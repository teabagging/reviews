There are no innocents here. This book documents the betrayal of allegiances by all the participants including the United States and documents the role of Big Oil in bringing about the current conflict. The fact is that to build a pipeline to transport oil from the Central Asia Republics, stability must be achieved in Afghanistan. First the USA backed the Taliban to defeat the Northern Alliance and when that failed, the USA switched to backing the Northern Alliance to destroy the Taliban. It is not important which side wins as long as one side wins to bring about the stability to allow for the construction of the pipeline. This book contains an impressive investigation to reveal this and to also illustrate the brutality of both the Taliban and it's opposition in Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study of the Taliban","review":"This is an excellent look inside the Taliban - the history, their \\"idealism,\\" and their aspirations as a group.

One that leaves the whole movie completely unresolved. In the film, the main character's boyfriend suddenly disappears because someone lied and told him that his boyfriend is HIV positive. The main character has no enemies so who did it? We never find out. And the main character never sees his boyfriend ever again. Instead, he decides he will become a slut and have sex with random people. Wow. In the end, he finds love with a new guy who we never get to know.The movie revolves around a musical that sort of mocks Christians. That's not a way to get people to look at you with respect. The musical also depicts gay men as wing-wearing, skipping-prancing sissies. The one positive thing I can say about it is that some of them could actually sing pretty well.Over all, this is another gay movie with a weak script and only furthers stereotypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"Gay-Themed\\" movie","review":"I have now watched this movie several times and still look forward to seeing it again.

It's actually funny, romantic, and campy at times (but mostly within the \\"Gay Musical\\" parts). The acting is actually not that bad and the quality of production is quite nice. I was actually surprised, because the cover jacket is kind of dumb.I was even glad that the actually tell the story of these two guys as they each go through their own issues with love and relationships and become good friends who don't fall for each other or are destined for each other.This one actually has a good ending where so many in the gay canon of movies, good or bad, do not and I am not the biggest fan of leaving a movie depressed for the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have given this five stars","review":"but I'm not a fan of musicals and wouldn't want to encourage Casper Andreas to make another one.

I agree with the first reviewer that this book does not offer much for someone looking for a COMPLETE solution manual to a good physics book.

Certain dynamics are not given the weight they deserve, but, as I saw this film in conjunction with a college class on Arthuriana, it was easy to notice several subtle allusions and modernized twists that bring the movie to a level a bit beyond it's fairly obvious examination of the search for personal utopia.

There are one or two standouts, perhaps, but the listener might be better served by buying a compilation of earlier work.Of course, if you are an absolute AS fan, then this CD will surely complete your collection.I had this on vinyl 30 years ago, but my recollection had been dim.

It is a serious ( and heavy) academic work that breaks new ground and adds important dimensions to the work of previous scholars such Scholem and Shatz.Whereas other popular works on Kabbalah lack the serious historical perspectives and mastery of the original texts Moshe Idel is unique. There is no one like him writing about Kabbalah in the Western World today.If Scholem was too Germanic, detached and disregarding of the experiences and spiritual achievements of Kabbalah, Idel adds all these dimensions to the solid academic foundations.This book is a hard read, its style is not easy, but if anyone wants a serious understanding of Kabbalah rather than a comic book version, this has to be the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for a \\"letting go\\" era + moving on","review":"Guy Finley's strategies for coming into present time are so very welcome in these most turbulent economic times.

The subject content is simple and straightforward enough: Let go of self-defeat and release your inner strength. What really annoys me to no end about this book, and why the book wasn't very helpful at all, is primarily his obnoxious writing style. He writes like this throughout the book: to NOT be aware of what you DON'T want is in truth what you CAN'T change. And you're shaking your head, what did he just say there? So, you spend more time than you should translating these ridiculous double-negative inverted statements into something simple, as they should be, that makes sense.

It is disjointed, mostly incoherent and unorganized. It is full of promising chapter and section headings but then once you read them you realize that the author has just used a lot of words to not say anything of real substance. You'd be better off reading a book of mythology because that is about all this book is. It wastes time with stupid, inane and mostly pointless stories and analogies. What little of value that there is in this book could have been compressed down to about 10% of the total. The basic gist of this book (in my opinion anyway) is to just accept whatever life sends you're way.

As an adult, I enjoyed it, but I'm ready now for more spicy foods. This is like a very hot Bloody Mary, and as a child I was more interested in pina coladas. Does that make sense?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for people with too much fun in their lives.","review":"The perfect book for the child interested in an uninteresting girl making uninteresting observations about uninteresting people going about their uninteresting everyday business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: darkness and complexity ahead","review":"Just a cautionary note to parents. This isn't a \\"fun\\" or innocent book for younger children, as you might imagine from a cursory look, or from what you might glean from the title and packaging. We got a few chapters into to before my daughter asked (begged) me to stop reading it. A lot of it is just downright mean, and not in any helpful sense. On reflection, why would we want to introduce young kids to such themes as alienation, existentialism, class warfare, entitlement, and on and on? Can't we allow them a few years of innocence and fun before the onslaught of the teenage turmoil and adulthood? And some of the effort to introduce complexity comes across as risible. I mean quoting Dostoesky? Honestly, how pretentious. If you want darkness, stimulation, character development, and excellent writing in a completely original imaginative landscape then try the Guardians of Ga'hoole series.

She seems to have some serious problems, most of them probably having to do with the fact that her parents don't seem to know how to raise a child--they seem to either ignore her or smother her.However, the plot, although full of rather unpleasant events and attitudes, is realistic. People do behave that way, and talk that way, and to try to wrap your child up in a cocoon where they are insulated from everything negative and disagreeable is not a good idea. The child will, sooner or later, encounter people or events like this in real life, and having first done so in fiction s/he will be forearmed. I wouldn't advise feeding a child a literary diet only of this sort of story, but as a part of a balanced literary diet, it is certainly worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every young girl will love this book!","review":"This was the first 'big kids' book I read as a child, one with chapters! I think I was in third grade, that would have been 1965. I was so surprised when, thirty-somthing years later, the movie came out! I knew it was the best book I had read as a child, but thought it was no longer around. I am very happy to see Harriet is alive and well and still as popular now as she was then! As usual though, the book is always better than the movie. Get your child to read this book, it will turn her into a reader for the rest of her life, and that's a GREAT thing to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be on every preteen's reading list!","review":"When I was in 5th grade, this book made the rounds of every girl in theclass -- and many of the boys. Recently, after seeing the movie, I wasprompted to go back and reread the book. (I cried this time too!) Evenafter nearly 30 years, very little of it seems dated; the subjects ofdivorce and social alienation are possibly even more pertinent today. Ican also highly recommend this book's sequel, The Long Secret"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading for those who like spys","review":"Harriet the Spy is about a girl named Harriet, who likes to take notes on everyone and also likes to spy.

The first time I read this book I ripped it to pieces and had to pay the library. This book is honest and groundbreaking and all that, perhaps. But I cannot stand it. It makes me want to throw up, but that's too passive. I did like that girl who wanted to blow up the world. But if I ever encounter Harriet on the street, there's going to be trouble. I don't understand why and how we are supposed to like this character, much less how and why so many people do. But I think she is the basest sort of person, and deserving of far, far more punishment than she gets. I have now written two reviews based on the main characters; both characters write in journals things which they would never speak. I love Mary Lou Finney (from \\"Absolutely Normal Chaos\\" by Sharon Creech). I despise Harriet. And, wow, it's great to get this all off my chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever!!!","review":"Harriet the spy is a horrible book. I read the first half and exactly 0 interesting things happened. Her nurse is fired. She is in a play. She likes spying on people and writes everything down in a notebook. Harriet's voice is childish and sassy-sounding. There is no voice in it but Harriet's, which gave me a headache. There's nothing that would make a reader care the least bit, and I even began to hate Harriet. Life, life, life. All Harriet deals with is life, which we all know about. She handles everything like a preschooler,and lacks a satisfying character.This book is not worth the paper it is written on.

Fitzhugh seems to capture theenvironment of the pre-teen world, with its insecurities, its need for belonging, and its mountain of creativity. Harriet, with her notebook and her dream of becoming a writer, Is put through terrible trauma at the loss of her Nanny, Ole Golly, and without her lifelong companion, the events that follow are almost impossible to overcome. When her notebook is stolen, and her peers read everything she has written about them, even Harriet's own best friends turn against her. What comes to follow is the solitude that Harriet faces, and worse than solitude, she must face the scorn of all of her classmates. In the end, Harriet learns the value of a few different things. She learns to apologize, and that in some cases, it's okay to lie. And, most importantly, she learns the value of a good friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent listening for all students of A Course In Miracles","review":"If you are a serious student of A Course In Miracles, then this is perfect for you.

We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over. Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar, we rented it. It's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn't rotate the camera except for certain times. The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in, it still wasn't close enough. It's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly! Another aspect we didn't like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor. Maybe we're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions. It's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... for the kiddies","review":"I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases (is that right?) ago, and i gotta say it was alright. the pros are that it is up to four players ( so if dad wants to spend \\"quality\\" time with junior), it has a wide variety of fun characters, and plenty of levels.HOWEVER, it lacks graphics, and young children might not do well during the game. but overall its alrightGraphics: C/ It must have been released early, cuz it's pretty badSound: B+/ crisp sounds. the sound really matches the mood.Controls: A-/ Changing and controlling characters' a breezeGood for children and adults to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young boys","review":"This game is rated E for everyone when it really needs to be for Teens.

I think young kids will really get a kick out of it, but serious gamers would probably pass on it unless they really, really love Shrek 2. (...)it's definately worth renting from the video store. Be careful though, too many hours of gameplay can temporarily fry your Gamecube because the game moves at such high RPM(it's got a lot of high end graphics and cut scenes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but too expensive for a kid game","review":"Bought the game last week and our 6 and 8 y.o. kids like it so far, it's fun but definitely not on par with Harry Potter or Finding Nemo. The movie is much much more fun than the game. It doesn't have what we call the 'stickiness' factor. You can play as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and few other characters and it's better to play as a team than as a single player. The game, however, is far too short for the full price. Most GC games of equal or better quality are much cheaper. I feel I paid $10-$20 extra for the marketing and hype.

Drawn Together basically mocks every reality TV show from every channel at once. The laughs are non stop. A fast paced show, but has a lot of repeating gags. Why only 4 stars, because the show deserves 5 because it's so funny and unpredictable, but this DVD deserves 3 because the DVD release is butchered. The DVD starts with a lot of ads from Comedy Central. You can't skip right to the Menu either. That is enoying. The first DVD has 5 episodes, the second only 2. Why couldn't they space them out more, like 3 and 4 I don't know? The other reason this DVD is 3 stars, one of the unaired episodes is not shown here either.

Beyond that disclaimer, I won't spoil the episode plots. :-)Once you get past the taboo, there are quite a few funny moments in the show. Where this DVD falls down miserably is the fact that it is extremely poorly implemented. The episodes are split between two DVDs, where they could fit into one.

This show is another show like Family Guy that is just trying to shcok the audience rather than be funny.

The story concerns Harold Odom, a confused young man drowning in his own circumstances: Depression-era poverty, serious Oedipal/sexual confusion, a neurotic alcoholic mother, sensitivity and repressed rage, along with the Brooklyn mobsters who make him one of their own, with tragic results. Charles Perry manages to portray Harold's complex nature--his vulnerability and his violence--in a keen and convincing manner. The wise-guy dialogue is sharp and never hackneyed, and the stream-of-consciousness narration pulls you into the mind of Harold from beginning to end. The characters and settings are realistic yet electric, like film noir but with more of a troubled heart. A great read, through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting but compelling novel","review":"Simply one of the best narratives I've ever read. The book follows the main character Harold from the time he is a child to his death. Harold is struggling with a myriad of problems from his family and the gang violence that rules his neighborhood.At first of a victim of many atrocities Harold develops a warped perception of the world that surrounds him. He struggles to understand the actions of his peers and the adults that rule his life.As stated in the other reviews it is a graphic novel with perverse sexual undertones that are disturbing. Harold's actions in the book are as reprehensible as they come, but you will find yourself still believing in the goodness of his character.The title is fitting for the imagery that is given. Harold strives to stay afloat but we are aware of his inevitable destruction from the very beginning.

Ms. Crombie will hopefully inspire many readers not lucky enough to have actually seen architectural wonders such as the Pontcycsyllte Aqueduct to view some of the amazing photos available on the Internet. Non-British readers should find this novel especially interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-faceted plot","review":"Water Like A Stone was well written bringing new characters into the lives of Duncan and Gemma,intertwining them with interesting plots and subplots. It took awhile and a red herring before they all came together. The character of Kit was more developed and she did a pretty good job of depicting young teenagers responses, negative and positive, to peer pressure and family crises.I did feel that if you looked closely you could tell early on who the culprit was, but there was enough doubt to keep it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful coffee table book","review":"This book arrived in perfect condition and did not disappoint.

The vocals are excellent (particularly \\"Little Altar Boy\\", the \\"First Snow/Let It Snow!\\" pairing and \\"Merry Christmas Darling.\\" The arrangements? Impeccable. The only weak selection: \\"Ave Maria.\\" It just doesn't work -- but that's four minutes out of almost two hours, and I'll take that any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpenter Christmas is always wonderful!","review":"What's not to like about the Carpenters? Her voice melts butter and the composition of Richard (her brother) is absolutely brilliant. I grew up listening to Karen Carpenter, so there's a lot of sentiment and nastalgia associated with her music; however, her voice transcends generations, in my humble opinion. The Christmas Collection is a classic, with an eclectic mix of music from traditional hymns to the Carpenter's originals. Great for commuting, decorating the tree, and baking both during the Christmas season and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpenter Collection","review":"The CD arrived in a timely manner.

To make a real Girls Of Penthouse DVD have some lovely Penthouse Pets pose like Tracie Carmichael(June 2000),Juliet Cariaga(POTY 2000),Karrie Jacobs(Janurary 2002)and Megan Mason(POTY 2002) instead of nasty tatooed devon and chunky aria giovania. In addition this production was doomed with dark lighting and scenes that were shot at what looks to be Motel Inn. Just look at the beautiful Pet Of The Year 2000 Winner Disc it has Juliet Cariaga by a pool that shows the palm trees blowing in the background. Now that is a DVD with class and quality.

It is more of a t-n-a type. I am a big Devon fan and Penthouse did not disappoint me, providing 3 scenes of her solo and 1 with other women. She does have tatoos, but they are small and they do not cover the important parts of her body (breasts, ass, and vagina). She spits only once in the entire dvd to moisten her left boob. Tera Patrick is also in it and her only solo scene showed how hot she is.

I needed something lightweight and with minimal functionality for exercising. The sound quality is wonderful and when you turn it off, it does not start at the beginning of the playlist again like some annoying flash players. It looks nice and sleek. I felt very cool carrying it.While there are not many buttons, after reading the manual I found that I could get too my personalized playlists pretty easily. Additionally, there is a recorder and an FM player. It is very light and very rugged. I played it off and on during my vacation and did not need to charge it until the 5th day.

It constantly keeps making that windows sound that its connected and then 2 sec. later it says it has been dis-connected. I really dont know what it is!!!!

My husband and I started playing it together after the kids went to bed. We found ourselves laughing out loud and getting very competitive w/eachother. We started playing it when the kids were doing homeowrk one night and it turned into a family event. Those w/certian \\"control\\" abilities were handed the game controller to take on the task at hand. When it was a single challenge each person got their chance to clear that part of the game.Family game night now has another option in our house. No longer is it just board games.We also enjoy the new Kim Possible What's the Switch game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game for enforcing cooperation.","review":"The best part of this game is that it supports cooperative play. Up to 4 players can participate in the adventure simultaneously on the same screen. Each character has his/her own strengths and may be the only character capable of completing certain tasks. My 5yo daughter and I played alot of the game together, tag-teaming the different obstacles and challenges--switching characters on the fly. Players can also drop out and drop back in whenever they want. Fun, not too hard, and the players are learning teamwork. My only complaint is that the game it not very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHREK","review":"the graphics were horrific and the gameplay was boring maby for a 4-7 year old age but if your looking for a fun game i don't suggest this one i give the game 0 stars but it wasn't on the rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is totally inappropriate","review":"We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died. I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals. What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit?

He played a bit again yesterday and he completed it before noon. It's a very short game. The game looks better than the first game, but it was very short with little \\"fun\\" factor for the kids.

Largely concerned with the doings of a Scots minister in an impoverished lowlands town in the mid seventeenth century, we are tortuously given a social history in microcosm. David Sempill is involved in plots of witchcraft, rural poverty and a bizarre epidemic, Anglo-Scottish border wars and ultimately flight over the seas.In no sense are we swept up into the life or adventures of the hero, as we are say with Richard Hannay in 'Greenmantle' or Dickson McCunn in 'Huntingtower'; both very different classes of hero but both extremely engaging. David Sempill fails the test of engagement and we remain sharply on the side lines, slightly uninterested observers of a time we can hardly credit occured"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"Calendar was damaged when arrived.

It's a book of poems and short stories (many true experiences)--all leaving the reader chuckling, smiling, or even with tears in the eyes. L. Jack Stevenson has given us all a small gift in this book-the gift of wonderful memories. Want to feel good and just have a great time laughing? Get this book. It's something great for all generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, given the author's priviledged position...","review":"With all due respect and in deference to the views of previous readers' reviews, as a techno-geek turned venture capitalist and self-described futurist, I find this treatise to be utterly disappointing, lacking in vision, and thoroughly contemporary.

He has been there, seen that done that, and now, he has put together an excellent book on how it will impact the way we live, whether we like it or not. It opened my eyes to the new wave and how those who do not address it, will be left behind. Excellent reading for everyone, not only computer buffs. CEOs, Managers, Engineers, Doctors, Taxi drivers....READ THIS. A very good insight into what the future holds for mankind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing inspiring nor new here...","review":"Dertouzos churns out the usual 'information wil change the future' vision that dominates books of this nature. Unfortunately, nothing here is really new, nor does Dertouzos write with much passion nor pizazz - his pronouncements come across as somewhat pretentious and trite. I prefer Esther Dyson's Release 2.0, which hawks much the same vision but in a nicely homey, conversational style that reveals how personal her book is compared to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little New, Negroponte (the other MIT Lab guy) is better","review":"I've come to expect alot from MIT, but Dertouzos' effort in \\"What Will Be.\\" is a disappointment because it contains little that hasn't been said by others. In fact, Nicholas Negroponte in his 1995 book \\"Being Digital\\" (the other MIT Lab guy) said most if not all of what Dertouzos does here-- nearly two years ago!The author has an annoying habit of telling you what he's going to tell you about-- literally. On the up side some of his individual short scenes of how he expects daily life to change in the digital age are good. But he does stray into the \\"Jetsons\\" by describing the kitchen of the future.If you expected new insights or cutting edge advice on how the Internet will change your personal life, it's been said better elsewhere. Don't expect much help with your business either (I'd recommend \\"The Digital Estate\\" by Chuck Martin).

The wire-clip mantles are easier to attach than the traditional string tie mantles, especially for somewhat arthritic fingers (like mine).

So my advice is to make sure you have some back-up mantle's in case yours are defective or just don't light up properly. Overall a nice lantern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Pros: Easy to light with long match, mantles stay functional for a good while, can be BRIIIIIGHT, or nice & dim, if you just need a small light, but don't want to burn a lot of propane.We ran our lantern for probably 9 hours over two nights, using varied brightnesses (dim for most of the time, to BRIGHT for about an hour and a half), and I still have about half a can of propane.With the carrying case, it is a heck of a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can depend on this product.","review":"This is lantern is easy to use, easy to maintain, and throws plenty of light with respectable run time. Nosier and not quite as bright as a white gas lantern but the convenience and durability more than make up for it.

Short disjointed moments put together randomly and often quite repetetive.The author strikes an always judgemental or condescending tone throughout and his observations rarely strike true chord of pathos. Just Western dogma and superiorattitude.Most of the book seems like the author constantly complaining that about what HE cant have or do...HE cant have good food...HE cant get a bicycle..HE cant go out.I cant think of too many moments in the book where the author hits a deep note of empathy for his subjects that might illuminate true feelings in the reader.I had high hopes but was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the author","review":"I am surprised at the positive reviews of this book. Although it is interesting in some ways, it presents North Korean culture with little compassion or humanity. The author describes his visit to North Korea according to how it served his personal comfort and sense of style, and with little reference to history or context. The North Korean government notwithstanding, ridiculing the shoes worn by the women on the street and making sweeping statements about how \\"all\\" Asian hotels are crummy is just ignorant. And probably racist. There are many very good books about North Korea -- skip this one. If you are looking for a good graphic story about one of the countries belonging to George Bush's \\"Axis of Evil,\\" read Persepolis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster At Best","review":"This book has very little worth unless you have absolutely no knowledge about North Korea. Aside from a sparse few (maybe 3) frames in the book, the story does not go beyond simple western conception of the nation. In addition, the few references to women clearly show the author's sexist mindset. Lastly, the artwork is lackluster and unimpressive, to put it nicely. Not worth wasting your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Unfortunately, the author - a fine illustrator - has little to no original insight into North Korea, and this is a rather uninteresting and trite description of his time in the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great visual and emotive journey","review":"I read this book in a couple of nights and then passed onto my sister and my mum.

You can go co-op with a friend just by them picking up the controls or setting them down. The game play happens in between the gaps in the movie, so you get to play with all the fun characters without any spoilers from the movie. The controls are simple, tight, and the characters have excellent snappy comments that will make you laugh without seeming the least repetitive.

My four year old has a little trouble with some of the harder parts, but my six year old is able to take the lead with ease.

They appear to be made by the same OEM as the shocks that came on the car and those lasted eleven years. There was even a spot where a label had been removed and replaced with the Monroe label.They installed just fine and work great. An installation trick involves balancing the load-leveling force in the shock which pushes against the leaf spring: put the car on jack stands and then use a floor jack under the end of the axle to get the lower bolt hole and bushing aligned. One nit is that the bushings are not as long as the originals; however, the shocks were provided with spacers to make up the difference and the installation went smoothly using the original bolts.I will update this review if I have any problems with the shocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"better skip it","review":"i bought this case and although it seemed sturdy I've been using it for less than 4 months and one of the wheels broke off and is not fixable, it ripped right off and there's now a whole in the bottom of the case.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the adjustable coarseness wheel doesn't seem to give me a fine grind.. more like between medium coarse and \\"cracked\\", so I keep it on the \\"lowest\\" setting. I have only tried black peppercorns so I cannot review how it performs with other spices or salt.I'm curious as to why the only other review at this point verbally loved it but gave it only 2 stars..It seems like a very serious and robust piece of kitchen equipment that I will enjoy for many years.

Highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best pepper grinder I've found","review":"I have three of the Kuhn Rikon Pepper Grinders. a black lid for my black pepper, white for my white pepper, and pink lidded for the pink pepper. I'm so fond of this pepper mill I've also given several as gifts.The only minor detraction is this isn't the prettiest pepper mill to sit on the table, but in this case function truly outweighs form. The grinder stores up, meaning the part you grind your pepper from isn't sitting on counters and tables getting contaminated by whatever might be hanging out there and doesn't leave that pepper dust ring all over the counter top.The grip is really nice, making it easy to use when I'm cooking. The grind is easy to adjust. I've had mine over a year and the clear part isn't cloudy at all. It's easy to put pepper in and the grinder holds a lot, which is good because we are all pepper freaks in this house and one of those cute tiny grinders would drive us crazy.This pepper grinder is a winner and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salt grinder review","review":"I know spending $30.00 dollars on a salt/pepper grinder sounds crazy but this purchase has been well worth the money.

They were being hit from many different angles and confused about which path to take. In this debut novel she created 3 dimensional characters that the reader sympathizes with, hates, laughs at, loves and applauds. Phenomenal Women Book Club read this book as our August 2008 book of the month and everyone woman in the club could identify someone they knew similar to each of the characters. This is really good read that I recommend to anyone looking for a faith based book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Read","review":"Ms. Sanders did a wonderful job on her first novel. I truly enjoyed reading this book. This book is about lies, and deception. It's about how people try to handle situations themselves without bringing it to God. I do have to agree with some of the reviewers that it had a couple of slow moments but all in all I still enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Rating recommended read","review":"Sanders writes a good story that starts slow but picks up quickly. Though the main character was a bit hard to cheer for it was an easy read with lots of moral introspection sparked by the subtle prompting of the story line. The plot has been done but is presented in a way that makes you want to make it to the end. The sub characters steal the scenes away from the main characters at time but not in a way that makes it hard to complete the story. An easy story that delivers in the morals department although a little slow at times. While hosting more than the desired number of predictable characters still a great read which is why it received a Silver rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Bomb.com","review":"This book is excellent once I opened it up I could not stop reading it...Waiting to Exhale Look out because \\"Soul is all that Matters.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to Author!","review":"I am not one to read many fiction books, but I LOVED this novel!!!!!!!!! From chapter one I was drawn into the life of Wendy and could not put the book down until I had read the entire thing. I think Yolonda did an excellent job in creating characters that make you care about them. Even mean old Frances won my heart in the end. I would term this book realistic fiction because it wasn't so fictionalized that I didn't believe what was happening. Wendy, Kim, Marlene, etc. all became very real to me. If this is indeed Yolonda's first book, she has a divine gift and I cannot wait to read her next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection of official documents","review":"It is really nice to have all these documents in one book to facilitate reading them in chronological order.

However, this bible is chocked full of commentaries, including many right in the text, which make it very difficult to read. Also, unless you have a very strict fundamentalist background (Pat Robertson is one of the authors of the commentaries) you will quickly become annoyed with the substance of these commentaries, because they present sometimes contorted interpretations of the text as indisputable fact. Only buy this book if you want someone else to do the thinking for you, instead of trying to read and learn the Word for yourself (which is a big mistake, in my opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noticed no difference","review":"I was skeptical about this product from the get go.

The best parts, in fact they are the only parts you should watch, are the performances by the individual artists and groups. The rest is thoughts from other people and it's very boring. I had to pinch myself to stay awake when I was watching it, and I love TRL. Honestly, even if you love the show, you will probably HATE this video. It is not a masterpiece. It's not a work of art. It's a boring tape that is only redeemed in the performances of the singers that have made the show so popular in the first place. So, please, do not waste your money on this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of lame","review":"I watch TRL every day faithfully so of course I bought the video. They go behind the scenes and talk to the producers and all the other people involved with the show and talk about all it takes to get TRL on the air every day. They take you on a tour of MTV and they show a few bloopers and greatest moments but all of them are pretty recent - and I know TRL has been on the air for a few years now. Worst of all, they don't even talk to Carson - Hello! He's the host. I know these other people work really hard and do a real good job - but I tune in to watch Carson not these other guys. There are some really good performances on there (although they have too many pop performances - *NSYNC, BSB, Christina Aguilera, 5ive).

I figured I could use the saw to cut the larger bones in half. It took forever to saw through the bone and it was really a lot of effort. I gave up on this experiment.

As women we have been told since we were children that as long as everyone is satisfied we will be satisfied. Then we are mystified as adults when we constantly give but the satisfaction never comes.

And this \\"care\\" is far beyond what is realistic. It is as if we are to carry everyone else's problems and woes and struggles on our own shoulders as if they are our own.This book is tremendously eye-opening to the fact that carrying everything for everyone else is UNHEALTHY for both you AND them.

Not even in a very small room. No matter what setting I put it on, it throws the same amount of heat out, and the knobs turn very easily, so not sure the child feature is working. I can put it on setting I, II, or III and they are all the same. Also the outside of the unit is staying ice cold, which I assume is not normal since the instructions are telling you in bold to not touch it as it gets hot. I am not happy that we cannot return it.

Despite being on the highest setting and having the thermostat on it cranked, the heater barely put out any heat. It was level and stable, but the only heat I could feel from it was from about two inches away, and that felt like a hair dryer on the lowest setting (and that's being generous).I returned it. I'm sure some of these heaters really get the job done, but I can't imagine that mine was functioning properly, and it sounds like a common problem.

(I did wonder how Stuart was able to stick to his high-paid job when all he could think about was SEX, SEX, SEX!) And the laughs come hard and often, even if they're laced with cruelty sometimes.Much of the enjoyment comes from the couterie surrounding the three main guys: Vince's slutty mother, Alexander, the lesbian couple, and the various tricks that turn up at Stuart's loft.Whether straight audiences will run for the hills after watching this display of in-your-face gay lib, well I couldn't care less.

That gay men are imature, irresponsible, mysoginistic and promiscuous. Stuart is a pig and Vince is a moron. Nope doesn't do much of a positive spin on gays.Surprisingly I found the American version (though I often think of it as being Canadian since it is shot in Toronto) much much much more interesting.

You can see them prowling around every gay bar around, or sitting quietly in the corner of the cocktail bar upstairs.

While living in the San Francisco area probably contributed to my initial tuning in of the American version, the stories and the character developments have hooked me - some remind me of tales of activities in San Francisco in the 1970s.

But the \\"level bosses\\" (fights that you must complete to move on) are terribly designed. One level (Mysterio's burning theatre) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed. Another level (Statue of Liberty) is so bad that you'll want to return the game.

The pages are brimming with case after case--episodes of complexity in action that inspire as well as inform. For leaders (in hospitals and anywhere else) who ask, \\"What do I do on Monday morning?\\" EDGEWARE provides literally dozens of suggestions.Don't get me wrong. Applying complexity is hard work. No book will ever make it easy to abandon command-and-control leadership or to let organizations \\"play\\" their way into the future. But with EDGEWARE as your guide, the work will be joyous."},{"rating":"2","title":"from Dan Beckham, contributing editor of Healthcare Forum","review":"Peter Drucker once described healthcare as the most complex of all business enterprises. So perhaps it's appropriate that the best book on the emerging science of COMPLEXITY should come out of healthcare. EDGEWARE will prove useful to managers in all industries. The book contains a primer on complexity, a set of unifying principles, practical applications, a rich bibliography, glossary and web site guide making it, page-for-page, the most valuable book to date on complexity and management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Stage Manager","review":"As one of the three original stage managers of \\"Sherry\\", I have waited for years for some sort of album, having ruined my hearing listening to the tape made on the backstage squak box. How sorry to now have heard the version that has been recored. It is not the version that we opened with in NY rather the version that we did in Boston and was being cut even before the opening there. When Joe Layton was brought in we rehearsed his version during the day and performed the \\"old\\" version at night until the middle of the run in Philadelphia. That was when Clive Revill took over as Sherry with Delores Grey and Liz Allen staying. It's a shame no quality recoring was made then. Listening to this version does not bring back fond memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad they found the trunk!","review":"At the risk of sounding totally mean, I have to say that there are some bright spots in this rather over-the-top and inflated score. No wonder it closed and was never recorded until now. It's just not as good as the publicity for the recording would lead you to believe. There's nothing original here, it's Broadway formula down to the first note of the overture to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite musicals now","review":"This is a fun CD set. The music is lush. The performances by Bernadette Peters, Carol Burnett, Nathan Lane and rest of the cast are simply great. The personalities of the characters really come through. In the production numbers, you can almost see the dancers. Goodness, Carol Burnett -- always one of my favorites -- here at 70 sounds wonderful.I have to state my bias, though, I'm performing the role of Sheridan Whiteside in a community theater production of the play. So people less familiar with the play may not appreciate this CD as much. It has grown on me, so maybe it takes a few listens. The 2000 movie of \\"The Man who Came to Dinner\\" with Nathan Lane would be good background (as well as a lot of fun in its own right)."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I love me, you love me, let's all serve my vanity...\\"","review":"As reviewers search for reasons why this just isn't a terribly good disc, I submit that you can't gild a turd. And that the only reason this near-forgotten score has been revived is because it's a ***JAMES LIPTON VANITY PROJECT***. Lipton, best (and only) known for his execrable TV show (oh, wait! no, there were also those sterling Bob Hope Birthday Specials...), is, politely put, an undertalented lyricist and playwright. That his emetic program has afforded him enough (hopefully-brief) celebrity to coerce talented performers (all but one--Tommy Tune--have been dais guests of the oleaginous Lipton) to waste their time in the service of his ego is just another reason to regret ITAS' popularity.B'way completists rejoice if you will, but please also admit that there are many shows much more deserving of fresh recordings with marquee casts than this hacked-out pastiche of other creators' immeasurably-better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Turkey's Deserve Roasting","review":"Look, I don't want to spend time repeating all the very good bad reviews this show has gotten. I saw the original New York production just as Clive Revel (?) took over for George Saunders. There was only one reason I went to see it and only one thing that has stuck with me all these years: The sight and sound of Delores Grey singing the title tune. What a great voice! I was under the impression, from the PayBill, that RCA had recorded the cast album. But that was so many years ago, I could be mistaken. Still, that voice stays with me.Oh, if this company wants to do something to repent for this recording, release the original cast album of a little known show called Donnybrook! Eddie Foy, Jr; Art Lund; Susan Johnson. It is a musical of the Quiet Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"One can assume the show's \\"cult\\" status (if it really has it) was due to the wonderful original cast. The star-studded group on this CD doesn't seem to be able to bring this score to life at all, and deprived of Dolores Gray, Elizabeth Allen, and Clive Revill, it seems the emperor has no clothes. The score is bland and mediocre, save for the clever title song (but that has a much better rendition with Christine Baranski and Jonathan Freeman on another CD). This is a big ego fest for James Lipton, but the CD is one to skip, definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROADWAY'S SHERRY LIVES!","review":"For all those of you out there who seem to know so much about Broadway cast recordings, let it be know that the original cast recording of SHERRY with the late, brilliant Delores Gray, Elizabeth Allen and the rest of the cast from The Alvin Theater does exist as a sound system recording and in any way comparing this recording to the new SHERRY is like comparing Marilyn Maye's recording of the title tune to Delores Gray's show stopping rendition."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUNDTRACK and CAST RECORDINGS","review":"Just a note:This is not a \\"soundtrack\\" as identified here. There is no track from which to take the sound. It is not a movie. It is a cast recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Part for my 03' Sportster.","review":"This is a great relocation bracket in both quality and appearance. It was fairly easy to install. Refer to the YouTube video a couple of times before starting and you should be able to breeze right through it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introducing Spencer","review":"I have only listened to this cd once,and it takes me a couple of tries to know which are my favorite songs. After listening to his Vagabond cd you can tell this is his first. I like it and know it will grow on my as Vagabond did. Am glad I purchased it. Would love to see Spencer in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness at an early age","review":"Saw him live in SF and listen to the CD weekly. Spencer Day is a new and rising talent. You will not regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the soundtrack to the movie!","review":"I just want to make it clear that this CD is NOT the soundtrack to the movie \\"The Edukators\\". For some reason they've allowed the title of the movie to be attached as a label to this anthology of songs with little in common and none of which were featured in the movie. When the movie itself is such an intense statement against capitalism, it's pretty low to do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle Plates","review":"When my husband purchased two 16 piece sets of Bamboo pattern Corelle dishware, I wanted more of the luncheon size plates (plenty big! I use them for dinner plates!). I was thrilled when I found them on Amazon for such an amazing price! They were shipped prompty and packaged experty. I am extremely happy with my experience and purchase. Highly recommend shopping here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pick another style","review":"This pattern is not the Corelle's best. When it arrived, it looked like a cheap screenprint, with a strange texture. Part of the leaf was already scratched off. I gave it two stars because the base material of the plate is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing to God Parts One and Two","review":"This is quite simply the best album ever created. Having been a fan of Cardiacs previous long-players I actually missed this one first time around, stupidly listening to someone's opinion that it 'wasn't that good'. What a fool I was. Every track is perfect, beautiful, shimmering in loveliness and gorgeosity. Quite frankly worthy of laudation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy","review":"It is a sheer tragedy that we can't get solid copies of this anymore. Is this the only Cardiacs album available on Amazon? And it's 320-something dollars? This album is frightening, powerfully energetic, catchy, unlike anything that personally I've ever heard, brilliantly produced... and yet, each of these descriptors falls short, to me. Think of all the bubbling frustration in Great Britain, veined with magic and murder and politics and religion. I dunno. I love this album to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A staggering work of art","review":"This would have to be one of the greatest albums of all time. The depth and variation within the songs is untrue, and the composition of each masterpiece will have you coming back for more and more every time. Totally unique sounding, Cardiacs defy description, and this is considered by many to be their finest work. A must for any serious music fan, casual listeners however: handle with care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purify!","review":"I have experienced a Nyung Na fasting retreat using this book. It was GRUELLING, and afterwards I felt FANTASTIC! The prayers and prostrations along with the fasting is a beautiful ritual that softens the heart. Buddhist ritual all has a subtle purpose and effect on the mind, this one is no exception. This retreat leaves a person feeling cleansed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is not the old Intermatic K4021c Photo Control. I had one of these installed in a backyard pole light next to my driveway for 12 years, it worked great, coming on late dusk and going off at first light in the morning. This new product switches on way to early 30-40 minutes sooner in the evening and staying on equally long in the morning. 1-1 1/2 hours more electricity usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intermatic photo control","review":"This is an inexpensive and completely adaptable daylight photo control, and small enough to fit almost anywhere.It's just what I needed, and I suspect the same for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for a week","review":"I selected this one because of the reviews, the brand, and the electrical ratings. (what's with all the photo switches at Amazon and other on-line stores with no voltage/current/bulb type ratings?). The stated mount size is correct, since conduit fittings like water pipe fittings go by ID rather than OD. I installed it and it worked great for a week. After I threw the box away, it stopped switching on at dark. Rechecked connections several times and tried changing the bulb with no joy. My light is a single 27W florescent; well under the 15A rating. Still looking for a decent photo switch that will last more than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photocell for yardlight","review":"The photocell works good. The diameter of the neck of the unit that protrudes through the hole in the light post is smaller than the one I had originally, so I had to find a washer large enough to \\"shim\\" it so it wouldn't just fall out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hospital killer","review":"This book is some what good, if you're in coma.I was in ahospital room doing this campaign with an injured friend. The guyacross from us was in a coma and he got out of it to tell us that thebook was horrible, then he died from boredom. So if you plan on getting this don't play in a hospital. Only play it in a mental hospital where people are insane anyways. ...the story reminds me of The Lion King. I f you actually play this and retain your sanity then I commend you for your superior mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"great follow-up","review":"this single includes 3 best singles. Live Version of Back 2 good and push can make you satisfy.

She hardly touched it. I thought maybe she was too old, but she was firmly in the recommended age range.After swiping at it a few times and pulling it once (at my insistence) it drifted to the corner, never to be played with again. I gave it to the Goodwill in like-new condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete and total waste of money!","review":"I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. This ebook is nothing more than 1) a regurgitation of (simplistic) legal do's & don'ts and 2)generalized information. The description of the book's contents is grossly misleading. If you're seeking specific help with learning proper interviewing skills and/or tips & tricks, you won't find it here.If you're considering this ebook, here's my recommendation: LOOK ELSEWHERE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game - Not what I expected","review":"A First Person Action game - from Disney! Usually Disney's movie-to-games are flat, unimaginative puzzles that bore my kids within seconds. But Atlantis is something new. It's entirely in 3D, which for kids' games is extremely rare. Having not seen the movie I can't say how well it compares, but it does an amazing job of putting the player \\"in\\" the game. Visually it is first rate, obviously a lot of creativity went into the production.Bottom line, my kids love it (2 boys and a girl). The multiplayer aspect of the game (you can go online and play against other people) is the biggest draw for them. Every time they play it's a new game, with new people doing unpredictable things. It worked out of the box, getting online to play is all built in, though my seven year old had to walk me through it the first couple of times.Great gameplay, very impressive graphics, seemingly endless replayability, and my kids love it. And I play it, too.Who needs a movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and challenging game for kids","review":"Trial By Fire is a fun and challenging game with 2 modes and 2 games. Multiplayer and Single Player (CD needed) It has cool 3D effects (But they could be better) and 2 challenging games to play. It includes the original \\"Search For The Journal\\" but the game has it's own disc and only the Search For The journal disc has the Keeper's CTF (Capture the Flag) and Tourney (Tournament) with Keepers instead of Atlanteans and no \\"Stormtrooper Explorers.\\" This is a fun game that should keep kids age 7+ entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Excursion into an Interesting Period","review":"When I saw the Amazon reviews and ratings for this book, I hesitated to buy it. But after examining the reviews more carefully, I noticed that several of the reviewers giving the book a low rating did admit to the fact that the book contained interesting information. So, after browsing it yet again, I bought it and read it. I was not disappointed. The author's writing style is very cultured but, at times, awkward; so, for me, it is not what I would call a quick read. There is much on Poincare, less on Einstein, much on simultaneity, some physics history and much on time synchronization, from all angles: political, cultural, scientific and technological. Although the book does seem to wander from one subject to a seemingly unrelated other, from one person to another and from one continent to another, everything eventually comes together. I enjoyed this book and recommend it. It should be read while keeping an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This is a book that I had no difficulty putting down, and did many times. Its author, purportedly a historian, should have at least written an outline before setting his thoughts to pen. I still don't quite know why Poincare's syncronus clock acheivments are related to Einstein's theory of relativity and certainly the author's several attempts to explain relativity by example is gibberish. Save your money and buy a good clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unfortunately, I don't think this subject warrants a book of this length.Whilst there is a story there, it could have been much shorter, and so the book drags it all out, wandering off at tangents before coming back.The illustrations & photographs were poorly reproduced and poorly chosen - why we needed to see the public clocks in Berne that Einstein would have seen on his way to work confused me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point of this book?","review":"Why does Poincare get the most attention of all the also rans (although it wasn't a race) assuming this was a major point of the book? \\"If only\\" could apply to several other prominent scientists of this era. I skipped the middle because it was too wordy and repetitious. Poincare was more concerned with clock synchronization for reasons of practicality which had nothing to do with relativity and everything to do with signal lag time. Einstein on the other hand was obviously more focused on the constancy of the speed of light and the inconsistencies it created. Some interesting historical accounts (investigation of a mine disaster) did not make up for a weak theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"very much out of date","review":"this book dates back to 1961 ...if you want to buy an affordable dover published book which is much more current i recommend the Itzikson and Zuber QFT bookQuantum Field Theory (Dover Books on Physics)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, sweet music, an essential addition to your collection","review":"I originally bought this album three years ago, looking for a good introduction to Spanish guitar music.

At Amazon's current price, this is a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Spanish Guitar is relaxing~","review":"I l-o-v-e Spanish guitar music especially with music composed by, Isaac Albeniz. This cd by John Williams, is b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l-l-y put together! It is so full of flavor, everything from the Classical down to Flamenco is on this cd. It is very relaxing as well as lively. I would & already have recommend this to people who are in love with the Spanish guitar. It's a perfect mood enhancer as well as a wonderful ambience to any backyard gathering with family & friends.For those of you who have been to Disneyland & dined at \\"Rancho del Zocalo\\" (in Frontierland) ... this cd is similar to the music you would enjoy while eating.Hopefully this will help you decide if this is something that you might enjoy for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish Guitar Music John Williams","review":"If I had known it was by John Williams I would not have bought it very disapointed,the other two CD,s are great,price was ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another top notch Pearson effort! Clever arson premise.","review":"This is a very compelling and clever detective work. Pearson is fast becoming my favorite with consistently fresh ideas and technically believable situations. It is first rate. The only downside were some contrived plot twists with two characters (Ben and Daphne), but these did not detract a lot from the main theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"a substitute for caffeine (it'll keep u awake)","review":"beyond recognition is the best book ive read this year and ive started to read a lot too. i liked it better than plum island which says a lot b/c i enjoyed that book too. but this book has more mystery to it and characters that u care for rather than just like. the two years of research he put into this book shows. before reading this book i decided i was only going to buy paperback books but now i cant wait to buy his new one The Pied Piper in hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only o.k.for a plane ride or if you're in labor.","review":"Not enough character development, plot is replete with unanswered questions and coincidences. If Boldt's wife is so sick, why is he out running away from responsibility? Or is that what we do with all mysteries? Or with all life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply amazing (not the book...the fact it got published)","review":"I must first apologize to anyone who reads this from Hyperion Press. I actually have a close friend who works there (that's how i came upon Mr. Pearson) so it's not in my best interest to give a terrible review of this book...but.Not only did I find at least two glaring errors in Beyond Recognition, I'm just amazed that it actually got published. Pearson's use of language is sophmoric, repetitive, and just plain boring. His descriptions of women are simplistic and one dimensional (all are incredibly attractive), his plot thin, and his main character rather unlikable.The only other thing I can say it that the news stories in the Journal and the News about original cases of high accelerant fires in Washington State were more exciting that Mr. Peason's fictionalization..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his earlier workds- very disappointing","review":"Mr. Pearson's novels are headed in the wrong direction! The last three have gotten progressively worse. His books have always suffered from poor dialog, but his first three novels featured unique plots and carefully researched detail. His characters have become less believable, the details often don't ring true, and the dialog still is quite poor. What's happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Recognition is beyond the ordinary crime tale.","review":"Ridley Pearson lights another burning success with this book about unexplained serial arsons in Seattle. More than just a plot driven mystery, Pearson develops further the interesting and complex web of characters he has introduced to readers in other Lou Boldt series.The story begins a bit slowly until it suddenly ignites into a fully engaging read. Police psychologist Daphne Matthews seemed a bit brittle in this novel but other characters expand and glow. The story itself taught me things I did not know I wanted to know about firefighting and arsonists - the sign of an excellent author!Ignore your mundane tasks and blaze through this visit to Pearson's world of crime fighting with very human characters fighting demons both within and outside the psyche."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept turning the pages...to find the good part.","review":"I like Pearson. He is better at character development than Michael Connelly. But with this particular novel, there is too much time spent in character development. And there are several characters, old and new. As a result, the book is big and fat, and the story moves slowly.It is not until towards the end that Pearson writes that it seemed like the next 24 hours flew by. That was a signal to the reader that we were finally going to get some action. And still it dragged. You might want to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down","review":"Pearson knows how to create real tension and exciting situations. Some parts of this book are too drawn out, he often explains the obvious (at length), but overall it is quite an entertaining read. Minor problems for me are that the author describes Detective Boldt as extremely clever, yet somehow he misses a lot of clues. In addition, a lot of events are telegraphed, which for me is never really satisfying, but of course might be considered rewarding for other readers ('I knew this was going to happen..'). The worst part for me is clearly Pearson's naive and uncritical view of psychology and psychic phenomenon. This is not something I mind in fiction in general, but if a story is presented in such a realistic way, it just rubs me the wrong way. If you have a scientific background or are a critical thinker, this book will most likely be painful to read. Others will probably have a pretty good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Reading of the Sweet Science","review":"Boxing by Haislet is one of the definitive readings on the sport of boxing; it's right up there with Championship Fighting by Jack Dempsey. Haislet explores the very basic elements of the sport, from form to ring generalship, and does so with easy-to-understand concepts. Though the writing is dated, the concepts are still applicable to anyone interested in boxing and will prove to be indispensible to a fighter's core arsenal. In fact, Bruce Lee drew a lot from Haislet's ideas and applied them to his understanding of fist strikes as seen from the Tao of Jeet Kune Do."},{"rating":"2","title":"FREE DOWNLOAD OF THIS BOOK","review":"Great book!

I've got a foot in both camps--some of it is just too, too much--other things I want to make immediately. My main problem is the lack of charts. He states that one cushion can be easily coverted to a chair seat--true, if there were a chart to begin with. Now, I can understand that a wing back chair might be a one off, but there is no excuse for showing a tantalizing close up of a pillow without a chart! It is too frustrating. And there are far too many references to things that are available as kits from Ehrman--particularly when not all of them are still available. Still worth it for the charts that he does include and for some design ideas--if you are willing to just pile on the patterns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book!!","review":"Another beautiful book from Kaffe.

I love his singing style on these wonderful songs. Obviously, he doesn't have the voice of a Charlotte Church or Mahalia Jackson. What he does have is the voice of the common man, and that is highly appropriate since the messages in these songs were written for the common man. He sings these songs, not as someone putting on a show or trying to make a buck, but as a man just simply trying to glorify Jesus Christ. I think that alone makes this CD much better than almost any of the so-called contemporary Christian music being put out today. I'm so glad I bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel Glory","review":"Since I like gospel music, this is one of the better ones of all the classics that never go out of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of faith","review":"Here I am once again to listen to a great gospel.

This album by their singer, Mike Harrison, captures a very special moment in one artist's development. It is beautifully understated and distinctly \\"non-comercial\\" in a way that,sadly, artists just aren't allowed to be any longer. This album is the best of Harrison's solo work outside of Spooky Tooth. Also check out Spooky's guitarist Luther Grosvenor's \\"Under Open Skies\\". This type of music is not for all tastes but it certainly isn't being made by anyone today! If anyone can find me a copy of Mike Harrison's last solo lp \\"Rainbow Rider\\" I would be very grateful!

I don't plan on having kids myself, and I was looking forward to a book that would commiserate with me on the kid-mania present in our culture, but this was not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"The book wasn't that bad, I did laugh out loud once or twice.

It takes a villager."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!","review":"There are probably millions of books in print dealing with the subject of children. Only one of them deals with the horror of Other People's Children. Adrianne Frost tells it like it is. This book was everything I expected it to be with a whole lot of stuff I didn't expect such as a history of OPC-hating. Brilliant! I can't wait to see what she does next. Buy a copy for yourself and buy a copy to leave somewhere strategic like the doctor's lobby or Starbucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that funny","review":"Most of the discussion of this book centers around the controversy of hating or not hating kids. But that was completely lost on me.Because frankly, this book just isn't that funny.I wish I was like the reviewer who read it in the store in 30 minutes. 40 pages in, I think I laughed once. Frost offers nothing but the most pedestrian of observations on children. Her humor and venom is forced, rote, and predictable. She's trying to be the self-proclaimed leader of a revolution that she's neither qualified to lead, nor needs a spokesperson.Frost would have done much better condensing her overdrawn prose and repeated examples into a solid magazine article. As it stands, this book is about 130 pages too long. Good concept, uninteresting execution.And for those calling for a sequel about the parents? Please. Two unfunny attempts at the same subject would be over the top. Sort of like Police Academy II and III."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously not funny","review":"Saw this comedian on the news, read the book in 30 minutes at Borders (didn't buy it thankfully ) and man, the only thing funny was how she got it published. Not funny at all. And how can the title be \\"other people's kids\\" when the author has none of her own? Be honest, she should just say I hate kids. Why this is should be left up to her shrink.

I read it cover-to-cover as soon as I got it, and have referred to it periodically since then. Many of the ideas aren't my style, but even those get me thinking, and there are plenty of other ideas to use/adapt.There are no pictures to inspire, but the writing is crisp, the ideas are good, and the text is easy-to-read. The chapters cover:Getting ready throughout the yearPreparing/buying gifts, wrap, cards, etc. (including food gifts)Decorating the home/gardenThe treeEntertaining (including recipes)TraditionsSome of my favorite ideas/recipes are the \\"Braided Wreath for Birdies\\" (a bread wreath with birdseed), \\"Winter Wonderland Centerpiece,\\" and an never-fail party favorite, \\"Chocolate Indiscretions\\" (not quite a sin, just an indiscretion).

The book is not elaborate, but still has nice drawings throughout to show the bow or craft or ornament that you're making. A++++ in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please!","review":"Normally I quite enjoy Marion Chesney's Regency romances. They often feature witty dialogue and absolutely hilarious secondary characters. This book features neither of these. Unfortunately, the heroine I found unsympathetic and the hero was quite dull. The only funny moments came from the little menagerie the heroine builds for herself, and those were few and far between. The overall tone of the story was lonely and disaffected. This isn't the best example of Chesney's work. To see her in much better form I would recommend any of the books in the School for Manners or Six Sisters series, which are all far superior to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"May as well read Lewis.","review":"Not one of Kreeft's better efforts, this imaginary dialog between JFK, Aldous Huxley, and C.S.

Besides that, we are very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit expensive, but nice. Worth it if they hold up...","review":"These seem to be well made and of good quality. Hopefully they will hold up. If they do, then they will be worth the rather steep price, I guess. Based on the other reviews here, I bought the XXL (13-14) size for my size 11 feet and they fit fine, a little extra room in the toes which is fine, snug everywhere else. As mentioned elsewhere, they are ugly, but they feel good and are very comfortable. Like moccasins. They can breathe which was very important to me. They are warm, too. Soft and quiet on a hard floor.So far, very happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A product from the past that works for the future.","review":"They are just like the previous pair I had wore out.

Unlike the first novel, the murderer is so obvious, the mystery plot so thin. Benjamin Justice comes across as a self-pitying bully. The vicious and violent attack on one of the suspects for leaking a story to the press is disgusting because Justice has probably similarly defamed others during his life as a reporter. There is so much similarity between the suspect and Justice that he has to lash out and beat him because he is unsuccessful at killing himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I love this movie!

The acting was alright, but it wasn't enough. The humorous parts weren't funny. The characters didn't have much depth. It failed to do what a decent chick flick is supposed to do, which is tug on your emotional strings. I'd have to say pass on this one, unless your a really big fan of one of the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst film ever made...","review":"...or at least in the running. Since everything from the writing to the acting is horrible in this flick, then let me focus on the few positives: Jeanene G. who unfortunately is only in a few sceens, I wanted more of her character as she seems to be the only one of interest, the cinematography is nice. That's about it folks. The lead characters are stupid and annoying, all of the acting is horrible, the script is pathetic, the dialogoue is inane, and worst of all THERE ARE ALMOST NO DOGS IN THE MOVIE! If the director would have just left the camera rolling in dog park to capture the silly things dogs do, this film would have been a 100% more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I suspected","review":"The movie Dog Park was not good at all. I found myself crying in the theatre when I wanted it to end. The acting is terrible with the exception of Luke Wilson. The humor was stupid and unfunny It seemed that when the writer ran out of jokes he/she started to use slap stick and over used phrases.Most of the jokes have been heard in other movies, so the movie could be called \\"Dog Plagerism\\" I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy/rent this movie!","review":"What's wrong with Hollywood? I cannot believe the producers, directors, actors, etc. of this movie sat in a screening room to watch the final cut and went ahead and released it anyway! The acting, the script, and the plot could not have been worse. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to sit through a \\"comedy\\" that is not even a little bit funny. I'm not THAT hard to please but I didn't even crack a smile during the grueling course of this flick. What a waste of Janine Garafalo; not that any of her movies are that great. She should probably stick with stand-up.

Buy the \\"Cinema Series\\" not the cheaper Theater Wide sets, you will be able to tell a difference.With ANY (and I mean any) LCD/DLP/LCOS/HiLA projection set... buy the extended warranty (I NEVER EVER do normally) but KNOW THIS.... all these sets have projection bulbs which WILL need replacement periodically. These bulbs range in price from $250 to $400. The life of the bulb is not something you can guess, but its driven by how much you use your set.

Eve and her sister Irish are great heroine's and the couisin's they marry (who happen to belong to a millionaire's club) are great. These millionaire's are down to earth and funny, and the grandfather (Cerokee Pete) is hilarious. When he finds a woman that he thinks his grandson's should marry he offers them a million dollars to marry them (and he has it to give), in fact, that's all his grandkids got their start by his giving them a million dollars, and if they double it in the first year, he gives them 10 million (oil was found on his property)....

First, there was a typo in jacket sleeve, identifying the goal of the colonists as being Titan not Tritan, so I started confused. I struggled through incomprehensible technology, self-indulgent introspection (in the form interminable flashbacks), almost no narrative and constant sexual encounters. Finally, still struggling at 150 pages I decided to go online to see if I was the only one who had trouble with this book, apparently not. I love science fiction, but this is just a high tech book about sexual fantasies, with characters not even mothers could love. Just because it's in space doesn't mean it should be called science fiction. These are explorers who live in holograms, scientists with no curiosity or scientific methodology. Save your money, save a tree don't bother with this book.

I only made it through 14 pages of this book. I checked it out from the library so had no reason to put myself through the torture that these reviews obviously indicate would not have ended until I stopped reading this book.In only fourteen pages, I was both disgusted by the prolific sexual content and completely confused by the scientific jargon.

There was a lot of superfluous stuff that I just plain skipped over. The authors tried I guess to make the characters interesting but most were so offensive to me that I didn't even want to know about them. That was too bad because most of the story seemed to be about all the little personal foibles and problems that the group of oddball characters had rather than science fiction. The other problem I had with the novel was that the techno-babble was not at all believable. But somehow I got through the novel and am now able to move on to something much better. I certainly will not be reading anything by those two authors again.I think the editor deserves a good part of the negative criticism I have for this novel. The novel should be much shorter.I don't recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRIS is Awful","review":"I'm an avid SF fan and even had the patience to suffer through these authors' earlier work, Alpha Centauri. I had no such stamina for this book. I seldom do this, but I couldn't finish it. \\"Directionless characters\\" is the understatement of the week: the entire book, but for a bare outline of a rather silly plot, is directionless. Over and over: go exploring; have sex; have sex; go exploring, etc. And everyone in the book so endlessly hung up on the routine! Who cares. Buy some other book.

The Amber Frey calls were ridiculously off, along with the basic facts. Dean Cain, like everyone has previously said, did an amazing job and it's amazing how much he looks like scott. After reading almost everything there is to read about Scott, I'm bothered by this film because it is very one sided. The questions \\"Tommy\\" asked were legitimate and it seemed like that was the only time they let you doubt that Scott was guilty but in the end \\"Tommy\\" looked stupid.I certainly just wish the movie was a little more factual and not so one-sided."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a dramatization...NOT a documentary.","review":"I thought this was a documentary when I purchased it.

It just moves too slowly for its own good. Add the annoying best friend who refused to believe anything bad about Scott Peterson and this made it a reasonably difficult 84 minutes to sit through.Those criticisms aside, Dean Cain was quite good in his role as Scott, as was the grieving Dee Wallace as Laci's mother. However at the end of the day, why does a movie like this get made when this sort of thing goes on all the time every day of the week across the world. Was there something particular about these cirumstances that warranted a film? I ask this because the script for the film was not written well enough to pull the viewer in. Not enough information was presented to the viewer to help us form an opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Husband","review":"As almost everyone else in the world I was caught up in this case from the beginning. Scott was my suspect from the beginning although I kept an open mind for a brief period. I would give anything to know just exactly what happened that triggered Lacys murder on Christmas eve morning or the night before. It was a good movie but the Amber Frey flick on TV was bettert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another profile","review":"Dean Cain did a decent job playing Scott Peterson in this made for TV movie, but quite honestly the story was a bit too choppy to be liked completely. The story of Scott's lies were told as they unfolded, and what a liar he was! As Scott was playing the happy family man who was reluctantly waiting for the arrival of his first child with his wife, Laci, he was leading a double life as a swinging single bachelor with his girlfriend Amber on the side. Amber is a subject of pity, no question, as she was lied to and drawn into this media circus as an innocent, but his phone calls to her are almost hilarious as he attempts to lie to Amber, his family and the public of his innocence. It's an ok profile of Scott the man, might give others insights into how he tried to lie and cheat and sneak his way out of the murder, but it leaves a few things to the imagination of wanting him to just fess up. Then again, that's how Scott was/is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ive seen better","review":"Movie was okay.

I was a real Peterson trial junkie, and I knew alot about Scott and Laci and the families, this movie did not portray anyone else just Scott.

I'm pretty good about keeping and open mind, and also get good and bad vibes. With him, SCOTT PETERSON, I knew he did it. Just hated it took so long for them to catch him. So of course when the movie came out, (I have to say) they couldn't have picked a better actor than DEAN CANE, it was actually very eery to see the resemblence of them. The movie was very well made, and to me seemed to actually go by the 'REAL STORY' which I like. To this day, I still feel sorrow for her parents, and at least once a month, they cross my mind.

The special effects are incredible and you are left wanting to see how things turn out.I didn't quite get why they reintroduced Barbosa, but we might find out in the next edition.In addition to the mystical elements of the first part, one is treated to a subtle diatribe on the evils of corporations and the strangle-hold they've had on governments for hundreds of years.All in all, it is an exciting picture that might scare young children, but is mostly fun for the entire family.

If Davey Jones couldn't set foot on land, why would he keep his heart locked in a chest on dry land? A few of the stunts were good. The sword fight on the water wheel was creative. The main problem was that the plot was lame. Frantic action does not make up for a thin story line. Orlando Bloom was captured so often it defies imagination. Depp was good. It was a typical bad sequel. The producers must have thought more stunts, uglier monsters, and more danger would be better, but it wasn't. They lost most of the charm and the humor. I was just bored and then it was opened ended so they can have another sequel. They should have stopped with just one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible movie","review":"The constant references to the first movie was stupid, not allowing the movie to stand on its own. Worse was how Depp ruined the Sparrow character. There was no intelligence or shrewdness behind it. I didn't even like the Sparrow he portrayed in this disaster. Depp and Knightly grossly overacted.

Most of the things that made the first movie good where gone. Replaced by a string of dragged out action sences with over done special effects.The odd laid back goofiness that made Johnny Depp's character so entertaining in the original was replaced by with more of a fearful kitten like persona. A new, and completely unexplained, villain is provided in the form of the head of the East Indina Trading company. It is never clear exactly what his purpose or goals are. He basically just seems to be someone there for you to dislike. The story line becomes more and more twisted, and unclear as the movie drags on.

Everything about the film seemed cheap and low budget. Even the sound quality and editing was lousy. I could hardly understand what the characters were saying half the time! I think my biggest dissapointment was Keira Knightley, she was wonderful in the first flick, however in the second it seemed as though she didn't have much to say? Very Few lines.

There is ONE person of color on the 'good' side, but I forget whether he already got killed off (and if not, I am sure it's coming up in the next movie). In a movie featuring all kinds of unreal creatures -the makers couldn't stretch their 'fantasy' enough to refrain from portraying whites as superior and people of color as inferior?

I watched it expecting it to be as good as a film based on a banal theme-park ride could be. On the contrary I was blown away. Clearly the film was self-contained and did not necessitate a sequel, but of course they would make one.Amazingly, the majority of the cast and crew rejoined and that spoke well for the possibilites of the sequel being entertaining. The aim for the filmmakers of this film were not to continue a story with the characters they created, but to make an audience pandering thrill-ride that doesn't allow any pesky plot to get in the way. It was painful to watch them crowbar every single major and minor character from the last film into the new one despite any logic. Apparently afraid the audience would reject the few new characters and ideas, they opted to make the same movie again.I hated this sequel, and I think it detracts heavilly from the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better/","review":"Well, overall a good movie, if your into the overall action overshadowing the storyline. To me, it was as if the writers were trying to compensate for the lack of new ideas for the script. Several parts were disappointing.........1: The ending: the writers tried the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" ending type that grabs your attention for the next movie. This one fails to make any sense. Maybe they were trying for that though.2: Several parts were repeated. (Running away from beings on deserted items)3: One octapus attack would have been enough.4: Why is the monkey still immortal, anyways?5: Drags out certain parts way too long, but other ideas need to be elaborated on.I would reccomend this movie and in all I hope that with the release of the third part in the trilogy, I will grasp the whole concept that the creators tried to get across.

I like everyone else, liked Depps Keith Richards impersonation in the first movie, but it's a one note trick, it's like ok we get it, you're doing Richards. Frankly, im no fan of Bloom, he just does not responate, he gets lost when he is on screen with Depp or Knightly but I did like many of Sparrows crew, they were very funny at times. The special effects were excellent, no doubt much money was spent on this film and you can help but be awed by it, but this is without question the weakest of the three movies; it's overlong and short on story, that sound contraditory I know, but there it is..enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.

Curse of the Black Pearl was an outstanding film with interesting characters. Dead Man's Chest introduces new characters who feel like extras instead of actual characters. This film clearly does not stand up to Curse of the Black Pearl. The best part of this film is when Barbossa walks down the stairs at the end. The rest of the movie was slightly interesting, but mainly boring. They tried to do too much from a simple concept and it ended up being a cookie-cutter Hollywood film, lacking story and good characters, and mainly being just special effects.

I just hope the final one of the trilogy will be as good as the first and bring together all of them.

But even though he was in it throughout, it felt like his parts were watered down. His dialogues felt too few and far in between. Also, Davy Jones' crew was a disgusting bunch to watch.

Sell out! What a stinker. Hollywood greed at its worst. They created the audience for the movie. At least the first movie, over rated as it was, had the innocence of no pre-marketing connections.

The sexual ennuendo did go over his head though. I enjoyed seeing that like the old time movies and cartoons had for adults. If you missed it, watch the scene when they go to the voodoo chile's hut.

In the first pirates movie Jack said to the two Government Navy officers, \\"...and then they named me their cheif..\\"as Elizabeth was falling into the water. The second movie explains that bit cause he was talking about these cannibals that made him their cheif.Anyway, I would say this movie rocked. The special effects rocked on Davy Jones and his crew. There was lots of action and barely any slow parts. The music was the awesome pirates music from the original. The script was excellent because it introduced new characters and greatly improved the old ones.The ending of the movie left you with lots of suspense, making me looking forward to the third movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"I was so impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl, that I anxiously awaited the second film. I must say that I was most disappointed by it. I have tried to watch it twice and each time I kept dozing off. I found it way too long and very boring all the way through. While the first movie was hysterically funny, it seemed as though this one was trying to be, but fell short nearly every time. One cannot fault the actors. Johnny Depp is one of the best male actors of our time, in my opinion, and his performance was superb in this movie, as it was in the first. But the story seemed to drag along, and the ending, when it finally arrived, was no ending at all, merely hanging there obviously letting us know that there is another one coming, folks. Perhaps the next movie will make up for this one, who knows; but I hesitate to watch it when I couldn't even stay awake for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All special effects, no story, movie does not have an ending","review":"The first pirates movie was wonderful and I can't recommend it more highly. My family watched it multiple times and my 3 year old really liked it. He said the new movie was \\"stupid\\" and he did not like the octopus/crab guy, the over-acted central character. Pirates 2 was focused on monsters almost exclusively instead of pirates... really, where are the pirates? The story never seemed to flow and the entire thing IS A CLIFFHANGER for the next movie - arggh! I can't remember ever being so disappointed in a movie. The special effects were great, but the movie ultimately seemed to be a soup of effects without any compelling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Gross","review":"I enjoyed the Black Pearl movie but this one was a bit much.

And it was worth the extra money. The special features had in-depth behind the scenes documentaries, great commentary; very interesting if you're a fan of the movie and behind the scenes movie stuff in general. Only complaint was I wished the 'blooper reel' was longer. This movie is an enjoyable one that can be watched over and over again.

The audio is quite poor, making much of the dialog unintelligible.

The first movie in this series was great. I doubt many people dispute that. It was funny and interesting, and the characters and story were executed to perfection. Every scene mattered and it held your attention. What happened this time? I don't know, but it stunk. My wife, who is nowhere near as critical as I am, was as disappointed as I was. If there are people out there who were entertained, I can't relate. I don't want to ever see this again because it takes away from the first story. Just like Karate Kid, Back to the Future, and Jaws, I'm going to pretend no sequels exist to Pirates of the Caribbean."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know who was more bord, me or Depp","review":"Somehow i just don't find this movie all that entertaining. Johnny Depp looks bord in many of the scenes of this film. Special effects are not anything i really enjoy or get excited about but give me the older days when pirates were pirates. He sort of look like a badly made up drag queen. To me the good films of today are very few and far inbetween. This one is way far inbetween. Don't bother. Rent yourself an old Gene Kelly MGM Pirate movie instead. Actors today,,,,yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Pirates 2","review":"I agree with the minority opinion, that his movie was a grave disappointment. It was very weak and not entertaining. As the one reviewer points out, there ARE many similarities to the Indiana Jones series. Like that series, the first (Raiders of the Lost Ark) was fantastic, as was the first Pirates. The second (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) was very lame, as was Dead Man's Chest. No interest in seeing either of those again. So, now the question is whether Pirates 3 will be a big comeback as was the 3rd Indiana Jones (Indiana Jones and the Last crusade), which was terrific. I hope so, but am skeptical. Since Pirates 2 and 3 were filmed together, it leaves little time to reflect on what a poor job they did with Pirates 2, in order to make up for it in Pirates 3. We can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this Pirate a wide berth","review":"The first \\"Pirate\\" movie was an amusing diversion but the second one is just an overblown bore.This being a sequel the characters are no longer fresh - Depp's Jack Sparrow character has definitely outworn his welcome.Give this \\"Pirate\\" a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the same Sparrow!","review":"Although the scenery was breathtaking, the movie experience wasn't quite as rewarding as the first adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, not as good as the first","review":"Good movie, not as good as the first.

It is over two hours and what a boring film. The movie ends in an anti-climax with no treasure in the end. The worst part of the movie is Johnny Depp who seems so idiotic and stupid that will make \\"Don Quixote\\" an \\"Indiana Jones\\". With lack-lustre dialogues and lines he is just a waste of time. Overdoing dirty looking pirates and their mannerisms were also nothing impressive. You wonder what the beautiful Keira Knightly is doing in a film as this. There is hardly any role for her here. I liked the way Naomie Harris as the Voodoo Soceress spoke her lines though. There are some good special effects but haven't we seen enough special effects already.Waiting for Part 3? - Don't even care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Shockingly disappointed with this movie! The Black Pearl was great with the quirky Jack Sparrow, the entertaining escapes, the fantastic story line, the whit, the various predicaments-I could go on and on and on...Dead Man's Chest was TORTURE to watch! The quirkiness was gone, the Sealife pirates were ridiculous, the obligatory escapes were a complete bore and drawn out way too long, I couldn't understand most of what they were saying with the ultra thick accents every character seemed to have, and the twist at the end with Jack and Elizabeth left more than a sour taste.There is no chance I will waste my time with the third movie they will obviously be making since they didn't even bother making Dead Man's Chest a completed movie.

I've seen the first movie six or seven times, and it still hasn't lost its humor and glorious silliness. DMC does deserve an extra star (up from one) for its decidedly entertaining action scenes. Black Pearl was so much more than action, though...In the sequel, Jack Sparrow is an entirely two-dimensional character and his fellow protagonists are flat and entirely uninteresting. Will and Elizabeth are thoroughly unconvincing when declaring their mutual love.The relation between the East India Company and the Crown as represented by the governor of Port Royal is utterly unbelievable and seems more like a reflection on the current involvement of big business in politics than anything that could actually have occurred back then.I'm sincerely hoping that Dead Man's Chest will turn out to be what 'Back to the Future II' was to BttF I & III -- a really awful movie wedged in between two great ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie for cheap","review":"i payed was less then i did buying a movie at blockbuster when it was going out of bunis and said big sale (not true) it was such a good buy for my money"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for whole family","review":"The movie is funny and well done but there is also a second disc full of activities like how Captain Jack's costume is put together and what the individual pieces are.

I especially liked the surprise at the end and you know there's a sequel because the movie ends in a cliffhanger.

After such a wonderful beginning with 'the curse of the black pearl', it is sad to see how far a film studio can fall just to keep the dollars roling in. The plot is laughable, even if one can understand it, and the characters have had yet another metamorphoisis from the original group we came to love and laugh with. Johnny Depp salvages most of his original genius, but the remainder are pitiful. Even that great actor Geoffrey Rush, seems to wallow in confusion as to what he is supposed to be and do.Please, Disney, do us a favor, and DONT MAKE ANY MORE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp","review":"My wife and I enjoy watching these series of POTC.

It has a fast pace, lots of action, many funny one liners and a great cast. It's a long movie but doesn't seem long because there is so much going on. I was not bored once. Depp was HOT, Knightly was hot and the ending left me hoping that part 3 will come out soon! True, it's not a realistic movie and the fight scenes are really far fetched but it's a fun movie and I was entertained. There are some gross scenes and it's slightly scary but for kids who can handle it, it's a really a great family movie and also a great date movie with something for guys and gals alike.

Some of the dialogue was so low that I had to turn the subtitles on the DVD just to see what was being said. I also had to rewind several times when the Seer, or whoever that black lady was that they went to see, was speaking. The movie makers tried to give her an accent but it ended up being over the top and really hard to understand. Davy Jones and his crew were so disgusting looking that I almost couldn't watch the scenes with them in it. They tried to have a deep emotional thing with Will Turner and his dad but it seemed really contrived to me and not that interesting to watch.

It's a fun story with good performances and spectacular effects.As someone with a life-long interest in special effects and animation, I especially liked the Kraken, a giant sea monster that reminded me of Ray Harryhausen movies - but it's so good you can't tell which parts are CG. Most impressive, I am told Davy Jones is entirely CG - there's no actor involved - and the same is true of his entire crew save one, Bootstrap Bill. No doubt this one will get an Oscar for the special effects / animation. Oh, and the human actors aren't too bad either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the charm of the first?","review":"I'm in the very small minority here, but I didn't care for this movie at all. It seemed to lack all the charm and spontaneity of the original, as though the producers racheted up the special effects and production just to cash in on the Pirate's \\"franchise.\\" Even Depp's performance was sub-par (and he's one of my favorite actors!); he didn't seem to have his heart in it. The others called their lines in by phone!I mean, what in the world were those early scenes on the island with the hungry natives supposed to be about? It didn't do anything to add to the story or the characterizations. It was absurd -- but not funny.To me, the entire intention of this movie was to sell products and promotional items -- not to entertain.Okay, go ahead and hit the \\"not helpful\\" button -- but I just had to put in my dissenting opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"As with most sequels, it's lacking","review":"\\"The first time is always the best\\" they say and it seems to apply to serial movies too. Johnny Depp was great in the first movie, but he's over acted this one and even he doesn't seem to be enjoying it. Overall the movie has no plot, no story line and a bunch of special effects, all seemingly created to top the first movie, but it's not worth the $1.99 I spent for a 48 hour rental. I definitely will not bother with the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th. in the series. Yes, Dinsey is going to produce 2 more back to back after the 4th movie. When you get a hit, beat it to death, just like terminator, star treck, etc.The best part of the movie was the undead monkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"everything sucks in this film","review":"This is a dicusting picture not even [the scary presence of Davy Jones] scares me The first one I really like its wellploted smart funny and had a great swordfight.The second one I dislike Its hard to follow goofy retarted and very childish.Don't wast your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Pirates","review":"OK so it was not as good Pirates I IMHO but still like it anyway. It is a sequel - what do you expect. If you loved Pirates I you will probably like this a lot (but then again you probably would have already seen it.) Of course now can't wait for Pirates III, they were both filmed at the same time and this one clearly is only half the story. Pirates I had lots of extras on the 2-disc set. This one looked like they kind of ran out of time in post production. Hope III does better in that respect - they have had a whole year to get lots of comments and voiceovers from Keira."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"I know I am in the minority here, but I loved the first one and was very excited to see this one. I don't know if my expectations were too high after the first one, but I found this to be really bad. My wife wife actually liked the first one and fell asleep during this one. I just found it really disjointed and felt they substituted special effects for story. Its a good movie for little kids I guess, but I don't see this to be anywhere near as good as the Spider man movies, The Incredibles or even the Mummy Returns for that matter. If you haven't seen it already, I would recommend watching it first or waiting for the price to drop before shelling out $20. It's worth watching but I didn't need/want to own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie! Widescreen Only!","review":"I ordered this item on 12/5/2006 & recieved it on 12/6/2006 as promised.

Just to let y'all know it is widescreen only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Let me start off by saying how much I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Johnny Depp was brilliant, the story was fun, it was immensely entertaining, even Orlando Bloom didn't annoy me as much as he usually does.I think Disney let their idea people get out of control. The movie just got too crowded with special effects and totally goofy plot twists, which eventually robbed a good cast of any opportunity to actually act. Davey Jones and his crew are so over-endowed with gimmicks squirming over their bodies that they ended up more being more distracting than entertaining. And why did the director need to get so focused on being as gross as possible? Johnny Depp nibbling on a necklace made of human toes was something I didn't get; I didn't need it, and neither did the movie.Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a let down. I can't think of any redeeming qualities, except maybe that it is making a few people a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequelitis or Laziness?","review":"Quite a letdown from the first. The characters became less sympathetic. Depp's character acts like a classic sociopath: say and do anything to further your own goals, regardless of how it harms others. Knightley's character is not far behind. Bloom's character remains rather noble, but his nobility blinds him to how others use him, making him appear stupid. The sound track was harder to hear than most other DVDs on our system, so I missed about half of the dialogue. No problem: the plot was predictable. The characters on the whole were flat and stereotypical (dull). The producers seemed to know this, trying to cover it with a plethora of special effects. The third installation may prove some of this analysis wrong, but the protaganists are going to need to really make an effort to become sympathetic and/or well-intentioned. Otherwise, it's just Seinfeld meets Long John Silver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible saga","review":"Totally disapointing piece of trash. Pointless, boring, grotesque, confusing, and violent. Filled with the disgusting humor and the ridiculous romantic scenes, which characterize the latest American movies. This is another example of a typical B.S. movie, along with \\"The War of the Worlds\\", \\"The Day after Tomorrow\\" and \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Armageddon\\", etc. The only reason why I didn't rate it with cero stars, is because of the excellent special effects and the great scenery. It's a shame that Disney Productions lent itself to producing this horrible movie. Pirates of the Caribbean number one, was a great movie, this one's not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This pirate should have died the first episode","review":"My friend and I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest yesterday. This was the worst picture we have seen in years. We saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean and were looking forward to the wit and charm of the new film.

The movie sizzles like a lit fuse on a firecracker when he's on screen. More Popeye-type muttering under his breath would have been welcome. But, God, what more could you ask for in a summer movie? It's beautifully shot, the evil guys (the British) are very bloodless and Dubya-like, Davey Jones and his crew are pretty weird, but it works, and the good guys (the good guys and the very delectable Ms. Knightly) are pretty good most of the time. The voodoo priestess actually blows away Ms. Knightly's trembling sexuality and the cliffhanger at the very end of the movie will positively have you stomping your feet and yelling for more.This movie is FUN. What more could you ask for..? I cannot wait for the third installment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN - Dead Man's Chest -TOO Widescreen","review":"We loved this movie...better than the first, although the first was a gem as well. Viewed in a movie theatre it was quite an experience, however, this series (referring to the first) when released on DVD is only in the EXTREEM WIDE SCREEN EDITION, I'm assuming this new edition is the same. Even on a large 16 x 9 format monitor there are still black bars on top and bottom of the picture...on a 27 inch standard or smaller TV the picture with all it's action is JUST TOO SMALL. There should be a choice of FULL SCREEN with all the extras on DVD as well as the wide screen edition. You also lose one-half of the picture resolution when the picture is reduced to a narrow band in the middle of the screen. At one time many DVD movies had BOTH CHOICES ON ONE DISC. A great movie with just a technical complaint. FOUR STARS due to the extreem widescreen formatonly."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic movie","review":"a movie that is advertised with the disney label shows whipping, throatcutting and guys having their eyes eaten by crows? if walt disney was still alive he would fire every one of the movie bosses for this! because even though its PG13 alot of parents will show this to their small children who will have nightmares for a week!never mind a bogus plot, a missing ending (only to make you go see part 3) and an overbearing, incessent music track and i really wonder how this could become such a hit? all johnny depp manages to portray is a permanently druken pirate...were it not for some good visual effects i would have given the movie only 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead man's blu-ray","review":"Sad sad day.

Worse this movie builds toward something then just falls off the last fifteen minutes to ensure the viewer will buy a ticket for the next showing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I immensely enjoyed the first 'Pirates'. It was engaging and entertaining. This second installment seems to lean entirely on the success of the first. The dialogue is trite and unimaginative. Several of the scenes left me wondering what they were there for. They added nothing to the plot or depth of the characters. Some of the redeeming qualities of the characters in the first movie were left behind as they tried to invent additional scenes to 'entertain'. Elizabeth especially was more heroic and intelligient in the first movie. She became silly and ridiculous in this one, checking her moral foundation at the door. The best scene was the last, where Captain Barbosa makes an appearance, giving us hope at least that the third installment may recover from this disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main Menu","review":"I have the new Samsung Blu Ray player.

There is a poignant scene near the end that is truly touching, and all the actors deliver fine performances. But unless you are very hardened to the thoroughly gross, the movie is visually revolting.

A over 2 and a half hour commercial for the third part in 2997, and I wasn't expecting that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great special effects and action...how about linking those scenes with a little more plot next time!","review":"Really, can Disney afford these millions in special effect, but not hire a writer who can fill in the spaces between action scenes and CGI wih a little more plot for the adults in the audience. In example, why didn't they explain some things a little better, like why Jack was escaping from the prison at the beginning other than waving a picture of a key about. I mean geesh, they had just spent a scene talking about how the other characters had helped him escape, just to show him escaping a prison apparently by himself. Were these two linked at all...were they just referring to the scene at the end of the first movie where Jack jumps off the cliff. Boo poor story telling! Movies these days think they can be a video game...little story and lots of action. How about quality in both areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, It's Not As Good As The First One, But It Is Still Very Good.","review":"I think the title says it all.

First off I found the kitchens in this book uninspired and many of them just impractical. For example there are more then a couple kitchens in this book with either no upper cabinets or just 2 or 3. What is that about? I will say that if and only if you are really into super contemporary kitchens, I mean some of them looked like they were out of some futuristic movie, you may be able to justify the pricetag to yourself, otherwise pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Kitchens","review":"This book has a hundred inspirational kitchens, Helpful guides to keep you focused, on budget, etc. Great photos of upper end kitchens, although the helpful parts are for all of us.

It is just chock-full of beautiful kitchens and designs, with their stories and insights into the design process. I had figured for $6 it was about the same price as a magazine and I could maybe just cut out a few photos, but it is really a wonderful book.I'm not sure if I'd choose it first among other $20+ books, but I am glad to have it.

I read quickly, so it took about 30 minutes. It is a simplistic book presented in a way that one might write to one's employees. Each chapter is a a statement followed by a hint of justification. Pretty arrogant actually. I gave it to one of our High School interns who found it somewhat educational because he knows nothing about the B world yet.If JW was not famous, then this book, in the form of a paper, could get a solid B at a Business school. Here is my version of one of his chapters: \\"I, the ex boss at a company that makes a lot of money on a whole lot of products which are never the best-in-class, say this, and because I am famous you can buy my book so I can continue to cash in on my great PR.

If you are looking for all of Chambers's writings, not just some representative pieces, you will need to look elsewhere.

This was the first series he wrote and it is not quiet as good as his other works, but you can still the the genious creativity that is his trademark. The Sword and the Flame is mostly Quinten's struggle with how to balance being a king and being a man. You see an emotional side to him that isn't sappy or wierd, but completely human. As a reader we can relate not only to Quinten, but to his friends as they either stand by him or desert Quinten in his time of need.

My son has loved this chair basically from day one. He's five weeks old and therefore isn't really into the toy bar right now, but I'm sure he will be later. But he does love to take naps in it (he happens to be taking a nap in it right now). The vibration is perfect. I've only had to change the batteries once so far, but we use this chair and always with the vibration on because if he falls alseep in it and you turn the vibration off he'll notice and wake up and not always fall back asleep. I picked out this chair because I wanted to be able to get my money's worth out of it instead of a normal bouncer that they can only stay in until they're about 25 pounds, but I definetely feel like I've already gotten my money's worth out of it anyway!

I love the kickstand which allows us to lay it back like a bed. He sleeps very well in it. The bugs attract his attention when he is awake, the middle ladybug which sings is his favorite, I believe! So far this bouncy seat has been worth the money and I am looking forward to him using it as a rocking chair when he is older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could return it","review":"I had registered for this based on its good reviews and some recommendations from other moms. I am not at all impressed with how this rocker is put together. Why would they make the toys hang with velcro? The cow in the center doesn't even face the correct way. Also, the seat is really hard. My son is bored instantly when we put him in this. We only use it if we need to put him down really quickly for something.

I can't tell you what it feels like to pick your baby off of the concrete she is lying on her face not knowing what you will find. She hurt her mouth and was bleeding a lot.I am mortified that there is a product on them market that can flip so easily. Didn't they test this thing? Furthermore, after finding this page to write a review I find out I am not the only one. Please don't risk it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for a while...","review":"This chair is nice to get if you have a larger baby (like my son) who quickly outgrows smaller playseats. He didn't like to sit in it for too long, because there's a hard, board seat without too much padding. He did like the toys pretty well, but sometimes got frustrated when he couldn't pull them towards himself more (mainly to chew on). The toys are detachable and can be used seperately when the child gets older.The \\"kickstand\\" feature is nice for securing the seat to put baby in it, or to stabalize for young infants. Never used the \\"calming vibrations\\" feature. Fairly easy to assemble (and disassemble, when it needs to go into storage)."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy so far","review":"Our 7 month-old son has gotten lots of use out of his rocker...especially in the first few months when he had reflux and slept better in this than flat on his back...useful during colds too.

We are very glad we got this RATHER THAN A BOUNCER SEAT, as he was over 20 pounds by 4 months old...and I am all for toys that have lasting value.

I like the stablity of the frame, yet it can fold down to take in the car, or to remove the fabric for cleaning-which is easy just slides off. I prefered it to a bouncer which seems a little flimsy, and then what do you do with it, when they are too old? This rocker has a stability bar in the front that lets the newborns lay back, and vibrate, and eventually as they become toddlers, they can use it again as a small rocking chair. My kids used theirs for years and it still looks good.I will say at times the vibrator makes too much noise-but i fixed it by adding a little paper towel in the battery compartment.All in all, i think this is a great choice for new parents, and will last for years.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"Maybe if you are not into the flashing lights, and the music, this would work great.

Now that I have one I don't know why I never bought one before. This will last so much longer than any bouncy chair and has way more YEARS of life than an expensive Papasan chair. Please those things are such a waste of money! I think I may have to buy another one since my 19 month old is wanting to use this one but my 5 week old son is in it. Can't have her trying to sit on his lap! I love everything about this chair. My baby is a quiet (except when he's crying) baby. Well after 2 minutes in this chair he kicked his legs and it made the toys move. He started to make sounds and smile and kick more and more. It's the only thing he's interacted with.

My daughter wants to sit in it and when she gets in, it sways. She is 23 months and only 24lbs, it shouldn't be that flimsy! The screws are as tight as they can be, but the plastic is just cheap.

Our newborn very often sleeps in here, thanks to the recline feature (wasn't on our first chair). When the baby isn't in it, my 2 year old will put the kickstand in and sit in the chair. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the cow on the toy bar...my 2 week old loves to stare at it, but it faces the wrong way!

She uses the chair now in the rocking position as her everyday seat to put on her shoes, watch a movie or read a book.

So I started putting her in the stand position so she couldn't \\"rock\\" it forward and somehow she leaned so far to the side that the entire chair tipped over with her in it and landing right on her head!I would not recommend this chair for infants who are trying to sit up.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just got this after 4 other bouncers...","review":"And I'm finally happy.My 6-week-old is finally happy too. Baby apparently doesn't like typical bouncer seats. Baby feels much more secure in this bigger, deeper seat (baby is a big baby). And baby prefers the gentle rocking to the springy bouncing of other seats.The toy bar is the best I've seen too. Because of the different angle of the seat, even young babies can reach the toys, rather than stare at them just out of arm's reach.I only gave it 4 stars because my 2-year-old doesn't like it as much as I thought 2-year-old would.I would recommend this one. Even if your child doesn't like it right away, at some point they will because it has years of usefulness, instead of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must rock manually","review":"This is cute but I ordered this item with the impression that it rocked by itself (battery operated) after receiving item it only has a vibration option.............so you must manually rock this yourself..........this was a waste of money for me!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for children over 1","review":"I thought this chair would be great for my 15 month old but it is not. You cant remove the harness so it is uncomfortable for him to sit in it with the harness still being on the chair.

Very dangerous! I still gave it two stars because it worked great in the reclined position. But because that is all its good for I would just buy a bouncer instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I had this chair sent to my parents house before a visit with our 6 month old baby thinking it will last a while longer than a regular bouncy seat since she doesn't visit there often.I loved this chair and if I had seen them earlier would have bought one for our house instead of a regular bouncy seat and may still get one when she outgrows the bouncy (it has a vibrating function like the bouncy which has always helped her take naps better). She really liked it and it was a saver as we used it for a feeding chair, entertainment center with the toys and a napping seat.I love the fact that it can be used up to 40# so she can use it as a rocker for the next couple years.Had a little difficulty reclining or lifting the back with her in it as have to push both buttons at same time as moving the back but was not that big of an issue.Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot believe they still make this...It is awesome!","review":"First of all I had the old school model. My son is now nine years old. I was shopping on here for a baby shower and found this. I can't believe they still make it.

So please, please be careful with this chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIPS OVER!","review":"My 8 month old daughter loved this seat because if offered her the chance to sit upright and she enjoyed being able to remove the toys herself (velcro), but as she learned to rock it, she tipped the entire thing over on her face, bringing the chair down on top of her (she was strapped in) and the toy bar down over her head. She was not hurt (small red bump) but was very frightened (as were my husband and myself). Luckily we were both right there with her and were able to extract her from the chair very quickly. It did take two of us to get her up, one to move the chair and one to pick up the baby (who was still attached). I do not reccomend this chair! There are safer versions available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous Product","review":"I was so excited about buying this product, me son loves to rock, until I brought it home.

My first two children used a bouncy-seat when they were babies and loved it. When they moved the seat jiggled a little. This chair has to be on a hard, smooth surface to move at all with baby, otherwise he's just sitting there wondering why he can't quite reach the toys hanging in front of him. As a toddler rocker, it's too reclined even in the upmost position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the cow backwards?","review":"I bought this for my son at birth. He used it a lot while he was 1-3 months. The reclining position is great. When he started sitting up he did the same thing, he rolled it with him in it. I was in the room also. but he ended up with a pretty big bump on his head and was grouchy the rest of the day. A question I have is, why is the cow backwards?? When put on the cow is facing the wrong way. When you turn it around it doesn't stick to the velcro and is easily pulled off. Not a very sturdy item, there are better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We bought this chair for our daughter instead of a traditional bouncy chair, and I am so glad! My daughter is now 4 months old and still loves this chair. The vibration totally puts her at ease and she loves talking to the little farm animals. (I only wish the cow faced the baby instead of the other way around). I always put her in her chair just outside the bathroom door when I need to take a shower and she is just pleased as punch to sit there. We always take it with us when vising friends, too, so that she has something to do and we don't have to be constantly holding her. I couldn't live without this chair. It was well worth the cost and she can continue to use it as a rocking chair as she gets older. Great job fisher price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't bought this","review":"I really thought that this would be great for my son to hang out in as an infant while strapped in, but as another reviewer points out, the 3 point harness is no good for a child beginning to sit up or lunge forward.

A disappointment---my son is now 2.5 and we keep the rocker sitting in the living room filled with toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than I expected","review":"I got this as a gift before my son was born. I honestly thought it was the ugliest, most unnecessary thing ever. It was my first child, though. As I found out quickly, this chair is a lifesaver. I used it to feed my son on occasion, gave him a place to sit while I did a few chores, taught him to reach for his toys, etc. He's 18 months, and just decided a few weeks ago that he doesn't like it anymore.Pros:It can sit or lay backToys are close enough for babies to reachHas a vibrating option, which is good for a babyCover is removable for washing, and easy to wipe down with wipesThe toy bar comes off to help put the baby in and out.Cons:It's not the most attractive thing I've seenAdjusting the straps is difficultThe child can't rock themselves until they're older, at which point they're probably bored of itIt's almost impossible to get the child in with the toy bar on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea... poor execution","review":"Although it was ridiculously easy to assemble, this chair wasn't an instant hit with my daughter.

I registered for this particular one because my nephew who just turned 2 has the same one, and he still uses it. I like it because the seat is deep. I think it is the best value because he's been using it since he was about 4 weeks old and continues to use it. My only problem is that the toys on all the bouncers seem so close to the baby's face. My son hates it so I just removed the toy bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I bought 2 of these when my twins were born and that was almost 4 years ago. They have used it EVERY SINGLE DAY since then. They have endured all kinds of flipping and abuse by the children since they grew up a bit and the chairs are still holding up in excellent shape. The fabric teared a bit but again they have been subject to extreme use. They are 3 years and 8 montsh old now and still use it every day to watch tv and most days fall asleep in it while doing so.Don't think it twice, buy it! Also, this older version seems to me much more durable than the newer ones, which seem to have a lot of plastic and focused more on esthetics than durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful chair!!","review":"This chair is wonderful> My new grand daughter loves this chair.

The rattle toy that comes with it is OK. We hang our own toys off the bar using links. She likes the song it plays.

I have a long boy and at 9 month he still fits in it comfortably, though I removed the overhead toys. The conversion to a rocking chair is super easy. Took no time to put together. These items have limited lifespans, but this particular one has a longer life than others because of the rocking chair option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Newborn/Infant Rocker","review":"We spent hundreds of dollars on the best reviewed items out there, however our newborn hated them all. She would sit in the full-sized \\"My Lil Lamb\\" swing and bouncer and cry. Then we tried the Fisher Price swing and she still hated it. This rocker was our last hope and to our amazement she LOVED it!!! She would fall asleep in it which was something we never experienced with other units. The swing is very light and convenient. Although I wish it would fold down when traveling. The toys are attached with velcro so its easily removable or you can remove the whole play unit for easy access to baby. I highly recommend this rocker for easy long-term use."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"really like this baby chair. my son has just about outgrown his bouncy chair and i needed something more versatile. it's nice quality, great how the back of the chair reclines and sits upright. easy to assemble. i wish the seat of the chair was more padded - there's a piece of wood that slides into the chair cover to form the seat and it's quite hard for a baby's bottom. i folded a soft receiving blanket and stuffed it between the chair cover and the wood and this works well. also, this chair tends to slide on the floor if you rock it with your foot, it doesn't have the rubber stoppers like some other chairs do. a bit annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"This is a great infant seat, it was easy to assemble (in all fairness, my husband did it, but I supervised), it's good quality, the pink princess mouse print is cute. It's sturdy and I think it will hold up well. I love that it can grow with the baby through toddlerhood as a rocker. (We use it for my newborn but my 2 year old tried out the rocker and she gives her approval) The vibrations are not too weak or too strong, it's just right for soothing my little one to sleep. She seems comfortable and she sleeps well in her seat. This seat is well worth the price and I am happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE","review":"This chair can tip over if your child reaches forward, overbalancing the chair. My son tipped the chair and fell face first into the hardwood floor. Luckily, he was not seriously injured. The instructions for the chair say NOTHING about being usafe for infants who can sit up, but that is what a representative at Fisher Price had to say about it! \\"NOT SAFE FOR INFANTS WHO CAN SIT UP.\\" Shouldn't that be on the instructions? Infant to Toddler Rocker is a misleading name, if that's the case. The response by Fisher Price was to offer a refund. This product should be RECALLED! This could have led to a serious injury. I see numerous reviews about this product being unsafe. Where is the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission? I called them numerous times but could not get my call returned. BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE FOR INFANTS WHO SIT UPRIGHT","review":"We, too, had an accident with this product. Just today, my 7 month old daughter (21 pounds) flipped the seat forward and landed on her forehead on our hardwood floor. Big egg on forehead above eye.

He loved his bouncy chair, but he got to be so big that the seat nearly became horizontal when he sat in it. This was a great option for us because he cannot yet sit on his own, and this seat will be able to hold him until he reaches 40 pounds. The color scheme is pretty cute and the toys are a lot more fun than the ones that were on his fisher price bouncer. The things I do not like are that it is quite difficult to rock (maybe because I have it on carpet?), and the seat is hard (because of a wooden bored underneath a thin layer of padding). Also, the seat is not quite as roomy as it looks in the picture. As the other reviewer noted, the children in the product photos must be quite petite. Other than those few things, this seat meets my expectations and the price was reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"just like everyone else...","review":"just like everyone else.. we like this rocker...our 3 year old seats in and our 1 year old can have fun in it as well...looks like a good gift to give and looks like it will last a life time around kids...P.S> Fisher-Price CS is great.. so 5 star for that.--------------------If you fine my reviews helpful please mark it as so..

My son likes to be held all the time, and this is the only thing that he will sit in for long periods of time so that I am able to get anything done around the house. I have never put batteries in the vibrating feature because he does fine without it, so I can't tell you how well that works. I have never let him nap in it like another reviewer suggested, but it would be great for doing so. The seat also reclines, and it is great for feeding time, because they are sitting at a higher angle. My mom has even bought one to keep at her house, and my mother in law wants to buy one as well.

Because you can use it from infant to toddler, its ideal for the toddler to sit on whilst watching their favourite video, putting on their shoes, or just to chill. It is ideal for baby because they can sleep peacefully in it, and you can have it stable or rocking which is great when trying to sooth baby to sleep.

I ordered this item and today it was left on my door in completley battered condition. While this may sound like a UPS issue, the bottom line is Babies R Us was responsible for preparing the package and said package had no outer boxing, meaning it was pulled from the shelf, a label was stuck on it and it was left to the mercy of UPS. The box had obviously been opened and taped shut, in a very poor manner, at least once. To ship any package in the same form you would pull it off the shelf at a store is pathetically irresponsible and unacceptable. I've arranged for a refund and pick up from UPS to send it back and will just get the item wherever I can find it and put it in the car. I wouldn't third party order anything from Babies R Us again and Amazon (who I've ordered probably hundereds of various items from) was made to look bad by representing them.

My child can kick her legs and actually rock it herself a little, which provides her entertainment. The only thing I see that is of concern is the hard toys that hang down: if the seat is not reclined in the furthest position the toys will hit the baby in the face when it is rocked, which is not good. I guess once baby is big enough to sit more upright, the toys will need to be removed. Other than that, the price was good and the seat is handy to have around when my hands are full."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I was using this for my son right from his 15 days.He is now 7 months and still enjoys it.It\`ll follow us from the dinning area to the park/backyard while my daughter is playing there.Good use for the pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente Producto","review":"Excelente producto, a mi bebe le encanto!!! se siente muy comoda y segura alli, ademas se divierte muchisimo con los juguetitos que trae la silla y la musiquita...

Usually he is so tired he cries and screams when he is trying to settle down. We bought this rocker hoping the vibrating and rocking would help his gas problems.We have had a lot of success in getting him to go to sleep without all the screaming when using this. It doesn't work every time, and sometimes he is only happy for 15 minutes, but for parents of a colicky baby we will take any amount of peaceful time regardless of how short it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for baby sister and big brother!!","review":"We LOVE this rocker!! We have a 6 month old little girl and 17 month old boy; this is one of the few baby items that both my babies can enjoy.My baby likes to sit in it and watch the kids play. We, also, have the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer, which my son loved alot, but my little girl prefers the rocker.And the best part is, my son will sit in the chair and look at his books or just sit there to rock back and forth! One downfall is he tends to want to be in it when the baby is sitting there.This really is a great investment because it truly grows with the child AND if you have a toddler and infant it can be used by both!! Which is a rarity among baby items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one he likes!","review":"My son is 8 weeks old. For shower gifts, we got a great swing and a bouncer, but he only seems to like these if he is already asleep when we put him in. I had registered for this one, but hadn't received it.When friends had their 9 mth daughter in it and said they take it everywhere, we decided to go for it. He LOVES it!Totally into the toys that hang, likes that he can recline and lay back, and even seems happy with the vibrating in this one, unlike in the other bouncer. We are all very happy with this, and it was easy to put together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF CHILD!","review":"A friend of ours got this \\"wonderful\\" rocker at her daughters 1st birthday. Since our twins outgrew their bouncy chairs, we thought this would be a lifesaver. NOT! Our smaller twin, 17 pounds, scooted herself out from the belt right in front of our eyes, not once, but twice. Another time she was doing a handstand in front of the chair. She bent completely forward and popped right out of the belt. Of course the belt is as tight as it could go without splitting her tummy! PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF YOUR CHILD IN THIS SEAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The one I received wobbles. Not safe~~~~~","review":"This is the second one I have. This frame wobbles and I have safety concerns.

The seat fabric is not tethered to the back frame so they can pull the whole fabric seat part out of the frame/forward. The vibration setting rattled which was highly annoying. I had to stuff a soft toy between the vibration unit and the bottom of the seat. Got almost no use out of it and then it just became a place to put toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok - but nothing special","review":"My daughter spent minimal time in this chair as an infant. Now at 10 mo. she's too little to use it as a toddler chair, and too big (mobile!) to use it as infant chair. The toys (hanging animals) have entertained her more detached from the chair (I now keep them in her toy box). Two of the animals are two-sided, but when seated in the chair, the one-sided cow faces away from her. (I don't understand why manufacturers do this!)I've heard from some friends that bouncy chairs worked miracles on their fussy infants, but that was never true for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker, Bug Friends","review":"This is an amazing product. I highly recommend it. It is so colorful, and our grandson spent happy times in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, easy to assemble","review":"LO (11 weeks) seems to like this, as it props her upright and she can look around. The toy bar is good and the middle toy plays a brief musical interlude when you pull the handle (LO is too small to do this herself yet). She also likes that the chair rocks when she moves (teaches cause and effect) but she doesn't like the 'soothing vibrations' mode - I think this scares her a little. She might like it when she gets bigger. It doesn't rock back very far, which is probably a safety thing but it would be good if it rocked back a little further than it does. Still a great product, well made, and one that will last a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I bought for my twins","review":"I am amazed by how much my twins love this bouncer. It never fails to delight them. I think the company must have done studies on what babies enjoy....my babies stare at the snail and smile endlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"This seat has been sooooo perfect! It reclines enough so my newborn can be comfortable (she actually uses it to sleep in a lot of the time.) It's big enough for my two year old also. I like that it rocks easily, but can also stay stationary. It's bright and colorful! The only thing I dont really like is where the toy bar is.I feel like my daughter is going to get hit in the head by the toys (but she never does.) I would definitely recommend this seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby loves this!","review":"Great value. Our 2-month-old loves looking at the toy bar, and he loves being able to rock himself in the rocker. We love that it is easily portable and multi-functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely better than a bouncer!","review":"I bought this item based on previous reviews and I had seen bouncers in action. I wanted somthing I could use for a long time and something that could keep my baby comfortable and occupied. This did that and more. My 3mths old baby rocks to sleep so easily it's amazing and we started using it as soon as it arrived nigeria when she was just weeks old! She also loves the arch holding the toys instead of the toys, the red polka dots catches her concentration its so amazing(I have the blue-green).I don't regret buying it but I must admit I don't like the vibrations (my baby too)so I don't use it. Other than that, it's a five star."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby rocker vibrating seat","review":"Bought this and had it sent to my granddaughter for the baby. Loves the seat and would recommend it. My daughter has one that has been used by three babies and theey love to use it as a rocking chair. They will not outgrow it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Grandma bought this to use & it was perfect. It is so cute. I still remember them looking around trying to see the elephants that are on the clothes pattern. I do wish the back was taller as if you have a longer/taller baby then their head might outgrow this sooner than you want, but I would still buy it.It is a very cute chair that once big enough they can move around themselves. I like that it is very portable.It is a chair for many stages: sitting & learning eye hand coordination to play w/ the 3 included hanging toys (NOTE: pretty neat these are velcroed so can be taken off & played with seperately), pull the toy to play music, rock or just sit to read a book.I would highly suggest this item & suggest it early so you get a lot of use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase!","review":"Bought this for our now 3 month old son and he loves it. Prior to getting this, we only had an expensive swing that just wasn't giving us the results we had hoped for.This Fisher Price chair is great! It is battery operated (D) and is a go to favorite for my son. After play time, tummy time, etc...sometimes he just wants to sit up and look around. This chair soothes him, often puts him to sleep and is easy to move around the house to keep him in the action.We haven't used the mobile attachment, he isn't really that interested in it, so we just keep it off.I would have given 5 stars if the frame was a bit more sturdy. Overall, a great chair for a little one, not sure how it will hold up over time, but then it was not that expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for longer and heavier babies as well","review":"My son is 5 months and he is taller than most babies his age. We had a different bouncer before but he was just outgrowing it so fast. So I decided to buy him this one. He enjoys being in it and loves to nap in it with the vibration on. He's starting to sit up but doesn't flip over as other reviews are saying. It clearly states in the box and manual to NEVER leave your child unattended while on the toy. This really helps you save money from buying another bouncer. Like I said great bouncer for a baby that is longer than other average babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not support babys head from the sides","review":"This rocker is cute but does not support babys head from falling to the side. Not suitable for infant. My baby is 11lbs. When he sits in it his chin touches his chest and it looks uncomfortable. Im sure he will grow using it but not now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little chair","review":"I purchased this rocker when my daughter was 4 months old as a replacement for her bouncy seat, as she was wanting to sit up more and look around. We have been very happy with the rocker except for one main issue; when your child starts to be able to sit up unsupported, ALWAYS have the kickstand out, my daughter, like many of the other reviewers here have mentioned, could have easily flipped over in the chair while strapped in. All in all, a pretty good product, the cover is washable and it has held up well so far to hard use. My older daughter (2 1/2) also likes to sit in it when the baby's out, so it is getting plenty of use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it","review":"Our son loves laying in the bouncer. We love the bouncer because we can carry it in any room to keep him occupied while we need both hands for dishes and such. We also like how it can double as a chair and a rocker. We use it as both very often.One con though, what is the deal with the backwards cow head? Mine is located in the middle and is still backwards, I think I am going back to BRU to see about a new one if mine is defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"This is a great baby seat, it is very sturdy which makes me feel confident that my baby is safe when he is in the seat.

I liked that it had two postions for the baby to sit and that it rocked. I bought this product for the intent of having a chair for my baby when he was older. Now that he is older I had to take the chair away from him because he can tip it backwards. He tries to sit in it (which he is very good at) and if he tries just the right way the chair can tip fully backward. Overall I love this seat for an infant and happy that it was washable for those diaper leaks. Just be careful and watch when your toddler sits in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just set this bad boy up this afternoon and my son already cant get enough of it.

When he joined the family we used it all the time , he has reflux and the vibrations made him sleep better , but he quickly out grew the bouncy seat in length and weight ! By 4 1/2 months old I was regretting buying that particular bouncy seat and began looking for something that could be used longer and still had the vibrating option . I started my search on Amazon and found the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker and ordered it right away ! I love how it can be for a baby and toddler , I have a 2 year old and 6 1/2 month old baby, plus it has the vibrating feature the baby loves ! Both boys love this chair it is well used in our house ~ I would and do tell my friends with babies and who are pregnant about this seat , I wish I had bought this one fist !"},{"rating":"2","title":"great seat","review":"I love this rocker for it's versatility. We borrowed one from a friend and had to buy our own because we loved it so much. When my baby was new this rocker was her most favorite place - more than the swing, bouncy, etc. Now, at four months, she still loves. I haven't gotten to the stage that some users are complaining about so I can't say if we'll have trouble then, but for now I love it. My favorite part is that my 2.5 year old can also use it. When our son was a baby he ruined the bouncer by bouncing in it like a madman once he got a little older. This seems much more durable and both my kids love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had this chair for my son and vowed I would never buy it again when I have another child. This chair was only good for rocking and it seemed most of the time I had to do the work... if the child throws himself back, it doesnt give or spring back like a normal bouncer would. The stationary part came handy sometimes. The hanging toys didnt seem very entertaining. They come off when pulled, seemed that they can only be slapped around."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CHAIR!","review":"Perfect for little people from newborn to toddler! This chair is SUPER durable! It worked for my first until she was about 4 when she got too tall for it. I just got another one for my second baby due in May. This chair is so much better than the bouncers that only work up to 15lbs or so. And so much more sturdy! As far as I am concerned it is a MUST have for any mom/mom to be. I really can't say enough about it. Totally awesome chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"improvement for walkers","review":"The glides are a huge improvement over the common tennis ball glides.

She provides exercises to go along with her musings and these are delivered with a healthy dollop of quite encouragement and belief. This is a complicated little book - sometimes I had to read her musings two or three times to get the most out of them.

I've tried it every night and every nap time for over a month, but it hasn't helped a bit. He does seem mildly interested in playing with it as a toy, but he has never fallen asleep while listening to it. For one thing, the volume is WAY too loud for a soother and there is no volume adjustment. Also, the light bulb is non-replaceable, so eventually you'll lose the lighting feature. Finally, it's not safe to keep anything in your infant's crib due to the risk of SIDS - so what use is the remote control?

She fell in love with it as soon as her parents put it in her crib. She quickly learned how to push the button to turn on the lullaby and put herself to sleep. The song and Pooh's voice are very soothing and comforting. Having a remote to turn this on from the hall or another room is an added bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light Sleepers - Forget It!","review":"While this toy is cute, it is much too loud and does not have a volume control. We received it as a gift for our 9 month old baby - it hindered her sleep. She plays with it during the day and likes to turn it off and on and watch the stars light up. But, we never use it at night. It was particularly disturbing to our 4 year old who shares a room with the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light sleepers, beware!","review":"I know that a lot of people love this toy, but I think it is too loud to be soothing. I let my daughter have it in bed for about a week, and it woke me up in the next room every time it went off. I am a light sleeper, though, so it might not be a problem for everyone. Sometimes it woke her up, if she just happened to bump it in her sleep. I also think it is too heavy to be a good baby toy. I let my kids play with it as a regular toy, but by the second or third song I'm always pleading \\"Turn it off!\\" I just find the songs to be annoying. I was disappointed, because I'm a huge Pooh fan, and I had heard such great things about this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing Me to a Temper Tantrum Pooh","review":"I bought this when my daughter was about five months old, mostly based on the great reviews it got on Amazon. I was hoping it would help her get to sleep. It did nothing, she hated it. We tried for several weeks. It got to the point when she heard it go on she started screaming. At that age too she was getting to the point where she could accidently pull it on to herself. Maybe if I tried when she was a little younger it might have worked.I gave it two stars, because it is a cute toy, the voice and the song appealed to me (if not my daughter) and it seems well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing-Me-To-Sleep-Pooh","review":"I purchased this product for my grand-daughter when she was 2 months old. Mom had BIG trouble getting her to stay asleep. With this sing-me-to-sleep-pooh, she put her in her crib, turned on Pooh, and she went to sleep for the night. It was a God-Send for her. She is not 16months old, and still goes to sleep with the music. So, I thought I would get one for my house, as I have 2 grandchildren and 1 on the way. This is an EXCELLANT product.Barbara McIntire"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"We bought this toy for our son when he was about 6 weeks old, and he hasn't slept a night without it yet!!!! Before Pooh, he would cry everytime we put him down in his crib at night. After Pooh he goes to sleep within 15 minutes of putting him down. He's now 6 months old and we won't even go on vacation without it. The best part is that Pooh has a remote control so we don't have to bother our son when Pooh stops. We can just push a button from another room. It's wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now our son can operate Pooh by himself and when he wakes in the middle of the night, he puts himself back to sleep by listening to Pooh. I highly recommend this item!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it :)","review":"I was looking for a lightweight lotion with sun protection that was cruelty free.

Plus, the batteries have a lifespan of a few hours more than the conventional alkaline flashlight sitting in your desk drawer. I really like this lantern, and it is a good emergency light for your home.I have 2 problems with this thing, however. First, the battery compartment is kind of hokey. You have to put it in your lap, hold the base with one hand, and twist the bottom with the other hand. Out comes a plastic battery case held in place with some velcro. Talk about easy to break or lose (hey, son, what happened to the battery holder? Uh, well, it sort of broke, so I tossed it...). The other problem is that the bulb is that harsh, blue-green color that is kind of painful to look at directly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck finding parts","review":"The lamp itself isn't too bad, but when the flourescent bulb went out the only place I could find the replacement was the coleman site.

The high setting comfortably illuminates a 12' x 12' room (especially at table height or higher). The medium setting is good for the same size room if just general lighting is required. The lantern is a little heavy with all the batteries loaded, but the build quality is very good. I would highly recommend this light for an emergency or camping light and as a safer alternative to the traditional gas lantern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for power outages and camping, safe","review":"What a great lantern.

Can't wait for Jaffe's next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...","review":"...so little fulfillment!This book had an interesting sounding plot, so I gave it a try. What a mistake. It was incredibly poorly written and had a plethora of characters introduced with no backstory and little character development. Neither of the main characters were likeable. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings--could have been much better.","review":"Now I know why you should always read real reader's reviews before buying. The concept of this book is great. The lush setting and potentially interesting characters all made me eager to read STARGAZER, but, much to my chagrin, it turned out to be a bodice ripper in disguise. Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down. Jaffe has a way of pulling you in, making you need to know the outcome of the story, despite the annoying \\"love\\" scenes that appear at every turn. If Jaffe had kept to the mystery (or even left a bit more to the imagination withthe lvoe scenes), it would have been a much better novel. We \\"get\\" that Ian and Bianca are sexually compatable--let's move on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"The characters are unlikeable and unbelievable; the love scenes are contrived and the plot is poor.

Well, guess again!This is a barely acceptable historical of the bodice-ripping kind, with vile characters, historical gaffes galore, and plot holes as big as the Grand Canal -- which is about as close as you'll get to Renaissance Venice reading this tripe. Don't waste your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor reading.","review":"All I can say is I'm glad I borrowed the book and didn't buy it to keep. I felt Jaffe's characters lacked believability and couldn't make myself like them or want them to get together. They were very one dimensional throughout the book and they never seemed to learn anything about themselves or each other as the book progressed right up to the last chapter practically when everything resolved itself. This was totally unbelievable. I could barely make myself finish the book. As for the setting, I have no desire to read any other books placed in that time/location based on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groan.","review":"I wasn't impressed. The plot was very contrived and the characters just didn't seem real to me. Their emotions seemed all out of whack with their experiences. And the heroine's sneezing becomes this big plot point-- it's all kind of silly.I hope the young author took the money and ran with it, because it's nice to see an author who makes a mint. But I hope next time she gets an editor who is willing to challenge her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow and far to sexually graphic","review":"Unfortunately I found this book hard to follow. To many characters and I kept going back pages to figure out who was who. To me the love scenes were almost pornographic! I do not want that much detail! I also did not really figure out why the women got murdered, a bit confusing. However, I did enjoy the Italian location and the development of the characters and their relationships. I believe I would enjoy another book by Jaffe (perhaps about some of the brothers), but again without so much explicit sexual scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book was a struggle to finish, and to think I paid for the hardback!

Could not finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"the stargazer","review":"Well I have to agree with the negative reviews of this book. Being a faithful fan to historical romance novels and giving an author a chance, I reserved judgement till the end. This author did everyting possible to make not only the characters unreal but also very unbelieving. I am one of those readers that cant put a book down once stared and even though the beginning gave me a headache which lasted the few hours it took me to finish it, I was so disappointed. The actual time period wasnt revealed till the very end and I think Ian and the Bianca where really ignorant, everything kept repeating itself and the flow of the book was so unreal. I was disappointed till the end, but once I read that this was Jaffer's first novel, I let up on my disappointment. Lucky for me this is the only book by her in the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant.","review":"I was somewhat trepidatious about purchasing this novel, knowing that publishers occasionally oversell new releases that are underrated to say the least. Jaffe's is not - this is a romance novel worthy of defining a whole new genre. I can only imagine the readers who were unimpressed lack the imagination, sensuality and joie de vivre to fully appreciate it. This is a must buy, as I am sure her next one will be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it enough to finish it.....","review":"A very strange, disappointing debut. The plot had potential but the writing style was gawky and awkward. The hero and heroine were totally incompatible, plus the fast-moving plot was too complicated to keep track of. Lots and lots of secondary characters to sort out and a see-through mystery plot. Try again, Michele: this just didn't make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sneezed me to sleep...","review":"Whenever I read a five-star review of this book where the reader gushes by saying: \\"Beautifully written,\\" and/or \\"historically accurate, lush, vivid, etc.,\\" all I can think is that Ms. Jaffe has a lot of terrific friends out there, or that these reviewers have never read past Jackie Collins. The Stargazer is FAR from beautifully written or well-crafted, (Hello point-of-view???, hello style? Hello good writing???) and the editor knows it. But a Ph.d and long, flowing hair that holds a curl do make for a nice package. Alas, Kathryn Lynn Davis (a Pocket romance author who truly is a word-artist) has a new book coming out soon and I'm thrilled about that. I really wanted to like the Stargazer, but it's so poorly written, it's offensive. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"After seeing all the adds for this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Maybe it was because my hopes were too high that I was disappointed. I felt the plot was implausible. The two main characters are presumably very intelligent people. Then why do they come up with the silly scheme of the heroine pretending to be the hero's betrothed while he tries to figure out if she's a murderer? Since the whole book was based on this premise, I could never get into the rest of the plot. And, unfortunately, their love scenes weren't romantic. In fact, I felt the plot was manipulated so that more sex scenes could be added. Ms. Jaffe did do a good job with the seamy scenes with the villains, but I'm afraid these well-drawn characters didn't make up for what was lacking in the hero and heroine. I'll probably wait until I get some feedback from other readers before reading the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+! One of my favorite romances ever!","review":"This book was scruptious. The mystery kept me guessing, the setting kept me drooling, and I don't think I will ever forget Bianca and Ian. I can't wait to read more enchanting books from this wonderful new author--I only hope they can all maintain this high caliber of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's what I get for buying a book for its cover!","review":"This book contained some of the worst writing I've ever seen published. The scenes were choppy and unrelated. The characters were flat, and even then they were inconsistent. The tone of the book switched from page to page so you never knew what you were to be feeling. The sex was jarring and emotionless. I won't even mention the lack of (or perhaps disregard of) historical research that was evident. I threw my copy away so no one else would have to suffer at my hands. If you want a good historical romance about Venice try Susan Wiggs' Lord of the Night."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"This is one of the worst written novels out there. The characters are unbelievably 1 dimensional, the plot is so cliche, and the story is implausible to say the least. I bought it for $2 on clearance and now I know why it was in the clearance bin. Its not even worth the $2 I paid for it. Its an utter waste of time and trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a mess!!!","review":"This \\"simply\\" has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I can say that I seriously considered dropping this one in the trash! However I perservered and found this: an extremely choppy mess with a rushed onset-pressing an excessive amount of secondary characters before we had even been introduced to the primaries. \\"Simple\\" me had figured out the killer after the first introduction to the cousin and the ending was long-overstated with a blunt ending of the harsh herione finally saying the \\"I love you\\". At first I was excited-the setting-Venice-rare not your typical \\"ton\\" atmosphere. I was extremely disappointed about the form of the text-shocked the author is a Harvar graduate-seen better writing in high school. The reasons I gave it one star-the scenery-sadly wasted on this book. Too bad she couldn't have applied this discription to the characters. The sex was hot-but if I wanted strait erotica I would have picked several other authors. Overall-\\"Simply\\" disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"Having just read, Judith McNaughts' \\"Whitney My Love\\", which I would rate 10 stars for content and thorough enjoyment, The Stargazer was a BIG disappointment. There was no romance, not even kindness coming from Ian so how a gentlewoman of that period could find lovemaking with him so enthralling is beyond my comprehension. The highly descriptive lovemaking would seem more in tune with a Hustler or Playboy magazine. I do applaude a first effort but I would rather a bit more romantic hero instead of one you'd like to punch in the face!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the ending half way thru the book to get rid of it.","review":"Jaffe tried to write in Amanda Quick style and failed miserably. I'm surprised Amanda gave her writing such kudos on the book jacket. The story was disjointed.

The heroine responds. \\"I promise to keep this information like a sacred trust in my bosom.\\"Pleeeze! The book was impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should have Left it on the Chair!!!","review":"Thank God this book was given to me (and about 2000 attendees) free of charge -- I now wish I'd left it on the chair and never brought it home. After all the hype I fully expected a lush, wonderfully written book -- what I got was a disjointed and cliched plot with some of the worst POV glitches, grammar and punctuation problems I've ever seen. Not only a disappointment because of all of the extravagent hype, but also because this woman's educational credits indicate she should know better. It is tragic that wonderful writers who have truly earned a hardback cover are being passed over for a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing!","review":"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this novel. I love historical fiction and used to live in Venice, so was really excited to receive this as a gift. Sadly, I was disappointed from page 1. The characters were weak, there were too many secondary characters, the plot was predictable, clumsy and slow-paced, and Ian and Bianca's \\"I love you, I hate you\\" got old really quickly. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they wanted a cure for insomina."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different read","review":"The Stargazer had a wonderfull plot, and I have to say I loved the book. Though I do admit the beginning was kinda well...lets say it could have been written differently. The Charaters seem a little too \\"oh so there's a dead body here, oh well.\\" I believe that their emotions could have been a bit more dramatic. Yet I couldn't put the book down. As I got into the novel it did get better. Though sometimes confusing the book was great to me, and I love Ian's family they were a funny and witty group. All in all, i give it two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good present","review":"I bought this as an x-mas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it.

Most studies done on this tragedy blame torpedos which had weld issues which could cause them to leak fuel in the subs silos thus causing them to explode.

The plastic connectors were so broken that I was unable to determine the shape they were supposed to be in if unbroken.

Then when you compare the filter to the pic on the box, it is not right as well, supposedly the pic on the box shows a black plastic casing around the white filter, NO, i didn't see anything like that, the filter is just one piece of cotton, the sides have mesh on them but no casing at all!!! Then I tried to fit it to my old volvo and not sure if my air intake casing warped or this is the wrong spec, but when i inserted this i had to use duct tape to tape both ends so no small openings would appear!!Bottom Line: IF I DIDN'T LIVE IN CANADA AND IT'S A HASSEL TO RETURN THIS, I WOULD!!

It covers all things balinese and more. It covers more than just the tourist stuff and talks about music, art, religion and the islands people. One of the best parts of the book is about the photographers mobile studio, which shows great photos of dancers and musicians. The book is from 1987, but does not seem dated.

Some of their articles are just wrong. For example, its article on absinthe states that it can cause convulsions, blindness and even death. But, although absinthe was vilified in the past, no evidence has shown it to be any more dangerous than ordinary liquor. Its psychoactive properties, apart from those of alcohol, had been much exaggerated. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, when countries in the European Union began to reauthorize its manufacture and sale. It is now legal for sale in the U.S. There are many other examples of misinformation throughout the book.

It's screwball comedy, erotica, some black humor and some bad taste all rolled into one, but it works and it is great.

It would cost me MORE to get my money back than to just forget about it.The supplier is responsible and Amazon is also responsible for this. The ad on Amazon was misleading.

Lame, lame, lame. Buy the individual titles separately in my opinion. Limited edition my foot! The reason it's a limited edition is because when the 6th movie is released on dvd they'll make a 6 film 'limited edition' set to replace this current one.

Quite the opposite. There are even more parts of the stories cut, which makes this set more of a made for commercial TV presentation.If you want \\"the rest of the story,\\" I guess you'll have to buy it piece by piece.

The DVD game is entertaining, but after playing the GameCube/Wii video games, it's clunky and awkward to play - it's still nice to have, though. The trunk comes with several extra goodies such as stickers and beautifully-made bookmarks. The trunk itself is smaller than I initially expected, but it comes with everything and the quality is good, so I am not disappointed.

However, the 2nd disc (Chamber of Secrets) did not work. It seems that only the music and background noise made it on the disc but not the actual voices. I am very disappointed as it must now be returned and the price is substantially more than I initially paid for it, not that I would purchase it again anyways due to the poor quality. Also, I appear to have received the Canadian version, so Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is now Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Very weird.

We also recently bought a blu-ray player and so we went searching for this extended version of the movie. What we found was this collection of 1-5 that promised \\"Additional scenes\\" for every movie. Don't be fooled. The \\"Additional scenes\\" is the same package of \\"deleted scenes\\" that comes with every Harry Potter movie. There were no additional scenes in the movies themselves.

It's a pretty neat set up!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Set but box broken","review":"Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Edition Gift SetAn amazing set and my adult children both LOVED all the goodies included.One of the boxes was split open on one edge of the trunk so that is not very sturdy,especially if your a collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter DVDs","review":"Love the DVDs of Harry Potter...great price, easy to order, came in just a few days. Made a wonderful gift for friend. Thank you Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Collection - A Harry Must","review":"This is a great set. I really enjoyed the series and anyone would likes these will enjoy buying the set. It's also very space saving. The discs are slim and fit nicely in the collection box which saves a lot of room instead of the individual discs which are bigger and take up a lot of space. I also like the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter DVD","review":"Harry Potter Years 1-5 DVD box set is a great addition for movie collection. I bought this as a gift for some family members and they love it. DVD's come in a box, with each dvd in a slender case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin' Deal","review":"Came in great condition. Had no problem whatsoever with the 5th DVD like many others said they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Gift Set Bargain","review":"The gift set came out in mid December 2007. The imitation leather box contains the 5 DVDs and several goodies including collectible cards and bookmark tokens. The DVDs include games children will enjoy.The best part was Amazon's price. You get all 5 movies for about $18 each. I held a Harry Potter marathon movie week and we watched a movie every night for a week. The continuity is better that way. It's also great to see the actors growing up across the years. Life is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Box Set","review":"I know many people want to wait for the box that will come out after the 7th movie, but as I want to watch the movies again prior to 2010, this made for an excellent hold over until then.The box itself looks and feels like an old piece of luggage and there are lots of fun things inside. Each movie comes as a two disc set enclosed in a case resembling a text book. There are two extra \\"books\\", the interactive DVD game and an disc full of Harry Potter extras (various short documentaries for each film).In addition to the DVDs, the box also contains trading cards and bookmarks. The cards are very cool, but the bookmarks are the highlight of the extras. They are of metal construction and are very detailed. There are bookmarks of Hedwig, Harry's Broom, a Golden Snitch, Gryffindor Shield, and Voldemort's Prophecy.If you don't want to wait until after The Deathly Hallows or you just want a really impressive set to collect, I highly recommend you pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing 5th movie","review":"I just sat down to watch the 5th movie in this set and unfortunately what was in the package wasn't the movie, but \\"special features\\". Which means either I have to exchange the set and try my luck again (looks like this is a common problem with this set) or I just fork over more money to get just the 5th movie. Very sloppy to be selling something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Disc 5","review":"I received this set missing the Disc 5 movie (it came with the special features disc instead). I had it replaced only to have the same problem again. Very poorly distributed by the manufacturer. I would not recommend this set until they have figured out the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the stand-alone blu-ray disks...","review":"This set is bizarre and seems thrown together from an odds & ends bin of spare parts. Inside the exterior \\"trunk\\", the disks come in two different sizes of folding cases that do not at all resemble a product family. You're really stuck storing all of the disks in this case forever because none of the disks has sufficient labeling to be on the shelf by themselves.For uniformities sake, I'd much have preferred to buy the 5 blu-ray disks individually- especially knowing that another three movies will have to be purchased to complete this \\"set\\" in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The replacement is also missing the fifth movie","review":"I sent in a question to customer service asking if they could just send me the fifth movie by itself. Instead of answering my question, they just shipped me a replacement. Now I have to ship one of them back, or be charged again.In addition, the replacement is also missing the fifth movie. For the love of [insert deity here], nobody buy this until the problem is fixed! There are a lot of people here who have been disappointed. It would probably be more worth your time to spend the extra money on each individual movie, or just not buy them at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering the unknown","review":"it inspires courage and quick thinking...kudos to the writer, producer, director, actors and all that help develope what is known The Harry Potter book and movies...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Imperio\\"","review":"What does it means?

And this amazing box gives every thing that you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good packaging, alright movies.","review":"I'd never seen any of the Harry Potter movies before I got this box set, I just never gave them a chance.

If it were standard box set packaging, I'd give this series 3 stars, but I like the little suitcase packaging, it's well made, so that bumps it up to 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better check your set...","review":"because I just received mine and it was missing Episode 5- Order of the Phoenix!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described in reviews","review":"Movies arrived fine, undamaged, but I bought 1-5 instead of a more current set because I wanted all the extras that were described in the reviews. Not the trinkets, necessarily, but the extra interviews and behind the scenes additions. Came with nothing. No trinkets, no extra scenes at all. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out - check these immediately! 4 out of 5 won't play at all!","review":"I purchased this set in December 2009 to have on hand, but did not watch them immediately. This week, in anticipation of the final film's release, we wanted to go back and watch all the previous ones at leisure. \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" was fine, enjoyed it. The next night, we popped in \\"Chamber of Secrets\\". Locks up just starting to play. We messed with it for a while, checked on possible software updates to the player, etc. Finally watched the DVD version which I also had. To make a long story short, four of the five disks will not play. The newest player (LG 3D model) does nothing at all. An older Magnavox BD player just tells me that playback may not be enabled for this disk (!?!?!).

It is advertised on many sites as being full HD, but the 16 bit sound is good it could be 100% better with Tru HD sound. But nonetheless it is a great buy for a great price!!! DO NOT buy these films seperate.

I opened the first case and it was split down the spine, otherwise good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Blu-ray case and disc","review":"I adored the movies and have been looking to buy the first five in bluray format for a decent price. So I was really upset when I received my set yesterday and there were only four cases in the box. The Sorcerer's Stone case and disc was missing from the set. I bought the set from vendor NorAm International Partners, Inc. and fulfilled by Amazon. I ended up sending it back today for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"5th Disk Missing","review":"I've had the same problem as the last few people. I had the \\"special features\\" disk 5 instead of the movie itself. Upon calling Amazon and speaking to someone on the phone, they are conveniently \\"out\\" of the boxed sets for an exchange. But when I go back in as a new customer on the website, I'm able to buy the set again and they have it in stock. I think they know what's up and just don't want to send out another faulty set to someone who already complained, but for a new customer, they don't mind sending them the faulty boxed set.Anyway, they offered me a full refund if I ship the product back or a 20% credit ($7) to my account and I keep the set. I took the latter option and wanted to let everyone know they are offering the $7 credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story - mispackaged","review":"I ordered this set on January 6th, before most of the other reviews had been posted, and I had the same problem as many others - my disc 5 was the Special Features disc instead of the actual Order of the Phoenix movie. I wanted to exchange it (hoping that the problem had been corrected since so many complaints had been lodged), but the automated email that I just received from the Amazon returns department said that it's no longer available. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, great upgrade","review":"i got my set today, i sold my 1 - 4 boxset over a week ago on amazon and i got 50 bux, the box is awesome it comes in, and all the dvd cases are very nice, i really like the bookmarks...i only checked out one of the dvds so far which was prisoner and it looks amazing. i had to check out my favorite scene where the dementors come inside the train, and that looked beautiful then i checked out the scenes in the snow cause snow always looks awesome in hdand if any of you were wondering, there is no dual layer skip on the part where harry is using the map and snape catches him, i always hated that on the standard dvd"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Double Dip","review":"If you already own the SD version, get rid of them.Get this gift set (got mine on sale at Best Buy for 100bux) and I am not disappointed.I watched one and 2 and the picture quality is a lot better...not as much noise and grain in the pics and when you pop in 5 you can see how much better the film quality has come since the first one.The Audio is great if you don't mind waking your neighbors....Now to answer some of the questions: these are NOT Combo disks...this is HD DVD format only. Are there extra features? Plenty and even a bonus disk with even more extra content.I will when time allows watch the 5th disk with the In movie focus feature....But either way if you want the best Potter experience...get this set...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for fans, meh for non-fans.","review":"As the title implies, non-fans should really just get the stand-alone set. But for extreme fans (Such as myself), this is an extremely neat collectible set. Yeah, the Blu-Rays aren't in regular cases, but that's fine because I never use the bloody things anyway.Basically, it's about $10 more for a really neat box (Big enough to hold all the HP collectibles you've gotten so far), some of the nicest bookmarks I've seen in a while, and some trading card pictures. Completely worth it for fans, but... Non-fans may want to reconsider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"This is an excellent product that was well worth the money.

It came in perfect condition and he loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wash, Rinse, Dry, Repeat......NO DISK 5. (Deja vu?)","review":"Well I will keep it short because it seems 15+ other people that ordered this product had the same problem. NO DISK 5, it is just the special features. So basically the info for this product should read as such: \\"Harry Potter Years 1-4! And a Harry Potter themed Frisbee that you have to pay for! Wooohoo!\\" Regardless, I did not file a complain due to the fact that I know there would be no resolution after reading everyone else's comments, and I will just use it for the first 4 movies. All in all, if you do not have the 1-4 this might work fine, but if you wanted a cool gift set of all 1-5 look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says","review":"The cover says Harry Potter 1-5 but the 5th year DVD didn't contain the movie Order of the Phoenix.

SO!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why haven't they sold extended versions yet?","review":"I think i speak for most harry potter fans that the extended versions of the movies that they show on tv are better. Personally, I own all the other movies and have them in two-disc editions and they don't even put deleted scenes on the second disc, except on the third one. Are they just going to keep repackaging each sequel as a box set with hours of HBO specials without ever selling the extended versions of the movies? Warner Bros. should take a page out of New Line Cinemas Home Entertainment and sell a boxed set with two-disc versions of the extended movies as was done with LOTR. That in my opinion would be a good marketing ploy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Clip Show","review":"It just shows clips from the movies.

Similar to others, I was disappointed that the first two DVD's were in different packaging, but I mostly care about the actual videos and we enjoyed watching them very much.

Realistically they won't be available in Blu Ray either as all the old fashioned optical disc delivery formats seem to be inevitably doomed to fail. However if like me you have a HD-DVD and you are thinking of getting your money out of it in the short term, this box set is the one. All the films are fabulously transferred to HD and the latter ones feel even better. My next task is to keep my HD player safe as in a few years I suspect I'll not be able to get a replacement to watch these films if it gets knackered.

Disc 1 was so scratched up, it looked like someone had let their cat use it as a claw-sharpener, and the 5th disc was only bonus features. Amazon apologized & replaced it promptly, but the 2nd set I received also had a 5th disc that was only bonus features. After realizing this was a common complaint, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, to which the WB manufacturer (address on box) has not yet responded. False advertising, unprofessional? You be the judge. I just found out this set of discs is no longer being made. Hmm, I wonder why?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mispackaged.

Bloody brilliant!!","review":"Packed in five slim-line Blu-ray cases and housed in an attractive box, this Harry Potter box set fits in nicely with my steadily growing Blu-ray collection. All the movies have been given the standard Blu-ray treatment: interactive menus, in-depth interviews and features, along with stunning, razor sharp images and crystal clear, Dolby Digital True-HD sound. It's the stuff that Blu-ray is known for and it's been put together quite nicely in this fabulous set. If you're a fan of Harry Potter, you already know the movies. But, if you already own a Blu-ray player or simply need an excuse to buy one, this is a great set to get you started in viewing movies in their true HD glory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter gift set","review":"We were interested in obtainig the Harry Potter DVD's.

Of course the movies are excellent; blu-ray rocks. I was pleasantly surprised with the packaging though. Each disc is in it's own sleave (with a minimum of plastic, thank you). The extras are great also. There is a DVD game (you can play on your DVD player with the remote), a wizard card collection (OK, bit of a yawn here) and a collection of five bookmarks. The bookmarks are high quality metal and should last several lifetimes of reading to future generations of HP fans. I would put a $20 value on the bookmarks alone. My only gripe here is, where do I get the matching bookmarks for books 6 and 7?"},{"rating":"2","title":"HD Harry Potter Years 1-5 Box Set","review":"A great collection of HD Discs with a impressive case that houses many extras.... well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost...","review":"Almost as awesome as the three wolves T-Shirt, but not quite.

I saw order of the phoenix in a state of the art digital theater and this doesn't look any different. It has the same picture and sound quality that hundreds of thousands of dollars of theater equipment did. Money well spent in my opinion.

I of course called Amazon, and they are expecting me to mail the entire set back instead of them just sending me the last movie. Even though they are sending me a free mailing label, I'm still going to have to trot down to the post office and wait in line which is an inconvenience.

It's not clear exactly what the hero, James Lee Wong, did for a living, but he was a Federal employee, possibly of the Treasury Department, and a graduate of Yale. Because the stories are short, there is virtually no character or plot development, and they tend to plod along fairly pointlessly and then wrap up in a quick paragraph. Decent subway reading -- if you have a 20-30 minute commute you can read a story per ride -- but that's about it.

It's about three friends who get dropped off on an uninhabited island in Indonesia for a month, with reef breaks firing all around them. Lots of cool barrel shots and other footage. Anybody who gives this review less than five stars is definitely a kook. This video is a must. I own over twenty surf vids and this is definitely my favorite. There's only two turns in this movie and then the rest is barrel riding. However, the waves, different angles, and the way they set up the camera to capture film inside the barrel is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scond Thoughts","review":"Way out ride of a dvd with the best surf footage for the year.

This DVD doesn't have the best airs, cut backs and radical surfing expected with new DVD releases. Instead it has a fantastic insight into 3 guys who challenge Indo's remote islands in search of perfect barrels/waves. It's nothing like survivor as mentioned in another rating/comment. It's a story of pure freedom and the determination of pursuing something they love doing. It's not about money, competitiveness nor fame...just pure enjoyment and freedom. It's a fantastic DVD and it's truly inspiring/uplifting. Anyone who rates it below four isn't a true surfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Havent seen a good title for my GBS in a hot one","review":"Finally I found a game worth my precious batteries' litle lives.

I think all of her movies are awesome and worth watching over and over again. I don't understand why the films in this set were chosen. I don't think they are her best work but they are good non the less. I think movies like: The Island, Lost in Translation, and Match Point would have made a better collection. Even though those weren't the movies chosen, this is still a good collection. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. Girl with a Pearl Earring is very good movie as well as the Good Woman. Scarlett can pull off other time period very well. Not to mention that she is sexy while doing her acting roles. I haven't seen American Rhapsody yet but I'm sure it doesn't fall short.

After a batch of spaghetti sauce burned to the sides today I came online to check other reviews and see if maybe this one is defective or has broken. Interesting to see other reviewers also saying theirs is too hot. We may keep this to cook in when we're there to stir frequently but we'll be looking for a true slow cooker too. If you buy one of these be careful and test it when you are on hand to stop the process if it runs too hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My point of view.","review":"Skillfully written and wonderful vocabulary and phrase construction.

While \\"Hardcase\\" is a fairly enjoyable thriller, it's yawningly predictable and simply not a worthy effort for a writer of Simmons' talents.

As a matter of fact, I read it because of a recommendation here.I have to admit, I'm a sucker for the hard-boiled school, as this book certainly is.

They're fast-paced, witty and violent.I do hope Mr. Simmons writes some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcase","review":"An open letter to Mr. Dan Simmons.Dear Mr. Simmons: Please stick to horror novels and leave the PI stories to writers who understand the genre. Your novel Summer of Night is one of my favorites. But Hardcase has more holes than a 20 year old bucket. Why would anybody give an ex-con like Kurtz the time of day, much less quit their old job, give him a millon dollars etc.... And do not forget that in the first of the book Kurtz was looking for a missing accountant. After the accountant's wife is killed you never hear about him anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like To Read Comic Books, You'll Like This Book!","review":"According to author Simmons, readers are supposed to like to read about a \\"hero\\" who committed a revenge killing, served eleven years, and now comes out of jail to be an unlicensed \\"investigator\\" who knocks bad guys out with a sap, breaks legs, and kills without thought or remorse. It's okay, though...these bad guys are all trying to kill him! He is such a \\"nothing\\" character that I almost wanted to do him in, myself. If you like mindless action, gun-talk, might-makes-right, and a little sex thrown in, this is your tome! Beats me how anyone reads this author...but some people eat chocolate-covered grasshoppers too."},{"rating":"2","title":"On your mark, get set, kill.","review":"Hardcase by Dan Simmons could be thought of as hardboiled crime fiction on steroids. The action is not merely violent, it is brutal with a take no prisoners attitude.Former PI Joe Kurtz has just been paroled from Attica after a rather long stay. His first act as a free man is to hire himself out as a stalking horse for the head of a western New York crime family whose fortunes are rapidly dwindling. This is a novel with a very fast paced, action packed narrative. The body count mounts up at a dizzyingly accelerated rate, with no shortage of new and improved ways of dispatching the ever shrinking cast.Does Hardcase qualify as great literature? No. The plotting, though not without some unexpected twists, is contrived and not believable. The characters are generally over-the-top stereotypes who lack nuance.

His thriller \\"The Crook Factory\\" was as good as it gets.Then came two clunkers in a row, \\"Darwins Blade\\" and now \\"Hardcase.\\" Both suffer from the same shallow chaterierisation and lackluster plots. Hardcase's tale of an ex-cop/con working for a crimeboss lacked both the color and complexity we've come to expect from Simmons. Regrettably, Mr. Simmons seems to be writing in the hopes of selling to Hollywood. The book reads like a lame star-driven action piece.Come back Mr. Simmons.

This book is dangerous, because it presents the view that cocaine is great, not addictive, and that very few people will ever abuse it. These days, we know that approximately one in 10 people who ever try cocaine become addicted to it. I am all for responsible drug use, but assuming that most people can use a drug like cocaine (daily, no less!) and be okay is a dangerously outdated concept. We realized in the 80's with the introduction of crack that cocaine is extremely addictive, even without strong physical withdrawl.

I don't believe in censorship but would make an exception in this case. If I ever find it at a library I shall check it out and burn it to save others the fate of seeing it. No research about akitas was preformed before publishing obviously and I don't think the person that wrote it even likes dogs. To top it off the writting is horrible.

One of the reviews said this is not the saw for the home handyman. I couldn't disagree more--this saw almost makes tile cutting fun, and when all is said and done I know I will have saved thousands over hiring out the many small tiling jobs I am facing in my home.

I was only cutting 1\\" thick cultured stone and ceramic tile with it.I am not sure what Dewalt is trying to accomplish by cheaping out with this saw, but it is very frustrating to be in the middle of a job and have a brand new saw die. I can see wanting to saving money if you can, but the saw needs to work. It's too bad because the features of the saw are great and for the money, it did everything I needed it to do. It's a shame so many companies are going the wrong direction to save money. You are only alienating the people that buy your products. Or used to.

It is attached at the top by a noninflating section and flips over and should attach so it stays down on either side. I could not attach it on both sides, it wasn't wide enough. Perhaps I should have tried to attach it before inflating, but I think it would have just popped out anyway.

Its cute but not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !!!","review":"I have read the other reviews of this swing and feel they do not do justice. This is the best thing we have for our baby. He loves it even more than his shaking chair! When he got his first set of vacinations, nothing could calm him down. We tryed everything, then we put him in the swing. He calmed down and finally went to sleep! It rocks him gently, and playes nice music to sooth him. He loves to sit in it and watch TV with us, or to fall asleep at night. I would recomend parents or soon to to be parents to buy this or put it on a registery as a gift idea. The baby will love it as our did! I wish they made a swing for bigger baby's so we out grows it we can get him another, it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter LOVES it!!","review":"My daughter is 4 months old and LOVES this bouncer! She's got the portable swing and the cradle swing also, and it's great to have her hop around from one to the other so when she's bored with one, she can find the next one fun!I love it because the colors are bright and she loves the bubbles and sounds.I also love that it keeps her entertained while I do things around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad to see they fixed it!","review":"I wrote an old review when my now one year old was almost killed in this swing. I would like everyone to know that this swing appears to have been fixed. The mesh is SOOO much smaller and I now see no problem with it at all. With that considered. I would HIGHLY recommend this swing, we LOVED it until \\"the accident\\" which was caused by the high mesh sides on the original version. I am sure that most of the old reviewers would agree with me. Please pay attention to the most recient reviews on most baby products because although the company may not issue a recall, they will go back and fix the problems as long as there were no deaths attributed to their product. (No matter how many NEAR deaths there might have been) Frightening isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low speed is too fast!","review":"I was so excited to use this swing with my newborn. I figured it had 8 speeds so speed 1 would be fairly slow. Not the case as someone else wrote and I agree that the swings speed is too fast for my newborn. I love all the lights and music but this swing just is not healthy for a newborn to be in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing!","review":"My 4 week old loves this swing. Shw can either sit in it and watch everyone around her, or she just stares at the dangling items on the sides. The swing is a lifesaver! It is the perfect speed for my little one. I don't know what I would do without this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it","review":"The one plus was that Babies R Us returned this for me with no problems.It was difficult to snap the metal bars together correctly. Then, when we finally got it working, even the lowest speed was WAY too jarring for our newborn. Her head would slump all the way over no matter how I put her in the swing (why don't they make some kind of a headrest, like they do for car seats?) I tried propping her head up using blankets, etc. but those just got in the way, slipped off, etc.Then, the plastic joints (where the fish/water are on the sides) came loose and we could not get them to hook back in. They would just slip apart and the swing would come crashing down - clearly defective.Finally, when I was \\"folding\\" up this swing to return it, it was still quite bulky.I obviously wouldn't recommend it, and didn't buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Swing in the World","review":"I was excited when I bought this swing because it's portable, light-weight, takes up little space, and has lights and music and toys. But, it has turned out to be a pain in the neck. When my son is sleeping in the swing, his every movement hits the toys, which make noise and wake him up - so I cut the toys off. It's also VERY difficult to get the baby out of the swing without hitting his head on the overhead bar. It's also easy for baby to stop himself from swinging - my son just grabs the bar all the time. And the worst part - my son has flipped himself out of the swing twice, even though he was strapped in !! So he has to be completely supervised while swinging. I really don't recommend this swing - it's not all that it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"We bought this yesterday and have a 4 month baby.1. gear sound is too noisy2. speed 1 is too fast3. baby seems to be very uncomfortable when she takes a nap there (head/face is always down).therefore, we will return it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"Please consider buying a swing with shoulder straps.If you must have this swing, NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER leave your baby alone in it, even for a second.My son tipped over in this swing while he was bending to look at the lights.He was secured with the waist straps and is not too big or too active for the swing.This swing is just not safe, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Swing","review":"This swing does not have enough support to keep the baby centered - my son's head always falls to the side when he sleeps and bangs into the side poles when the swing goes back. It is too bad because he loves the lights over his head to look at - but I am unable to use it because it is just not safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe on swings so much that I have 3!!!","review":"Yes.... I have bought 3 swings for one baby... 1 at home, 1 at my parents and 1 at the nanny's. They are all different, but I think I would have bought the take along one, if I had known better... unfortunately, it was my third.The swing is also known as the neglect-o-baby. I think that is if you condemn epidural, the microwave and formula feeding... I love my baby with all my heart, but there is so much arm-rocking you can do. She did go on naps for extended periods of time and I didn't mind. She now if 6 months old and it is less and less interested in the swing as time goes by.This is, from now on, my present to all my friends having babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"mesmerizing but uncomfortable","review":"Our daughter loves the lights & toys, but the seat doesn't recline enough for her to stay centered in the swing. She ends up drooping over to one side & her head smacks into the hanging fish. We got the swing when she was 2 months old & now she's 5 months & there hasn't been a stage where she has been able to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"Slowest speed is kind of fast. It's hard to get baby out because it swings.Baby likes much better the kick n play bouncer.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing","review":"This is a really great swing and worth every penny we paid. We just wish we had it with our first son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"This swing is wonderful!! Our 8 week old daughter loves it. The size of the swing makes it perfect to move around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It For The Lights!","review":"I have returned 2 now for the light going out in the third position after only a month's use. I called Fisher Price to find out if I can change the bulb, and you can't! I then complained to them that for $65+ it would be nice if all 4 lights stayed on after a month's time. I am going to be looking for a different swing which is sad because my son has loved using this one. He likes being able to pull on the fish and turn on the lights and music. It's a great swing except for that little problem. I just think for that kind of money, everything should work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would think twice about recommending this","review":"because....My little guy could not sit without being squished. The seat does not recline back AT ALL which means you can't put a baby in it until they can hold their head up well. Even after that, if they fall asleep you are back to the slumping head. The only reason I bought this product was because it was such a good deal (on sale) but, I would never pay full price and am even debating returning it! Its really a shame because most Fisher Price products are so good but, stay away fromo this one! Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"8 soothing speeds? Try a variable control that produces more like 2 speeds. And, the swing moves as if it's in slow motion even at the fastest setting. There's only a 3 point harness, which is bad for newborn infants.I'll be returning for a refund in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"We used this product one day and the motor broke. By looking at it, I thought it would last at least a week or two.Our baby girl just loved it too. What a disappointment!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it","review":"Our daughter LOVES her swing. We chose this one because we don't have a lot of space for the larger swings and we travel to Grandpop's and Gamma's home a lot. Once I figured it out, it was easy to fold up and throw into the car. Our daugher will sleep for hours in this...a feat only accomplished at night and when she naps beside or on me. Without this, she would only take brief naps and I could get nothing done. Plus, she would be a terror without the sleep.My only reservation is that we have been using it for about 3 1/2 months and the green light has gone out. I am trying to find out how to fix that and hoping that the others won't do the same.Overall, well worth the money - I never thought it was too expensive - and a great addition to my daughter's activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for taking along!","review":"My son loved his bigger aquarium swing, so this was ideal to take along when going to other family member's house. Folds up nicely and easy to carry along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with Design","review":"Would not recommend this swing. Sure, portability is nice but so is ease of use and safety. Everytime I try to place or remove my son from the swing, I hit his head on the bar. Also, placing him in the swing can be a challenge since it is not steady...if he is fussy and kicking, that makes it all the more difficult to safely place him in the seat. Also, he doesn't like the swing...maybe it is my frustration....who knows. I wish I would have kept the box because I would be returning it! My neighbor also bought one and she is having problems too. Her son has flopped out (even strapped) of it on more than one occasion. Once they are big enough to grab the upper bar...forget about using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swings too fast, bad angle??","review":"My child gets frustrated and nausated on this swing. I think it's because he's tilted back too far and it goes too fast. He does much better with the side-to-side swinging motion of his ocean aquarium swing. I had big hopes for this swing but my baby really dislikes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!","review":"If I could have, i would have rated it ZERO stars. I bought this swing for my daughter right before she was born because we needed a small swing(small apartment) and this one seemed great. One big selling point was the 3-position handle. Even to this day Fisher Price's own websited and catalogs advertise a 3-position handle however if you call when your handle doesn't move they will inform you that it is actually a fixed handle and they just advertise it as a 3 position handle. My daughter is now 4 months old and toog big to get her in or out without bumping her head o the handle. She can't reach the toys 75% of the time because the handle doesn't move like it's advertised to and the lights are in such a bad position when it swings that her eyes almost roll back in her head when she swings forward. If I'd known the handle really didn't move I don't know that I would have bought this swing. Now I'm not sure I can trust Fisher Price/Mattel anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"Very hard to get smaller baby in and out of it (It tends to swing). My daughter is 6 months old now, weights 16lbs and it can't even handle her. She wants to sit up more and this thing is just too flimsy to hold her, most of the time, it looks like it's just about ready to buckle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this review before you purchase this item....","review":"Our son fell sideways in last years version of this swing and receive a small red bump on his forehead(because his head got stuck in between the white part of the swing and the back blue bar). I have since returned the swing to Fisher-Price for a full refund. The three point harness is not very sufficient for smaller babies. You have to end up packing blankets around your baby to keep him/her from falling from side to side and hanging toys(which are not removable) tend to whack smaller babies in the head while swinging. The lights and music are very entertaining. Good Luck with this one. Hopefully this version is better, although it looks exactly the same, just different colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exchanged swing 3 times b/c lights wouldn't work!","review":"We loved the Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing and knew that we'd be traveling a lot. So, we tried our luck with this swing--boy, was that a mistake! We have exchanged this swing 3 times due to one or two of the lights not working. It's really hit or miss as to when they would burn out, b/c one of the swings the lights didn't work when we first assembled it. The other two have burned out after only a couple days use-maybe an hour's worth of usage. Fisher Price has really disappointed us with this product-definitely not the quality of their other products.I suppose that I should also comment on the handle-once baby gets taller you'll have to remember to push the handle all the way back in order to get baby out without bumping their head. I learned this the hard way. The sad thing is that there really isn't much of a selection for travel (or smaller swings) so we have just kept this last swing even though the blue and yellow lights don't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy napper","review":"My baby 5 mths love this swing, he pulls on fish and enjoys lights and music. The bar moves forward and back ,so when you pick up baby he doesn't bump his head. It folds easy and is lightweight. He loves to nap in it. The only issue is the 8 different speeds are not needed and the 1st speed is just right.And you can't move baby room to room in it like instructions says, its too heavy and awkward! But I reccomend this one over the others since it is compact and portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!","review":"Warning, my sone got his head and arm stuck between the sides and since it does not cradle a baby very well, he has fallen forward as is is moving!!I returned it as soon as he fell forward! he just doesn't sit right in it, there is NO support!Doe not fold up as small as I thought and the construction is not sturdy. over all, I was increadably disapointed for a Fisher Price product."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud","review":"I purchased this swing since my daughter (11 weeks) will only sleep in her papasan swing, and I didnt want to have to move that from room to room. Well, the swing works ok, not a lot of power. The real issue is that it is loud. It makes a clicking sound that when there is noise in the room is not that loud, but when it is quiet at night, wakes her right up. The papasan swing is soooo much quieter so we are just going to purchase another for our bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this swing!","review":"With four kids I've had just about every swing out there. None of which compare with this one. Everything about it makes it so much better. With everything you need with a baby, anything that takes up less room is great! Comfy, Cleans easily, looks great, and you can't beat the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One light not working AGAIN!","review":"I received this swing for my baby shower (I registered with BRU). I LOVE everything about this swing EXCEPT that ONE light doesnt work! Of course (as per instruction booklet) this product isnt consumer serviceable. I purchased it again and returned the other one (two different days). Everything was fine, all lights were working. I threw out the box. Sure enough, a week later one of the lights is broken AGAIN! Instead of continuing to return/purchase now that I'm missing a BOX I have to call them. Considering that someone else had a problem with their customer service, I'm a bit leery."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the only swing you need","review":"We received both this swing and a full size Ocean Wonders swing for our baby. Although we enjoyed the full size one immensely, this one would have been enough. It is so easy to move around the house, and it was a lifesaver for trips to the grandparents and for camping before our daughter was mobile. She loved the lights, which was something the full size one didn't have. The seat was very comfortable, although we do not use swings for sleeping. It folded up very easily and fit in the back of our SUV very nicely with much other gear in tow."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"Great product. Puts baby to sleep right away. One of those things I didn't think I would need but now know I couldn't live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I think this swing really came in handy for the times when I wanted my hands free. My son falls asleep everytime me or my husband put him on it. He usually stays in his swing without being fussy for an hour or more. If it wasn't safe, I wouldn't have thought of putting my son on it. It's safe, with supervision of course. I'd recommend this swing to parents that want a small, travel-pack, and affordable swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good while it lasted (for my baby)","review":"This was a life saver the first 2 months, but then I guess the novety wore off and she began to hate it.The product is portable,lightweight and was the only thing she slept in (but I needed to change the batteries often as my daughter was heavy in weight and needed it on full power to get the full swing.. she was born 11 lbs and used it up until she was 15)I can say I didnt like sliding her under that overhead piece, being it was so low to the ground it was a bit uncomfortable. She did seem too impressed with the lights/music and dangly fishesLike I said though, It was good while it lasted !! With a newborn you would take whatever baby naps you can getBut The battery life (when using it daily as the \\"main swing\\") is low.. atleast when you are swinging a chunky baby.. I ended up then replacing this on with the nature swing papasan.. she only liked that one for a week!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny !","review":"We just bought this swing for our 6 week old because he loves motion and loves being rocked in the glider at a \\"fast-ish\\" speed so we thought he'd like a swing. We picked this one b/c we really don't have space in our house for a full size swing. So far this one totally keeps his attention. He stares at the little fish swimming in fake water. I keep the swing on the first speed which seems already fast to me, so I can't see using the other 8 speeds. He is 11lbs and the swing fits him perfectly. He is very comfortable in the inclined position. I can't speak for the other parents on here that said the swing is flimsy and uncomfortable for their older babies b/c it leans too far back. But , I'll tell you what, if this swing helps us get through the \\"fussy\\" times for even just a couple more weeks it will be WELL worth the $50 as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its moments","review":"I have to say that this item is wonderful at times when it comes to keeping my 3 month old occupied. She really enjoys the lights and soothing music (which sometimes manages to sooth her to sleep) Unfortunately when I want to move her from the swing to the crib I end up waking her up because its so hard with that huge bar in the way! Its a miracle I havent hit her head yet. You also have to be careful not to run into it too hard, that happened with mine and now it doesnt want to swing at times unless i push it around a little. Also when it comes to smaller babies make sure to keep an eye on them, i placed the swing on its lowest speed level and my daughter was swinging back and forth like crazy, you have to wait until they're at least ten pounds for it to work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Tellin Lies, It's That Bad","review":"Only in the eighties could such banal buttrock have been recorded, thank gOd this band has disappeared into the black hole that swallowed the whole horrible movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"I bought 2 of these to check the room temp/humidity and the temp/humidity in my guitar case.

Gordis is a gifted scribe and a keen observer and the story of his family's life in Jerusalem reads more like a novel than a mere memoir or journal. He brings to the task an incredible depth of knowledge of Jewish and Israeli history, but what is most striking is his devotion as a parent and how candid he is about his struggles, both internal and external. Even if he were just sharing his observations, it would be a fine read, but Gordis's real talent is finding connections between things: between past and present; between global politics and his own dinner table; between ancient texts and today's headlines. Those often brilliant and surprising associations are what lift this book to the level of literature and make reading it such a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific insights","review":"This book opens up to us what it is like to live with the existential crisis Israelis live with every day.

I used to not care about this so much, but now I don't expect every game to work right away. How tragic.-The graphics are excellent. I was very impressed.-The game is very original. Resources like water and rice that grows make the game more interesting. The unit alchemy is a very new concept. Horses are really cool in the game.Cons:-All in all, the game wasn't all the fun after a while. I just went back to playing Civ 3 and Dark Age of Camelot.-The battles, though they look cool, are not fun to fight.-The resource cap is VERY annoying.-The unit alchemy system means that making all of your peasants into the top unit is really all you need to do to dominate. There is no reason to diversify your troops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern software","review":"Terrain Graphics and Unit movement Ai are good, but that is about it. The concept of unit alchemy, which is where a unit trains in one building and then another to become more powerful is fairly unique but little else is offered. UNit graphics and animations are dull and uninspired. The game has bugs and little balance. The sound and music are pathetic albeit amusing from time to time. The interface is a crime against gamers. There is a fourty unit population limit and the game grates along slowly anyway. Players are limited to four towers, which are far from impressive. Battle gear and other upgrades can be aquires just like unit alchemy, but fail to make up for the glaring shortcomings of this game.Overall Reveiw. 2 Stars and a waste of money.

That was all that was great about the product. Battles, which take forever to prepare for, are pointless because you have no control over the units once you right-click attack. The unit alchemy system, seemingly innovative, is just an Age of Empires clone with units instead of buildings. If you like great visuals and standard RTS fare in disguise this game is for you. If you like good games, don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Revolutionary Game!","review":"This game is WAY FUN! It's different than a lot of other strategy games because you can train each unit into something else, or just augment it with special powers, which is ESPECIALLY revolutionary. I would recomend this game to ANYONE who likes PC Strategy games just because of the new way of playing a strategy game that you encounter. Instead of turning the units out cookie cutter style, it makes you realize that they are little pseudo-people who require different types of training.May favorite units were the Werewolves and the Master Warlocks. I subtracted a star because I thought if could've been cooler if each unit had an experience level, and it could advance into something stronger, like for Werewolves it could've been SilverBack Werewolf, then BloodFang Werewolf or something, you know?Anyways, the game pretty much ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Brilliance","review":"Battle realms for the PC is a work of tactical masterpiece. The graphics are the best i have ever seen in a strategy game. The variety in the 4 clans is really cool, offering the best and most differed gaming experiances since Starcraft. The multiplayer leaves a little to be desired, but if you are not a huge multiplayer and enjoy a little bit of point and click gaming, Battle realms is a breath of fresh air on the PC and over all, is hugely enjoyable and alot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"As a physician who is interested in working for MSF, this documentary gives an insight into what the lives of the doctors working for MSF are like.

I've put the book down after completing just the first four chapters. Although it seemed to be moving at a fast pace, to me it totally lacked any form of depth in regards to its characters.The story line she chose is a good one, and with that I feel she could have expounded more on her characters interaction with each other right from the beginning. As hard as I tried I just could not get into the characters, they seemed so unrealistic. Their words and actions were almost laughable.The only way that I will finish this book is if I have absolutely nothing else to read. If you simply go by the back-cover you will more than likely be duped like me into purchasing it. Don't do it if you haven't already...stop and reassess the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible but not likely","review":"This book has great possibilities with its storyline and characters, unfortunately that's about it. I found it hard to get into this book. Before the first few pages are over, the characters (complete strangers) are all over each other and it's a little difficult to understand why this even happening. There is little background to help you understand why or how these characters should come together, except that they're both beautiful. Their actions and conversations were unreal. No one talks in that manner. In addition, the female character got on my nerves. She's got this great guy who is willing to do anything for her and she runs off and acts childish through most of the book. Hopefully the next book will be better plotted and thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be Mediocre, Maybe...","review":"I was not impressed with this book at all. It wasn't very well written. \\"A beautiful house painted white like the White House.\\" What kind of description is that? Real creative! And then there's this one: \\"She entwined me in her arms and kissed me.\\" Entwined? Nice. Obviously someone found the 'thesaurus' function on Microsoft Word.Basically, if you want to read a book that is no more special than any other book out there then go ahead and buy this one, but I'm sure you could find something better at a lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book was increadible! I could relate to it in many ways, so it was a nice easy read for me. Only took about 3 hours because I couldn't put it down. Mr.Lindor wrote the characters in a way that really made me feel like I knew them. I was so wrapped up in it, when the ending came, I was honestly upset! The cover picture is eye catching enough without the title, and goes to show that you really can't judge a book by it's cover. Very well done and I look forward to reading anything else he writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every boy scout needs this publication","review":"This is that book a 12 year old boy reads and it irrevocably changes his horizon.

My wife is a fiddler, plays lead fiddle in a band for Irish ceili dancers, and sometimes sings. Several other musician styles were in the concert series I recorded.The ATM450 compared, in response, favorably to my others (CAD M37). However it's sensitivity is such that a singer must be at least a foot back from it, or p's are disturbing, and distortion may occur. Over a violin, it lays neatly 4 to 8 inches above the strings, and picks up a full sound.The soft mounting clip helps a bit, but not really well designed for shock absorption.I expect to buy at least one more."},{"rating":"2","title":"gary's review of audio technica at450 microphone","review":"I was looking for a microphone that would work well to pick up the barrel of a clarinet. Studied lots of microphones and pickup patterns, microphone types on line. I decided on this microphone because it has a cardoid pickup pattern, and what seems to be an adequate amount of sensitivity to pick up the barrel of the clarinet from about 4 to 5 inches away from the instrument. I probably could use a little more sensitivity, but am concerned about feedback problems, being in an extrememly lively sound stage situation. I tried it at home with an amplifier and small speaker, but have not given it the acid test, which is on stage.

Though he blazed new trails on television and stage, the Hollywood studios could not provide a memorable vehicle for this truly great actor. \\"Frankenstein 1970\\" (1958) represented the worst of a largely forgotten lot. Portraying an atomic-age, Nazi-scarred version of Baron Frankenstein was an opportunity Karloff should have avoided. The only interesting aspect is the bizarre \\"twist\\" ending - if you can wait that long. Happily, the 1960s would provide more rewarding film roles for Karloff, culminating in his masterful triumph as Byron Orlok in \\"Targets.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I love this movie!

But, Cuba Gooding CANNOT carry a film ON HIS OWN, especially one which has NO REAL PLOT,NO BACK-UP STORY,NO OTHER ACTORS OF NOTE, ABSOLUTELY ZERO! He is NOT a Lead Actor whatever his fans may say and I am sure he has many. He is OK in a secondary or third role BUT NEVER as the lead. It's NOT that the story of a supposed Conspiracy with Middle-East and US Government involvement has been 'overdone', as it is always an interesting one if played right BUT this was played wrong, lacked action, and also that certain 'oomph' to make it a success?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this film.","review":"I expected much better from Cuba Gooding.

I'm still using the first one and haven't yet needed the one in reserve. It's very light weight, when opened doesn't lock sucurely into position, the gripper cups won't close too firmly and so on. Next time I need to buy such a thing (and they all wear out eventually) I'll go to a different source I found on the internet. On that site such items are more expensive but I'm sure much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping costs more than item!!!!","review":"Silly to pay a little over six bucks for something you can pick up at the hardware store for about the same price, then pay nearly eight bucks to have it shipped.

Also the handles don't really get hot to touch even after long time cooking on a gas range.If you're asking why I went for 4 stars instead of 5, so here are the reasons: the frying pan already got scratches even i never touched with steel utensils. For those who are looking for a perfect one-piece steel pot, this isn't the one.

It is easy to use, well laid out and has a wealth of interesting, useful information. Most of the photos are very good. We like being able to find birds by color, a very helpful feature. However, it covers most, not all, the birds found in central Wisconsin. One bird at our feeder was not in this book. Also, the binding is very poor. After just 2-3 gentle uses, a section of pages are falling out, requiring gluing. Not happy about that, wonder what it will be like after a few months? Otherwise, we would recommend to all novice and intermediate birders in Wisconsin."},{"rating":"2","title":"birds of wisconsin","review":"Very good reference book.I have it on my window sill.Seen alot of the birds in the book in my area.

The size and pics are well done and the book is packed with info & easy to use. If you have small children who are interested in birds this book is a good choice. It only takes a few seconds to flip through the color coded pages to answer-\\"What kinda bird is THAT?\\" It will fit easily in the diaperbag or your pocket while walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mathew Swain, 21st Century Tough Guy","review":"I first read two of the books from Mike McQuay's entertaining Mathew Swain series about ten yrs ago and I have just recently been lucky enough to have found the entire set, which I am in the process of devouring right now. These books showcase what I like best about Mike McQuay's writing: his incredible facility for writing snappy dialog and deft touch with similies and metaphors. I can still quote, verbatim, descriptions of his from his novelization of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. The Swain series has even better use of language.Here is a sample, \\"Sometimes when the wind blows just right and the summer rain steams the streets like the last foul breath of a concrete dragon, the smell of death rolls down from Old Town and hangs over the living like a hammer over an anvil--waiting. There's life in death, I suppose, the knowledge of the rind makes the melon sweeter. But then, I suppose a lot of things. That's why I make my living solving other people's problems.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Repressed memories","review":"Yeah, I read this a long time ago too, and repressed the horror, the horror of this story.

Two thin, fit young men rolling around in the lichen and killing stuff--it's unseemly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you want","review":"The one-star rating is merely to draw attention to a problem. The top line in the little box that displays the purchase options - new, used, paperback, etc. - will divert you to an item that is the LIBRETTO ONLY. Nothing describes it as such, and all the reviews on the new page refer to the full score. The cover design is different, but I figured it was a different printing. It doesn't help that Amazon erroneously describes the full score as being part of the Dover Vocal Score series - though, if the vocal score with piano reduction is what you want, they have that, too. (Fortunately, the Dover cover design is fully legible in thumbnail.) Just be advised that until this situation is corrected - Amazon, are you reading this? - you'll have to do some sleuthing to find what you want and be extra vigilant to make sure the right thing ends up in your cart. Despite my complaints, I have to give Amazon credit for making the return and refund process super-easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I'd read this sooner.","review":"As a novice teacher, I read this book with vigor during my first break. It contains valuable information that I wish I'd known before I started. I'm sure all teachers eventually figure out what works for them, but it would be great if every new teacher could carry this book in his pocket during those first trying months. It's nice to know that most teachers experienced frustrations, questioned their choice of profession, and wondered if they would ever be able to juggle the tasks required of them. Unfortunately, this book tries to answer all the questions at once, leaving the reader with reassurance that they're not alone, some good general suggestions, but few specific solutions to common problems. It's good--but I wish it had gone further. Also, my editon contained many typos and seemed tied to specific local school policies and procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left wanting","review":"At first, I was skeptical about the Eberron setting, but after trying it out - it was enjoyable, albeit different. I was looking forward to this book to find out more information to use in a campaign. Unfortunately, the book is mostly filled with the same information from the ECS presented in a different format. Sure, they include 1 prestige class per nation and some NPC stats and monsters - but the world was left just as vague. The power group and cultural information is definitely a plus to have - no other books have successfully detailed this before. Thrane was the most underdeveloped portion of the book though and if you want information on specific portions of the landscape, you'd be better off making it all up. Of the nations, Aundair and Breland are the only ones that have decent details on the geography. Bottom line: good for skimming, but no real meat to pour through anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic, emotional book","review":"I've read this book on and off the past 6 1/2 years. Jenny Jones wrote a very moving book. She has survived a lot of the things put against her, even that one secret crush show that her talk show was sued for. I commend her for going 12 years with her talk show, which ended in 2003. She managed to get better at hosting it, even through some of the tired infidelity shows. The rocky relationship with her mother is strongly mentioned in this book. There were several well written chapters, even the court chapter that occurred in Michigan. This book told me the real Jenny Jones, as told from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was wonderful! It was almost more like a novel than a biography.

This novel depicts her struggle from childhood to adult life. Jenny shares both her triumphs and tragedies in a plain but interesting manner. I was particularly touched when she shared about losing her elderly parents. I can certainly identify with this from my own family. It is a difficult time. She proves that anything is possible if you want to do it.

The key is difficult to insert and remove, it is not a smooth feeling and you have to fight it to get it in or out, and visually the key hole looks like raw cut metal with jagged edges. It looks like a piece of crap on the mailbox!It's working temporarily since it's (only slightly) better than the lock that was being replaced but it's going in the trash as soon as I go to the local home hardware superstore to get a different lock.The product I received for ordering this \\"EZ-Flo\\" lock was a Guard Security mailbox lock part number 127/5 and nowhere does it say EZ-Flo so maybe I did not get the product that I thought I ordered.

Looking forward to Sharpe's next book coming up soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"First off, I want to say that I love sport movies, and so I had high expectations for this one. The reviews looked good, so I gave it a shot. It is HORRIBLE. The acting is atrocious, and the coach is just downright mean. Halfway through, I stopped caring about the coach and the team, and I was just waiting for something good to happen, to change my mind. But nope. This is the worse sports movie I've ever seen. Thumbs DOWN!!! I'd give this NEGATIVE 5 stars if I could!!!I'm all for someone working out his/her personal demons, but not at the expense of others, ESPECIALLY kids. The world is hard enough without someone like that in a position of authority. And the swearing is too much. It just makes him sound uneducated. Awful. Awful.

I got this to go with the new West Bend horizontal bread machine I have and the two go together well. Its been fun making homemade bread for the family. There are many good healthy recipes, and some less healthy ones in here. There are bun recipes, sweet bread recipes, hearth breads, bagels, english muffins, sourdoughs, sticky buns, danishes, donuts, cakes, pastas, etc. Some are easy and some are more advanced and alot in between. This book is very complete and could keep you busy for quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was disappointed in this one.

She is just perfect for her role as an older, expectant mother. This story is very heartwarming. It is about a family that is blessed with a surprise just when they thought their lives were in order. Although the movie was made in 1979, it fits nicely into today's world - a world with too much violence - and reminds us that love and caring are still the most important values surrounding us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hot!","review":"These get way too hot, it burns to the touch. Different than older versions, stay away from these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half stars","review":"This is not one of the disco legend's better albums, even though this CD reissue of Call Me contains additional remixes of several of the songs. There is some stylistic variety: a short gospel song, He'll Understand, and a passionate soul ballad, One Night Only. Good Feelin' is another soul number with an interesting arrangement and impressive vocals. The trouble is that the real disco songs lack catchy hooks or memorable tunes. Too Late and Power Of Love are great for the dance floor but not hit material. The album's saving grace is Sylvester's high-powered interpretation of the old classic Band Of Gold, quite a spectacular disco version, and even more so in the stunning remix. Unfortunately it shows up the lack of melody in the other songs. Sylvester's best work can be found on his Greatest Hits compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Concert","review":"Now en sonido e imagen la compania CODISCOS es lo mejor en ell mercado.Dieguito Gale y su sello SALSA-POWER, I'm telling you is the THE BEST en sonido ,imagen y de to'.Este concierto de Tony Vega en Colombia esta bueeeeeeenisimo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the Saga","review":"_In Chancery_ is the second of the novels in the first Forsyte Saga trilogy.

Usually bound together with \\"Awakening\\", the interlude that binds this book generationally to _To Let_.Discovering the world of the Forsytes has been one of my delights of the year.

Bought it to try to get better connection speeds from my computer. Description says: \\"Enables data transmission up to 10 times faster than an ordinary phone cable\\" This is a total fabrication. In fact speeds went down by at least half. I got better results for a cheap phone cord. But it was free since I signed up for the Amazon credit card so i'm not that upset.

He includes lots of history about paranormal occurrences and research, but in no particular order.I was disappointed, given the the title of the book, that only the last two chapters are actually devoted to psychic detection (one of them being on the specialized field of psychic archaelogy).Overall, it reads like an interesting collection of paranormal occurrences throughout history, but by no means should it be used as research material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this product in New Zealand for $NZ30.00, which is approximate to $US10.00. I was very disappointed in the amount that I had to pay for it. The last track features some excellent fiddling by a violinist and 'Song for Ireland' is very nicely done, but tracks such as \\"Will ye go Lassie go\\" were very poorly done. This song is a very mournful song, but Celtic Spirit played it as if it was a joyful, alive song, which wasn't appropriate. The voices that back up some instrumental pieces sound mechanical and computerised, as do the violins that back up other pieces. If you are looking for Celtic music, try \\"The Corrs - Unplugged\\" - all the instruments on this CD are real and not computerised."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the LOOONG version.","review":"Bought this movie for my wife.

It would have been much better in Chinese with subtitles. The English dialogue sounds so phony much of the time, and the characters seem so plastic. This is an epic story, but it lacks real human emotion, perhaps because there was just too much of a story to fit into even a LONG movie. It probably should have been a trilogy, so that the characters and their experiences could have been explored in more depth. The scenes of the Forbidden City were very interesting, especially since I just got back from seeing the real thing, but otherwise I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE COUNTERFEIT JUNKY IMPORT!","review":"This is NOT the Artisan Release.

The songwriting is very campy and silly. The arrangements remind me of Queen only less original. It's comes off as pretentious. The lyrics are as though the author really wants to inform the listener of his deep inner struggles, but that nothing that bad ever really happened to him. It's like reading Dean Koonts when your in the mood for Kurt Vonnegut. This record is just bad fiction.

It is simple and great at the same time. However, even after you master the 1st book, you won't be able to make a jump to the 2nd book so easily. It seems a this point a lot of information not covered in the 1st book is assumed and learned. I found the exercises confusing. I already knew the C Major scale by heart long before I got to this book along with the other scales. However, I found the number exercises located after the c major scale to be confusing. The book just doesn't eloborate where it needs to. Very disappointed in this book.

Get a propane unit first of all, second of all, get one with the knobs on either end, and not side by side - those stick, won't adjust, and are horrible as well. I went through the entire Coleman catalog so I could help you. Learn from my mistakes.

Sometimes you are directed to make a copy of a page so you will have enough pages. There is only two pockets to keep receipts, etc. Each section does have very detailed questions to ask vendors, photographers, etc. Instead of putting theses within the chapter, they should have been in an appendix so you can easily locate all the questions. My advice is to buy the Emily Post Wedding Etiquette book (which I did) and find another planner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Proper and Well-Planned Wedding","review":"This planner guide is beautiful. I love the binding since it is easy to browse topics without the book flipping closed. It covers various information and check lists that are useful to first-time brides (or mothers of the bride). I appreciate the simplicity and the inclusion of Post's infamous manners to help me plan a proper wedding. The big drawback is that the book is so crisp and worth saving as a memoir of the planning process and 'big day' that I am timid to write in it and make full use of its pages for fear I'll mess it up.

The author presents everything as a complete success story and never deals with the reality that there will be rejection. I quite honestly had trouble reading the book because it was just over syrupy sweet with every story/example ending with a teary eyed made for TV movie revelation. Like I said there are some really good points and yes Christians should be getting their butts out of the church pews and making a positive impact in the world around them, but we have to be realistic.

Many city names were left off and locations had to be noodled out from other maps.Better maps are available in my study Bible, so we also used these.The Lutheran Study BibleBut the kids had to make presentations, and these maps helped them quite a bit.

As I grew up, I mostly forgot about the old songs my mother used to play. This especially since my brother \\"borrowed\\" all of the old LPs, and has never returned them to her. Nonetheless, I devote a little bit of time to finding the old songs for my mom. Artists like Juan Legido, Los Gemelos del Sur, Blanca Rosa Gil, and Raphael are her favorites. This was a great find. Very few artists capture the \\"Gallego\\" spirit like Juan Legido. Worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"window glide","review":"This product did not work for us.

He has created a story while decent has no basis in how the Coast Guard actually operates. I have been a Coastie since 1991 and it was almost painful to read this due to the inaccuracies. If you aren't a coastie, please don't view this as an accuarate view on how the Coast Guard operates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth A Shot","review":"I was hoping that this book would finaly promote the Coast Guard in a deserving and exciting light, but unfortunately I was let down. Being an active Coastie on a 210', I was thrilled to see a Coast Guard fiction book on the shelves. After forcing myself to read it however, I became very disapointed in the obvious lack of research performed by Mr. Hutton, which I need not reproduce, as many other of these reviews have already stated them. It was a well enough story in itself, although there were few areas where I felt \\"caught by the action\\". I have kept the book only because I am an avid Coastie, but if you can mind the multitude of factual mistakes and sometimes slow plot advance, then this book may be worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"The deep blue is the right place for this book","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book due to Mr. Huton's disregard for fact. It certainly would have made better reading if he'd done a little more research. Some examples: 1) A 210 foot Coast Guard Cutter has more than 29 people on it. 2) The 1st Coast Guard District is in Boston, not New York.I didn't get far before this book found it's way to the trash.

It takes the setting to sevral diffrent parts of the US, and deals with the point of views of sevral charaecters, both good and bad.

I immediately contacted AMAZON because at that point I only had 3 days before my trip. I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake. They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly. I did and FOGDOG said sorry, we can only send you the boots if you order, pay for them again and pay for the express shipping. Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase. I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store.

I am not, per se, impressed with the \\"stylishness\\" or \\"femininity\\" of the boot, but these were for warmth and for fun in the snow. Very sturdy, warm and waterproof. Easy to clean.

The point is that you might not be aware of this so-called atmosphere.It's the sound of this cd, especially songs like Kevlar Soul, Stay With Me and Quite Heart. Kent are from Sweden and you can hear that. The singer sings a bit \\"Swenglish\\". But that doesn't give the album an unattractive tinge.This album reminds me of long winters, immeasurable forests and tundras covered with snow. Lots of songs have a melancholy sound, but others rock! The King Is Dead, Heavenly Junkies or Revolt III are filled with guitars!Anyway, I play this album mostly in autumn and winter. It's the sound, the atmosphere. Just try it, I would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweden Rocks!","review":"Kent is a wonderful example of an overlooked band. I believe that they have been overlooked here in the states because of the stupid way our radio stations are all really a part of some corporate conglomerate.If you are willing to be like the English and really broaden your horizions, check Kent out.

Do youself a favor and check out some of the Euro Indie offerings by starting out with Sweden's Kent."},{"rating":"2","title":"better and better","review":"I seem to belong to the few that actually think Kent is getting better and better. I bought this album just because of Kevlar soul -- which may be one the best pop songs I have ever heard -- and discovered that the whole album is really tight. It strikes one of those archaic emotional cords. The end of the album seem a little incoherent but it doesn't matter, the first half of the disc is classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album so far !","review":"The 4th album from Swedish giants \\"Kent\\" is also their best.

Though I hold my tongue. Radiohead's 'KID A' hasn't come out yet.The singer sounds like an interesting mix between Andreas Johnson, Fran Healy and Billy Corgan when he whispers. The phrasing of the lyrics is a little poor, however, and thus the singing sounds slow and a little lethargic. Think of Oasis's 'Girl in the Dirty Shirt.'The tunes on an album are what counts, and gladly, Kent know how to pen a great melody... Music Non Stop is the catchiest thing ever to come from Sweden, and The King is Dead is an opener worthy of comparisons to Planet Telex.Surprisingly good british music from a swedish band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone seen Dead Calm?","review":"I have noticed this with a few Sweet Valley books, but more so with this one.

You may know about European immigrants living in New York or Chicago, but did you know they flocked to Latin America as well? If the answer to these questions is \\"no,\\" you need this book. It is a quick, easy read, covering more than 500 years in a little over 300 pages. Of course, details are sparse, but it is an excellent way to gain a basic understanding of our neighbors to the south.

The author covers types of travel, reasons for travel, accomodations, major historical attractions, the mail delivery system in ancient times, and many other topics. In general, the book is highly informative, readable, and entertaining. Descriptions of holiday travel, inns and restaurants, the Roman road system, the trade routes of ancient times are quite fascinating. In a very few places the book seems to bog down in perhaps too much detail, but overall, the book is quite good. The author's perspective is also primarily on the Western world and the Near East, including Egypt. Thus, other ancient cultures (e.g., China) are mentioned only briefly.

The only complaint is that my baby, who was 7 months old when we got this, wasn't tall enough to see herself in the mirror. She could sit up on her own but she is on the small side so she couldn't quite see the buttons or herself very well. To fix this, I put her in her Bumbo chair and put her in front of it.

My baby slams on the buttons and looks at herself and my toddler sings into the microphone and pushes the buttons in order to hear the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of money","review":"I bought this after reading several positive reviews, but I am very disappointed in it. First, I had to return the first one because the \\"mirror\\" was damaged. Then, when we tried out the item, it is very lame. It only plays a clip of the songs and even then, it cuts out near the end....I guess it is supposed to be a fade out effect, but not fun when you are a toddler and enjoy hearing more of the same not less. Finally, the only reason I was drawn to this item is because of the microphone. Lots of toys have one, but this one had one of its own that you can walk around with and not have to hear the little songs on the unit.....well, it is not even a microphone. It is a rattle. My daughter loves to hear her voice being amplified, I could have done better handing her a hairbrush!!!!! Anyway, not at all what I thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and a Waste of Space and Money","review":"This toy is kind of unnecessary given that there are so many other musical toys out there that are way better.

Almost every child these days seems to have some digital squawk box of some type. But that doesn't make it smart.I would not submit such a very young child to noises this loud or unnatural (electronic). No, it won't damage their hearing per se. But parents must understand that this kind of over-stimulation in a young one's brain has more than a momentary effect; it can have a long-term and adverse auditory affect.Same with the lights. If you have to go to these lengths to capture a baby's attention, what will you do for Act II?How can you expect a child to pay attention to soft instruction/guidance/response from a parent when they have gotten accustomed to over-the-top stimulation?Yes, ADHD is genetic; toys like this won't \\"cause\\" ADHD.

The mirror is already (after 2 mos.) pretty scratched. He hits the mic on the mirror. Otherwise I would have given durability a higher ranking. They toy was a gift from grandpa.

She really enjoyed looking at herself in the mirror and the flashing lights. The songs are cute too, although she doesn't really appreciate them yet. The microphone is doubling right now as a rattle, which she has played with quite a bit and seems to enjoy. Small enough for her to bite on a little bit, but big enough to not really fit into her mouth or be any type of choking hazard.Although she can't see herself when she is just sitting on the floor, when I put her in the bumbo seat right in front of the mirror she can see better. I think that once she starts standing she will love it even more.

It has become one of her very favorite toys, and I recommend it to anyone who has a kid who loves music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy...","review":"It's a great little toy..lots of action, color and music.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy For Independent Sitters","review":"My 9 month old daughter loves this toy. She talks to herself in the mirror and loves the microphone and all of the buttons and music. It is very upbeat and one of the better toys I have purchased for her.Their are 2 downsides. One is that if the baby pulls on it it can tip over. The second is that the music plays continually and does not go off on it's own when it is not in use.Other then that I would never trade this toy in. She adores it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used Toy!?!?!","review":"I ordered this toy for my 6 month old daughters (twins) expecting it to be new.I got a VERY used toy!

Doesnt look like this has happened to anyone before so maybe it was just a fluke?I would beware before sending this to a loved one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"My baby got 2 of these for christmas and at first I thought, we'll just keep them both and put them on different floors in the house, but when I put one together and saw that all it does really is play a little music and has very little activity options for baby, I really don't know what to do with the other one. Definately not worth fifty bucks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the cost!","review":"I heard about this item from a our child's early intervention occupational therapist; she said they used it with many kids and they all loved it. When I saw the price, I was hesitant to get it, but it was so cute and so I just got it. I LOVE it, and it's so worth the money. My little boy is now about 8 months old and he's really starting to enjoy the music, lights, and movement. Before you know it, you'll be singing along with the words yourself! My 3 year old niece also likes it. I'm glad I bought this toy, and I think it will continue to provide many hours of fun in our house! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing several parts! = FRUSTRATION","review":"I'm not sure if this is a function of this new \\"Frustration Free\\" packaging that Amazon is offering, but the Singalong Stage arrived in a generic cardboard box with NO INSTRUCTIONS and missing the screws, 3 AAA batteries, lyrics cards and microphone holder. The irony being, I am now VERY FRUSTRATED!!!! Because obviously, if they had kept the item in the original packaging, unopened, I probably would've gotten all the parts. I immediately called Amazon customer service, and while I'm glad they were answering calls at 9:05 pm CST, my frustration was increased by the fact the customer service rep had a very thick accent (if you want to be offended by that, feel free) and I had to ask him to repeat himself over and over again so I could understand what he was trying to say. I don't have time for that kind of nonsense. Amazon, you might want to rethink this \\"Frustration Free\\" concept!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Wow cannot sum up this toy enouf.

We had one for my older daughter, but gave it away when she outgrew it. We bought a new one for my twin boys first Christmas. They are 9 month old and love seeing themselves in the mirror and dancing to the music. Even my 4 year old gets into it. The microphone is lost already though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Christmas Present","review":"My 8 month old daughter loves this toy. She bounces with joy and coos at the music and her reflection in the mirror, and the rattle-microphone is a favorite teething toy. We leave it on the \\"jazzy\\" music without lyrics, and it's not nearly as tedious as other baby musical toys. (Although I find myself singing \\"shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo-ba-ba, yeah!\\" in my head more often than I'd like.)

She gives herself kisses in the mirror & claps her hands. It doesn't hold her attention for more than about 10 minutes, but she always goes back to it when 10 minutes is up with the other toys. The older she gets & learns the songs, the more she'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun and Magical!","review":"The sing along stage is super fun and magical! My daughter is 9 months old and we sit her in front of it and she is busy for a long time. She loves all the lights and looking at her self in the mirror. The piano keys and the little things that pop up are just great and she smiles when she sees them. I would recommend this toy to anyone. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a $50- toy","review":"This toy is cute but it is basically a glorified mirror with a few lights and buttons that play music. That is all.Now, my nine month old gives it a few courtesy laughs but then she just wants to use it as an item to cruise from, however, the rear legs do not stay on (even though I have applied them correctly) and this poses a great problem for which I will call FP.If you want a great toy, invest in an exersaucerEvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer! I firmly believe that this toy assisted in the muscle development which allowed each of my children to walk independantly by 10 months of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy","review":"I got this for my daughter when she was 6 months old and it was an instant hit. 5 months later and it is still her favorite toy (which is saying a lot because she is a little spoiled and has ALOT of toys). It is sturdy enough for her to pull up and stand the songs are very fun.Unfortunately, Fisher Price no longer makes this fabulous toy. I wouldn't pay $200 for it, but I found mine at a mom-to-mom sale for $10 and a friend got one for $15. It is absolutely worth it at those prices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy has gone through two of my kids...","review":"This toy has gone through two of my kids and they both have loved this toy so much. I bought this for my son when he was a baby and have passed it on to my daugther who is 6-months-old and it was probably the best money ever spent on a toy. It's obviously durable, fun, musical, the mirror allows them to look at themselves (which is important at that age) and also helped them practice to sit unsupported. I'm sad to see that it's discontinued since it's the best baby toy ever made. I wish Fisher-Price would bring it back, or possibly bring in an updated design. Either way I'm holding on to this in case we have any more kids lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!!!!","review":"My 7 month old son LOVES this toy. It is well worth the money if you are considering it but are unsure. He loves looking at himself in the mirror and watches the lights and listens to the music. It is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old and it is a big hit! She discovers new things everyday and will play with it for quite awhile. I think she will even like it better later! I do have one small minor complaint--the mirror scratches VERY, VERY easily--I cleaned with water and paper towel and the paper towel left faint scratches. It doesn't bother her, just me. Overall, I think this is a great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wyatthiggins","review":"My son is 16 months old and he loves this toy.

He was clapping his hands and babbling in minutes after i set this up. My daughter who just turned 2 trys to sing into the microphone. It isn't very loud and it keeps them both entertained for awhile. It is easy to assemble also. I love this toy, great pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPDATE--good at first, be careful later","review":"Great for infant who can sit up on her own--perfect size/height (I chose this instead of a toy piano for this reason). It has 2 modes--one with actual songs, another with just music. Both allow the baby to \\"build\\" music with different instrument buttons, although at nine months my baby is more into slamming everything at once. Clever, fun and sturdy. But also can be overstimulating with the lights/noises/plastic.UPDATE - UGH - AND BE CAREFULNow that my baby can stand and she leans on this I'm unhappy with the construction--it topples over easily, we have to make sure it's backed up against something sturdy. Potentially dangerous, I'm surprised more parents haven't had this complaint. Plus the legs come off quite easily, she can disassemble the entire thing in a snap. The music is still a hit but I'd undo my 5-star ratings if amazon allowed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My daughter bought this for her baby. She absolutely loves it. This year our friend had a baby boy and we bought this one through Amazon.com.It was shipped early for Christmas and arrived in perfect condition. Her baby plays with everything on it.

A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy for a little one","review":"I was able to find this toy second hand for about $12, but it has probably been some of the best money I've spent in a long time. I got it for my son when he was ~6 months old and beginning to sit up unassisted. He LOVES this toy. The songs are catchy, but not annoying. Now that my LO is 10 months old, he still really likes playing with the stage. Now, he pulls up on it, stands in front of it, and bounces to the songs. It's really sturdy and doesn't tip over on him, even when he is unsteady on his feet. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"My LO loves looking at herself in the mirror and this toy is fun for her to sit or stand.

Absolutely enjoys playing with this every day. Her big sister (4 years old) loves to sing along with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter loves this!","review":"I purchased this awhile ago, and it is still one of the first toys she goes to when she walks in the door!

It's just perfect for her now, and the best part is as she grows, she will still enjoy this toy learning to sing and dance to the fun songs! I highly recommend this toy. Good quality, value, and grows with your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirror time","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter for her first birthday. She loves looking in the mirror and trying to see things behind her. She also will use it to stand herself up while she plays with it. The only negative thing is it only has 2 settings, many toys have more than that for a variety of music and learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her favorite toy","review":"This Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage has been my daughter's favorite toy from about age 6mo-12mo (and counting)...The mirror is very large, and she loves that (I guess she's a bit of a narcissist, lol). The sound quality is excellent, and the flashing lights are bright enough. We love that it has selectable volume (2 levels) as well as 2 different modes of play. My only complaint would be that the legs are only held in by one little screw...one of them pulled through so I had to add a little washer. No big deal really, but washers should have been provided as the screw heads are pretty small. With that being said, she CONSTANTLY climbs, bangs, and pulls on this toy (actually she beats the hell out of it) and it has proven to be very durable despite the undersized screws. This toy was $$ well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit with the twins","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old twins and they LOVE it. They crawl over to it and 'play' the instruments and bounce around. They usually make the rounds over to it a few times every day - and it seems to be a ton of fun for them every time. The music gets their attention (though I am tired of hearing it!) and they laugh and smile and babble along. I think we are going to get a lot of use out of this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after two months","review":"My daughter received it as a gift when she was 9 mos old; she played with it for 2 mos and loved it, but then it inexplicably \\"died\\".

If Fisher Price had a customer service department that was even REMOTELY helpful or user-friendly, I might have given this a better rating because she did enjoy it when it actually worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift that goes on giving","review":"I've now bought this for both my granddaughters.

How good is that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!","review":"I bought this when there was a great deal on it around Christmas time for my son! He was 3 months old at the time, so we kept it in the box until about 5 months and I wish I had got it out even sooner! He LOVED it. He is now seven months and sometimes even tries to push himself off the toy to try to stand up to grab the microphone and play and stare at the lights at top. At first when he tried this I was terrified it was going to slip under and he was going to bust his head on it. but nope it stood still on our carpet! Very durable! Also- like another reviewer said, this IS better than a BUMBO! I would always sit behind him or put pillows around him while playing with this, but within the next week he was doing it all on his own for 30 minutes at a time or more! LOVE this toy and would recommend to anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy for grandson","review":"I have received the toy and sent it to Germany to my grandson.

I am very glad that I got the toy for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's o.k., but there are better, more balanced views.","review":"I read the books by Win Worley back in the early 80's.

The highlight of the collection is the short preview of \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" Ritchie plays.

This book is exactly what it is listed as, a CHECKLIST. Don't expect to actually learn anything about the systems that make up a home.

We put the boppy behind him in case he fell, which he did... We love this, but just had to pack it up (he's 9 months now) because now he crawls and it got boring to him. I will say that the previous post had issues with their kid not being able to set the sounds off, well there are two sound settings. One for only hitting the nose and one for movement.

I am really glad to have found a toy the she can play with at such a young age. She has the rainforest musical gym, but all she does is lay there and stare at the lights or look at the chair next to it. The bobbin gym is much more fun to watch her play with at this stage.

He has his records co-written and puts most of his emphasis onto the stage show and videos, creating his gigantic ego. When he gets gorgeous songs liek Angels and She's teh One, the results are stunning; semi-rockers like It's Only Us and Old Before I Die can be equally impressive. When he comes up with Rock DJ, with it's novelty rap an risque lyrics, it can be sen as good entertainment. But this lazy rewrite of I Will Survive, complete with more cod-rapping, is not what a top pop star should be producing. Robbie is basically a heterosexual, modern Elton John-obsessed with his image and flamboyance, and occasionally able to come up with a good tune to back up his writing partner's lyrics. But this is style over substance in the worst possible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"My daughter and I love this doll. We had so much fun shopping for her together.

It got great reviews and since she has a 4 month old baby brother, we thought she may like playing with her own 'realistic' baby. Although Chou Chou is very cute, after batteries were installed, she sounded and acted more like a baby from The Exorcist movie! The doll made very strange noises which are not at all realistic baby noises, and the eyes, instead of closing slowly while being rocked to sleep, fluttered wildly the entire time. The breathing sounded like a grown man snoring! This doll is scary! Her mother suggested taking the doll back and exchanging for another as she said there must be something wrong with it. We watched the online video of Baby Annabell and it definitely sounds more realistic, appears worth an extra $5.00, plus her mouth moves while eating."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Chou Chou","review":"My daughter absolutely loves this doll. It is a little big for a two year old to handle, but now at 3yrs old, it goes every where.

She has taken to mothering this very realistic doll instead of her 1 yr old brother! There are several things I would change, though. First, the bottle has a rounded bottom so it does not sit flat on the table, floor, etc. Also, the baby makes a lot of sounds all the time, like cooing and crying. It would be nice if she were content (and quiet) sometimes. She even breathes loudly when she sleeps.

When Edwina (the name I gave her) arrived, I immediately started to play with her. I noticed right off that she is very well-made, and she is also a tad on the heavy side, giving the feeling of an actual baby. One characteristic I particularly fancied is the fact that Chou Chou is very dependant on her \\"mother\\": feeding, rocking to sleep, and calming her when she cries. Another teaching factor is that this doll doesn't immediately stop crying when pat on the back, or immediately fall asleep with one or two rocks back and forth, showing young mums that a baby requires patience. In conclusion, \\"Rock-A-Bye Chou Chou\\" is a good investment for collectors, and young mums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is the cutest doll I have ever seen. My four year old has had this doll since last Christmas. In less than 2 months I had called the manufacturer about a malfunction. She wouldn't wake up when moved and when we turned her off and then on again all she did was make the sucking sound she should make when given her bottle or binky. There was nothing in her mouth. We tried everything to make her quit making the noise. Finally I had enough and turned her off with the intention of shipping her back to the manufacturer. When I checked her two days later she was working properly again. This has happened many times in the past year and we just coninue turning her off for a few days. I never did return her because my daughter was not willing to part with her even though she wouldn't work at times.

What I like about this doll is that it teaches my rough and tough daughter to be gentle and patient. She has to pat her for at least 30 seconds before the doll will stop crying. She has to rock it for the same amount of time or more before the doll will slowly close its eyes and go to sleep. She truly loves this doll. I have caught her singing Rockabye Baby to it and kissing it nite-nite. What caught my eye is that it is just a beautiful looking doll with those big green eyes and soft body.

Otherwise, it will keep yawning and sighing for a good couple of minutes which is maddening. Other than that, it's a pretty good toy, but I can see little kids getting really frustrated when they want to gently rock their \\"baby\\" to sleep and can't do it.

It was exactly what I was looking for to give for Christams this year. I bought this doll and the bouncy seat. Both are exceptional quality. If you read anything about this doll in magazines or the web, she was a top 10 in the Duracell Toy Awards this year and is being placed on the list as a top toy for the blind and visually impaired. The doll makes such realistic noises and it's very soft. The other plus is the doll can wear newborn size clothing. I can't wait until my daughter sees her on Christmas morning. I know she'll love her.

They have been loved every day of the year. They are very durable and easy to clean except for the cloth body. If they go around naked for very much, the body gets soiled and is hard to clean.

She is really interested in the doll. When she wakes up in the morning, she goes right to her doll. She treats it like it is a real child. My husband and I even play with it. The sounds are very realistic. The only thing I notice is that it takes quite a hard pat on the back to get it to stop crying. Other than that, the doll is really amazing. I am so happy I bought it for her.

We are very pleased with Baby Annebell. I read all of the reviews prior to our purchases, but I couldn't get Annabell in the store, I could only get her online so we went with Chou Chou to save time.

Also, beware that the bottle is very sharp for those who still put things in their mouth, especially toy bottles. But there is a pacifier to use if you must hide the bottle.

The battery cover did not hold the battery precisely in the required position - hence the intermittent operation.

So as for looks, I couldnt be happier. But the downfall, they are made out of a thin material and the black part is made out a material that can snag if your not careful. So quality isn't top knotch.I've had these now for four months and I think I can probably get another four out of them.

Words had spaces inserted randomly in the middle, or were missing entirely between words and punctuation; quotation marks would sometimes appear around speech text and sometimes not, the list goes on. It felt like reading a first-draft written by a drunk monkey.I'm sure the proper print version of the book doesn't contain all these errors, so I'm going to blame the publisher for making such a crappy quality version for Kindle and for ruining the flow of the book, as your eye is constantly snagging on these errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best mysterious and factinating books I've read","review":"Reading this book you enter a fascinating world full of sensuality and mystery.

I really wanted something a little lighter that the 4.4lbs of this unit, but I compromised because I wanted to the flip lever leg locks. I tried an aluminum Manfrotto that was similar to this model, but it was too heavy. I then tried a SLIK 814 CFII and if it had not been for the pain in setting it up and taking it down I would have kept it. If SLIK made a model with lever locks I would be all over that. I would happily shell out the higher $$ for a Gitzo as well if they had lever locks on the legs. I will probably end up buying a monopod as well for travel as I don't see it being very practical to haul this one around. All of that said, this is a fine unit that sets up quickly, is sturdy, lighter than aluminum and has the added bonus of a spirit level. I would recommend this unit to others who feel the same way I do about twist to lock tripod legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.","review":"I've been looking for a non-aerosol spray starch that was not outrageously expensive.

I did buy the \\"new\\" version of Galaga that came out for GBC about two years ago and found it so easy to beat that I finished the whole game in about 20 minutes and never played it again. I was equally disappointed with 1942. Why they seem to make old games \\"easier\\" to play is a myster to me (found the same thing with Space Invaders).If Nintendo or somebody ever came out with a Galaga of the original game for the GBA that increased the sizing portion of the play area, I'd buy it in a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is so old school and it rocks","review":"if you like old arcade games like i do then you gotta get this game. it will entertain you for hours. it gives you a veriety of games to choose from so you dont get bored easly.ther is only on bad thing about this game on ms pacman. if you choose the full screeen its to little to even see and if you choose the larger screen it srolls when you go up and you cant always know if there will be a ghost when you go up but dont get me wrong this game rocks! you also get to choose how many lives you get for ms pacman. there is also alot of other options to choose from in the other games as well. its old school and it rocks!

If you used to shovel quarters into these games as a kid, you won't be disappointed with this cart. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there really should have been more games on the cart. C'mon, you expect me to believe that the simple pixels that make up these games take up all that memory? I suspect this will not be the only \\"Museum\\" cart that Namco puts out...but I'll probably buy those as well. I was also surprised at how addictive these games still are.

It takes a little time to to get used to the small screen, but if you loved any of these games, you won't be disappointed.

There are two things that I don't like about this cart. First, I love the challenge of beating my own high scores but you can't save your high scores. Second, there is no rapid fire in Galaga and Galaxian. If I hold down the button, it only fires once. You have to keep pressing the button to fire. This really slows the game down. It takes twice as long to defeat one wave of enemies as it does in Microsoft's Return of Arcade for the PC. Those games aren't as fun on the GBA. Aside from those two flaws, there's nothing else to critisize."},{"rating":"2","title":"So old school it hurts, esp. w/o battery back up","review":"This game is very true to it's promise, it is exactly like all the old arcade games I remember as a kid. But there is one major flaw that prevents it from being perfect: A lack of a battery to save your high scores(plust it only saves the top score w/ no initials :( ) If they would have implemented that, this game would be a definite 5 star, but as it is right now, its still nice to have a portable 80's arcade with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Battery Backup for your high scores!!!","review":"This game is worthless it contains no battery backup for your high scores.

Basically, this album is two long songs. THere is also a third song, but that is just an alternate take of the first song. This music is very minimal. Tony Conrad plays his viola or violin at a fairly constant note, maintaining a drone for the 20-minute songs. Meanwhile, Jean-Herve, Zappi, and another Faust guy plod along, not changing what they are playing very much, either. It's super repititious, and when Zappi finnaly has a drum fill, it is a big event. Now, a lot of people will find this boring, but I don't. The music has a very organic pulse to it, it seems very alive. I like this album a lot better that the other work I've heard by Tony COnrad. Faust are the perfect backing band for him. I don't listen to this album all that much, but when I do, I always enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudging through mud","review":"Now I know why I found this book in the $5.00 Bargain Bin. I picked it up to entertain me over some flights and it mostly succeeded in inducing sleep - which was a plus, I suppose. You'd think some extraordinary things could happen living in an old castle in Prague in the early 1990's. Not to mention the intrigue possible when a married woman runs off to live with her lover exiled in Libya due to some unspecified spy activity. Sadly, nothing really ever happens except long drawn out descriptions of minutia written in a beautiful, deeply detailed language but sometimes (I feel) meant to make the reader feel like a idiot, running to the dictionary or google to look up deliberately difficult words and references.

Wilson's willingness, as seen by Nicholson, to sacrifice any principle in favor of obtaining agreement on the League of Nations soon soured Nicolson on the American President. Written and published years after the conference, Nicolson reflected the then general view by the British that the conference had failed to achieve as satisfactory peace.

The album starts off with Dead/Alive and the ripping chorus makes this a great tune to drive to.This is not cut and paste punk, this is the real deal. With titles like 'Booze Cabana' and 'The Day I met Iggy', this album destroys all posers who swear by their Green Day. I forget the bass players name, but he's got some great runs and bass lines all through this disk.

The acting is beyond magnificent, and the filming and sound effects are wonderful. This is one of the best examples of a film that is understated, yet so moving and powerful. It treats the tragedy of the holocaust from a real life scenario, and is touching and compassionate in its portrayal of the main characters of the film.The review, placed on the back of the DVD leaves much to be desired. It is ridiculously simplistic and inaccurate. It portrays Tono (the Aryan supervisor of the elderly Jewish woman's shop in the film) as being merely cowardly and complicit.

And well as looking at it, in comparision to the animated films of today. The film is kinda mucky, and the animation is kinda blane. But it's actually very good. Its only 60 minutes long, and contains three stories by the famous novelist, Charles Dickens - The Ghost in the Wardrobe, The Mail Coach Ghosts, and the Goblin and the Gravedigger. My persoanl favorite is the Mail Coach Ghosts, in which a drunken man wanders to a abandoned area occupied by coaches.

It's written with humor and a great deal of enthusiasm for the subject. The bottom line is that I went from knowing nothing about music to feeling empowered and able to shock my smug musician friends with a sudden grasp of their secret world which with this book was simple.

It is none other than Vince Gill, you know, the artist to have won a grammy for every year in the decade of the 90's, the man to have quietly lived out one of the most succseful music career's in a long time.

If you are in a good mood you get a feeling that life is good with all the ups and downs or as Charlie Chaplin would have put it, \\"It's not the ups and downs that make life difficult, it's the jerks!\\" So what the heck, life is short - be happy with the goodness around or find it to breed it, to use this album as the score!

Plenty of big stars signed on. The script is the problem here. It turns everyone into a cliche and stereotype: the drugged out LSD-addled 60s hippy; the bride-to-be getting married to spare a kid from the Vietnam draft; the alcoholic aging lounge singer; the Latino versus black conflicts on the hotel kitchen staff. And what are Anthony Hopkins and Harry Belafonte, besides two old men hanging out in the lobby of the now-demolished Ambassador Hotel? This fictionalizes the lives of all these players on the day and night leading up to the RFK assassination, interspersed with real footage of RFK campaigning etc. I didn't buy it. It's a little boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of talent","review":"I realized shortly after it started that this film was meant to be evocative of the era when Bobby was killed. Unfortunately it failed dismally. I was a university senior at the time and this didn't give me the slightest sense of deja vu. It's obvious that few, if any, of the people involved in making this dud were alive at the time. As to the (usually) very talented cast, what happened? Most of them seemed to be sleepwalking through it all. Note to Freddy Rodriguez: If you don't want to be typecast as \\"cutsey\\", choose your roles more carefully.

Nothing grabbed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eugene McCarthy is missing...","review":"Having lived through this era, I'm saddened that the man who brought anti-war fervor to the presidential campaign before RFK tossed his hat into the ring isn't given a few seconds, and that is Senator Eugene McCarthy.Without McCarthy's articulate presence, RFK as a candidate might never have happened.RFK was a very interesting mix of idealist, pragmatist, and opportunist. It shocks one to hear his straight-from-the-heart voice and realize how far we have fallen in our choice of politicians.Just give us a little McCarthy, as a tribute to that great man as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"First of all I was glad that finally there was going to be a movie aboutBobby, and not John. I never expected this movie to be so captivating and awsome. E. Estevez put it all together at the end. It was like it all made sense. Amazing and truly appreciated.

I expected something totally different given the all star cast and glowing reviews on the case. The acting was horrible. It was like the actors decided, \\"I am going to play this this way\\" and had no regard for being part of a cast. The dialog was horrible. The actors had no relationship to one another (even in the same scene). But the worst part of it all was the hard to miss propoganda. I didn't want a social commentary on what is going on today. I don't want politics shoved down my throat. If I wanted to be part of a liberal dialog, I would listen to talk radio. I wanted to be entertained and this film failed miserably in doing that for so many reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Shot at RFK Backfired","review":"What a stinker!One stereotyped 60's character after another is paraded onto a boring movie.RFK is portrayed as the second coming (wait...wasn't JFK the 2nd coming...too bad Marilyn is dead, only she would be sure to know) and the answer to everythingthat Estevez and Papa Sheen and the rest of the Hollywood activist set believe is wrong with america. Gratuitous scenes of RFK with black people,but the movie gives patronizing roles to its black characters and has then live out stereotypes (typical white pinkolibs, eh?)This is just another tribute to the overidealized 60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"politically correct 60's stereotypes and the roots of anti-americanism in the Democratic Party","review":"This is a politically correct 60's stereotype. Today, young people are largely brain-washed and ignorant of historical facts. For the record, it was Eugene McCarthy who was the courageous Democratic candidate who challenged the Vietnam War. Bobby Kennedy only jumped into the race after McCarthy showed that an anti-war candidate was viable. Of course, with his name, he quickly eclipsed McCarthy. Bobby was assassinated by a Palestinian. JFK was assassinated by a Communist (Oswald). The affiliations of both killers have been largely forgotten and the crimes were attributed to the evil of America.

The acid scenes are priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual narrative devices at work","review":"An unusual way to tell a story: this film focuses on many people (some more compelling than others, I must say) who were in the Ambassador Hotel at the time Robert Kennedy was assassinated as he moved through the kitchen. Instead of dealing with Kennedy directly or having an actor portray him, director Emilio Estevez instead uses footage and voice-overs, concentrating not just on the killing but on the death of idealism at the time.

Well researched scepticism is a valuable counter-balance to the 'pro-monster' books and leads to intelligent debate. This book is not well researched, (there are many factual mistakes), in fact it doesn't do anything well. This is a true hatchet job. This does for Loch Ness what Goldman did for Elvis and Lennon. It is poorly written, vindictive, and has no sense of objectivity. It is malicious at a personal level to many people who have given a lot of time and effort in trying to solve this mystery.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Tale, Grippingly Told","review":"This is a LONG audiobook (over 10 hours), but I couldn't stop listening to it. It was incredibly compelling to hear the story of U.S. sailors before, during and after a devastating typhoon in the Pacific at a critical time in the Pacific Theater in World War II. The narrator, Eric Conger, has a voice that draws you in as you listen to the stories of the ships and crews in their daily lives, and how those lives are changed forever, for good or ill, by the typhoon, by the decisions made by the officers, and by their own actions and reactions to awsome and terrifying circumstances.I found myself liking some men, admiring many, and changing my opinions back and forth about some, as the story developed. I was surprised to hear of then Lieutenant, later President, Gerald Ford's heroic actions in a crisis.This was clearly well-researched and well-wtitten, and well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, very poor authorship","review":"I have a casual interest in naval history, and regret that I did not know of other books on this typhoon incident before I read Drury and Clavin's version.I agree fully with most of the negative reveiws posted, and will not reiterate their specific complaints.In general, the authors demonstrate considerable ignorance and lack of research into general naval matters, terminology, and technology. In reading the narrative, one is jolted over and over by obvious errors, misuse of technical terms, inconsistencies, unlikely supposition of peoples' feelings and statements, and basic poor writing.Charles Ostrofe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Question?","review":"Despite the two typo errors by page 17, my question about this book deals with life preservers. The authors repeat a number of times the claim that the \\"Mae West\\" life preserver was some kind of old style replaced by the \\"newer\\" kapot style. My understanding is the Mae West was issued to air crews and never as standard issue to surface vessel crews and was in fact, a newer design. Where they got this idea that kapot was some newer design that replaced the Mae West and why they say it did so over and over may well be another \\"Untold\\" part of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price ...","review":"I bought this book because I thought it might have new material in it. I suppose the last chapters might satisfy this, but the book as a whole was disappointing. It is mainly an historical re-do of the US 3rd/5th Fleet's operations in 1942 - 1944, loosely centered on the typhoon.What really turned me off was a tin ear for the language of the sea and the arts of the mariner. The terms used to describe basic maritime activities are off base ... example; the reference to \\"helming' a ship. It was obvious early in the book that this was not written by anyone with any amount of sea time. The over-the-top language used to describe the typhoon was unseamanlike and repetitive.The book would have been much better had someone with a maritime background, and preferably command experience or group command experience, read a final proof and corrected it for terminology and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by colege freshmen","review":"This book could have begun with \\"It was a dark and stormy see\\". The authors try to impress us with their vocabulary, often using archaic terms, and overuse adjectives. The writing is in the style of a bad romance novel with overuse of adjectives. Many of the similes are inappropriate for a sea story.My biggest complaint is reserved for the lack of citations. The book is filled with quotations, but there is no notes section to tell us where the quotes came from. The book might as well be labeled fiction. The magazine and newspaper section citations are lacking and the electronic sources section follows no style. Websites are listed with URLs nor access dates. In the miscellaneous section, one of the sources is history.navy.mil. The high schoolers I work with can put together better bibliographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight into WW II","review":"I purchased this audio book for my father who served on a small patrol craft in the South Pacific during WW II. He was in Leyte Gulf and was a few days behind the ships that experienced this typhoon. He still recalls seeing the flight deck of the Wasp smashed up by a typhoon. He found the book very insightful and found out a lot of information about plans and tactics that he did not know before.Since I'm a history buff, he passed it along to me. I looked at the 9 CDs and wondered when i would ever have time to listen to them, but once I got started I'm HOOKED!Once you get past the first few perfunctory background chapters, the story is very well told. I encourage anyone who served in the US Navy in the South Pacific to buy this book. Or better yet, if your father served in that theater, buy it for him! It's a GREAT gift, especially if you can surprise him with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another example of courage.","review":"I don't know if Admiral Halsey was negligent or irresponsible or not, but I doubt that he was. I think he probably acted with the best information he had at the time and had to make a decision. It's easy to second-guess.I do think this is just another example of the courage and bravery ordinary men faced during the times of strife that they faced. The book did leave me with several questions however, i.e. how did the Navy report the ships that were lost? How about the men that were lost were they reported KIA or just lost at sea? I do think KIA is appropriate for surely they faced an enemy of great magnitude, and some of them defeated this enemy and survived. I would certainly recomment it as a reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halsey's Typhoon","review":"This is a magnificent read because it was written by people who make their livings writing. The turns of phrase, the interweaving of different time periods, people and ships in, out, and back into the story, even the use of terms that are more easily understood than those written in ancient mariner lexicons make this book refreshingly easy to read and understand. Maybe it helped to have several dozen Navy people editing and helping with the composition. You can almost hear the howling winds and see the translucent greens of the water. Nasty business to be sure, here so eloquently told, on a par with Joseph Conrad. Thank you everyone for a job very well done.

Reading about how all these men were lost was sad; realizing how technology we have today would have made a difference gave an interesting perspective to the descriptions of how aerology was such an infant science; and reading about leadership errors was depressing. All-in-all the book made me sad; it also makes me want to look at other books on the subject and to see how others have written about this event in WWII. The mind can't help compare things in the book and what is happening today...families in WWII didn't learn about their loss in this event until weeks later,and now with computers/satellites/cell phones the families learn about their loss in a matter of hours.

Throughout her childhood Kehoe was subjected to the whims and abuse of her eccentric and tyrannical father. A gifted architect, Kehoe's father ruled his children and his wife like a dictator. Isolated and miserable, Kehoe has no explanation for her father's behavior. As an adult, she decides to investigate her family's past, to try and better understand her father. Spurred on by an episode of anti-Semitic violence in her youth, Kehoe's search for her past leads her to unexpected places and surprises. It's difficult to say more without giving away the conclusion, except that this memoir explains Kehoe's search for her past, and how she comes to terms with what she finds and what she knows of her father. Well-written, sad, and sometimes shocking, Kehoe's rendering of an elaborate family myth and its unraveling is well-crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dark read","review":"This book is not for everyone.

For it to play music my son would have to tip it himself with his hands because the balls are not enough to do it. The music is the same song and saying all the time and just the nose lights up.

Potassium, magnesium, and other electrolytes like calcium and so on are important. This product is good, especially for the price. But I add other ingredients to my horse's electrolytes since exercise and exertion on the muscles can lead to cramping and a drain in the glucose levels of the muscles after workout. I add Gatorade powder to the electrolytes and find it is not as salty and my horse is getting more of the electrolyte elements he needs. I've been doing this for years and my horse has never tied up or had sore stiff muscles.

It ranks right under whey protein. The best kind is a standard creatine monohydrate, in a powder or capsule form. Optimum Nutrition has this powdered form that has about 60 servings in it. Assuming you take one a day, this should last you two months, or about eight weeks. That is also a very convenient creatine cycle length.

During the time I was taking it, I noticed better recovery and performance while weight lifting. The grains mix pretty well, but they tend to remain grainy. It's not worse than sugar it's not that bad, but if you don't like that texture, then you'll need to mix it with milk or something a bit thicker than water or sport drink.Overall, it's extremely effective and I'm satisfied with the product. It has helped me exactly as specified by the company. I recommend ON products over all others."},{"rating":"2","title":"some gains","review":"I definitely noticed some gains while taking this product, however it was nothing crazy.

Even now the ambiguity is annoying. I'll either take too little or too much. Grams depend on what substance is so a gram of sugar, protein, and createin will not have the same volume (tea spoon size) so you HAVE to have a gram scale to correctly measure it. Other supplements DO include their own scoop and tell you how much gram it holds and they make a full scoop to evenly divide into the amount you need per day. So if you need 10grams of something, the scoop has volume to have 10grams or 5grams, so you know how many scoops you need. this has been very upsetting. In weight training the amount of supplement is everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Quality Possible!","review":"What can i say about ON. All of their products are the best quality. With all the various forms of creatine out there, monohydrate is still king. I have tried many different forms. It just works! And don't bother to load. Studies have shown that within 30 days that you still have the same amount of creatine in you muscle tissue. And you don't get the Creatine bloat that people complain about. Loading just gets the creatine into your muscles a little bit faster. And don't forget to cycle it every 60 to 90 days. The biggest secret with weight training is patience. Stick with ON, it's a brand you can trust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great without the bloating!","review":"I've taken 2 different brands of creatine powder since I initially worked out and 1 of the 2 always left me feeling bloated.

Unfortunately, the twisting action is HARD on the wrist and is definitely too hard for a five year old to move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying.","review":"Like other reviews have mentioned (why don't I read the reviews before I buy toys!!??) this game is a nuisance. It takes forever to set it up, > 5 minutes, then the game is played in about 2 minutes, max. The bees are cute, the game is sturdy. We never play it anymore. Kerplunk is similar and easier to set up, more fun to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"My three-year-old received this for Christmas & absolutely loves it. It's actually pretty fun for an adult, too. My only complaint would be that you have to turn the trunk of the tree to make the bees fall into each player's slot. This is difficult to do (especially for a four-year-old) without causing more bees to fall accidentally. We solved this by just turning the entire tree and each person keeps their bees throughout the game. Other than this problem, though, it's constructed very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS TOY","review":"Takes far too long to set up; bees are too small (smaller than a grape) and clearly a choking hazard. My 3 year old likes rolling the bees on our hardwood floors and we inevitably miss one or 2 when cleaning up, so someone ends up slipping on it. She doesn't have the patience to wait for it to be fully set up. The tree comes apart too easily. This was a gift that is now going to be given away."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Seconds of Play, 5 Minutes of set up","review":"Takes forever to set up and the game is over after a few moves.

It is definitely a way for *me* to pass time, trying to get those stupid leaves put in for twenty minutes. The game itself takes about three minutes to play. Though my three year-old son loves the game, until he's old enough to put in the leaves himself, I've hidden this away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah to be the hero of Christmas to the niece and nephew!","review":"I got this and two other games for the kids (age 6 and 3) for Christmas and they were so excited! Their dad opened the boxes and they started playing each of them. This one all three of them truly enjoyed. There was a lot of very happy yet loud noises at each turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal pain to set up","review":"This game is inexpensive and looks cute, but it is a ROYAL PAIN to play b/c it takes forever to stick each of the sticks into the holes -- it gets more difficult the more are in there, and no child will have the patience to set it up all for the few minutes of \\"play\\" to get the bees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work!","review":"This game takes way too much time to set-up. Poking the long, thin stems through the tiny holes takes forever! The basic idea of this game is the opposite of what preschoolers want to do. They WANT to wake the bees and have them fall in the tray. This game is really only good for teaching basic turn taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"We've had this game almost a year and my 3yo son still loves it. He plays with it in different ways. Sometimes he just talks to the bees and flies them around; sometimes he puts some of the leaves in the honey pot and tries to catch the bees. We also practice counting sometimes, to see who has more bees. He doesn't understand yet that getting bees is 'bad' when you pull a leaf out, so we play to see who can get the most bees to fall down. He can put this together by himself and get quite a few leaves in. Yes, it's tricky to insert all the leaves, but you don't have to use them all, or all the bees. We love this game and are so happy we have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much set up for very little play time","review":"Not worth it! Takes soo long to set up,then it's all done in two minutes. All the frustration/set up for nothing. There are way better games out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super cute & fun, but way too long to set up.","review":"We loved this game in pictures. Finally got it for a birthday & loved playing it, until the newness wore off (after game #2) and we were no longer patient with taking longer to set it up than to play it! I don't know how I would change it to make it better, but the set up just makes the game not worth playing! That and the turning of the tree in the base for each turn just jostles the bees into falling. So we now use the base and 10 bees to do a number match up work & the kids love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Adorable, But...","review":"Yes, this game is incredibly cute. I agree wholeheartedly that it takes way too much time to set up. By the time we get the leaves in the tree (which is no small feat - you must put insert the leaves pretty much in a specific order to get them all to fit) our 4 yr old son is bored and ready to play something else. In the few times I've been able to drag him back to the game, it takes just a few pulls on a few leaves to make the bees drop. If he happens to bump the tree - ALL the bees can fall in to the open area and fall through at once. It makes for a very irritating experience, especially for mommy! Yes, its really, really cute - but I can't say I am thrilled with the purchase. Our siamese cat has had more fun batting the bees around the tile floor...(Under our supervision, of course! Those bees are pretty small and could get lodged in his little throat!) There are definitely better games out there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps for little kids (under 3?)","review":"My 4 year old got this game from his aunt. We have tried many times to play it, since it looks cute. But each time, we pack it back up in under five minutes. It actually takes longer for us to pack it up (or to set it up) than to play it. The long-stemmed leaves, which are supposed to be inserted through the holes in the top of the \\"tree\\" have to be inserted one by one by an adult. And the bees, which are supposed to be held up by the stems, keep falling through and onto the collection cup before the game even begins. We are not very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not as tough to set up as you'd think...","review":"It took several tries before I realized the \\"trick\\" to setting this game up more quickly. The branches enter one side of the hive and exit through a hole on the other side. At first, I found it frustrating to get all of the leaves through the exit holes. Then I realized that once you've inserted a dozen leaves or so, the rest don't have to exit. Then can just be popped in quickly and find support on the properly inserted brances.I didn't think the directions were as clear as they should have been. I definitley fell prey to the \\"award winning\\" sticker on the box when I bought this game.However, the more we play it, the more I see the educational value in it. My 3 year old is simply thrilled to learn turn-taking as we try to make the bees fall out. My 7 and 9 year olds are definitely more into the logic and competition of the game.All told, once you've mastered the branch issue, it's really a fun game and worth the space on your family game shelves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"It takes too long to set up (sticking all the leaves through the hive). By the time I'm done, the kids have lost interest. They had more fun just playing with the bees separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey Bee Tree","review":"Yeah it is a pain to set up, but that doesn't bother me. I would rather my son be playing these type of games then video games all the time. Once set up it is fun for all of us and I recommend this to anyone. My son is 5 and this is one gift he wanted santa to bring and he did. He is very pleased with it and has tons of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute But Frustrating","review":"Takes longer to assemble than play. We've only played it a couple of times, but my 3 and 4 year old don't yet get the strategy. The trays are a little too small and bees tend to bounce out. It's not bad for a quick game, but call the kids in after you've set it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's very cute but....","review":"... play value is low. It takes forEVER to set it up and, IMHO, requires adult hands. The holes for the leafs are small and after the first few are inserted, it gets to be quite a challenge. Once set up, it offers less than 5 minutes of play. About the only really good thing about it is that the 2yo loves the noise the bees make as she pours them \\"through\\" the tree - who needs leaves? The 6yo, however, loses interest pretty quickly. I don't recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hide this one in the back of the closet!","review":"This game looks fun and it's a great concept but not worth it.The set up takes way too long, getting the sticks in is very tricky and there is no way a little kid could do it on their own. My little girl is off playing in the other room before I can even finish setting up. The tree is difficult to turn to each players space and toward the end of the game bees come falling out just by turning the trunk. It is a very quick game (2-3 minutes) to play which might be good for kids with a short attention span but terrible for the adult because then the torturous task of setting up begins.I would have given this one star if my daughter didn't have fun during the actual playing of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed to Kill Parents","review":"This was one of my bigger mistakes. The leaves are hard to get in. There are maybe 100000000 bees and you will be finding them in the strangest places. I didn't really understand the purpose of this game after buying it. The kids liked it but unfortunately for them, it accidentally go dropped in the garbage can (mean I know). Tough toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honey Bee Tree","review":"Bought this game for my almost 3 year old grandson and it is way out of his attention span.

He utilizes the same examples over and over again, resulting in a detrimental effect on his credibility. In addition, he describes behaviour that the average odeon would be able to explain.

I went to the website brandsense dot com to find out more and on the promotional materials there's a blurb about the author where in the opening sentence it claims \\"Martin Lindstrom founded his own advertising agency at the age of 12\\"!!! Now, forgive me, but I find this extremely hard to believe unless he is really stretching the definition. And even if it is true, do you really want one of the first things someone reads about your brand (ie: Martin in this instance) to be something that makes you think \\"what a joke, this guy is obviously full of hype\\"?!!? Now, maybe the book is OK, certainly a lot of other people think it is, but I fear that this sets the tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulate our thinking","review":"This book is great in a way that it stimulates our thinking and looks at the branding concepts in a brand new way.

It gives some good, concrete examples of where Microsoft has made mistakes, and where Apple and Singapore Airlines have gotten it right.The reason for my low review isn't because the book lacks interesting material. It is because the book is overly wordy, and would have been far better condensed to 20% of its size. If it brought in more case examples, and were a lot shorter, it would have conveyed its ideas in an efficient fashion.

She portrays each and every character so vividly that you begin to love every one as your own. From the very start of the novel, I was hooked. I simply could not put it down. I only got this book in the first place so I wouldn't be bored on my plane trip. What I thought would be a semi-interesting book to occupy my interests momentarily, ended up being an obsession. Even when I reached my destination, and my boyfriend, I had to read this book to the very end. To the very end of the book I was guessing at the twists and turns the plot would take. Not once did I guess right (and I read a lot of these books).

It made my son very hyper and aggressive, and it didn't reduce his allergy symptoms enough to be worth the hyperactivity side effect. It did reduce his symptoms to a small extent, and he didn't mind the flavor, so I'm not giving it the lowest amount of stars.This said, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that every child is different. The fact that it didn't work for my son doesn't mean it won't work for *any* child. If you've just found out your child has allergies, it may be a trial-and-error thing for a while finding the perfect medicine.

You have to fumble for a position that leaves the top free to pop up.2. Every time you put in a new CD you have to keep pushing the button on the edge that increases the volume. It always starts at zero. That means I have to push the button about 30 times to raise the volume to the level I like. It won't go back to a previous setting. It starts at zero each time.3. The player skips like the devil. If I put in an absolutely perfect, pristine CD, it will probably play all the way through.

Firstly, it has a lot better coverage, literally everything inside M25 and bonus things i.e. Welwyn Garden City, Guildford, Windsor, etc. The entire domain of the GLA (except a square mile of easternmost Havering) is covered. No other atlas does that. Secondly, the clarity is amazing. Yes, the Philip's map is has a slightly more intimate scale, but these maps are sharper than those.

Bourdain spices up this tale of a young chef caught up in a FBI sting operation targeted at organized crime in NYC with numerous scenes of mouth watering food preparation scenes. The mob characters sometimes behave too much like cartoon versions of the real thing, but the young protoganist, an aspiring chef who happens to be the nephew of mobster Sally Wig (an overweight loan shark, knee breaker, and sloppy eater) is written as a real character looking to escape from his \\"Family\\" roots. The frequenly humorous plot is mixed with occasional violence, several interesting supporting characters, and more than a few things you probably don't want to know about restaurants."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy but somewhat bland read","review":"I enjoyed Kitchen Confidential a lot more for its witty writing and colourful insights into the restaurant business. This fiction novel however, disappoints as the pace is slow, the action limited and the characters predictable. It is nevertheless unpretentious and an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job Tony....","review":"I got this because I love Tony Bourdain's caustic wit and thought that the book would reflect some of it....instead I got a disjointed, poorly written mob book that just does not make the grade. How bad is it? Well I will even read the Yellow Pages if I am bored and this was worse than the Yellow Pages. Dialogue is sloppy, poor character development (except for the Chef and perhaps that was slightly autobiograpical)....and it has a dreary feel like a poorly done 1930 George Raft movie. Everything overdone.I understand there is a sequel and I have to wonder why. Sorry Tony, I love No Reservations and enjoyed Kitchen Confidential....but leave the mob books to Mario Puzo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced good read","review":"Bourdain's first fiction book is right on. I liked the plot flow and the characters are all pretty believable. Nicely paced and not too far fetched. Looking forward to reading \\"Going Bamboo\\" next. I also enjoy his show on the food network. I think that Bourdain will have a long career in the literary field. Some other reviews didn't like the ending of this book but I found it fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Maybe I was expecting to much. I don't know a lot about the mob first hand but the ending in this seemed just almost too easy considering the struggle that had taken place. Lot of drug use and foul language which isn't shocking considering the cast. It is a very straight forward story that is easy to follow but when you're reading it you find yourself going back to find out who the character is that has just been reintroduced. The police and some of the lesser seen mob members seem to become easily forgotten to the point that it is a little confusing. It seemed to focus on gourmet food as much as anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fast Read","review":"This is a great fast read. I thought the plot and story was very interesting and easy to follow. Bourdain does a great job of describing the characters and really makes you care about them and what happens to them.

Difficult to know what or how much you missed when you turn over white areas with nothing in them. I would not recommend this book at any price since it has not been properly digitally scanned. I have occasionally found white (blank) areas in other Kindle books but this is the first time that I have encountered so many of them. Book has repetitive dialogue - maybe thugs talk like that, but it is boring, tiresome reading, which coupled with the blank areas in the book, makes for a poor reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining except.........","review":"True, this would have been a fun, fast read. It would have been even faster, say, 50 pages shorter, if he just took out one word. I'm afraid that one word spoiled it for me. On occasion is one thing, three times in every sentence is another.

Anyways, I just started reading and I have been pleased and entertained so far. I like that there is lots of food/cooking/chef stuff and references in the book. I'm excited to finish it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised","review":"I was surprised at how the book held my interest. Although I really enjoyed Kitchen Confidential, I somehow thought Bourdain's writing ability might not cross over to fiction. This isn't a mystery at all; it might be better to call it crime fiction. His writing is direct and understated, no hyperbole, no \\"creative writing\\" attempts. For instance when he describes sex he uses straightforward and understated rather than overdone language, and it is much more effective than more blowsy prose. I like his sentence structure and choice of words. I could see the action and the characters very clearly in my mind while reading the book and didn't want to put it down. Warning though: this is pretty violent stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"As only Tony can","review":"I was mesmerized by this book. So fast paced. So Bourdain.

I could not put it down. And I don't say that often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...","review":"I was surprised at how good this book is.

I worked in a restaurant myself at one point, and could picture my own staff getting caught up in this type of mess.Any fan of Anthony Bourdain and his television show \\"No Reservations\\" will likely be entertained by this one. It reads very similar to his spoken dialogue on the show with sprinkled bits and pieces of cynicism."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME product!!!","review":"I purchased these traps last week and they are AMAZING!!!

It has managed to set off one of 3 I have set up, but it avoided getting caught, just as it has for 3 wooden d-Con traps.

We recently moved to the \\"country\\" and along with the ambiance came a large mouse population. When I received the package I immediately set a trap up next to the existing Victor trap. Within a few hours we had the first victim. (The Victor trap had been untouched for days.) The Snap-E traps are easy to bait and set. The mouse is easily released, without touching the creature, and the trap is ready to use again. Actually the mouse never got a chance to sample the peanut butter that was in the trap. I would recommend this product to everyone!I tried to purchase this product through Amazon but due to a glitch concerning the shipping charges, per item, wound up purchasing the Snap-E Mouse Traps from the seller.

I have to catch lots of mice. I've been using this trap for the past two years. It's perfect. It always kills instantly, never maims. It has never misfired. It's easy to set, and doesn't go off in my hand as I'm putting it in place. It's reusable. I've caught over 30 mice with just a few traps. Every one has been an instant, clean kill.I once caught a mouse in a \\"humane\\" trap in the garage, and forgot it. The caged mouse died of thirst. No more of that for me. My old style wooden traps often caught the mouse by the paw, so I had to kill him myself. I don't enjoy that either. This SnapE trap is indeed the best way to deal with mice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tiny to catch a rat","review":"I brought 3 of these hoping to catch a Rat in my house.

This kind of trap solves the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic trap- The other reviews are right!","review":"I bought a set of 4 of these traps after seeing the other reviews. One week after receiving them, I can say with confidence that these are the best traps I've ever used. Every kill so far has been perfect- one mouse even had a chunk from the chunky peanut butter right between his teeth when he met his maker. Unlike traditional traps, these appear to always snag the mouse directly on the neck, making for a clean (no messy blood) and humane (instant) death. I actually heard a trap go off the other day and checked it seconds later, and the mouse was 100% deceased- no horrific twitching or desperate escape attempts as with other traps. The other bonus with these is that you rarely even have to re-bait them, because mice don't even have the chance to remove any bait before they're caught. Long story short, I'll never buy another kind of trap again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mickey's worst nightmare...","review":"Folks...setting the old standard wood traps is kindalike defusing a bomb...you gently let it go and hope it don't go off!!It's nerve wracking...or aggravating...depending on your point of view.The solution??.....The Snap-E Trap!--------------------------------------------------- Let's go over its strengths, one by one.1. . .The base is synthetic.This means no wood to rot, or warp, or soak up mouse blood!It'll be here (and in service) longer than you!2. . .The set and release bar is AWAY from the killing bar.This means NO snapped fingers and NO prying the bar off dead mice!3. . .The bait hole is genius.Just drop in a Peanut Butter Capn Crunch and its baited!Couldn't be easier!----------------------------------------------------- Ok...now lets go over its weaknesses, one by one.1. . . . . . .

One mouse even had the balls to do a little break dance in front of my when I came home yesterday and entered the kitchen, it then scampered away under the dishwasher.

When I came back there was a mouse in the trap! Another hour, another mouse. Set overnight I caught one in each trap. 4 mice in 12 hours, and I haven't seen any since!

Normally, I use 'pill pockets' when I have to give my cats tablets, so I tried to cut a CalMix tablet into smaller pieces using a pill-cutter, but I ended up with lots of chunks and 'crumbs'. Even when hidden in the 'pill pockets', my cat refused to eat CalMix. This product seems more appropriate for dogs (the enormous tablets are chewable) than for cats.

Jessica's occasional semi-poetic personal musings are rather annoying when they are used to fill a page in this sparse book (which, by the way, can hardly be called a biography). If you buy this book, you will probably pick up a couple pieces of trivia about the Crows that you didn't know before. But that's all you'll get. Worth $14? That's for you to decide, but I'd pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even finished","review":"First of all, the picture shows the whole set, the truth is you only get one (the page doesn't specify the amount).

If you're a fan of classic soul, funk or R&B; you'll love this. I'm a huge fan of Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Barry White, Aretha, Tina Turner and the Ohio Players. I'm always on the lookout for new artists that appreciate & respect the classics. Maxwell, D'Angelo, Brand New Heavies and Jamiroquoi are some modern artists that have a similar vibe to Angie Stone. Her music has a warm organic funk sound. And her voice is smoky, funky & spectacular. Some of the standout tracks are #3 \\"Green Grass Vapors\\" and #5 \\"Coulda Been You\\".Very, very good cd.

However, I was very disappointed because every song on the cd is a sample of the great artists from the 70s and 80s. I should have know that I was in for a shock when I heard No More Rain. That song is a sample of Gladys Knight's Neither One Of Us. I'll admit that Angie Stone has a very soulful voice, but she is all hype. Anyone expecting the rest of the cd to be like No More Rain is in for a surprise. Why should I have to pay $15.00 for a cd when she could have released the single and I would have been HAPPIER? I am not surprised that several people are calling this a soulful cd because most people don't know what real soul is. Especially, when people consider Destiny's Child to be soulful. Where is the originality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"The first time I heard Angie Stone's song \\"No More Rain\\" I knew I would end up buying her CD. I usually stick to just Gospel music, but a guy told me that she had some really touching spiritual notes in her CD cover and the song \\"No More Rain\\" touched me so deeply I just knew I would love the CD. The spiritual notes are, in fact, really beautiful but her lyrics don't entirely agree with what she \\"preaches\\". Using profanity and smokin' green grass are not very Chirst-like activities...we should be vessels for His spirit. Doers and not just hearers (and repeaters) of His Word. But, of course, if you don't mind profanity and weed, you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant stuff","review":"Angie Stone has a unique and powerful voice. This albumn is so varied and interesting. One of the best albumns I have bought in years. If you like classic, obscure soul, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual and soulful","review":"This album is deep, emotional and true soul. The sexiness in this album comes from the mature use of voice and lyrics and not from the pouting breathy style used by pseudo-soul divas like Mariah and Whitney. This is an album by a woman confident in her music and in her voice.Starting with the cool No More Rain (in this cloud), the album moves through various styles including strings, rhythm guitar and synthesisers. Nothing dominates but instead it is all woven together into a magical package by Angie's rich voice. Standouts include Everyday (cowritten with ex-partner D'Angelo), a brilliant version of marvin Gaye's Trouble Man and the true soul of Love Junkie.This is an album that is soul itself. No contrived and controlled wailing pop diva here. Angie is a true soul diva who wraps you in her velvet voice and makes us feel.

I'm not 100% crazy about the CD all the way through, although it's growing on me with every play. But Stone's rendition of Marvin Gaye's \\"Trouble Man\\" is worth the cover cost alone, and when you throw in \\"Green Grass Vapors\\", \\"Love Junkie\\", \\"Vision\\", etc. etc...you have a beat going that just won't quit. I'm sold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC, MUST HAVE ALBUM","review":"The first time that I heard Angie Stone's song, NO MORE RAIN, I was automatically drawn to her soulful, breathtaking, and beautiful lyrics and voice. It was that song that drove me to buy her album, not knowing how her other songs would sound. I did have a feeling inside, though, that it would be a good album and I was right. While listening to her songs, it just gives you a beautiful, relaxed feeling on the inside with her soulful, head bopping beats. Her voice is just amazing and I would recommend this album for everyone to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This CD is worth any amount of money you pay for it. Yes, she may have snatched a few beats from a couple of originaters, but think about it, WHO HASN'T! Artists of today can't do what R&B creators did back in the day. They can't make there own beats and create ther songs without some type of influence. Angie Stone's \\"Black Diamond\\" is one of my favorite CDs because it is mellow and smooth. Every song in the CD has a beat to it that you could just nod to. To be honest, at first I really didn't like this CD. But as I listen to it more often, I began to feel the beats. Anyways, what I am trying to say is, is that if you haven't purchased this CD yet, you need to do so now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite purchase with a lot of sampling","review":"Unfortunately I cannot give any artist who makes use of samples as much as Miss Stone 5 stars although I feel that she has really created something truly original and satisfying with her use of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye music to name just a few of the artists that were sampled.Part jazz, part fusion, part soul... it's great listening.It's definitely a must have album but let's not go too far in our praise for work that is not entirely original."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMPLETELY Refreshing","review":"Just when I thought it wasn't safe to venture out into the oceans of today's R&B mishaps, Angie Stone drops \\"Black Diamond\\" and totally gives me reason to believe that R&B music has not gone to the dogs. Her voice is honest and expressive and her delivery on \\"Everyday\\" is fantastic. This is absolutely one of those all day CDs.

It's neither bad nor good, it's just there.'Thundercloud' though belongs in the canon of Sweet's best work. The track features diverse instruments like the flugelhorn and theremin to evoke the sounds of a thunderstorm. The song starts pleasantly, then becomes slower until it hits the turbulent solo. By the end everything's calm again. Masterful.Also, Sweet's irritating backwards CD packaging (everything's in reverse..like the title, get it?) clashes with my entire collection and worst of all really, really bugs me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt's lost it","review":"With these last two album releases, Blue Sky on Mars and In Reverse, Sweet is but a faint shadow of what he once was.Sweet's career has been a fairly perplexing and interesting one. He started out playing wimpy synth-dance stuff with those heavy '80s drums. Luckily, he ditched that style and went for power-pop with heavy '60s and early '70s influences, and hit gold. Girlfriend was the breakthrough album for that style. Then came Altered Beast, a noisy, dark album which shattered any expectations of a \\"Girlfriend II.\\" 100% Fun was a return to classic power-pop.After that, Sweet ran out of steam. Blue Sky is extremely pedestrian. In Reverse is even worse. His talent is apparently what is going in reverse. He's lost it.Too bad -- I was a big Matthew Sweet fan for at least three albums, from Girlfriend to 100% Fun. And now this dreck. What happened? Well, I guess \\"Nothing Lasts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering, Mediocre Pap!","review":"After reading all of these GLOWING reviews I bought this disc. What a mistake. The magic everyone promised Matthew delivers on this disc is missing...No hooks. Notes hammer redundantly, insisting that THIS IS melody, simply by nature of repetition. The upside down and backwards packaging (\\"in reverse,\\" get it? any idiot would...) is annoying. Is this another case of all packaging and no substance? You bet.Vapid, vacuous lyrics wrapped in 2-dimensional production. There are a few clever sounds utilized and some amazing talents on board, but these just can't salvage the mediocrity of the songwriting. All of the comparisons to Brian Wilson's and Phil Spector's production values are lost on me. Musta missed 'em in the self-indulgent, meandering drone of this melody-less mistake.Very disappointing. Thanks to the misleading reviews gushing the virtues of this abortive effort, I wasted my money. This is frisbee material."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET IS STILL SWEET","review":"I have several Matthew Sweet CD's and was very pleased with his latest effort. I enjoyed it the first time I listened to it. He doesn't have a lot of his excellent guitar work on this album, but is once again testing new waters. I haven't been too impressed with a couple of his albums (which I won't name), but he hits the mark with this one. \\"Write Your Own Song\\" is TOO good. The lyrics make that one! \\"Thunderstorm\\" is a tapestry of sounds - I think it is the best \\"long song\\" I've heard in a while. It doesn't bore you with pointless wanderings. \\"Faith In You\\" & \\"Untitled\\" are clever and two of my favorites on this album.No matter how many albums Sweet puts out, he never fails to try new avenues. That is why I admire his music. I like the artist and what he puts forth - it shows up in his music - DARE TO BE YOU! So, if you want to know who Sweet is, this is a very good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible disappointment","review":"Calling \\"In Reverse\\" a masterpiece or one of the greatest albums ever (as some have here) is so bizarre I don't know where to begin. If this is your idea of great music, keep your CD collection the hell away from me. This is, simply, one of the most disappointing CD purchases I've ever made -- and I'm a big Matthew Sweet fan. Return to form? Absolutely not. Meandering and completely uninteresting, this has none of the attributes of the absolutely great \\"Girlfriend\\" or underrated \\"Altered Beast.\\" Somebody should start a rumor similar to the \\"Paul McCartney is dead\\" speculation of the late '60s, because this doesn't even seem to be the same person who made some outstanding power pop in the early to mid '90s. If you like Matthew Sweet, avoid this; consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Work ...","review":"This is everything the reviewers here say..although, agreed, it isnt as near perfection as 100% Fun. Sweet has put it all together for a pleasant CD with great tunes and great lyrics. Perhaps the only problems are the 'strange' similarities to ELO on the early tracks (i love ELO, but mimicking their sound doesnt sit well on the originality table) The Brian Wilson factor may be here, but it isnt as blatant and works very creatively. The backtracking i have no qualms about. Its not the using it, its the WAY its used..and it all works well on this notable addition to Sweets work. Now if Matthew can just take this format and add a bit more zing (read: no over-amped screechy noise, but classy work like on 100% fun) than he will have reached his prime vintage musically! A good addition to your Sweet Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Give this CD a couple of listens and I guarantee it will not leave your CD player for weeks. Simply put, this is shimmering, beautiful ear candy in the classic Pet Sounds tradition. This is also clearly Sweet's best work since Girlfriend and one of the best releases of the year. Matthew, thanks for hanging in there and blessing us with this gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Did The Sharp Edge Of Matthew Sweets Music Gone To??","review":"I pre ordered this CD and I was so excited to get it on my door step yesterday. I am a passionate Matthew Sweet fan. I am sad to say that Sweet's sharp lyrics and music that his genius shines through on is missing on this CD. I was not looking for the same sound as in his other incredible recordings, but the originality is some what missing. It is slow and there is not one song that really stands out. I am sorry to not give more of a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy entry in the Matthew Sweet catalog","review":"I bought this album when it first came out mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Girlfriend\\" and as a bassist, was thrilled to see the incomparable Carol Kaye listed as a player on several tracks. She does not disappoint. While not a perfect album, there are some incredible songs here, and as has been observed by many other reviewers, the production is dang near flawless. I would heartily recommend the opening \\"suite\\" - the first three songs which flow directly into one another, very reminiscent of Phil Spector. If anything, get the record just to hear Carol Kaye on \\"If Time Permits\\" and crank the bass up on your EQ - you HAVE to hear what's she's playing. She hasn't lost a step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss It...","review":"I had one of these games for 5 years and played it all the time in the evenings for relaxation. That one game lasted me 5 years.

If that's why you're looking at it, then you don't have much of a choice. Otherwise, look somewhere else. I've found it nearly worthless at helping me adjust to college--all it seems to do is tell me what I already know (it points out what you need to \\"work on\\" in your life but gives you no suggestions on where to begin working). I'm surprised that the review says that it doesn't talk down to students--I think that's exactly what it does. It relies heavily on statistical stereotypes, and dispenses little practical advice.

It sounds convinsing very much because it is simple. In deed the Zen like character of the teaching as to how to meditate makes it trully engaging. It is clear to the point, personal and human. There are a lot of books about tecniques and alot of them quite good. But some of them seem too full of the particular brand of Buddhism they come from, so much so that one almost fells as if to meditated one has to become Tibetan or Chinnese.Some others are so much explain in like magical lenguage that the magic of the simple act of meditation goes away.

We love to play Scrabble and, even with this version's drawbacks, it still rates four stars for fun and, of course, any version of Scrabble should receive five stars for educational value. It's durability remains in question -- we haven't used it that many times -- but it give me the feeling that game parts will start breaking relatively soon.

If you like to move your letters around on your rack, this probably won't work for you. It could have been designed better, but it works for me.

Was one ever made?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrabble - travel version","review":"This scrabble version is a very clever travel version.

It's perfect for a long (or short) airplane ride. It's small enough to fit in a carry-on bag and the size if just right to put on your tray. If you have to put it away, you can do so in the middle of a game.The small size is great, but also a problem in that the pieces are easy to lose. With a little care though, you should be able to use this game for many years to come. This is one of my favorite Scrabble sets since I can take it with me everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best travel version of scrabble","review":"This is still a scrabble game, played like all others, but the design is not very good. The letters pop off the 'board' all too easily and by 'pop' I mean they go flying through the air. After playing several games my wife and I got better at placing the letters but some still took off. I can't imagine playing this in a car, letters are bound to get lost; ironically, this version was probably designed for in-car play. Anyone with hand problems should avoid this game, the letters are small and good dexterity is essential for placing the letters.On the plus side you can stop mid-game, fold everything up, go somplace else and resume where you left off.I much preferred an older travel version which I gave away to a friend. It folded in half and was made out of light blue plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"scrabble game folio?","review":"I ordered form amazon because i was looking for thefirst introductry offer which was pink. they said theyhad 3 but i recieved the one that i could have purchased anywhere. was disappointed.

I have small fingers and I find it hard to handle at times. I think this would be hard to use at the beach or on the plane. We also had to rub each piece on all four sides at first b/c they wouldn't stay on the board next to other pieces. It only took a few minutes though, and all the pieces fit now! So if you have that problem, just take a regular emory board and file each piece on four sides a few times.

We took it to Starbucks and played a half a game and when it was time to leave, we just packed it up and off we went. The portability is nice. I do agree with the other reviews as far as the size of the tiles - they are tiny. It is also a bit difficult to take the tiles off the board because they are pretty much set in there when you click them on. Otherwise, it is perfect to take with you anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scrabble board","review":"This is a great board for traveling, but no good for home use.

The tiles are a bit difficult to handle so you have to be a little careful with them, but this little baby is small and packs easily. I have played it a lot on planes and have taken it on vacation with me to play with people when I get bored. Its portability is its best feature. Just be careful not to lose the tiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"little too small","review":"I was stoked to get this, it was a great idea, but poorly executed. The plastic is too tiny and tight, making it hard to pop in the letters, which occasionally shoot off the gameboard. The racks are worthless, the pieces don't even fit in two of mine. I don't know if my set was defective, but it seems to me that they went a little too cheap on the plastic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play Scrabble - IN BED!!","review":"It's revolutionary - you can play Scrabble in bed, on the couch, in the car, anywhere. You can hold the board and racks at any angle, toss them around like frisbees, and stop your game at any time to resume later. My girlfriend and I have become hopelessly addicted to it, along with hardcore opiates. We spend a lot of time in bed.These people complaining about the design of the tiles and racks... maybe they have arthritis, or really fat fingers, or some kind of developmental disability... but we've never had any trouble with it. I suppose I wouldn't recommend it for children or the elderly, but Scrabble has never been a children's game, has it?I also suppose, in an ideal world, there would be a better way to design a portable Scrabble game. But at $20 it is an amazing value, and a WAY cooler design than the $30 \\"deluxe\\" version with the corny woodgrain finish. I just bought four of them as Christmas gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com","review":"Scrabble is one of my favorite games, but I really am not impressed with the quality of this travel edition. The board refuses to lie flat, making it nearly impossible to stick letters in the rows bordering the hinges. The letters are difficult to pop into their spaces on the board. The racks, for some absurd reason, have 7 individual slots in them, so shuffling tiles is a near impossibility.This is highly unimpressive. If I want a word game when I'm traveling, I like the Quickwords travel edition MUCH more than this. I love Scrabble, but I'll leave it at home until they come up with a better travel edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel and camping game!","review":"I bought this travel Scrabble game for a camping trip in the middle of nowhere Adirondacks and it was great! When the sun went down at 5pm, we would head to the tent with our headlamps and play this game for a few hours before we went to sleep. I was a little concerned about losing the tiny tiles, but the snap-in feature aleviated that fear completely. It was a great thing to have when you are miles from civilization with a husband who has a short attention span."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel version","review":"We keep this one in our RV. It's compact and zips up to hold everything in completely. The tiles are small and you have to get used to that, and sometimes they can pop out, you just have to be careful. But it has everything, scorepad, pencil, racks, and a bag to hold the tiles, and is useful for travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the cutest little travel game","review":"Comes with the same number of tiles as the full-sized game, but perfect to take on trips or to the park! Plus, the tiles snap in, so you can fold up a game in progress. Pick up a pocket dictionary to keep with it for answering challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"We don't leave home without it!","review":"We use this the most when we go camping. It is a nice way to settle down while dinner cooks and the sunsets, plus it is nice to have if it rains! What I love about this folio is the genius packaging: sturdy and well thought out in design. It is easy to pack up a game and move it to another location. The pieces stay put, so we have even successfully played over several rows on bus and van trips.The only thing missing is a little dictionary to stop squabbles! I have to remember to bring that separately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT little game!","review":"This travel game surpassed all my expectations! It's small and compact making it easy to use ANYWHERE! The clip-on tiles are a real bonus! Other reviews said because of its size it's hard to read the board itself, and since my eyesight is not the best anymore, I was a little concerned about this, but I can see everything just fine! I highly recommend this travel game - even if you're not going to travel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If the tiles would go into the squares, it would be great","review":"I love Scrabble. My parents taught me to play when I was 12 (many, many years ago) and I've loved it ever since. My husband and I bought this version of the game so we could take it on the road with us. And, it would be great except that it's almost impossible to get the tiles into the squares. They pop out frequently when you are trying to put them in. My parents have a travel version where you can just lay the tiles in the squares. Why did they change it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and ... not so good","review":"I give this one five stars for estetics. Its beautiful, contemporary styling makes it one of the classiest-looking scales. The large blue numerals are well-back-lit and easy to see.

However, the only time I got a consistent reading was the first time I stepped on the scale and it gave me the same weight twice. But the next problem was that the weight was incorrect! I tried it out for a couple of weeks but I never did receive the correct weight or the same reading after stepping on and off the scale. So unless you like being frustrated with your products, I would suggest finding another scale.Note: I would recommend an Eatsmart scale, which I have been pretty pleased with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"Scale arrived quickly as promised and initially provided consistant readings little or no variation when taken 2-4 times in a row. Checked it against the Dr.'s office and it was the same (they had just had theirs calibrated).

However, with some use it became apparent either the scale or my body wasn't functioning propoerly. I have access to calibrated weights, and found that after weighing a 50.0 lb weight multiple times over different days, that it was the scale wasn't working. The weight had values ranging between 50.4 to 52 lbs, an error of 1-4%. Given that my diet was calling for a loss of 2 lbs a week, that was an unacceptable error. What was worst was that the scale's precision was terrible. One day yielded 5 straight readings of 51.0 lbs. The following day yielded 50.4. The day after that returned mixed results of 50.4 (2x) and 51.8 (3x). Thinking that perhaps an uneven floor may be causing problems, I carefully placed the in a set spot, and repeated the tests. One day saw values of 50.4 lbs, and the next saw 52-51.8 lbs. At this point I gave up. Avoid this scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfect","review":"I've owned one for almost two years and have never had a problem with it.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably consistent and fairly accurate","review":"My scale reads a little less than a pound lighter than true but it does so consistently if you stand on it in the same place each time. If you stand too much toward the back of the scale (away from the display) you get less consistent readings. I'd have given it 5 stars if it had been dead on accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looses accuracy after a short time","review":"When I first got my Tanita scale, I loved it. It was fairly accurate (if I got on and off the scale to check the accuracy, 3 out of 4 times were the same). However, now that I've had the scale for almost a month, it's lost all accuracy. 4 out of 4 times weighed, and they're all WRONG. I not only get the wrong weight shown, but sometimes 0 (ZERO!) as a weight and also Error messages. I would not recommend this scale. It's nothing more than just a glorified paperweight now. Don't waste your money. I would, however, recommend a Taylor scale. I've had one for 3 years now and it's still working accurately. Plus, it was about $20 cheaper than this one. The only downside is that it doesn't have as high a weight capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm","review":"This scale is very pretty.Not the most accurate scale I've stood on ( and I've stood on a few!)

I did so with trepidation as I've had digital scales in the past that have been both inaccurate as well as wildly inconsistent.

In addition to its performance, I recall when I first took it out of the box being pleasantly surprised by how solidly made it is. I think it looks great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I listened to other reviewers","review":"I bought this scale for digital accuracy.

It looks great.The scale appears accurate because, if you step on and off several times in succession, you will get exactly the same result. However, if you come back a few minutes later, the weight can differ by almost a pound. Come back a few minutes after that and you can get a third result.This variance was acknowledged by Tanita Customer Service who said there is an .8 pound (8/10ths of a pound) \\"tolerance\\" in the product and that there is no \\"tare\\" (zero restore) button on this scale to mitigate that tolerance.We think a one-star rating is appropriate for the Tanita HD372 that, based on our experience, doesn't meet its primary function of providing accurate and consistent results.We returned the scale to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Throw the Box Away!","review":"If you buy this Tanita scale, you better save the box, because you will probably need it for the return. Alas, I didn't do this, so now I'm stuck with an extremely attractive scale that NEVER gives the same weight twice in a row, even if it's just 10 seconds later. What is up with Tanita? Why hasn't this problem been noted and corrected? There's a ton of negative reviews here, certainly enough to indicate a problem with the product. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective unit","review":"This is the first Amazon review I've ever written, but I felt that I have to warn people not to buy this scale. Maybe I got a lemon, but if I were you I wouldn't take a chance. Tanita clearly needs better quality control. Three problems: 1) the scale frequently wouldn't turn on unless the \\"Lb/Kg\\" switch on the back was jiggled; 2) occasionally, the scale flashed an error message for no reason; and 3) once, it turned on simply by someone walking nearby. This was just within 24 hours. I'm thinking about going analog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice scale","review":"I like this scale - maybe not the numbers it shows me, but that's not the scale's fault! I dig the stainless/glass design, and it's got a 400 pound capacity - that's the biggest I've seen for a digital scale. Of course I use it to check my weight, but I've used this to check luggage weight before heading off to the airport, and it's been quite accurate.If you have to have one of these dreaded devices, I think this one's a great choice both for design and function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly erratic","review":"This scale is very erratic. You cannot get an accurate reading. Even if you step on it numerous times it will never give to the same reading with up to a 20 lb. difference. After you step off it will flash the weight so quickly that you don't have time to read it. Then it switches from lbs to metric and bounces around until there is just a plain blue screen. To bad it does not work properly-it is a nice looking scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"The scale was DOA; it simply didn't work.

Believe me, I gave it a chance but every time I would weigh myself (3x every 10 min, then the next day), it gave me a different reading! So pissed off! Not even close! Well, I returned the scale and still waiting for Amazon for the refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Aware!!!","review":"My scale broke after only 8 months. I tried to get in touch with Tanita to obtain the address of a place where I could take the scale to be repaired. It took the company's customer service a week to return my emails and they never returned any of my calls. Moreover, Tanita does not have any place where you can take your scale to be fixed, all it offers you is to ship your scale back to Tanita, but of course, you have to pay for the shipping. Thus, you are better off buying a new scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pretty but doesn't work!","review":"I ordered this for my diabetic mother who has to watch her weight.

I was wrong. First let me say that on rare occasion the scale does work and I would be quite satisfied if it continued to do so. However, I often get a \\"Lo\\" message, meaning the lithium battery is low. I tried a new battery and still get the message. The message will go away if you pick up the scale and press on the battery. Assuming you get by the \\"Lo\\" message the scale lights up with a tap and \\"00.0\\" appears. Then you step on the scale and wait a few seconds for your weight to appear.

I didn't notice the inconsistencies the other reviewer wrote about so it didn't bother me. I just loved the way the author wrote. I felt like I was there. He puts so much emotion behind the story.

It is a classic, recorded in the Fifties, and reflects the classic tradition of this rich musical heritage. The good news is that the songs are exemplary in the genuine quality of their content and their allegiance to the structure of the son, guaguanco, cha-cha, and other forms. The bad news is that recording technology of the period did not produce the clarity of sound that modern listeners are accustomed to hearing.The subjects of the songs are charming. Clever lyrics, too, if you can make out the Cuban Spanish expressions.

It has all about freight hauling, refers, hay hauling, petroleum, want to drive a truck full of gas?, meat, lumber, livestock hauling, logging, and the bed bug haulers.

But....this is not a child's toy. It held our child's (age ten) attention about five minutes as a toy. The wrapping takes about 45 minutes to take the School from the box. By then all enthusiasm for it, is gone. A rating of two stars is about all it's worth as a child's beloved toy,but as a novelty it's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment!","review":"Much smaller and dinkier that one might imagine. The miniscule figures are easily lost both inside and outside the playset. Mattel's most glaring design flaw is failing to magnetize the bottoms of the figures and the barely-indented spaces on which they are made to fit (in order for the barely-discernable \\"actions\\" to take place). The figures keep toppling off which is very frustrating when you are trying to make one \\"disappear\\". We also found the playset difficult to open and close. Considering the big price I really expected something cooler to happen. I guess this doesn't matter now since all the figures have been lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BORING TOY","review":"I boght this thinking I'd really enjoy it.But after 2 nights it got boring.The little people get stuck inside the castle.But it's a great collecters itam."},{"rating":"2","title":"pricey but fun","review":"Although it costs quite a bit (as of November 2001), it is a fun little castle for the kids. The best thing is not just that it is electronic (sounds and movement) but that it connects to other (smaller/less costly) micro playsets (Hagrid's Hut, Hogwarts' Express and Forbidden Corridor thus far) and electrically powers their movement mechanisms as well. It looks like there is room for one more connection/expansion (Quidditch Field maybe?) This playset reminds me of micro-machines playsets.Make sure you don't give to small children, it has lots of easy to lose (or choke on) pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I gave this to my daughter for her 7th birthday.

Unfortunately, although many of the poems in this selection are formal, they aren't all that good. The metrical poems are proficient though not deft (one wishes for the music of a Donald Justice or cleverness of an Anthony Hecht), but the poems rarely involve you; the poems seem too much like diary work, which is great for the writer but not so great for others. I am not a poetry critic, but I can say this book isn't what I thought it was going to be. I figured a selected poems would be the best poems by the poet.

Her use of meter is so thudding it gives one a headache. She isn't artful, clever, or moving. Her poems are rarely ever surprising. A few of the early poems showed promise, but Hadas hasn't lived up to that promise. She, like many poets in her generation, is living on her name and her false reputation.

Where did they come up with the title for this pointless, painfully insulting movie? It posits the idea \\"What if Jesus came today?\\" However, in doing so, it offers nothing new or original and makes mockery of the actual coming of Jesus. It ignores the Last Supper, the Virgin Birth, and insults Christian's intelligence with its pandering psychobabble. The acting is atrocious, the special effects mundane and the musical score is banal and uninspiring. Their decision to make God vengeful and unforgiving at the Crucifixion is unforgivable. I don't know what the movie makers intended but this is one piece of trash that should never have made it to celluloid. Avoid, avoid!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mish Mash","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, as I have often wondered that if I lived in a contemporary time with Jesus, would I have believed Him? However, this movie was pretty terrible. It quoted a lot of Scripture, which was pretty accurate, but it lacked direction and just seemed weird. The cover of the DVD was misleading also, showing \\"Jesus\\" in blue jeans with helicopters hovering about in front of a city skyline. The whole movie looks like it was filmed in the 1980s and takes place in a Cape-Cod type setting. I ended up forwarding through most of it, watching the miracles and then the crucifixion. The end was weird too, with no showing of the Resurrection, etc. I'm just glad this was a bargain bin purchase..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"I was unlucky enough to see this in the theater in Austin, Texas in the early 1990s.I walked out halfway through it because it is so incredibly bad.Do NOT waste one second of your time.If you want to know about Jesus, go to the \\"Bibles\\" section of amazon and buy a King James Bible and read that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahead Of It's Time...And Bad!","review":"Okay...speaking as a Christian and one of the biggest supporters of fresh and innovative ways to relay the message to modern contemporary society, I cringed from the opening to the conclusion of this film. Not that the idea wasn't an awesome one(Jesus' 1st coming being today instead of 2,000 years ago), it was just so lacking and predictable in the acting and plotting departments.If you're interested in a more potent visualization of what things may've been like if Jesus' had never come until our time...I strongly recommend JOSHUA(Jesus \\"returns\\" to reconcile Catholics w/t Protestants in a small town and ultimately reinterates His true, salvific purpose in a meeting with the Pope) and HERO: THE ROCK OPERA (a musical, set in a near yet alternate future in which Jesus story is retold in contemporary context only in N.Y., the Roman Empire evolved into I.C.O.N., no churches save the Temple, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terible","review":"This movie should not be let out into the public. This is not an accurate description of what what happen today, even. The graphics are horrible, and the dialogue is worse.

Other reviewers mention what happens in the end of the movie. How did they make it to the end? This is one of two movies I have walked out of the theatre during. What were they trying to do in this movie? What was the point? I don't know. I mean, Jesus Christ Superstar and Gospell already covered most of the territory in the film 20 years before this was released. In any case, bad writing, bad acting, bad special effects. One thing I learned in this movie: \\"You could lose your SOOOUUUULLLL, for thirty pieces of silver!\\" What a great song. Why doesn't Amazon have the soundtrack to this movie? Now that would be entertaining. There is some humor/camp merit to this film, but not enough to sit through more than 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bike for around the neighborhood!","review":"I bought this for my husband and he loves it!A little hard to put together, if you are not bike smart (like us).

Diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, a relatively new syndrome in the 80's, she went through all the identity confusion, discomfort and hardship of an adolescent not knowing her place in society. With doctors and medics themselves unsure about how to treat the problem, Daphne undergoes many unique experiences as she attempts to fit in with the world around her. As we follow the story of this young woman who has never seen a normal day in her life, we soon learn that even people diagnosed with life-altering disorders are still only human beings ."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fiction than fact.","review":"I find the entire story to be contrived. I know of many people who work in the area of psychology, psychiatry and mental health. Personally I have a degree in Psychology and currently work in the field. There is little evidence in the book that would be a grounds for so many years in institutions! My feeling is there is more illness than is being relayed, classic Sociopathic symptoms come to mind.I fear this kind of diatribe aimed at institutions will hurt the field of mental health and I believe it will harm the gay population as well for allowing fiction to be exemplified as actual experience of a young lesbian woman as I highly doubt she was institutionalized for being a tom- boy. There are too many true and terrible stories that need to be recognized, not this false memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoir of Denial","review":"Scholinski attempts to attack the mental health field in her memoir \\"The Last Time I Wore a Dress.\\" She asserts that she was held through her teenage years because she was not feminine enough in the eyes of idiot doctors. However, I found little evidence of her tomboy nature contributing to her hospitalization. Scholinski never considers the consequences of her actions, she is dishonest, histrionic, and self-absorbed. It is a lack of maturity, not femininity that causes Scholinski's downfall. Amazingly, Scholinski never sees her actions as having anything to do with the state of her existence. This short, simple, and repetitive novel is a memoir of denial."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"This wig is a really funny idea, but the quality of it is not great.

Even as far as cheap wigs go, this was a disappointment. Hair actually consists of two types of material. The pictured, straighter hair quality is only in chunks, with frizzy, lower quality material in the back.

This is may be a money maker, as so many of us like CB, but this is absolutely false advertising.

I washed them in the washing machine on hot, and dried them in the drier as well, and the mold stains stayed. We like the Sassy bibs better, even though they are a little more expensive.

I have packed up all my others and only use Bumkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bibs, but a little pricey.","review":"I've had these bibs for about a month now and they have held up really well so far. There is a good selection of color and designs in the set, and they have not stained like similar bibs have. Also they are not hard like some of the plastic/vinyl bibs can be. I've been throwing them in both my washer and dryer and they have survived just fine, including the velcro which is sticking just as strong as it did the first day they arrived. My only complaint is that they are a bit expensive for a pack of bibs. They are very good bibs, but I still think they are a little overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy and garish","review":"I'm disappointed in these bibs. the ones I received are quite different designs from the ones represented online, and they are really very ugly; there's only one out of the five which I can bear to have my daughter wear.

First off, Britney Spears's song Crazy is the radio version (Not the album version) with the really cool \\"Stop!\\" part. It is a killer remix that was super popular. The Backstreet Boys's hit song I Want It That Way was spiced up a bit for a fast paced version that is as good as the original. However, there are some adult contemporary and alternative rock songs on here. The Barenaked Ladies, Donnas, Matthew Sweet and Phantom Planet provide some really good tracks to this compilation. Don Phillip's song Sugar is superb. The Jars Of Clay song is pretty good too. I love this CD. I use it a ton in my dance classes, and I still haven't gotten tired of it.

The coverage is both accurate and up-to-date (published 2006), so far as the present musicologist can tell. It reads well, fascinatingly so. I recommend it highly for anyone with a deep interest in Mozart and his music.

Over the years he would talk to me from time to time about some of the things that happened, but as a rule he wouldn't say very much about the war. Brian was able to get alot of the stories to print. I remember something my dad said to Brian,\\" your asking me to bring back memories that has taken me almost 40 years of my life to forget\\" Maybe the true inner stories can never be told, but Brian you have shown at least the what really happened.

So many things could go wrong, and that was before there was long-range fighter protection. Just surviving the trip to the target could be a miracle.Discipline and training matter.

The author's research for this book is made into a tight book with the addition of the comments and diary entries from the men that where there. It's hard for me to understand what these men(boys really) went through during this time frame. To face the odds that they faced and to do it time and again is a true sign of the courage that was shown during WWII.

Then he gets mixed up in a search for hidden gold, and it seems like all compasses, from all people, are pointing to this gold. Many bodies will be left behind for the buzzards.This is a short tale, easy to read, and full of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Sackett Story","review":"L'Amour always tells a good story and this book is no exception. The story is about Noland Sackett, the outlaw Sackett, who at the beginning of the book is running for his life, but of course gets sidetracked because of a soft place in his heart for women in distress. But since no good deed goes unpunished, right off one of the women he befriends tries to kill him. The action is fast and furious, with hidden gold, beautiful women, and a whole collection of thieves, gunslingers, Indians, and cutthroats who are also after the hidden treasure (which just happens to be in a canyon where, according to Indian legend, nothing can live,not even birds.) Besides trying to find the hidden canyon, which he is not sure he wants to find, he has to stay alive while at least 10 times in the book someone tries to kill him. But Sackett is a hard man to kill. As with all good stories, in the end he comes out with the gold and the woman. This is a good read if you like westerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustang Man","review":"Louis L'Amour at his best my parents have the entire Sackett seriees.

It is all one piece that is supposed to slide onto a shelf, but if it isn't a small shelf, it won't fit unless you bend it far apart. Then, once you get it on the shelf, you can't put anything directly above it due to the thickness of the piece that holds it in place. It causes anything up there to fall over because it can't sit straight. I am going to be purchasing a different unit because this is pretty much worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I intended to screw this to the underside of my cabinet, which worked wonderfully, so the size of the arm versus the size of my shelving was not an issue for me. I like the way it looks in the kitchen and was able to get several mugs on it. However, the prongs are not spaced quite as far apart as I had anticipated and the mugs hang very close together, which means some of the larger ones do not fit at all when placed directly next to each other.I chose to hang my smaller mugs and teacups, which incidentally were also what I planned to hang in the first place. A few larger mugs could fit if they were staggered, though it would be pointless for someone to purchase this item if only half of the space were available for use.I am happy enough with it that I am purchasing a second one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not made for normal coffee cups","review":"not made to hang normal coffee cups, only for the tea cup type can you fit more than 4 cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold 8 cups","review":"I ordered this product because it is similar to an undershelf wine glass holder which I really like. Although it has 8 hooks, it does not hold 8 coffee mugs. I even tried my smaller fine china coffee cups and they nested on the hooks, which would eventually lead to chipping. It barely fit over the cabinet shelf, although the closely spaced hooks are the main problem. Buy this product only if your coffee/tea cups are very small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Main problem: I can't place normal sized mugs on all the arms because there is too little space between each one. Its a pretty major design flaw. I think it would work as designed if you were only hanging expresso size cups.I can't comment on the under-shelf feature as I mounted mine under the cabinet. Last issue is that because its mounted the weight of the mugs causes the side that would otherwise be supported by the cabinet to sag.I would look for a different product if you are interested in hanging more than 4 normal or oversized mugs from the holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"i bought this to create more space and it did nothing but take it up it doesn't hold all the cups it says it will it is not worth the money i spent on it i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. buyer beware"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!!","review":"I really like to read.

When I first purchased it I was expecting a well written discussion on travel and adventure in Eberron, perhaps similar to a wilderness guide discussing all the fantastic inbetween places in Eberron. What I got was disappointment.This book is, by far, a DM oriented book that describes a number of locations you may wish to insert into an Eberron game. The locations tend to be focused on the mid to extremely high levels. The Prestige Classes are the only part of the book I would consider being oriented towards players, and there are only three of them. The writing, on the whole, is sub par."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid supplement for the world of Eberron.","review":"This is a very solid supplement for Eberron.

I've thoroughly cleaned the top surface of the glass, but there seems to be some residue on the bottom side, which I can't access to clean.The color accuracy of the scanner is also not good.

The countless ranges he has documented guide one safely through the islands without fear of one's GPS receiver having a bad day. His challenge to find an anchorage where you can lie with 6' foot draft that he has not documented is in the finest tradition of sailing bluster.

He said it wasn't very practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not respectful of baby's aliveness/personhood","review":"If you're fine with a book minimizing the personhood of your baby, go with this one. It makes the companion books mom is reading sound like overly hopeful fairy tales... instead of sweet things about your baby's development, it mocks them in early pregnancy. My husband had me trash this book after reading several sections, saying that he just didn't want to think about our developing baby in such a poor way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book offensive","review":"I am an expectant father. In my opinion, this book has an offensive tone, and makes terrible assumptions throughout. Here is a sample what the book suggests a woman might be feeling during pregnancy (literal quotes): \\"afraid you won't love her after the baby is born (after all, she's not the same woman you married);\\" \\"may be afraid she won't have enough love to go around (what with loving you, and all);\\" \\"feelings of jealousy (after all, it was her private pregnancy until now);\\" \\"increasingly dependent---needs to know that you'll be there for her, that you still love her;\\" \\"she might be afraid that you don't love her anymore, and you might leave her.\\" And so on. What kind of weak, spineless, self-loathing creature do the authors take the average woman to be? There are plenty of books with on-the-money, fact-filled advice for fathers; this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"the expectant father","review":"THIS BOOK STINKS. THERE IS A SEGMENT ON WHY HUSBANDS HAVE EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIRS DURING THE LATE STAGES OF THE MOM'S PREGNANCY, AND THAT THERE IS A RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS, SO I GUESS SUPPORTING THOSE WHO PARTAKE IN INFIDELITY. SEEMS TO ME THISHAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PREGNANCY, AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SUB-STANDARD EXCUSES FOR HUMAN-BEINGS AND THE NEED TO FEEL \\"O.K.\\" WITH NOT BEING FAITHFUL TO THEIR SPOUSE. PERHAPS THAT SHOULD BE IN A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE LIBRARY, NOT IN A BOOK WHERE SOMEONE IS TRYING TO LEARN THE INS AND OUTS OF THE JOURNEY THAT AWAITS THEM IN THE HAPPIEST TIME OF THEIR LIFE.

Two stars is a stretch.My main beef with this book is that it talks down to the reader, IMO. Not that I know everything about women and pregnancy but I didn't just get out of fifth grade either. A little insuting on the intelliegence. What red-blood male needs to be told he needs to be more understanding and supporting while his wife is pregant? Hopefully all of us know that already. I also disliked this book becasue the author tended to throw in some of child-rearing opinions that seemd a little far to the left and really not neccessary for this type of book.I have found that \\"What to While You Are Expecting\\" to be much more informative as it moves past the redundant and obvious.Stick with the minority on this one. Buy one of the many other books out there that cover the subject, but better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a man, but made for a woman","review":"While this book is written by a male author, don't look here for any pearls of wisdom that were passed over by the author of the pregnancy book sitting on your wife's bedside table. This book is full of sensible, measured advice. I'm sure that any pregnant woman would be delighted to be attended to by a husband as doting, sensitive and as in tune as the ideal man described in this book. That man, however, would more resemble a woman than the real world creatures we all know and love. If you are already a man for the new millenium, this book may resonate with you. If you still have some Neanderthal man left in your gene pool, this book will annoy you endlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Book lives up to what you expect...Vendor described condition of book well. Fast delivery too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah...not for me","review":"I started reading the first part of the book. All I've read thus far is the negatives such as birth defects, miscarriage, and other bad things. I'm excited about being a father and the last thing I want to here about (in what I thought was a positive book) is the beggining to start like this. I may bring myself to read further, but not what I wanted to read at the beggining"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for dads from a dad","review":"I bought this book for myself when my wife and I were starting to think about having children and it stayed with me thorough the entire pregnancy.The month by month sections are great to read and they provide not only advice about what is going on with the baby, but also what is going with you and with your partner.It has a great balance to it and with resources and an index in the back; it works wonders as a quick go-to guide.My wife loved that I had it because I was informed and she appreciated how the format not only got me in the loop as to what was going on with her, but also looked at some issues that I might be thinking about.A great book, and I've just bought the second one (1st year) so I can continue the series.Good luck to all you future and fellow parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book that I needed","review":"This book was very informative and I do not think an expectant father would need anything else. In fact, I tried to talk my wife out of buying herself books because I thought this was enough considering Google is handy for specific questions.What I did not like is that it is 99% text and considering I have the attention span of my soon-to-be new baby, I found it hard to read at times. That being said, you can read the whole book in a day or two and then reference back to it through the pregnancy since basically each chapter corresponds to a month of the pregnancy.***Keep in mind this deals with just the pregnancy and you will need another book for how to change diapers and things like that. I recommend the Baby Instruction Manual. I love it.All in all it was good and fulfilled my needs and I 100% would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Expectant Father 2nd edition","review":"I love it! I just picked it up today and I can't put it down! It is a very easy and informative read. I blew threw three chapters today.The author puts in plenty of personal advice and is very thorough in research. The part I love about this book is that it breaks a pregnancey out month by month and tells you what's going on with her and what's going on with you. The main focus being you, the dad to be.It answers some of the questions you already have and gives you more questions you haven't even dreamed of yet. One of the continuing themes is communication and understanding. It is actually getting me excited about being a father and past the whole \\"oh my god I'm going to throw up\\" stage and shear terror stages.I think it will be a great book.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous for First-Time Parents","review":"Good book for first time parents (daddy-to-be AND mommy-to-be) as well as for other folks with good intentions. If you already have the \\"Bible\\" - What to Expect when you are Expecting - you already know more than you thought you should - but it is quite dry - whereas \\"Expectand Father\\" is light-hearted and concise. Good read if you are bored with the 'bible'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information; a lot to think about","review":"My wife bought this book for me during our fourth pregnancy. We both enjoyed reading it - I to read the perspective of another father and her to see if I was doing things the way I was supposed to. All in all, the book provides a broad spectrum of information for fathers-to-be - including everything from the physical and emotional changes occurring to the mother to how to plan for your financial future as a dad. The Expectant Father got me to thinking on many occasions and served as a starting point for many pregnancy-related conversations with my wife. Two other books I highly recommend are: A Child is Born which contains outstanding pictures and explanations of the development of the baby, and We're Pregnant!, a great book to read together because it was written by an expecting couple and provides a true-to-life rendition of the ever-changing life of expecting parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've seen for new fathers.","review":"My appreciation for \\"The Expectant Father\\" grows as I read more fatherhood books. Most authors spend 90% of their book trying to convince new fathers that fatherhood really isn't so bad, that we should be nice to the mother and perhaps show up for a doctor's appointment once in a while. For those of us who are already excited about the prospect of having a child, this tact doesn't cut it.Brott certainly advocates being involved during the pregnancy, but he spends much more time explaining how to be involved. Topics from when to tell your friends about the pregnancy to financial planning are covered. More unusually for fatherhood books, Brott describes what the mother is experiencing and how the baby is developing. This has been extremely helpful as my wife's pregnancy has progressed.I keep this book handy, and refer to it at least monthly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnant? Get this for your husband NOW!!","review":"My husband wasn't interested at all in reading anything about my pregnancy. I marked passages out of some of the books I have but I have to admit I'm not surprised that he didn't read them--not a lot there. But when my mom got him this book he changed completely. He'd sit over there on his side of the bed and read and chuckle and not and then we'd have these really amazing conversations about what he was feeling about becoming a dad. Knowing that he cared so much really helped me to be able to talk to him about what I was feeling too.What was really interesting was that he seemed to be having so much fun that I started reading this book too. I learned so much about him and about what men are thinking about as they become fathers.I credit this book not only for bringing out the great dad in my husband (I knew it was there all along) but for making our marriage better too. Sounds like a lot but it's totally true."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Definitely needed this book","review":"This book prepares you what to expect from not only the months before the baby arrives but what changes you can expect in you and your wife. This book covers it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I bought this book for my husband after his interest in \\"What to Expect\\" and my other pregnancy books waned. After thinking about it, it's no wonder--most of the information in those books is about me, not our baby, and this book is written from a father's perspective. He's been steadily reading this as we progress in our pregnancy and shares the things he learns with me. I love that he has a source of information written specifically for him. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for new Dad's","review":"This is a great book! Easy to read - broken up by months - quick read with great tips. A good way to keep up with what's happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book. Great for moms too!!!!!","review":"Great for the moms, too! Some of the women in my prenatal yoga class recommended this book in order to gain a better understanding of what their partners were going through. It brought me and my husband even closer together during those exciting months! Thanks for such a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dad book out there","review":"There are a million books out there for moms to be, but the dearth of books for dads is downright depressing. This book was like a ray of light for me as our child's due date approached. So much common sense information that you're wondering about but don't know where to look for answers. He gives you a great idea of what your wife is going through and what's happening with the baby. And, most importantly, he talks about what YOU are likely to be feeling and thinking. I found myself nodding along so many times as I read this book. It was invaluable and I can't recommend it highly enough. We are expecting kid number two and I am re-reading it. It's been a great way to get me back in the mindset of having a new kid in the family. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like a doggy bag for that?","review":"Absolutely terriable. This book seems outdated. From how he describes his pregnancy test it doesn't sound like he's gone through the process since the 1970s. In many cases his comments just seem stupid. I quit reading after he devoted a whole page to saying that he took his placenta home, stored it in the freezer (along with some of his friends placentas...) then buried them and planted a tree over them. Hope he doesn't grab the wrong item when going in for leftovers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should know this stuff already!","review":"This book presents only basic information that expectant fathers should already know before they read the book, or would be able to \\"intuit\\" naturally from the course of the pregnancy. Those who don't already know this stuff, or don't have the ability to figure it out on their own, have a real problem in my opinion! Also, it simplistically presents \\"typical\\" situations that expecting fathers are \\"expected\\" to feel month-by-month, throughout the 9-month period.....I must be atypical, because I didn't agree with any of the author's ideas of what I \\"should\\" be feeling during my wife's pregnancy. I don't know how many books out there have been targeted at men's experience of pregnancy, but this is a very bad example of one.Don't waste your time with this book. Instead, concentrate on some of the books written specifically for women, which will focus on more the technical realities of pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Child","review":"This is my first pregnancy experience, and the book is a life saver for the expectant father. Nice step by step explanations and timeline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"I have not completed this book yet.

I will update this review after I finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For an expectant father who wants to participate","review":"During our first pregnancy, I read all my wife's book for child birth, pregnancy, and even breastfeeding. I would like to participate in all aspects. Although our excitement toward the pregnancy were the same, some detailed (sometimes trivial) emotional reactions I had were very different from what my wife may have had. The author honestly reported many complex feelings wondering in a expectant father's mind. This book echoed a lot of my personal thinkings and enhanced my intuition and belief in my participation and actually, help in the whole process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good balance of perspective and information","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's not too clinical, though it does have sections in each chapter for what's going on with the mother, the baby, and you. The writer isn't afraid to reveal the worries and concerns he had through his wife's pregnancies, and he takes the time to speak to adoptive fathers and those whose pregnancies end in miscarriage. So he doesn't try too hard to write a \\"guy\\" book, and at the same time isn't overly sensitive and touchy-feely. It's a nice balance of a human voice while still being informative. I'm really glad I bought it, and it's definitely recommended reading for other men who are new to the whole process. In fact, it might even be useful for those who have gone through it before, but I'm not sure, not having been there yet myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of garbage","review":"This book is for complete morons.If you need a book to explain to you that you will soon no longer be the center of your pregnant wife's universe, you need some serious counseling.What a bunch of garbage. I am embarassed that I actually read part of this book -- thankfully, it was a hand-me-down and I did not contribute to the author's pocketbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for This Dad","review":"The Expectant Father by Armin Brott is one of the worst books on fatherhood I read in preparation to become a dad. There is very little in the way of concrete, usable information and the tone of the book is extremely patronizing.

Every expectant father should get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work","review":"I bought one of these for my husband who is, to say the least, not very good at emotional things. He found it condescending and wouldn't read it even though he really needs to follow some of the advice (i.e. He could send out for a pizza instead of me eating cold cereal for dinner because I don't have enough energy for anythng else.)It's well intentioned but the guys who could use this advice probably won't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all men are this stupid !!!","review":"One word- Boring!!This book gets bogged down repeatedly with telling men how they are supposed to act and treat their wives. It treats men like they are all insensitive lunkheads who need the book to let them know that their wives are experiencing numerous difficulties and changes, DUH!Ignore this book, and read \\"What to expect when you're Expecting\\", what your wife is probably reading. Then you'll be more on the \\"Same Page\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"are men really so bad?","review":"You'll only need to read this book if you are an insensitive block of wood. Other than that you'd be better off reading something sensible.

My husband couldn't get past the first chapter because of the overabundance of discussions on paternal jealousy, envy, etc. etc. Not enough discussion of what's going on with the baby early on to balance it out. By the time they get to anything useful, he was thoroughly disgusted with the book. Just have him read your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Somehow this guy has decided that parenthood is all about HIM. He is caught up in jealousy, insecurity, and misinformation. He has decided that his goal should be to be a pain in the [rear] to all around him. I was truly annoyed by him and could not get through this book. I was reminded that if I try to be a good dad I will be a good dad and I don't need some fool to tell me how to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Someplace Else....","review":"As natural childbirth advocates we found Mr. Brott's advice decidely slanted against the use of midwives and unmedicated births. The mention that most women who hold no religious affiliation choose midwives was enough to turn my protruding belly! I have a religious affiliation, work for a religious institution and still have chosen a midwife in birth. I would not mind his book so much if he provided a balanced view of both sides of the coin but he seems only comfortable with what he knows which is why he is not anti-doula (used in his wife's last birth). I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking unbaised advice nor would I recommend it to anyone who has no knowledge of birthing options as he makes his uneducated case very strongly. He is borderline scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared my husband!","review":"I bought ths book for my husband right after I found out I as pregnant because I thought it would put him at ease and give him some good information. Instead, it scared him because he thought that I expected him to follow the bizarre advice in it. When he got to the section in which the author suggests that the father-to-be ask the doctor to let him see the nother-to-be's cervix, we threw it away.This book seriously talks down to women and makes us all seem like simpletons.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a book you can do without","review":"A very superficial book, which goes through the motion of trying to explain pregnancy and how to handle it.Lacks details and depth. It could have done with more inputs from real dads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I bought this book thinking that it would be about how dad's can help the pregnancy process. But it ended up being a book about putting fears in dads. And it is not inclusive of different types of parenting situations. I didn't think it was helpful at all. In fact, the book \\"What to Expect When You Are Expecting\\" has a small section in the back for dads. I should have stuck with my instinct and just read that. It was perfect. I wish I could give this back. A million thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought","review":"This book is too much. I think the best example of how far out this book is comes near the end when the author talks about strategies for salvaging the placenta so you can have some kind of ceremony with it later on.The \\"Be Prepared\\" book is much better to read, entertaining, gets the information out there, and isn't overwrought like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the funny?","review":"I bought this book because several of the reviewers on this site complimented Mr. Brott on his sense of humor. I just kept reading this book thinking, who thought this guy was funny? Granted, it's one of the few books out there written from a man's point of view, so that was nice. But I was disappointed and now I wish I could go back and uncheck \\"This was helpful\\" on the reviewers who said it was an entertaining book. Informative - Yes, Entertaining - No.\\"Bun in the Oven\\", (or \\"Up the Duff\\" as it's titled in Australia) is the book my wife was reading and she laughed herself to sleep every night. I don't recall the author's name, Katz or something. Anyway, my wife loved that book and I enjoyed the chapters she read aloud to me.If you're looking for an informative book written from a man's perspective than this is the book for you. If you are looking for something entertaining, then look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"As a dad, my wife bought this book when she became pregnant.

This is a brief short book which truly made my wife's pregnancy much easier for me to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide for fathers","review":"It's not surprising that Armin Brott's The Expectant Father (now in its second edition) continues to be the bestselling guide to fatherhood. The book -- which offers and delivers \\"facts, tips and advice\\" for dads-to-be -- zeros in on all of the areas of key concern for expectant fathers: money, juggling work and family, providing emotional support to the mother during pregnancy and after the birth, making sense of the changing role of fathers, and -- last but not least -- how your sex life will be affected by the decision to have a baby. The book is extremely well written and provides a rarely seen father's eye view of the joys and challenges of pregnancy and the early weeks after the birth. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too mushy for my husband...","review":"I got this for my husband when we found out I was pregnant. He started reading it but then lost interest because apparently it was too sappy. I haven't read any of it myself, but thought I would review it according to what my husband thought.

He likes to know what's going on with baby and me. I enjoy him sharing little tidbits with me also.

Overall, great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source of quick (and in-depth) information","review":"The format of the book is particularily helpful in that it presents the reader with the quick, down-and-dirty information that one is looking for, but also digs a bit deeper.

We both feel that the information offered is old, does not typically jive with the current popular pregnancy books (Dr. Sears Pregnancy book, etc), and is not very in depth. It is obviously aimed at men, which is nice, very few pregnancy books are.

It makes my husband feel more involved since he has his own book that talks about \\"men's\\" issues. It is funny and very readable and provides enough information for dads-to-be. However some of the advice is a bit strange. For example to reduce your monthly expences the author suggest \\"to get rid of your housekeeper\\" or \\"trying to cook most of your meals instead of going out\\". And there's nothing practical for those of us who don't have a privilegde to have a housekeeper, or go out every night. It also confused my husband with the question of the baby shower. The book suggests that the husband should organize it, but doesn't really says how to do it, so my husband ended up involving me in organization of my own baby shower, and finally I asked him to drop the idea.Criticism aside, I would recommend this book for all dads-to-be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"After reading up on almost everything pregnancy related, I thought I give this book for expecting fathers a shot.

He said the information was mostly common sense and he did not like how the book basically assumed the father-to-be was an idiot who could not relate to his wife/girlfriend or the life change in general.

It is easy to read and has clear explanations of what to expect and how to plan ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 reasons why I bought this for my husband","review":"1. to get him involved in my pregnancy right from day one2. so that he would have his own pregnancy book to read while I was reading mine3. so that he'd understand what was going on in his head (he's been so worried about me, the baby, money -- everything)4. to encourage him to talk to me about what he's been thinking (I figured he could just point to a section in the book and say, \\"read this\\")5. because I want him to read parenting books down the road....As it turned out, my husband really liked this book. He's also really enjoyed the follow-up books by the same author, so if you're looking for some books for the father-to-be in your life, I'd recommend anything by Armin Brott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's hollow, silly,and time-wasting platitudes for you","review":"The inane cartoons that rarely have much pertinence to the topic set the tone for this trite book that factually tells you less than one could imagine. This book is written for the barely literate neanderthal who needs to be reminded that your pregnant wife should be treated with consideration or that you might care about the development of your embryonic child: it's full of the most obvious commonsense \\"ideas\\" and more filler than I can stomach. That such a worthless book should be published says much about how few books there are for expectant fathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating fluff","review":"If you are the type of guy who feels like saying to your wife, \\"Hey, I'm pregnant too\\" then by all means, read this fluff. However, if you want to gain as much perspective as you can on your wife's pregnancy and childbirth, and your role in this process, you will do better to read pieces of the other books you will surely have. The section in What to Expect When You're Expecting on the father's role is a good example. Every other decent pregnancy book has something for you, too.Advantages to this book: 1) Brief. Want something even shorter? Rent or buy The Dad Film (and I highly recommend it!). 2) Discusses financial planning, something you may not be considering just yet. However, now that you have been reminded, what you really need is a book on financial planning.Do not waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Useless: Insulting","review":"This book seems to think the only purposes a father has are to (a) earn the money, (b) plan the finances, and (c) try to survive the overemotional antics of his spouse and child.There is precisely one chapter that deals with any kind of interaction between the father and the child, and even that one is mostly about not letting fatherhood interfere with your work life.My husband threw it across the room; we recycled it. It is profoundly insulting to the entire parent-child relationship, as well as utterly useless (for anything but financial planning)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good breadth of information","review":"My dad gave me this book after reading it himself and making notes in the margins.

Well, given to me to give to my husband when I was pregnant. \\"The Birth Partner\\" is a much better book, and my husband swears by it, and even buys it for his friends whose wives are getting pregnant. In fact, something happened during the birth part that is almost completely described and covered in the book \\"The Birth Partner\\". This one is probably a bit too polished (make it less real) for the dads to be. If you are a husband that wants to be involved quite a bit, go get \\"The Birth Partner\\" instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on psychology, short on practicality","review":"Whether this book will interest you depends to a large extent on what you're looking for as an expectant father. It was not particularly what I was looking for, but other people might find it useful. The focus of the book is on emotional and psychological reactions, and generally non-specific touchy-feely topics (\\"What You're Going Through\\"... \\"What She's Going Through,\\" etc.) As a new dad, I want to know stuff like how to change a diaper (like most men without kids, I haven't a clue), what I should be thinking about in terms of saving for college (tax issues, investment vehicles), whether I can take my wife to a smoke-filled restaurant once or twice, etc., topics that are glossed over in this book. If you want suggestions for keeping your wife happy, like giving her a foot massage, this book is for you. If you want more practical advice (and I assume this is what most guys are looking for), this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of shallow and trite observations","review":"It's hard to describe this book without insulting the author for this ridiculous and shallow work; indeed, I often felt my intelligence insulted when I read it. It adopts the most demeaning and infantile attitude towards the men who are supposed to read it: as if we need to be continuously reminded that pregnancy and birth are life-changing events, and the book often stupidly reminds its supposed audience that our wives' experiences are physiological and emotional or that we men have roles to play.The book's least-common-intelligence tone can be appreciated in 3 minutes by leafing through the stupid and unnecessary cartoons that provide filler to expand the book. They aptly appeal to an audience with short attention spans and a hunger for pointless diversion--and they rarely have anything to do with the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful yet not deep, far too much merchandizing","review":"This book is filled with a lot of information that becomes helpful along the way and it's directed to first time Dads. There are many categories of information that one has to learn, such as the products that one has to buy, and it's amazing to me how I didn't know any of it. I had never taken care of a baby or learned much about the subject, so I got a lot out of The Expectant Father.After reading this book, I saw one of his instructional videos and then seeing him talk, I understood much better how passionate he is about his work and the commercial aspects. It's a kind of calling to Brott and he has a website that promotes his books, speaking engagements, various products and he even has his own Mr. Dad seal of approval. That's a lot of promotion, but somebody has to do it. I regret paying to see the commercial, yet there was some helpful advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Dads to be!","review":"This book has a lot of great information written in a way the new Dads can enjoy.

Black Cloud is a kickin song, featuring Jay Gordon from Orgy, its fast paced and with good instuments, kinda techno-electric with good guitar and bass. The guys of CxT do know how to play, and play good! Players (only love you when they're playing) sings about players and their game; Revolving door is kicked back and catchy, with tight guitars; Lollipop Porn is a hard jamming song with a fierce beat.

Then I got the album.I hated it instantly. This album is basically WHITE RAP. And bad white rap at that, by a \\"Mac Daddy\\" who does no more than brag of his prowess with women (yay for him).

I decided to listen to the entire albulm BEFORE buying it and you know what? I LOVED IT! With all the negative reviews I have read of Crazy Town, there isnt anything I can say to make my opinion more relevant than the next music fans. I can only recommend that you find a way to listen to it BEFORE you make the purchase, because I KNOW how much CD's cost now-a-days and I would not wish a bad purchase on anybody.

While they are guilty of becoming popular with rap-rock, they do it better than almost any other band out there. They have amazing, infectuous beats, hard, driving guitars that are also very melodious at times, and Jay Gordon, the keyboardist, is just awesome. Each song has a different sound and feel to it. Most people know \\"Butterfly\\", which is a great, although overplayed song. No other song on the album sounds like \\"Butterfly\\". Now, some might think this is bad, but it is just the opposite. It is amazing. In my opinion, \\"Dark Cloud\\" is the best song. But, you should just buy this CD and decide for yourself.

Despite whatever individual talents of some of those who were assembled for the band and the album (including DJ Adam Goldstein and drummer James Bradley Jr.), the only thing that's remarkable about the album is the fact that it actually sold a million records, proving that for a brief history in time people actually enjoyed listening to this. The first two singles floundered, the third single \\"Butterfly\\" took off because the hook was lifted from an existing RHCP song, and after that, the group went back to relative obscurity.Rumor has it these guys have a new album coming out soon.

Amelodic music mashed with idiotic, immature, moronic lyrics that make no sense and are downright degrading and offensive to women everywhere is what these clowns are making. It's sad that rock has sunk to the lowest state ever in 1999. I will forever remember 1999 and 2000 as the worst years in rock music because all that was popular was despicable profanity ridden drivelheads like Limp Bizkit, Eminem, Crazy Town, etc. that literrally are brainwashing the youth of America with mush like this.

One of those bands that better enjoy the limelight while they got it, because I can tell you know, it ain't gonna last. Butterfly, which is sadly the best song, wasn't even created by them.

I hope they come to England soon, would love to see them in Concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Although this CD has been out for more than a year and a half, Crazy Town is just now getting popular around the US.

Let me just say that this CD rocks. I quickly went and bought the CD the same night I heard these songs and I wasn't disappointed.There is such a wide variety of influence in their music from old-school House of Pain and Beastie Boys to the new flavor of Limp Bizkit.If you are into deep beats with hard chords, Crazy Town is the place to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This has to be simply the best I have heard in a while.

The lyrics are very much in the style of \\"Crazy Town is in da house, and we will show you where it's at, etc., etc.\\" \\"Butterfly\\" is nothing more than the RHCP's \\"Pretty Little Ditty\\" intro sampled, with a hip hop beat slapped on it. The look of the video for that single is straight out of the Backstreet Boys. On top of all that, from what I saw, the Ozzfest tours they did were horrendus. Keep far away from these guys.

Empowered by a strong commercial marketing, these recordings are quite in pair with modern unhealthy American Hot Dog culture. Not that there do not exist other inspiring mantra recordings in a modern rendering �C there are actually plenty of them.

The prince marries her because he wants \\"a girl with spirit\\", totally clueless to the fact that forcing her to give up her dream will turn her into a bitter housewife. This idea that it was OK for women to have careers, as long as they give them up once they get married is a very common theme in 50s popular culture.

This album has a pretty versatile line up with clear and crisp sound and well mixed production. This album features allot of the tools of Kenny Loggin's past. The emotional ballad in I MISS US that should never have gone unnoticed as a single & THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY. The funky grooves of IT'S ABOUT TIME, BROTHERS & THE UNDENIABLE GROOVE. Plus, a very interesting track titled DOIN' IT RIGHT which renders mild qualities of big band influences. Overall there isn't much here to complain about as this album conducts itself with tasteful lyrics and vocals. From the Michael Jackson & Justin Timberlake meets gospel sound of IT'S ABOUT TIME to the short but sweet ballad NO OTHER VOICE this album is entertaining.

My puppy likes to tip over her waterbowl so I needed a way to hang a drip bottle. I found one normally used in gerbil cages that attaches with a screw and bracket - and cut a tiny hole in the canvas to push the screw through and hang the bottle.

It takes a couple chapters to get into the heart of the story, but once you learn about the life of Xing-Xing you can't put the book down. To read about someones life being so terrible and living somewhere that they are not wanted, it is very interesting to me. I am not living in that situation, and can't not fully comprehend what it would be like to live with a stepmother who doesn't want you. I enjoyed reading this book and learning about some of the chinese culture. Xing-Xing tries to live a noble life in honor of her parents who have both passed away. I was very happy with the ending, that with all the hard work Xing-Xing has done it pays off. I would definitely recommend this book to those who want to read about how living a good life can pay off in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book was OK...","review":"This book was so exiting at the end, boring most of the time in the middle, and fun to read at the beginning.

I thought this book was OK, and I would recommend it to people who like fiction books about adventure in a different culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Cinderella?","review":"I think that this book is great. It follows the main story line of the classic Cinderella... but not so sugar coated.Fourteen year old Xing Xing struggles to live a normal life. Her mother and father are both dead, and now she has to suffer through life with her horrible stepmother and stepsister. She is forced to do tasks such as chop wood and clean all day, while her stepmother and stepsister go have fun in town.Xing Xing's only friends are a pet raccoon and a goldfish, and at one point, she comes to believe that the goldfish is actually a reincarnation of her mother! When the 'evil stepmother' knows Xing Xing grows emotionally attatched to the fish, you really begin to hate her.I think this book is entertaining but can also depict Cinderella in a much different way. I love how instead of the classic fairy tale, Napoli makes it much more.This book is a quick read for anyone curious about Cinderella, Chinese, or both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOUND to make you fall asleep....","review":"I agree with the other reviews....although i love hearing retelling of folklores, this book was very boring.

It was too childish for me and should be located in the children's section instead of the teen section of the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I was hoping to find a DVD that provided good instruction on Zil work and have found it here. Elsa presents the Zils and accompanying examples of dance to help transition the beginner into the feel of the rhythms.More than a simple right-left-right, Elsa teaches you the advantage of listening and interpreting the beat so that you need not be tied to coordinating the hand and footwork. This system is simple and joyful. The doumbek of Raquy Danziger is amazing as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Elsa is very friendly and positive. Sometimes I found her a bit clumsy, not as graceful as other dancers I have seen. But she has her own style and uses some new moves or combinations I didn't know.However, I think it would be easier for the viewers to practice, if the combinations were demonstrated in front of a mirror.I find her way to teach how to play the zills very interesting but I think that there is one problem: the zills I bought don't have the same sound. So the 'tek' sound of the right hand is a bit different from the 'tek' sound of the right hand. It is important to check that first, otherwise the rhythm won't sound as it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly Dance with Zils","review":"I loved this DVD!

I now play ambidextrously but have a hard time explaining the concept to my beginner zil students. This DVD has given me some enciteful ideas to help me with my zilling. There were a few things that were a little confusing, I had never heard of \\"Balady Triples\\" and finally figured out she meant \\"Triples\\" or what we sometimes call a \\"gallop\\".Also when Elsa does her exercise switching between \\"Balady Triples\\" and \\"Basic\\" it would be helpful if she did it once slow and counting, since for many the 123 1 123 1 123 pattern is a new concept. I was taught Beledi aka Masmoudi Seghir a little differently from this. Otherwise, this would have been a 5 star DVD. I always enjoy World Dance New York products and find them a great value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the buy","review":"I'm an aspiring bellydancer and I thought this video was pretty helpful.

The exercises and examples are tired and over-used and are not \\"pioneering\\" as she claims. I am disappointed that a fine publisher like Tarcher fell for this material and added it to their line of self-help books.The reader who is looking for something substantial on how art taps emotions might look to Pat Allen's Art is a Way of Knowing. Living with Feeling lacks both depth and feeling and substance. I hope that Cappachione will someday take a risk and really dig down deep for some new material that will help readers once again use art as healing in a meaningful way and that she will quit rushing to get another book out onto the shelves just to make a quick sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can finally cook delicious rice!","review":"I've never been able to cook rice, but I recently decided to try to recreate a persian rice dish called \\"chelow\\" that I love and bought this rice cooker for $19.99 at WalMart.

Even my husband liked it! I read a few reviews for other rice cookers here and a lot of people complained that they boiled over, but this one didn't -- it cooked great. The pot is non-stick and removable for easy cleaning. And did I mention the rice was perfect?

Both rice cookers have the same problem - they burn the rice no matter how closely you follow the instructions! The instructions say that you should stir the rice if you want to let it sit more than 30 minutes, so that it will not get burned. However, by the time the \\"cook\\" light switches off, the rice is already burnt black on the bottom! This isn't a rice cooker, it's a rice burner. There's no way to adjust it, because there's only one button. Buy some other rice cooker; this one is a major rip off and greatly lowers the opinion I have of Black and Decker. This should never have passed quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this item like the Black Plague","review":"This \\"security\\" device can easily be removed by pulling the trailer one or two wheel revolutions with it still attached.

On several occasions I ran into stopped traffice due to bad accidents and not once was I notified in advance by the traffic feature.

The signal is either poor, or the traffic reporting system is very bad. Soemtimes I will be sitting in traffic at 6 mph and there is no indication on the GPS that there is traffic. The signal is poor if I am more than 20 miles away from detroit, so planning my route BEFORE I am stuck in traffic is not realistic with this device. The specificity is poor - in other words the symbols don't tell you whether the traffic is very bad (i.e. how slow is the traffic). It might say heavy, but sometimes that means traffic is going 50 MPH.It is actually sometimes more accurate to just listen the radio.Maybe the idea with tracking our cell phones will come into fruition some day.

It's not particularly helpful for reporting on \\"slow traffic\\" and the like, but it does attempt this. Yeah, I still plug it in, but I check the radio for a much more reliable traffic reports.Unless the quality of the reporting gets much better, there's no way I'm renewing this service.

This is because the quality of the product cannot be controled from these companies. If I were you, I would shop someplace else for this watch.

Their previous videos have been at a slower pace with calm and gentle backgrounds. This video has hypnotic backgrounds and a much faster pace. I'm not sure I can put my finger on all of the changes. The Wiggles themselves have severly short haircuts which looks kinda of military, and not warm and friendly. Dorothy, Wags and Henry all have a different look and none of these do I see as good. The music is more at a disco tempo then one suited for little ears and eyes. It also seems as though the Wiggles themselves are trying to be more animated and trying too hard.

We discovered The Wiggles on The Disney Channel last spring. My granddaughter was immediately charmed, much to our dismay. The adult s here found them really annoying. But, it wasn't very long until we could sing along with all the old favorites.This video was the first we purchased. It holds her attention all the way through. She is usually not wanting for it to end. We also own Wiggly Safari and Dorothy's Magical Birthday Adventure. The latter is more in the format of a real movie. It is very entertaining in a Beatles \\"Help\\" sort-of-way. So far we love every one of the videos. Thank goodness for the Wiggles...anything that keeps a 2 year old busy for an hour at a time had my undying gratitude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiggly potty?","review":"These guys know they are selling to an American audience, could they try to control the accent a little? My 3 yr old is certain the whole tape is about a \\"wiggly potty\\" and wants to know why they don't show the potty! The songs are only a little catchy, hard to learn since they are so fast, unusual and heavily accented. I agree with another reviewer that the dances are too difficult to pick up on. Also there's a little too much of that stupid pirate - freaks my daughter out. This is our first wiggles video and I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as entertaining as some","review":"The wiggles are a favorite here but for some reason this one doesnt hold the attention of my son as much as the others. He does enjoy some of the tape like the hoop dee doo song (the first one), Captain's magic buttons,the farm song and Marie's wedding. This is a definite good buy but in terms of choosing your first couple of wiggly videos I would choose Toot toot, Wiggle time, or Yummy Yummy. These are excellent videos and my son just loves them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is too mental","review":"My son and I love the wiggles. He squeals with delight whenever the show comes on TV. We recently viewed this video at a friends house and we all just sat there wondering what we were watching. Even my 14 month old son just sat there with a blank look on his face. It just didn't seem to have any of the farmiliar bits. I agree that there is way too much Captain Feathersword, who seems to be slightly.....off. This video is nothing like the show, and even the animals seem different. None of the songs are recognizable. No old favorites like Hot Potato, Big Red Car, or others that we had hoped for. If you're looking for something to entertain a smaller child, stick with their Playhouse Disney episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the better ones","review":"My son loves The Wiggles and has for some time. We have bought a lot of their tapes from Australia itself. We had the music CD before we had the DVD to this particular one, and we were disappointed when we saw this. My son does not hardly watch it at all, though he still likes the CD. He is only 4 and he even said \\"boring\\". He does like the dinosaur amination video but that is because he loves computer animated stuff other than that there are no real dance routines that made the other films so famous. I think we could have invested in saving for the next DVD instead of buying this one :("},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiggles - Hoop-Dee-Doo","review":"I'd have to agree TOTALLY with \\"the viewer in Dallas\\". It's really disappointing that the Wiggles \\"got a budget\\" because the \\"new style\\" is not their own. Too intense, too many graphics, etc. for the little ones. Even my 5 year old didn't like this one. Too bad you can't return DVD's after their opened. Next time I'll read the reviews more closely. Hope the older Wiggles video's are still available. I am going to send a note to Lyric and the Wiggles Website to let them know how we are feeling. I think they'll care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoop Dee Do is to much To Do for toddler","review":"My 2 yr old daughter absolutely loves Wiggle Time so I purchased this DVD thinking she would love it as well. Where are all the nice \\"simple, catchy songs\\" like on Wiggle Time? The sets are elaborate, the songs are long. Neither my daughter nor myself enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party","review":"My daughter and I love their dances. She especially loves the song \\"Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party\\", the music is so beautiful. I'm glad I've bought this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of our Wiggles Videos","review":"Our family loves the Wiggles, but this particular tape does not hold my 20-month-old son's attention and I can't bear to watch the whole thing. Instead of the simple blue backgrounds of many other tapes, there are distracting, flashy, backgrounds, and the songs are not as catchy as on the other tapes. Other moms of toddlers I know feel the same way about this video. I bought this one by accident when many people recommended The Wiggles' \\"Dance Party\\" and I thought that \\"Hoop De Doo, It's a Wiggly Party\\" was the same thing. Warning to others-- it's not! I recommend Yummy Yummy, Wiggle Time, Dance Party and Wiggly Safari."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"We have all of the Wiggles videos. My two year old is obsessed with them! This one is the only one that doesn't captivate him. His favorite part is learning the dances and dancing along, and he can't really do that with this one. There is much more random dancing instead of easy-to-follow choreographed movements. Watching any other of the Wiggles videos will get him up and dancing, but when this one is playing he tends to just lay on the floor and watch. I would suggest any of the videos except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"oustanding","review":"by far and away one of my favorite releases of the year. this album deserves more attention than it's getting although I'm hearing more and more about him. his cover of the knife's \\"heartbeats\\" is brilliant.this album is incredible---like a better version of the kings of convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Jose Gonzalez has a great folksy mellow sound that is bound to become popular. The songs on this album are consistently excellent. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This man is incredibly gifted and talented and we're lucky he's willing to share with the rest of us. The more I listen to this cd the more I appreciate his gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music...Not for Everyone.","review":"I was lucky to have my sister send me this CD...I would have never come across it on my own...I'm not musically savvy enough! It's like Elliot Smith's mood/lyrics meets Jack Johnson vocal/playing quality. It's a hauntingly beautiful CD with moving lyrics and excellent acoustic guitar work. In a world of NOISE it's nice to have a CD like this in your collection for those days when you're feeling quiet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooooooooooooooze","review":"Boring beyond words, the only life associated with this album occurs when the voice gets so on your nerves you have to hit the NEXT button before you jump out of a window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful debut","review":"If you like Nick Drake, you'll like this album. The songs are hauntingly beautiful. Track 4, Heartbeats, is worth the price of the CD alone, but the rest of the songs are excellent as well. I look forward to his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entire album is awesome","review":"Before I knew about Jose, I would hear him on Pandora and every time, I'd check to see who was singing because I liked it so much. Jose Gonzalez is the best rainy day music, sunny day music, any day music. He has such a light breezy feeling throughout the entire album. I never feel like I want to skip a track, I just listen to the entire thing. That is a plus when you can listen to an entire album without feeling like only a few songs are good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Veneer","review":"This is another one of those albums I wish I could give more than five stars to! It definitely gets better with repeated listening, until it almost becomes a part of you and you have to hear it on a regular basis. The blend of voice and guitar is out of this world and the overall feel is very chilled and moving at the same time. I agree that it is sadly too short, but every track is perfection and you have his latest album out now to keep you going when this album bites. I cannot recommend this album enough, give it a go and see how it makes you feel.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be a great folk musician but....","review":"frankly not for everyone. Jose Gonzalez explores intimacy in this album through his melodic guitar, but frankly I was not able to dig all the album, perhaps I was not in the mood? or maybe was too folky for me?. Certainly I have read several reviews and it seems that everyone loves Jos��, I wonder if it is an overrated musician?,or it just maybe that I didn't appreciatted that much that it didn't touch any fiber for me?.There's always something for everyone, and \\"Veneer\\" is not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Every English major has one writer who is responsible for their journey into the field. I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut. I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer. I do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them to write. This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped it would give me some insight. I didn't. The conversations, at times, are interesting. But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the 79 pages. If this had of appeared in a magazine, I would have read it and not whined. If this had appeared in a magazine, I wouldn't have wasted over 10 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really enjoyed Stringer's Grand Center Winter and am a life-long fan of Vonnegut. But I was terribly disappointed by this edited transcript from a couple of conversations between the two writers. Given the great potential of such gifted writers, this book seems little more than mutual admiration; it's short on substance or gravity and provides little insight to those of us who may be interested in the art of writing. I would have probably felt far better about this if it had been, instead, a magazine piece. But at this price I expected more substance."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-10b74fa5"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/54.md","filePath":"sponsor/54.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/54.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
