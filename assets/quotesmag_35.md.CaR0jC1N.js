If this book were printed in a standard font, I suspect there would be 50 pages of usable material at best. About 20 pages of the book are nothing more than the same form (of very dubious value) duplicated over and over again.

I just couldn't put it down!!! Also, one major problem I have with most comtemporary writers is that they leave loose ends throughout the story, Parker does not. Each character becomes completely real within the text, even when they are fleeting. This allows one to become completely immersed in the world which she creates. Bravo Mrs. Parker, Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara Parker abandons thrillers for romance!","review":"Well, folks, she had me fooled. I thought from her past books she was a serious writer of the mystery thriller genre. Boy, did I make a mistake. With this novel, she enters the romance market. Move over Catherine Coulter!

John Grisham,Lawrence Block, James Lee Burke, Tom Clancy,Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Clive Cussler, Nelson Demille, Jane Evanovich,Elizabeth George,Stephen Hunter, Robert B. Parker, T, Jefferson Parker,Ridley Pearson and Mary Willis Walker have one less competitor in their genre. What a disappointment! A 4 hour waste of time reading this book.

Keep up the great story line Barbara!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Parker's Best in this Series-Too Many Politics.","review":"Gail and Anthony are about to be married but not without problems and doubts. When a case comes along involving Thomas Nolan, trouble is on the rise. Nolan is a big opera star, and everyone in Miami wants to kick him out. That is simply because of terrorism from Cubans in the past. And when Gail begins the filing of a lawsuit, bad things begin to happen. Gail is badly hurt and nearly killed a few times when she tries to find out what is going on behind these killing sprees. She has her eye on Felix Castillo, Thomas's bodyguard, but that changes when other clues to the mystery come up, and near the end a bombing occurs in a building where Gail is, and Felix is hurt right along with her.There was a lot of politics in the book, and since I am not a fan of politics, it bored me a bit though I managed to find parts of it interesting enough to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"I have enjoyed previous Barbara Parker books as well her characters Gail and Anthony. I am also a major fan of the great collection of Florida mystery writers. This book misses for me for the same reasons other Sunshine State writers have. When they get into the Cuban exile politics my interest wanders. If I want political intrigue, I'll read a political intrigue novel. But, when I pick up a mystery novel by a familiar writer I have no patience for the exile story. Miami has more than enough murder, mystery and crime to draw upon (log on the Miami Herald)and keep readers turning pages without politicizing the Cuban migration. On the plus side, Ms.Parker draws wonderfully clear characters and paints outstanding word pictures of Dade County. When she keeps it to the courtroom procedure and amateur sleuthing I find her books far more compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Going","review":"I have enjoyed the characters, Gail Conner and Anthony Quintana in previous Parker novels, but they weren't strong enough to carry this one.

However, it is superficially researched and lumps together public opinion, social movements, interest groups, trade policy, etc., as if they were acting in the same field and part of a single, homogeneous phenomenon. Although the overview of trade debates in several sectors is interesting, the authors reduce antiglobalization politics in France to a nostalgic longing for French 'grandeur'. Such a label is perhaps applicable to some sectors of the French elite (Chevenement, Seguin, Pasqua) but certainly not to the wide variety of social movements and associations that focus on the democratic deficit and the increase of inequalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must\\"!","review":"\\"The French Challenge\\" is a MUST for anybody who wants to understand contemporary France.

His underlying assumption is that it is much more difficult for outside salespeople to apply the usual techniques, since their lives are so filled with uncertainty. Plus salespeople tend to be action-oriented, so they don't commonly want to spend time planning or setting up systems. But, Kahle argues, such organization is critical to success in sales. While Kahle claims that most time management principles and tactics \\"totally miss the unique challenges of the field salesperson,\\" the material he covers in the book sounds very familiar. It echoes many other books about goal setting, problem solving, decision making and effective selling. We find that while this may be a helpful review of fairly common material in the guise of time management, the information is hardly unique - although its focus on salespeople's needs may give it additional value for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CD's!","review":"I've really enjoyed this CD and listen to it often.

That would be O.K. if that is how they marketed their product but they lead you to believe that each mat is a custom fit mat to your exact make and model. I would give them a break on their claims if they didn't charge top dollar while giving you a false sense of security that you are buying an exact fit mat.

After being incredibly disrespectful, they offered to take them back if we paid to ship them back to them. My dad paid $150 for a set of floor liners that were worse than a $40 set from AutoZone.

In my old DVD holder, there were four slots per page/face (8 slots/sheet) and adding to the collection meant that I had to pull out inconveniently many DVDs to keep them alphabetical; it just didn't work for me. Another benefit is that you get to throw out all those plastic DVD containers which bulk up fast.

Anthony Hopkins hasn't branched out much from his past roles, so his performance to me seems typical of what you'd expect. There are parts of this story that I simply cannot believe. I know this movie was based on a book, but in today's society where political correctness and diversity are shoved down our throats, I find it equally hard to believe that Coleman grew up with a prim and proper black family that had zero ebonics in their speech, zero animosity toward whites and were jewish to boot. It's just too much of a stretch for me. It seems to me all of this was thrown together to further the believability of the story, which otherwise would not be believable.

Wentworth Miller (Dinotopia, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) who portraits Hopkins in younger form does his best as well.

I have aleays loved Hopkins and Kidman and Harris is a great supporting actor for every film.But this film is really disappointing. Not only for the actors, but for the story which is too confusing and plenty of flashes-back. The accident in the first scene is also a failure, because the film loses all interest. Sinise's part is really strange: he appears in the beginning till Hopkins refuses to continue writing his book; in the middle of the film (I had forgotten of him) he appears in a dinner with Hopkins and Kidman and, then, forgotten. At the very end of the film, Sinise's character is again in the screen and now he plays the main role.Hopkins' play is really decent (I was fed up of dangerous-minds characters), but I think he is over-exploited.

So I had the pleasure of simply watching it with no expectations, no book to compare it with, etc. The result was a compelling story of twisted lives coming to grips with themselves and their pasts. Nicole Kidman has to be one of the greatest actors of our generation, since she plays her white trailer trash role to perfection, accent and all. Anthony Hopkins use of subtle expression and understatement add tension and depth to the film. If you like complex, interwoven stories with good characters, you will like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely intriguing.","review":"The Human Stain starring Anthony Hopkins is full of raw emotion, shame, and the power to forgive are the themes explored in this provactive film.

Then there's the exquisitely beautiful Nicole Kidman, who does her best to look plain and bedraggled. Both premises are essential to buying into the movie. Both premises are also utterly unbelieveable. Hopkins and Kidman are superb actors, but I could not suspend my disbelief.

I found it to be basically a (partial) textbook about the war in which Mr. Shaara had inserted either fictional thoughts for real figures or created fictional characters to flesh out the story. I didn't find the characters believable at all, and much of the time I felt that Mr. Shaara was \\"talking down\\" to his readers.

If you are familiar with his style you will not be surprised to find the story unfolding through the eyes of select individuals all of whom bring a slightly different perspective to the conflict. If you are new to Jeff Shaara I believe you will find his style very approachable and enjoyable.

For example, I had no idea who Lufberry was. I kept wondering---\\"where's Rickenbacker?\\"The book has a few flaws and a couple of historical inaccuracies, but overall it does a fine job of presenting America's entry into the war, the air war that included Americans even before the US officially entered the war, and finally, the hell that was created by the amchine gun, the tank, and barbed wire.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Reading","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I also learned how the armistice which \\"ended\\" the first world war was actually part of the circumstances which led to the second world war.

The cover art shows soldiers coming out of the trenches as well. I was excited about the prospect of reading fiction about the soldiers in the trenches. And the introductory chapter came through for me in fine style. Very well written and should have gotten the book off to a good start.Then Shaara spends the next dozen or so chapters on fighter pilots! How did his story of the pilots related to the title \\"To the Last Man\\"? I can understand a need to place the entire story of the war into its historical context, but this facet of the story went on forever and ever!My attentions were barely holding on when we got to General Pershing and the AEF, but even then it fell a little flat. Too much politics and not enough on the soldiers themselves.Not Shaara's best work in my opinion.

It is a wonderful read and difficult to put down. I immediately launched into a Pulitzer prize winning book on the WWII war in Northern Africa immediately afterwards, so I have a good recent comparison.

It is fanastic and worth the money.The way in which Shaara describes scenes and events just envelops you and gives you the feeling you were there. He not only describes the battles and scenarios, but also describes the mental and emotions goings-on of the characters. Also, the format in which he writes his novels, switching from place to place and character to character chapterly, is very nice.

Trash Bin","review":"I am a huge Elizabeth Bevarly fan, but this was not her usual fare. This story was missing the humor and wit that is evident in every one of her stories. But, this was her very first book - something I didn't realize when I purchased it. A businessman, Silas, finds himself on a remote island in the Caribbean after his plane goes down. He meets (and within like 4 days) falls in love with Hester, a woman who also escaped the city life for an island lifestyle. The \`romance' is superficial and uninteresting, and the characters - both the primary and secondary ones - are undeveloped. The book is bad. I would recommend sticking to modern Elizabeth Bevarly stories and staying out of her archives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most fast and entertainig movie ever","review":"Can't hardly wait is one of those films in which you can't press the stop button, it's exiting. Like half way through the movie, your so into it, you feel your at the dance. One of the best movies of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Were finally back to the 80's","review":"I believe that with a little detour Dazed and Confused started the 90's high school films, but about the 70's. Then came Clueless and I really thought this would be the Sixteen Candles of the 90's, followed by tons and tons of these making a brat pack for the 90's, but it never happened. It came late, but I think that this is what the early 90's needed after clueless. And with the following of American Pie, a very similar but more intense of the same stuff and with a little better acting, that movie became the Pretty in Pink of the 90,s.Can't Hardly Wait was good. I was a kid of the 80's, and this is how I remember it. This movie is about kids in the 90's about to graduate or just graduating from high school. The big party and virginity on the brink, very serious films. I'm just waiting to see if there will be any time to make a St. Elmos Fire of the 90's, well at least a witty one. Not one like gross anatomy, of course that was good too but on another caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully reminiscent of John Hughes earlier work","review":"I absolutely loved this film. There were brilliant performances all round but best of all was Seth Green. He definitely lives up to the promising performances of his early career and will, without a doubt, go far. This is one film that should be a part of everyone's video collection. I thoroughly recommend it and those who have not seen it yet should get themselves to their nearest video store sharpish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A graduation party mixed with teen love.","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a great actress.

This was one of the first movies I purchased when I got my new DvD Player. The sound quality is amazing using 5.1 surround, it's effect is evident from the first scene. The storyline focus's on the High School break up party and one, Preston meyers (Ethan Embry), Who is finally given a second chance at winning the heart of Amanda beckett (Love Hewitt). It certainly is a Great Movie with a well thoought out script and an excellent cast. If you like the teen flick type genre, then this is a film worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Real Character in this Story","review":"Essentially, this movie lacked any and all reality. The plot line was trite and predictable--who didn't know how it would end? The characters, all of them poorly acted, were stereotypical of the cheerleader, the jock, the nerd and how they all end up. The worst of all the pathetic actors was Ms. Hewitt, who was boring and lifeless as her role as Amanda. It's my fervent hope that Hollywood would stop making this stereotypical movies of what teen live is \\"supposed\\" to be and start focusing in on the real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the better 90's teen movies","review":"I guess I was in a particularly good mood when I watched this, but I really enjoyed it. It didn't succomb to the predictable schmaltz of many of the more \\"romantic\\" teen flicks of its era. Instead I found this film understated and ultimately underrated. There is plenty of fun along side some honest \\"dealing\\" with relationships and saying the things that have gone unsaid for years between classmates and friends.I found the relationships portrayed to be quite believable and almost effortless at points, which is due in no small part to the acting. Here we have a showcase of some of the best young actors of their generation, including no fewer than three of the cast members of Six Feet Under. Lauren Ambrose is wonderful in a stand-out performance. And yes, Ethan Embry is adorable.There are plenty of extras to keep true fans happy, but the film itself is enough to please your average teen-movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this movie!","review":"I absolutley loved \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\"!

Half Baked used to be my fave but Can't Hardly Wait passed that one real fast. I think Seth is the best actor. Not only good looking, but great at his acting job. I hope for many more great movies like this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seth Green In The Role Of A Lifetime!","review":"This movie is a definatly must-see! As you have read from the other reviews, it is the party of a century. \\"A movie 18 years in the making\\". These student's lives lead up to the very last night of high school, and presents all the type of people in the average high school. There's the girl who's perty it is, the jock group, the jocks' girls' group, the foreign exchange student, the thinker, the girl almost no one knows, the home-boy wannabe, the cheerleader, the hippie, the girl who wants revenge on her boyfriend, the nerds, the band, the pot-heads, the lesbiens, the list goes on! There is not one character in this movie that can not be related to. But Seth Green's role as Kenny Fisher, special K, even denderfeliac is outstanding. He plays not only the physical and mental aspects of this character, but also the warm fuzzy boyfriend (well, sorta). This is truly the movie of the 90's. Buy the movie. You'll be reminsin' of your high school graduation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cult Classic Finally gets a special edition","review":"Ethan Embry and Jennifer Love Hewitt star in this teen comedy originally released in 1998 and now finally 10 years later we are getting a special edition DVD.

I am just happy this amazing movie is finally getting the attention it deserves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked any true lesson","review":"\\"Can't Hardly Wait\\" lacked true lesson or perception in it. For those of the audience who stated that Jennifer Love Hewitt was a \\"wonderful actress\\" need to actually look at her performance instead of her looks. She could have done so much more to her character--yet she just came off as a whiny little brat who just got dumped. All the other characters were stereotypical of the \\"average teenager.\\" Yet the problem is that there is no such thing as the \\"average teenager\\". Teens are all motivated by different internal and external circumstances that are more than what meets the eye. Yet in this movie, the characters only were motivated about superfical things. It was semi-pleasant...but we need to look at this film with a closer eye. For those of you who wrote that you learned \\"so much\\" from this movie...what could you have possibly learned? Who could you have possibly identifed with in the superfical cast of characters?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with great acting by Love","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt is my favorite actress and I believe that she was great in this movie!

Predictable romantic teen comedy, you know what the ending will entail and the acting is pretty lame. Seth Green is pretty good but doesn't he always play the doofus? Ethan Embry is soooooooooo annoying, he acts like a little lost puppy, you just feel sorry for this guy. I really wanted to like this film but it's pure silliness, don't waste your time people."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Can't Hardly Wait\\" for What?","review":"The graduation party is here! Let's all cheer and jump up with joy! If there was any kind of realism to this movie, the guy wouldn't have got the girl. Trust me. In \\"Can't Hardly Wait,\\" a doofus wannabe writer had a crush on the most popular girl in school and he prepared a love letter for her so she would be his. Oh Mandy (Jennifer Love Hewitt), since the quarterback on the football team dumped you, you're no longer with the 'in-crowd.' High school drama smells. You have the two friends who drifted apart and got in touch with their feelings in a bathroom. You have the nerd who tried to get back at the quarterback and have his dweeb friends hang out on the roof of the house. Oh yeah, Jenna Elfman is an 'angel' and tells Preston (doofus) that she kissed Charlie from \\"Charles in Charge.\\" What an accomplishment. This movie is for dreamers. Don't sit through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but seriously immature.","review":"I love Seth Green, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in most movies because they are such fun but this movie was so pathetic. The only thing I really liked was when those two \\"geeks\\" were sitting on top of the roof and playing with their flashlights, when that other \\"geek\\" said that the stars were god's salt and he was waiting to eat us, the part where the one \\"geek\\" is singing that song on the stage (he's so drunk!) and that crazy girl with the scissors \\"You're all sheep. BAAAHH!\\". I love that part...But the movie isn't the funniest I have ever seen and I was seriously dissapointed. If you are going to make a comedy it should be stomach aching funny not \\"heh heh heh\\" funny. The entire bathroom part was boring, along with anything to do with that guy obsessed with Mandy. The \\"geeks\\" were just hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"Can't Hardly Wait is a really awful film. I recommend you to go watch the movie, American Pie which is 1000000000000 times funnier than this junk. You'll thank me later, if you did. PG-13 teen movies just can't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but $90 is too much for a \\"ditz\\" movie!!","review":"I love this movie, it's hilarious! The only thing is: Why anyone would pay 90 bucks for a dumb little video casette, I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Can I say one of the best movies ever?! I love this movie! One of the neat things about this DVD is like almost every DVD there is a special feature where you can have commentary through out the movie, which typically would be very annoying, HOWEVER..one of the people who do the commentary is Seth Green who is super funny and super cute! You learn alot of cool stuff about the movie like for example the school this movie takes place in is also the school they used in Grease. Anyways, the movie makes you laugh from beginning to end and has soo many celebrities in I dare you to count them all haha! It's a good story and even though it's a bit of a love story you never stop laughing. It always makes me feel good when I am down. This will honestly be one of your favorite movies in your collection if you get it. I promise you will be able to relate to at least one of the characters..heck I bet you pick one out for your friends also!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Hilarious!","review":"This movie was very good, and did anyone catch the minute-long appearances of Leslie Grossman of Popular, Sara Rue of aforesaid show (she was the one who was going off about sheep) or a five-second long glimpse of Amber Benson (TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer) studying a banana? I saw a few others I knew too. This is very funny, and if you want to see how it feels to be experiencing new things in a scene that grows normal in high school (parties), then this movie is for you. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"best comedy in the world!","review":"this film is by far the best romantic comedy i've seen. especially because jennifer love hewitt and ethan embry are in it. this film also has great songs in it. this film is about preston(Ethan Embry) who has liked a girl called Amanda(Jennifer love Hewitt) but she's had a boyfriend for four years. at his graduation he finds out that her boyfriend dumped her and he decides his going to tell her how he feels at there graduation party. can he finally tell her how he feels or will his annoying friends and her ex boyfriend get in the way? watch this film you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This is a pretty funny film, it focuses on the usual teen film storylines about boys, girls and parties!It will make you laugh though and is better than other films in the same genre, like Road Trip or American Pie etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE WAS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE","review":"I loved this movie so much I wanted to watch it 300 times, but I saw it in the theaters twice.

Jennifer Love Hewitt and the boy who is obsessed with her are the most uninteresting characters here. The best character was Seth Green, in the ultimate fly4awhiteguy role. The film was boring, boring, boring. How can it have a 4 1/2 star rating? See \\"Clueless\\" or \\"Fast Times at Ridgmont High\\" if you want to see a real high school movie. This film has too many cute people with too little talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE 'ANIMAL HOUSE' FOR TEENAGERS OF THE 90s","review":"When teenagers party, boy do they party. This is probably one of the top 5 films in this genre with great performances from Ethan Embry formally known as Ethan Randall ) Jennifer Love Hewitt and the always awesomely watchable Oz man himself, Seth Green.

It was so fun to watch and it made me laugh out loud a lot. The plot was great because it was pretty simple and yet not dull at all; this way it was easy to follow and still exciting. It kind of hit home for me because I feel like I am in the same position as Preston and I can really relate; much like many high school guys. I also liked it so much because I saw it a week or so after I graduated. I would actually rate it a 4.5 star movie. Not a full 5 stars because if you listen to the audio commentary on the DVD, the producers/directors talk about how many scenes that they had to cut out just to get it to be a PG-13 rating. I think it would have been even better with those scenes. Overall, I loved this movie and I highly recommend it to most everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is the funniest film I've ever seen","review":"I am in 6th grade; I saw this movie last Thanksgiving.

Here this film has a bit of a free form feel, and it works well in spots, but in others it just falls flat. Soderbergh is not a particularly good actor, and he doesn't have much screen presence. Casting himself was a mistake. Many of Soderbergh's films are remakes (Solaris, Traffic, Ocean's 11), and not very good ones at that. Here he tries to emulate Python and Bunuel, and he has some success, but overall the film is a mess, and a lot of its jokes don't quite cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"feverish spontaneity","review":"A refreshing blend of satire and surrealism that showcases a crazy cast having rather bizarre adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a good movie.","review":"While I certainly can't argue that this movie isn't unique or surreal, those qualities alone do not redeem this film. Definitely worth renting twice (the first time you are just trying to figure out what the hell is going on), but it is not worth owning.

There is nothing complicated or deep about any of the 100 short stories, complete with a moral and lesson of the day. Most of the \\"secrets\\" seemed a little forced and within the 100 there was a bit of redundancy.This book also focused about 75% of it's secrets and stories on work/business related experiences. The lack of variety made this seem more like a \\"how to do better at your job book\\".

They were more like a set of facts which may have sometimes been derived from a really good story, but left me thinking \\"So what?\\". The stories are too simple.The \\"science\\" consists of a quick statistic. E.g., \\"The productivity of employees who score high in dedication to their career is 33 percent less likely to be affected by the quality of their managers than is the production of low-dedicated employees.\\"So, in short, the points are trivial, the stories don't work, and the so-called science is presented in a way that is generally useless.

Carolyn Meyer does an brilliant job capturing the drama of the tragic life of Grand Duchess Anastasia. I know a lot about Anastasia, and was very pleased with the amount of time and work she put into this book. The book does an outstanding job chronicling the downward spiral of the Romanovs reign into one of the world's worst evils; communism.

Finally a book that is worthy of Anastasia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"Anastasia writes in the diary that is given by her grandmother when she attends a ball in the beginning of this story.

To find out more, read Anastasia, The Last Grand Duchess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anastasia, The Last Grand Dutchess","review":"This book takes place in parts all over Russia, depending on where you are in the book. It is about The Last Grand Dutchess of Russia, Anastasia, and her sisters, brother, mother and father.

I've been up all night getting info about her off the internet. This is a really great book, accounting for her youth from the age of 12 to the months before her execution. In this book, you learn the truth about Rasputin, what her sisters were like, and how her father felt when he left office. The only bad thing is that the book ends before the real end (Anastasias death). Other than that, this is an incredible book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Boring!","review":"This book wasn't very good.

I learned about history and still enjoyed the book at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but lacking something","review":"'The Last Grand Duchess' was a real treat to read. I have always been interested in the Romanovs, and their tragic fate has haunted me for years. I was overjoyed when I saw that the Royal Diaries were publishing a diary about Anastasia. When I read it, however, it seemed to me as though Carolyn Meyer was attempting to make Anastasia out as a tomboy who loathed her Imperial heritage. This disapointed me, as who can really say what Anastasia felt about herself and her status? I don't belive Ms. Meyer should have taken the liberty of attempting to make up a personality that might not have been that of the Grand Duchess herself. The book itself, however, was a touching rendition of Anastasia's last years and I still cherish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWSER!!!!","review":"WOWSER!!! I cannot believe how much this book drew me in! When you start, it may not be the most exciting book ever, but soon you'll find out that you can't judge a book by it's beginning!

It is an funny exciting and an enjoyable read for anyone who in interested in the Romanov family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"I cannot imagine what Anastasia went through, and I'm sure most people (including the author) can't either. But as a historical fiction it is as good as it can get. According to historians Anastasia was a mischievous girl and she did love her little brother dearly; each of her older sisters are being portrayed with accurate personalities too: Olga being mature, Tatiana being prim, and Maria being romantic. The author clearly did her research well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Portraial...","review":"This book was quite interesting, and somewhat historically accurate. However...there are some things written in it that gives only vague descriptions. It was hard for me to realize afterwards that this was *not* Anastasia's true diary. Personally, I believe the author did an amazing job discribing the day-to-day life of a young Grand Dutchess, but after a while, it seemed that the story began to lack. Not in truth, but in description and the portraial of Anastasia's life. I am quite pleased that, for once, the author wrote the ages of the family correctly. It seems to me that many times, the author tries to make them younger then they really were at the time (IE: the Fox home video of Anastasia). All in all, it was a good book, and did \\"portray\\" as one would say, the way a Grand Dutchess might have lived durring that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insufficient read","review":"this book I think is more suited for a younger reading audience.I think that there is insufficient factual facts submitted in the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Five Stars","review":"I have not even finished the book When I thought it realy dezerves five stars.

It is a very boring diary and definitely the Marie Antoinette book is better.I do not like the book about Cleopatra much either.The book on Anastasia just talks about when she goes to picnics and other palaces and when she went on yatchs. Since I heard so many good reviews on this book, I thought on buying this book, but it turnes out it is'nt that good. I cannot believe people actually like this book even. Anastasia led a boring life and she recorded it in her boring diary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anastasia Romanov","review":"This book gets only exciting at the end when the Romanovs get arrested.

One one page, the instructions list the size of one pattern piece as different than what the pattern piece is drawn for. The author glosses over how to insert anything but a fabric handle. There are no instructions on how to put in a magnetic clasp or bag feet. And the measly section on how to put in a zippered pocket was so vague that I had to rip out the pocket three times. I finally went to another source to get clear instructions. The book also doesn't give guidance on when to add the extras. Should trim go on before sewing the lining together? Handsewn on afterwards?

The original comics were printed on newsprint, which as most comic coinnoseurs know, does not render the images with the utmost fidelity. These volumes give these stories the treatment they deserve, with good white paper and care taken in the art restoration.In the afterword, Roy Thomas (the writer who adapted Conan into comics) promises that issues #14 and #15 will be in volume three, so fear not at the omission of the stories featuring Michael Moorcock's Elric.

But I was hooked from the first chapter. It gave me the \\"willys\\" and at times, made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Susie Moloney has a winner here - would make a great movie! It reminds me of early Stephen Kings novels like The Shining, The Dead Zone, and The Stand.By taking us through three prospective buyers of this \\"house\\", this \\"living entity\\", while also giving us a great description of the \\"Realtor\\" - one of the main characters, well it just brought the whole novel \\"home\\" (no pun intended).

It's been a long time since I've read a haunted house book that had such a great pay-off. I wasn't sure how everything was going to be pulled together at the end, but what a joy.

I can only hope that Ms. Moloney keeps writing and I for one can hardly wait for her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nobody is home","review":"This ghost story was a huge yawner for me, it was cliche, boring, I didnt care about any of the characters, or even care who was haunting the house by the end. I was only curious enough to know why the heck all these spooks were even bothering being there to haunt in the first place, and the answer lies in the epilogue at the end, a one page deal that catalogs the ghosts reasons for being there, i think it was meant to shock the reader, i was like \\"oh, okay, whatever\\" If your curious just read the last page at the library, its more interesting then the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you think about the house even when......","review":"I stay up late to read this book.

It makes you start wonder if you are alone in your own house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a haunted house story that delivers","review":"I have read my share of mediocre efforts into the haunted house genre, fortunatly \\"The Dwelling\\" is not one of them. This story delivers the goods; its well written, has true-to-life characters, and best of all, it's actually scary. The book almost reads like three novellas, with the common theme being the very creepy house itself. I guarantee that if you are a fan of the haunted house story you will not be disappointed. You may however think twice about that old home renovation. Light on gore and heavy on story, this novel deserves all the praise the reviewers are giving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"You will never believe everything this woman has went through.

Must distance yourself from Swashbuckler mold but plenty to like with rollicking good fun.

Some clever moments between Flynn and Walter Connelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four's a Crowd DVD","review":"This DVD was manufactured to be played on a \\"play only\\" machine.

The New Avengers managed to capture the off-beat spirit of the first series without making a mess of things.Patrick Macnee is back as Steed, I always liked this witty, proper British gentleman spy, portraying the supervisor of two younger spies. Junior spy No. 1, Purdy, is played by skinny Joanna Lumley (nowhere near as good as Diana Rigg's Emma Peel). No. 2 is Gambit, a rougher, more Americanized version of Steed, is played by Gareth Hunt.Even though Purdy and Gambit cannot hold a candle to Steed and Emma, the whole thing seems to work, due to the show's more down-to-Earth and darker storylines. But don't worry, this version of the Avengers does have its wild moments: super-powered enemy agents who can catch bullets, giant rats...You won't see anything like this on TV today; well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is an amazing museum piece from the 70's. Steed is classy, Purdey is both sexy and funny, and Gambit is...well, he'd not terribly. Actually, speaking of Purdey, she does what few televised heroines can do: be very apealing without getting coarse or lose her sense of humor. Highly recomended and I can't wait for Season 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD!","review":"I have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others I tried had much better sensitivity.

The rep's response was largely that he charges so little because he sells seconds. He was very difficult!I then bought a roughly $30 copy from Amazon, which made up the $20 difference. That one was marked as badly as the other. Amazon's replacement of the replacement was just as bad.Many of us have seen these episodes roughly 20 times; I wanted a good pristine archive copy. That does not seem possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...dvds the way we want them!!","review":"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! Finally CBS and Paramount got it right.

This is the only pajama I use since my baby was born as it makes it so easy to nurse (especially in the middle of the night) and is comfortable. I wouldn't necessarily wear mine out of the house as an evening gown, but perhaps a darker colored gown could double as a dress. I got a cranberry colored one for my sister. The only hard part is figuring out the correct size. If you're in between I suggest the smaller size as the material is quite elastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support at all","review":"This was advertised as the most popular nursing gown, bra-less but with some built in support.

You are put through to a machine, to leave a message, and noone returns your call. I'm very disappointed and wonder if it's a matter of neglect or if I'm being ignored purposefully. This company lacks responsibility and integrity. Deal with them with extreme caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it. The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top. The straps are too wide.

The robe is soft and drapey and comfortable; the gown is thicker, stiffer, and somewhat scratchy because of the fabric's bulk. I don't recommend this product at all. As soon as I started nursing and my breasts became tender it was unbearable to wear this garment. I wish they used the same fabric they used for their robes, because the cut of the gown is fine. It's just awful fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE customer service!!! Buyer beware!","review":"My husband bought me two nursing gowns for Christmas. Not only was the package shipped late, but only ONE gown arrived. They now refuse to return emails and phone calls.

Would NEVER recommend this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this a nursing gown?","review":"I wore this nightgown once. It is too hot due to the thick material. This is not a good thing postpartum because you get hot and sweat a lot when you sleep. The biggest problem is that it is simply a low v-neck gown. It is impossible to take a breast out without taking down the shoulders and I can do that with a regular nightgown. I also purchased an Expressiva gown at the same time and like that much better. It is also on the warm side, but it has slits for the breasts and is easy to nurse without getting half undressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"The first shipment got lost.

This book is certainly an expansion on the \\"great man\\" approach to history, in that it expands political motivation to include a variety of people- small farmers, slaves, and Indians- who are not often heard from in this context.I think the book is most interesting when Holton discusses wealthy Virginians' fears of slave revolt.

Even if they were right about the Textus Receptus vs. the Alexandrian textual family (which they are *not*), why not produce an updated translation? Jay P. Green Sr., a strong TR advocate, has done just this with the \\"Modern KJV\\", and Dr Kouric has done this with the KJV-2000, but apart from this kept the rhythm of the KJV (search on the Internet). Even the NKJV is based on the TR, despite a lot of misinformation to the contrary, e.g. their use of footnotes -- which is exactly what the *real* 1611 KJV did, as opposed to the Blayney revision of 1769 -- which this work is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need for Newer Translations","review":"i bought one of these when it first came out.

I don't understand the whys of printing an entire Bible(which is well-made, by the way), defining antiquated KJ language, when a modern version speaks modern English. If you have to have hundreds of definitions of these words, then, indirectly, D.A., is advising the use of a modern translation where any sort of dictionary is not needed.

My favorite tracks are the title track (which is reminiscent of the child's book Harold's Crayon) which is irresistable but sadly very short ; George and His 88 Keys (I can't listen to it without crying - it's the grandfather equivalent of Butterfly Kisses) and an absolutely beautiful song that says everything about the life of the heart in a nutshell: Some Fires. There is one track called Bad Cliche which is almost too painful to listen to, a disturbing account of child sexual abuse and recovery - but it's a compelling song. Another is the thought provoking Don't Go In the Water - for those of us who live with uranium tailings, it's a fact of life.

I won't blame previous reviewers who liked the album because I already had it before reading my first review, but sorry you people should try listening to Isreal Vibration or Misty In Roots if you really want roots music.

Topics covered in this book include, drugs, prostitution, rape, incest, murder, child abuse and a host of other dark acts. Even if you are into things being rough, nothing in these situations is \\"Safe, Sane, and Consensual.\\" There are two SHORT scenes of healthy sex, but not enough to temper the other content. Furthermore, the scenes are not written in a way that draw the reader in; they are trite and unadorned. Much of this book seems to be shocking for shock's sake. Overall, there are no redeeming qualities. There are better erotic stores out there and there is better urban fiction out there. This book did not accomplish a realistic and effective telling of either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FOUND THIS DISAPPOINTING.","review":"I found Noire's book The G-Spot to be well written but disappointing.It was sort of like reading The Color Purple or one of those badViking romances where the heroine is raped repeatedly, then somewhere around page 395, the hero decides he loves the person he has treated so cruelly. Also, what was with the Disney ending after all the brutality? Did Noire wimp out with this sweet little ending which seemed to have no relationship to the rest of the story? I read this and every time Juicy has any hint of happiness you know she will be whipped down for it later. The sex scenes seemed too mechanical and made me wonder if Noire is a man. I'm sure some readers will enjoy this glorification of drugs, power and violence but it just didn't do much for me. And erotic? About as erotic as dirty dish water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the title fool ya","review":"This was a very good read. I took you through so many emotions.

G-Spot is one of the best books out right now and no other author writes what Noire has written or writes like he writes. What's your real problem? You jealous? Everybody has their own definition of erotic. The urban parts of the book were supposed to be urban and the sexual parts of the books were supposed to be sexual. If you can't understand that then maybe you should go back to school or just read mysteries or horror books.

Out of the few erotic books I've read I'd say this is my favorite. If I had to classify this book I don't think I'd put it in the \\"Erotic\\" category first, I think its more suspense. Don't get me wrong, there were some erotic scenes, but it was a great story of a young girls fall into a life that many would die for, but she couldn't wait to get out of. During the story I felt for her situation. The writer did a great job of vividly taking us through Juicy's life through her eyes, describing her childhood and showing us how she ended up in the dilemma she is in.

She's going to take on a journey where U can feel, taste, and see each graphic scene she describes.Because I have an affinity for suspense and mystery novels, I HIGHLY recommend this one.

Juicy lacks for nothing material. \\" G \\" keeps her dressed to the nines. He provides everything she needs but Juicy isn't satisfied- literally, she lacks sex. G has the right package but he doesn't hold it down. He is too old and Juicy is young, lusty and unquenchable. As the desire builds to a boiling in Juicy, she treads into forbidden territory with Gino, G's only son. Things heat up to dangerous levels when \\" G\\" finds out and Juicy and Gino find themselves running for their lives.This raw and gritty erotic thiller is dripping with sensuality, danger and high tension.Reviewed by:Dawnny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to get Hood!","review":"I thought this book was excellent.

I think that quick death was too good for G, he should've been made to suffer. I also would've liked more details on his issues with women but I was very entertained and would recommend this book to all the young women who think that the \\"hood\\" lifestyle is all glamorous because there's always a high price tag attached to that type of living and being young and naive only makes it worse. I love Juicy's survival instinct but I thought she was gonna get killed a couple of times but in the end she got what she wanted: all the money and the good man (cause you gotta be a good man to see the good in a woman that sexed your father then you)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Attention Grabber","review":"I read this book in one day.

All of the trials and tribulations that the family in this book went through are every day situations of thousands of families across the globe, and I think that it sends a great message that even though one might crush your spirits, if you just hold tight to your faith, they can never crush your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to be perfect","review":"some albums are not so good some are brilliant but you cannot judge a singer with a over 35 years in the business do a number one album each time,no one can do,but is one thing that Melanie does is she sang with passion,and for this album Old Bitch Warrior,has some geat song,Something Warm is my favorite cause she sang it with force...I'd like to tell you that you're beautiful;she does make my hair stand,I don't know how to say that to someone and I wish I could just like that and make their hair stand on the back of their necks"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"Oops, I thought that this album of new material by Melanie would be the album that would bring her back into the spotlight. We all have dreams I suppose. Well, it will have to remain a dream because this isn't the album. Uninspired is the best word to describe it. The title cut buries Melanie's voice in a mass of loud and insipid music.Her voice is there somewhere I suppose. \\"Beautiful People\\", yes, another version of this classic. Why is it here? Because it was a hit in Holland, I believe. The rest of this cd leaves me cold. One word of advice for Melanie, dump Peter Schekeryk as a producer; he's tired and obviously bored. Move into the 21st Century with a brand new sound; one that will capture the essence that made you Melanie in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I really don't get the point of this cd, does it contain music?

Film footage is a collection of takes by British civilian and military newsmen. Unfortunately, there is little or no analysis of the war, and there is no mention of the significant tactical and strategic consequences resulting from this encounter. It is essentially a 110 minute British military PR film, glossing over battles so that smiling faces could be shown to the people back home."},{"rating":"2","title":"louisa & the missing heiress","review":"Though I know next to nothing about Louisa May Alcott, I found myself caught up in her world in \\"Louisa & the Missing Heiress.\\" I've read a few of Alcott's books, but she was never really an author who I cared to do much research on. This book has actually changed my mind because I found Alcott & her family fascinating. The mystery itself is pretty good too, although the killer seems to come out of nowhere in the final chapters. At least the story leading up to the final revelation is a good one. It's a shame this series is only a trilogy because I surely would have read more than 3 of these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny...","review":"this book is hysterical. we found it one night while on a dig in scotland and it passed the time at night very nicely. full of jokes about field workers and interesting shirt slogans. great to bring if your going to be with new people to break the ice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Onmyoji","review":"Great movie, I'm a big fan of Hiroyuki Sanada and Hideaki Ito and they were very good in this movie. Mansai Nomura was a pleasant surprise too. I definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of japanese cinematography :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Japanese movies out there","review":"I picked up this movie based on reviews I had read, and I came in with somewhat good expectations. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. Though the costuming is great, and the theory behind the story is interesting, the exceedingly slow pacing reduces the movie to what is quite frankly an excruciating experience. I actually fell asleep 2/3 of the way through because of the pacing.Needless to say I'm putting my copy up on ebay shortly, and I recommend renting this or borrowing from a friend before you buy one yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fairy tale","review":"Onmyoji is an awesome movie if you go at it in the way of a fairy tale. The plot is great, there is also a lot of storylines to follow to keep the audience busy. The special effects aren't great, but the battle between good and evil is enough to keep you interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Damn Cool","review":"Ok. I'm going to be as honest as I can be. I've always had a fascination with Japanese culture. This movie is set in Heian Japan, and is a fantasy movie. It's sort of like Harry Potter set in ancient Japan, but with adult protagonists. As some other reviewers have said, it can have a B-movie quality at times. In fact, for the first 15 minutes, i burst out laughing multiple times because of this. But, once you get used to it, it's a great movie. The costumes, the culture...it really is a cool movie once you acclimate yourself to it. If you are interested in ancient Japanese culture and myths, this movie is really worth it. And as I was watching it, I thought this would really be a fun movie for kids to see....BUT, it does have some pretty gruesome depictions of death, such as a corpse laying in a riverbed, that would not be suitable for children under 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I thought this book was an interesting read. It probably is more for the fan of the movie than a fan of the stage play, as the history of the developement of the musical is told in relation to the birth of the movie. I especially liked the full screenplay, as there was a few parts of dialogue/lyrics in the movie that I didn't understand. There are also some lovely full page stills of the movie and behind the scenes shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleased!","review":"I was very happy with this book! I had read some of the reviews before purchasing it saying that it wasn't what people had expected, didn't like the added screenplay, etc. But since I was a huge fan of the play, (and as it turns out, the movie) I really enjoyed this companion book. I thought it was really interesting to learn how the play/musical came to be and how it evolved into the movie. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the play or movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great film!","review":"I love the story. It is very interesting. Other people might love the story as well; It has a different version on what is the actual opera show has; and that makes the story more successful. I love the whole side of the story.... the characters, the set-ups, the pacing and the musics. Being a phantom opera fan, I am not disappointed. Well, infact the directors and the whole cast was very amazing. The story captures the all the things you cannot imagine on the phantom of the opera alone. I will always love the movie...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book to accompany a fabulous story","review":"This book is a must-have for any Phantom of the Opera fan. The Complete Phantom of the Opera by George Perry is more detailed on the story behind the musical, but as an updated version that includes info and pictures from the movie, this book is essential to any true \\"Phan\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edited version of a better book...","review":"This book is for anyone who is really into the movie version of The Phantom of the Opera. It has a lot of colorful pictures, a history of the Phantom, and the complete screenplay. The problem is that many of these people will all ready own The Complete Phantom of the Opera by George Perry. The first 45 pages of the Movie Companion are simply an edited down, Reader's Digest version of that earlier, better, and longer work. There is some new material here on the movie, but that is painfully thin - consisting mostly of pictures, actor bios, and the screenplay. If you are obsessed with Phantom, you will probably want to own both, but the Perry book has EVERYTHING you always wanted to know about the Phantom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have for POTO Lovers","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It includes the screenplay for the movie and when I read it I could understand the movie much better. Plus the pictures are beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I read this book and was very disappointed in that it did not cover ONLY the movie version of the Phantom. I was not interested in anything about the stage version that was in the book. Considering the price the book should have been larger. I also thought there should be more pictures of the Phantom who is the true star of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit, lots of plugs","review":"Although it is a bit expensive, it has served its purpose well.

It talks too much about historically insignificant materials while spending too less for significant points). But a reader can get those summaries from any other major publishers such as Kaplan, REA, McGraw-Hill, etc. All of them have answers and some of them have explanations about them. Kaplan and REA have CD or internet support for further assistance.This AMSCO version does not have any answer or explanation about them, or any further support besides the analogue papers.

I think I easily got a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb study guide","review":"I must say that this book made my AP U.S. class a whole lot easier. It covered material almost identical to that of the test. It had review questions at the end of each chapter and made sense of what seemed complicated when I read the same information in my class textbook. This is a must to succeed in AP American. My only complaint is that you cannot check your answers to the review questions as there is no answer key. This is because teachers use some of the questions in this book on their exams, however if you are a teacher, I believe you can purchase the answer key online somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective Study Tool","review":"My sister and I both used AMSCO to prepare for the AP US exam (2009 and 2011 respectively). Needless to say, we both received fives!

Its easy and fast to read and understand the text in this book. They have it broken down into sections and divided by chapters so its simple to flip through and find what you may be looking for. I use it all the time in AP US History and almost the rest of the class has this book to help them also. Its actually such a great book, that my teacher is trying to replace this book with the current textbook we have now. :) Its also very interesting to read compared to most school text books that contain lots of information we dont need."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Answers to Any Questions - not very helpful","review":"I ordered this book to review/study for the AP exam. However, unlike other AP prep books, this one does not have any answers to the chapter reviews or practice test. It's not very helpful and quite misleading!!! It should state that you do not get any answers and there is no way for the student to order the answers. Amazon should stipulate that only teachers can get the answer key and say that it must be ordered from AMSCO directly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too detailed for the AP Exam.","review":"The AMSCO review guide is well-written and covers US history in great detail. With that being said, the guide is too detailed for a student who wants a quicker review/refresher of the APUSH curriculum. More concise alternatives that still mirror APUSH exam coverage are REA's Crash Course and Insider Test Prep's \\"The Essential Content\\" (formerly Direct Hits' US History in a Flash).However, for APUSH students that want a more detailed understanding of US History (perhaps, for more than acing the AP exam), the AMSCO guide would be perfect for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got a 4","review":"My teacher didn't get beyond chapter 5 in the American Pagaent? 13th ed..Ehh well...

It is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only textbook you will need","review":"This book is essentially a shorter breakdown of the overall AP US History textbook and is fantastic. I used it through my entire APUSH class and finished with an A without ever having to read a single page of the textbook. I also have my AP exam coming up this next week and feel more than prepared to do very well on it thanks to this book. It is unfortunate that the practice questions at the end do not have answers provided for them anywhere in the book but those can always be found online.All in all this book is the only one you will need to get an A in your class and a 5 on the exam it is just a matter of how much time you are willing to put into the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome - hard to put down","review":"This was a great read. The book just seemed to fly by and was difficult to put down. It will definitely eat into your sleep time! I thought he did a good job explaining the NASA words and taking everyone \\"inside\\" NASA.

This is my second disk hummingbird feeder, the previous one being a Perky Pets product that I had to replace since the threads stripped on the hanger rod after so many years. I wanted a disk feeder to use with our heater during ice storms and thought Droll Yankees would be a good choice since the Perky Pet product was too large for my hummingbird population. It has not worked out. There is a rim on the bottom in the middle (for screwing onto a ground post) that causes the disk to be unstable when you are filling and placing the top on. And, be sure you don't let the nectar in the feeder slosh around unless you feel like cleaning up the trail of sugar drops left behind from the kitchen to the feeder sight and on your shoes. I have tried not filling it too full (not an issue with my previous feeder) with no effective results.

It does not even come close to preparing you for all the material you will see on the TOEFL. The grammar is too easy, the listening section is mostly just a list of idioms, and some of the reading passages are about topics that TOEFL does NOT put on their tests.You might think this is a good book because it is long, but don't think that! Most of the book consists of practice tests--Princeton Review puts one question on each page (trying to simulate what the computer will look like). For example, the last 150 pages of the book are ONE test.Finally, the CD-ROM is NOT a Computer Test.

The book was just dull, filled with two many lists of items and tasks. I felt like I was reading someone's grocery list or an RV instruction manual, or the fine print on a road map. The characters were boring spunky cutouts, and I found it hard to believe how excited Jessie got when thinking about buying a can of beans. Her self centeredness even after the murder in the campground, with her major gripe being that it interferred with her trip, was something else. This was so banal (including the cover art) that I thought it was a vanity press/self published book. Mrs Henry's other books have got to be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I generally enjoy Sue Henry's books. As with any author, some books will be better and others not quite so good, but still enjoyable. I started the book hoping for another good read, but about a quarter of the way thru, I put it down and never picked it up again except to toss it. Why? It just didn't have a plausible plot, I thought her writing was not as taut and terse as it should be, and frankly, I just plain got bored. It appears to me that she wrote it quickly so she could get another book on the market.

On that album, I'm addicted to Floating Sync (track 3). It is a great brain tickle to listen to. To me it's the true definition of ambient, as far as i know, in that you can either listen to it as a background, or really focus on it with all the intricacies.Anyway, towards the end of Bionic Commune (my favorite on this album), there is one sound effect that is out of sync. In Floating Sync, there also is a sound effect that seems out of place but rather hard to pick up without good speakers and focus, also towards the end of the track.Now I'm wondering if these single events were random glitches or planted by Mr. Inoue!

It seemed as though he was skipping major details throughout- for example he glides right over the death of his brother Nelson, leaving out details of the circumstance. Which pretty much proved to me that the rumors were more than true.Chapter 27 was what I was hunting and in his own words on page 405 he solidifies accusations of his one-world agenda. Considering he has been a part of the Bilderbergs, CFR, and Trilaterals for most of his adult life- rather odd he only gives about a page a piece to each issue. A 500 page book and only 1 brief chapter on the bulk of his world vision.

Whomever marketed this title should not have been so deceptive, but rather call it what it is: A salsa musical concert that features the talents of some of the Fania All Stars (with Johnny Pacheco). Not only are Celia fans being deceived, but Johnny Pacheco fans are missing out; looking at the title or front cover of this title, you would never guess Johnny was on over three-fourths of this DVD.

Its flavor is a tad more subtle than the previous book in the series, and marks the difficult middle ground between the dramatic Emprise and the conclusive Empery.

Bernie was slightly funny at best. Foul-mouthed humor throughout. The plot...VERY predictable. The ending....well, if you know anything about baseball, you'd realize that the \\"sacrifice\\" would NEVER have happened in the real world. The play would have come to the PLATE because ONE run ENDS the game. So instead of \\"sacrificing\\" to advance the runner, Bernie would have been given first base on a \\"fielder's choice\\" and the ball brought home to save the run and prevent the loss. It would have neither been a \\"sacrifice\\" or a hit. I know I'm diving into technicalities, but my \\"suspension of disbelief\\" CANNOT get past this one. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable but entertaining","review":"An enjoyable-enough comedy about a jerk who gets jerked around and reforms. You know the entire plot already and you dislike Bernie immediately, and the pace could have been faster, and the romance is inconsequential, but it's a feel-good misty moment at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what your expecting","review":"I think they marketed this movie wrong. It was marketed as a laugh out loud movie, but it's anything but that. It is a chuckle comedy, with slight sly humor, and Mac is so good at it. The comedy is just enough, and not too much, to retain a empathy for the main character and his redemption story, but keeps you light hearted throughout. It's just a great little feel good movie, it delivers just what you want from a movie in it's genre.I really was impressed with the cinematography work in the film, I was not expecting such great atmosphere from a light movie as it is... but the cinematographer , at times, captured the magic of baseball better than I think I've seen it in many great baseball movies.Watch it for what it is, and I think you will really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. 3000 isn't a homerun but it isn't a strikeout","review":"Mr 3000 isn't a ten, but it isn't that bad. Bernie Mac saves the movie and it does get old towards the end. There are few sports comedies that can carry the entire movie, and baseball comedies have been overdone since Bull Durham. Still, if you rent this, or buy it, knowing you are going to get an ok movie then you should like it. The plot is predictable, and you are able to see some of the jokes minutes before they are delivered. Mac does his normal quick talking thing that has made him a star, and the supporting cast are funny even if they are forgettable. Overall, I would say it isn't the best sports movie ever made (Tin Cup), but it isn't Major League IV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me Up When It's Over","review":"Last summer, I decided that Superbabies was the worst movie ever made, if not the worst form of human torture ever conceived. Mr. 3000 appeared in theaters shortly thereafter, but (fortunately for me) I wasn't able to see it at the time. Turns out that this flick gives the talking babies a run for the money, which is a shame, since the whole theme of the movie is such a clever idea. This is one of those movies that is embarrassingly unfunny. To make matters worse, I seem to have received a defective copy from Amazon, since it stalled without explanation several times in a rather expensive DVD player. Maybe the player (unlike me) was smart enough to fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. 3000: Fun and lots of hits","review":"Record breaking achievements in baseball are what can make a career great. But what happens if that record was miscalculated? Mr. 3000 is a humorous story of an at times selfish baseball player, who discovers that he is actually short of the record, and has to make a comeback. It is through reconnecting with the game that Mr. 3000 sees some of the errors of his past ways, which provides for a fun and entertaining last gasp effort to truly be Mr. 3000.Nicholas R.W.

Mellow and uplifting it nevertheless explores an extremely wide range of subjects (lyrically and musically), most of which are far beyond the depth of mass marketed Christian music. While this it clearly comes from a Christian perspective (and there are several extraordinarily moving worship songs on it) it is more about life, written from a perspective that anyone (Christian or not) can identify with and appreciate.The vocals and musicianship are excellent, the songs astoundingly personal and transparent, the subject matter compelling, and the delivery magical. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so magnification mirror.","review":"I have had a long line of suction cup magnifying mirrors...I tend to accidentally leave them in motels when I travel.

This is an instructional complete with lesson plans. I give it four stars because it provides a very, very, very good foundation for teaching the Wiccan religion to the little ones. It lost that last star of excellence because I object to the format the lessons are given to children. Any parent who interacts with his or her children should purchase this book, but to teach ones children in a structured system such as presented here just is not my thing.

Most of the book deals with her idealistic, unrealistic, and closed-minded views on parenting. A few snippets of relevancy are mired in page after page of judgmental lectures on how to cower down to your child's will. As a teacher, I've seen the little rajas that are created when parents are too self-absorbed to step up and be authority figures.

I feel that some of there advice on how to handle children is unrealistic. Makes me wonder if they had jobs. because anyone with a job cant do most of the things they talk about. Also it is to hard to do anything like they do when you have more than one child. These people obviously only had one to deal with. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to indoctrinate your little one's","review":"Put this book down and step away slowly. Then run for your life and for those of your children.A good majority of Wiccan's have been brought up in religions from a young age without their consent. This book seems to just advocate the same thing, only the children are being force-fed Wicca.There are so many better ways to share your own spiritual path with your children than to use this book. Just go on family outings in nature and speak to them about what you see. Read them bedtime stories of pagan myths. There is no need to teach your children about Wicca on such a level until they indicate themselves that it's a path they would like to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check your facts, Virgie","review":"I loved this story and if Virgie there who I don't want to read more about, would have checked hers, she would have known that Not Quite Paradise is not a spin-off of The Visitor television series.

Clearly the guy has a lot of experience with this subject area, but his manner of encapsulating his knowledge should have been done more at arm's length, rather than attempting to come across as a one-size-fits-all solution, again, because it looks like it took a serious toll on accuracy. If you're looking for pictures and tidbits, then go for it, but what about the bigger picture? Perhaps his next release will cover this. One other thing: I found lots of typos and grammatical errors.

Mineral's first full length album, in my opinion, is their best. Granted \\"EndSerenading\\" is also a phenominal album as well. This album will take you places you've been and never wanted to return to, but because of Mineral's unique musical style, you can't help but lose yourself in their lyrics, vocals and music. True art, that is honest and comes from the heart. 5 stars is not enough. I don't think 50 would. It is unfortunate they broke up but if you like Mineral, check out The Gloria Record (lead singer/guitarist and Bass player for Mineral) or Pop Unknown (Mineral's drummer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.","review":"Very much like Sunny Day Real Estate and also very good.

Well, I've known about Mineral for quite some time now and Greenwald spoke so highly of Mineral so I just thought I'd check them out. I sampled both of their albums but chose this one because of the energy.Man, I can't get enough of this album. This CD has great climaxes that are breath taking and have much originality to them. I've heard people accuse them of being SDRE rip offs but Sunny Day Real Estate has a different sound to me. I'm sure at first listen they might sound the same but in depth they are very different.You can hear Mineral in many modern day \\"emo\\" bands and this is a great buy to see where this whole craze came from.

End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If this album were recorded with a larger budget it would easily stand out among the rest in the outplayed emo genre. As it stands this work is utterly amazing. Upon the second listen each song bloomed into perfectly constructed epics of joy. I've been trying to get my hands on a copy of this album used for awhile and it seems hard to find. Now I would easily pay full price to get a chance to listen to one of the definitive moments in the \\"emo\\" genre.

Most people bashing this album are saying things like its too pop or R&B but who cares what it is, if you like it, nod your head to it and don't give a (...) what anyone else has to say about it. Im giving my personal opinion to anyone looking for a reason to buy this album, it is worth every penny and i am considering going out and buying it becuase Kanye deserves all profit for it, and it's an album i'd like to have around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic Debut","review":"It's an instant classic from the beginning to the end of the album.

If you want a great album I highly recommend Twistas new album Kamikazi and forget about that retard Kanye West."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is Sick","review":"All of yall smooth, soulful playaz need to kop this ish...I havent heard anything this tight since Biggie or the Chronic 2001.

The beats are jazzy, highly melodic, the rhyme style is simple and slow but passionate and life-representative. \\"Through The Wire\\" is an odd to life, while \\"Slow Jams\\" is - in my opinion - one of the most heartfelt tracks of our fledgling millenium. Collabo's such as Mos Def and Talib Kweli contribute to the \\"underground-ization\\" of the album, and the raise of its conscious character. I just wish we had more artists (lets better say talents, since Kanye rhymes, produces, writes...) like him, and hip-hop would expand in a whole new horizon. Any suggestions, arguments or opinions, hit me up @ harris_t86@yahoo.gr peace..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing kanye droupout for rap's sake","review":"Kanye will never be greater then tupac or biggie.

Finally some truly excellent rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dropped out and still made it!","review":"Kanye spits some awesome lyrics, has some beats that are off the chain! Spaceship most def. has to be my favorite song on the album. A lot of people will say that Kanye can't rhyme or can't spit or whatever, but his lyrics are real, and his flow is different but original and good. I mean if you really listen to his songs your gain something, because its raw. Its real. Try listening to All Falls Down, if that doesn't apply to everyone at least some point in their lives than you not being true to yourself, but this is def. a keeper, def. a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!! - Don't Judge Before You Listen","review":"I just had to say Amen to what was said in another comment, \\"I would compare it to the male rap version of Lauryn's Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\\" I was thinking that same thing all last night while listening to it. I'm a girl so I had to eco what was said.I think this CD is absolutely BRILLIANT!!! This is exactly what hip hop needed. I hope the Grammys don't overlook this masterpiece just because Outkast won this year. Kanye deserves to be recognized for this outstanding achievement.Grab this CD. It's going to go fast once word spreads!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope new turn for hip hop music","review":"If you are a fan of hip-hop music yet you tire from the trend heard on the radio these days, you won't be disappointed. Kanye West has a flavor and soul in his songs that can't be matched by anyone short of Outkast. His creative use of classic samples and originally passive lyrical delivery makes him a great asset to roc-a-fella. Combine this with collaborations with the most creative acts in hip hop(Mos Def, Jay-Z, Common, Talib Kweli, and twista) and you have not only the dopest hip hop album to come out in a while but a diverse, classic, and soulful collection of music with an equally inspiring set of lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAAAAAAAAMMMMN","review":"If you've never heard of Kanye West, you havent been watchin TV, or readin a newspaper, or u've been in iowa figuirin out the caucus. Anyway, this kid is a bright shinig star for the futue of music period. not jus hip-hop, but music period. He is hands down the best new artist/producer of this year, considerin he's been on the scene for a whil. I've never heard anything like this album before. the beats, each seem to have it's own life, and it's own unique story to tell. the artists he chose to feature, are all icons of their \\"field\\", and they all contribute to an already brilliant offering by the new kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..wake me when it's over","review":"How boring...and did the whole World get brainwashed for a minute?...Highly over rated..the sped up vocals have been done to death, Kanye's beats all sound the same, he is a poor MC...I often wonder if he wasnt associated with Jay-Z how many kids would check for him...there is nothing new or original on this album Kanye is NOT a saviour a Hip Hop and this album is weak and boring, as a rap listener since 1982 I have seen too much hype over substance this is a clear case of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars - Nearly classic","review":"I have lots of respect for Kanye West. In high school, he got the superlative for \\"Lest Likely To Succeed\\", then he dropped out of college, then he started out as a small-time record producer for Roc-A-Fella, and just look at him now. That's real inspiration to me.I got \\"The College Dropout\\" when it first came out, and it hadn't left my car for a very long time (I still listen to it on occasion). The production is hot as hell, Kanye's got something to say on almost every single track, and there are real good guest appearances as well.Notice how I said he had something to say on *almost* every track. Yes, there are a few filler tracks on here, such as \\"The New Workout Plan\\" and others, which - in my opinion - prevent \\"The College Dropout\\" from being a classic rap album.Overall, most of the CD is good and worth the money. Add it to your collection if you haven't yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This cd is incredible. Kanye West did an amazing job on everything with this cd. It starts off amazingly with We Don't Care. The chorus, beat, message, and flow is on point in this song. Great opener. Then there is All Falls down, which is another amazing track that I'm sure you have heard. Following that are Spaceship, Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down, Get Em High, The New Workout Plan, Slow Jamz, and Breath In Breath Out. Every single one of those songs is incredible. The beats are all awesome and the lyrics are insane. Then is School Spirit which is the first decent song on the album. The album ends with Two Words, Through The Wire, Family Business, and Last Call. All of those songs have an amazing beat with awesome lyrics to boot. Overall, I think that Kanye is the best rapper/producer of all time and this cd is a timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who need's college","review":"awesome cd.

At the same time we see these explicit lyrics artists rip at the system, the music really offers no hope. This CD is filled with self-righteous anger and is not very listenable. It is a cheap trick knocking segments of humanity to make millions and then ride home to your mansion in a LIMO! Disappointed that this artist has chosen the low road.

I think not!","review":"Sister 1: I think it's sad that Kanye thinks he's a \\"Christian rapper\\". His lyrics are AWFUL! Can he honestly believe God is behind songs that swear every other sentence? Now I'm not to judge, but it puts a bad name on the Christians who listen to fulfilling music. If he really wants to be a messenger, sing pure music! The beats, though, are fun, but I find this CD a total waste of my time.Sister 2: Once I heard the CD I thought to myself, \\"He's a Christian?\\" I think it's terrible to spread God's word in such a wretched manner. I agree with Sister 1 that the beats are off the heazy. His purpose is noble, but his lyrics are not worthy of listening to.

Combined with some major talent such as Mos Def, Jay-Z and Talib Kweli.Some may not like the last song, \\"Last Call\\", since he raps in the beginning, for about 4 minutes, and the other 8 minutes is Kanye telling his own story, from his past to present.

Well, at least I'll never fall for that again. \\"Through The Wire\\" is one of the most puke-worthy songs I've ever heard. For KW to even think that it was a good idea to speed up the chorus of \\"Through The Fire\\" by the great Chaka Khan so that it sounds like the chipmunks, and let it repeat throughout the entire song, the record label should have dropped him for that alone. Pretty much every other song is as equally pathetic. \\"All Falls Down\\" is remotely listenable, but only because of the strong vocal contributions of Syleena Johnson. If she weren't present here, that song would suck as much as all the others. This truly was the beginning of the end for hip-hop having any credibility whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that shines!","review":"Kanye West's CD is great. Each song has a great beat and is a trip for the ears. Before this Kanye has been behind the scenes but now he is out now and showing the world he has it. I know that his attitude can cause one to hate him from the start, but I would rather separate the man from his music. I think Kanye is wonderful rapper and when he came on the scene this summer I knew he would be the next big thing. The only problem I think may happen is his huge ego will knock him down. Every rapper who starts off great loses the game because of their ego; and Kanye's is huge. But, this boy has an usual rap sound and is great at mixing songs! I wasn't sure if he would be a one hit wonder but he already is filling up the airwaves with his songs and each song is unique in its own way. I personally love this CD and hope he can tone down his ego to make another great CD.

He talks about his rise to fame and he also talks about his stuff but not enough that you get overwheled by the fact that he has a lot.Jesus Walks is my favorite song and it's religious but not in that hard core way.The whole CD is really great.

His words speak volumes about the struggle inherent with being a young man whose decisions can either take him in a positive or a negative direction. The success of this work shows that killing 5 people, and f***ing 10 b***hes in the first 16 bars of your song is passe to say the least. Jesus Walks should be the new anthem for a society that badly needs a God to answer to. I wholeheartedly recommend this album with no reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Hotness","review":"Kanye is the hottest producer/rapper out there right now. He admittedly trips on his lyrics on occassion but I don't think I have heard anyone drop beats like this since Dr. Dre & Mel Man.

There's way more GOOD songs on that album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I absolutely agree with the Matt reviewer","review":"Mariah Carey, Usher, and Kanye especially have no musical talent yet they're popular. Where is the sense in that. The only reasonably popular bands today are Fallout Boy, Black-Eyed Peas, and especially Green Day. Rap-crap regrettably dominates the hit stations these days.

He has awesome rhymes and creativity you wont find in 50 or eminem (not that i have anything against them). It isnt about violence and drugs, but has lyrics that have some thought in them. The way they did slow jamz is way better than the way they did it on the radio. I know if you buy this cd, you will find yourself listening to more than one song over and over again. For those parents who cant have all the dirty language, the cd edits it out perfectly and everything i have listened to so far has been clean. P.S.- Rock on, Kanye."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Drop\\" in on this \\"Dropout\\"","review":"The first great album of 2000 anything. Kanye has put together a masterpiece that should be studied for future generations. He has masterfully blended soulful beats with thoughtful rhymes. Kanye has made a wise decision to stay away from cookie-cutter MTV, 106th & Park brainless type of hip hop. I will not pick any stand out tracks, everything here is equally bangin'. Although I will say I was kind of wishin' to hear Common and Jigga on a track together but I still can't complain. Now everyone has had something to say about his rhyme skills. Let me just say this, Kanye's style is that he has no style. His subject matter is enough to keep you listening for more. Put it this way, on the wonderful song \\"Never Let Me Down\\" feat Jigga, Kanye actully steals the show. By the end of this year every other song on the radio will sound like a Kanye ripoff. Funny for a guy who is a \\"College Dropout\\", he is about to take a whole new generation of producers/ MC's to school. -18651"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap is back?!?!!?","review":"Kanye West is the newest and maybe most talented addition to Rocafella records. He has been making beats for everyone lately, from Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and even Britney Spears. The man is the new Neptunes, except where their beats were weird, his are beautiful. He makes smooth beats that you can sit back and just bop to. Its not music that makes u have spasms, its pretty. It has soul and it has feeling, which i think is helped by the beautifully strewn samples from Mo-town hits and such. His flow is pretty different. He actually raps about things that matter. Doesnt talk about shooting people or how many stores he held up. He keeps it real to where he is at. It reminds me of old school lyrics with new school beats, its a perfect union. Get this album!! Even if you have been disappointed with rap lately as i have been. This man brings rap back to where it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Dropout","review":"With Jay-Z leavin, Rocafella needs a new superstar to stay on top of the rap game. When Bleek's MADE came out I liked it but I didn't find anything special about it. I prayed that there would be Rocafella albums w/more much more depth. Maybe the Young Gunz. Today I went out and purchased Kanye West's debut, \\"The College Dropout.\\" Wow was I shocked with the quality. From start to end there isn't a single song bringing the CD down. It's funny at times, inspiring at others and an overall funky fresh album. \\"The New Workout Plan\\" is a creative, fun song about how the lady's can get a rich guy. \\"We Don't Care\\" and \\"It All Falls Down\\" are some of the good hits. So don't hesitate, pick up Kanye West's debut album and see into the positive future of the Roc."},{"rating":"2","title":"the collage dropout-kanye west","review":"every song i hear is produced by kanye west and i love them all. when i 1st heared kanye west it was on the David Letterman show(witch is a great show). i heard all falls down i didnt really care for it (which i regret). i went a second time to listen to it and fell in love with it. i was intreged and listen to other songs like. i will list my 5 favourite songs:All falls down- of cource slynna jhonsen has such a pretty voice.Never let me down-jay-z raps like mad on this.through the wire- some rap these days has such meningless lyrics but this.Family Business- i love it.spaceship- should i buy conquences album?inconclusion i love this because it is meaningful and insperational! 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"College Dropout...ok...I guess","review":"I thought this was an OK album but far from a classic. It only has a few good songs (We don't care,I'll fly away,Slow jams,Last call,jesus walks) but thats about it. The rest are just fillers. And why is everyone saying he is talking about new stuff and hes fresh. The Roots and common and many other artist like this have been making music like this for years. All Kanye is doing is talking about this stuff on sampled beats to make hits. In almost every beat he makes there is a sample. No doubt he is a good beat maker but without sampling can he make a hit. I like the album but I dont think it as great as people on MTV and TRL say it is. His rapping skill is average at best. So overall an average 2 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all","review":"I just listened to this cd a few times and while Kanye is one of the best producers out there right now his lyrics and beats on this album are very forgetable. 3 maybe 4 tracks are really good.

I didn't really want it because i thought Through the Wire was the most annoying song out & Slow Jamz sucked even more, but when i listened to the whole album, it turned out to be pretty good. I've had it for almost a week & I'm starting to get tired of it though. The best thing about Kanye himself is that he actually talks about things of substance (unlike Cash Money, etc), especially in Jesus Talks & he's not afraid to speak his mind.There's too many skits on the album. If you like skits, you won't mind, but they are uselss & not all that funny. You buy it & think there's 20 tracks. No. But there's a good number.Theres lots of guests on the album (Jay Z, Mos Def, etc) & they're all good. He's a great producer, & with this album he shows hes a pretty good rapper himself.

Folks don't get it twisted, you don't have to be bashful to do things the Chi way! Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"A future hip hop classic","review":"This album is surely a knockout! When I heard that the producer Kanye West was releasing an album of his own, I predicted nothing but greatness and that is just what I got. He may not be on the same page as Jay-Z and Nas, but I'm sure Kanye is surely going to make his mark in the history of hip hop, not only as a chart-topping produer, but as a great lyricist as well. This is an album that I would recommend to anyone who has fell in love with any of Jay-Z's albums. This is an album that I can listen to from beginning to end and I don't have to skip songs. Kanye, keep the hotness comin' PLEASE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Truth","review":"I am a 26yo female who owns more R&B CD's than Rap, but after listening to College Dropout I had to go and get it for myself. On top of Kanye having good looks, he is very gifted and talented when it comes to laying down the tracks. Now he's no Jay-Z but he still gets to the point. It's obvious he dropped out of college to pursue his dream in the music business but if you really listen to what he's saying in some of the songs you can see that he's a very bright guy. Congratulations Kanye, you are on your way to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome debut","review":"Kanye West is definitely one of the best rappers of all time. Not only can he write his own lyrics and rap them well, he makes awesome beats that are used by some of the best in the biz. The only bad part is that there aren't that many guest appearances, except by Twista and Jamie Foxx and a couple others. But this guy is GOOD! With all the commercial rap nowadays about cars, women and money, Kanye West brings his own style that is quite welcome into the hip hop culture. He talks about Jesus, the society, and many other thought-provoking subjects. If you don't have this album then you MUST get it now! You'll be amazed at his awesome flow, lyrics, and beats. BTW, best song is definitely \\"All Falls Down\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD OF THE YEAR","review":"Kanye is killin, he is reppin chi town to the fullest anybody who's anybody should good this cd. this is true hip hop. kanye is a lyrical genius who does not have to rap about guns and killing people to make a point. i'm proud to be from chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's garbage","review":"Kanye is the typical example of what happens when the media and MTV and radio brainwashes the American public and the consumers into believing that someone or something is the \\"next big thing\\" in rap music.

I have ordered this record twice and each time side A skips terribly at the same exact spots. My only guess is that it is a bad pressing. Even my older, more scratched records do not skip. The album itself is one of my favorites, but avoid buying it on vinyl unless you want it for decoration."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for music, but quality of record","review":"I'm really disappointed.

He breathes life into the crap rap that plagues the mainstream today. After coming out with the beats for Jay-Z and the likes that made my head bob in appreciation, he steps to the mic with an interesting way of flowing, using a near death car accident as his inspiration for this album entitled College Dropout, which smugly features him dressed as a bear; sports mascot sitting at bleachers. I do agree with one review that said that the skits do interrupt the flow of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 *S OKAY, MAYBE IT'S CLASSIC BUT...","review":"TOO MANY SKITS! The quality of the songs on this album may still make it classic, but the skits are out of control. At one point a skit is actually followed by another skit. I hate to complain about any album with so many great songs, but this could have been one of the greatest albums in hip hop history with just a little editing. Cut about half the skits and \\"Workout Plan\\" and forget the >> button for good. Kanye's not the greatest lyricist but an original flow and interesting subject matter like having past due bills while working at The Gap to pay his way through college and facing death in a car accident more than supplement that. As far as production goes Kanye West has already proven he's possibly the best hip hop producer since Dr. Dre. I have to complain about 1/3rd of the album being skits, but the truth is it probably is still a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Hip-Hop Cd Ive bought in a long while","review":"This album is hands down the best Hip-Hop album that has hit the stands in awhile. I would swear my life on it. I can't get enough of it. \\"All Falls Down\\" is a great song, and we all know about \\"Through The Wire\\". \\"Get Em High\\" is a hot track, that needs tons of playing time, it sounds straight underground.

I was one of the peeps who thought the beats would be fire on this album, but the rhymes would be soft. Well I was half right, cause the beatz is hot, but the rhymes is even hotta.

There are a few weak tracks, but the majority of the them are sick. All the beats are hot, and Kanye's lyrics are a lot better than I expected. The album has a lot of great guest appearances, including Jay-Z and J. Ivy's sick verse on \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and Common's amazing rhyme patterns on \\"Get Em High\\". However, there are too many skits on the album, many of them dissing college, which I currently attend. Overall though, the album is innovative and excellent for today's standards and is definately worth buying. Favorite tracks: Jesus Walks, Get Em High, Never Let Me Down, Two Words, School Spirit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kayne is hot","review":"For his efoort I will give him 5 but for how good of an album this I will give him 4 because Kayne doesn't have the best flow.But he a lyrical content and the production matches.

Out of all the CD's I have this is by far my favorite. Don't be cheap and get the bootleg CD, Get the real one and support K. West.

He of course produced the wicked track 'You Don't Know My Name\\". So obviously when i heard he was dropping an album i rushed out to buy it. Simply put the album is off the hook. he uses all the themes used by almost every rapper and gives it a new feel. He spits about Jesus, Guns, Drugs, Girls, and makes it feel all so new. My favorite track is Never Let Me down a collabo with Jay-Z and Common. All in all this album is history in the making. It is a must get.

Along with \\"Graduation\\", this is one hell of a hip hop album. This one mostly deals with social issues, religion, the workplace, family matters, etc. These are pretty unusual subjects in the world of rap nowadays: the only modern-day rap album I can think of that mostly doesn't deal with girls and money and f**k-the-police ramblings is \\"Release Therapy\\" by Ludacris. The songs themselves are catchy and intriguing. \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Family Business\\" are just two of the most lovable songs that are found here. \\"Spaceship\\" and \\"Through the Wire\\" have some good beats and music overall. But songs like \\"Last Call\\" and \\"Get 'Em High\\" don't seem to work; they don't have compelling melodies to start with, and the music is a bit irritating.As you can see, \\"808s and Heartbreak\\" shows a very different Kanye.

Producer-cum-rapper West displays the most culturally alive and [even better] the finest beats of the year. He's substance over style, and while he's never boasted to be the greatest MC, he's second to almost none in deft storytelling - his stance on the educational system not totally arguable, religiosity juxtaposed with positivity/negativity, the faith in his lord [not mine], the war within the black community [and the lack of political interest as opposed to hot rims], humbling yet boastful. In the realm of passe hip hop thugs churning out immature bile masquerading as macho braggadocio, West offers some of the most ripened and developed lyrics in ages. But it's his truths that are the key to his proposed longevity and it's the truths that set everyone free. All with his God on his side. Ironic, huh?

At least have a listen on this site, if you don't believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Dropout","review":"I think it is a great album. It's still in my cd player and I've had it for over 2 months. It's witty and serious all at the same time. As a college student, sometimes I wanna drop out and I think the skits are really amusing. I especially like the line, \\"you read all those books that you're not gonna remember\\". 'The Workout Out Plan' is freakin hilarious and I listen to it every time I listen to the cd. There is some really good singing on it too, especially the track entitled \\"Family Business\\".It's not a listen beginning to end, not touch the skip button, but it is definitely worth the money ($15)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rapper since the best Rapper Retired","review":"Wow! How can anyone thing that Kanye West cannot flow. HE has the most amusing,witty, and easiest to listen to lyrics I have ever heard. And how can you forget the beats he comes up with. Its amazing how he makes you bob your head without knowing it. Simply put if you want a CD With lyrics that you will memorize after about 3 times through, and beats to bump, cop KANYE WEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album.","review":"Kayne knows how to churn out some nice beats.

It's rare that you come across and artist who is not afraid to be themselves. The music is what soars to perfection on this CD, not the persona. Kanye's delivery isn't flashy, but it achieves its desired goal. Not a single song goes to waste. You will not be disappointed with this CD.FAVORITE SONGS:We Don't CareSpaceshipJesus WalksNever Let Me DownThrough The WireFamily BusinessLast Call"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS IF POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"A TRUE CHAMP THATS ALL I GOTTA SAY ALL YOU COLLEGE DROPOUTS NEED TO GET THIS CD AND SUPPORT THIS MAN. ALL HIS SONGS HE RECORDED BEFORE HIS ACCIDENT SO HE SOUND DIFFERENT BUT ITS STILL TIGHT. KANYE WEST TO ME IS TRULY SAVING HIP HOP CAUSE ITS ALMOST CLOSE TO EXTINCTION. AS A PRODUCER MYSELF I CAN SAY HE HAS A VERY UNIQUE STYLE OF SAMPLING THAT NO ONE CAN COPY.MY FAV TRACKSTHROUGH THE WIREJESUS WALKSSCHOOL SPIRIT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album","review":"The production on this album is tight, but lyrically soft in some spots. The subject matters, from materialism to God, is an interesting mix. Highlights are: All Falls Down which features a tight hook from Lauryn Hill and some nice gems about materialism; Spaceship which is a knockin' song about escapism; Jesus Walks which gives a shout out to the Son of Man, but not as deep as some might say; Never Let Me Down is HOT featuring Jigga and K West comes tight too; Get Em High is also a highlight feat. Kweli and Common, it is tight from top to bottom; Slow Jamz is aight; Two Words is also nice even though it features Freeway. This is long winded, but definitely cop the album. It may not be revolutionary, but it is highly bumpable, even with all the silly a$s skits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Kanye","review":"Kanye, Thank you for bring something new to the game. This album is solid all the way through. It's been a while since a brought an HipHop album where I didn't have to skip through the majority of the cd. I can listen to this album straight through. Finally, someone who raps with a message! The songs are great, the beats are better, and the skits are hilarious. Out of all the songs on the CD, I must say Spaceship hit me the hardest. That song is soo soulful and I can relate because I use to work at the GAP myself! This is defintly a cd you can get something out of, not just listening enjoyment. Thank you again Kanye, I'm really looking forward to you in the near future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TAKEOVER","review":"THE ALBUM THAT EVERYONE MUST HAVE IF THEIR A RAP FAN.

I knew little about Kanye West other than the producing side. I was really impressed with this c.d. I think that it is put together well. He seems humble and he has a good sense of humor. Unlike most rappers he seems respectable and is not always talking about money*, jewlery*, cars* and hoes*. He makes sense. I love this c.d. and I think it is a must have for your c.d. collection. \\"Congradulations Kanye\\" you made it!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Solo Debut","review":"Kanye's production and concepts are unmatched in todays field of Hip-Hop albums, however as an MC he's about 10 miles short of a major league fastball. Despite solid lyrics, I have a hard time maintaining interest with his limited vocal power. At times, he sounds on-point, and on a few occasions he sound like a complete amatuer.

I recommend Twista, or Memphis bleek."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.O.C.'s flagship","review":"great lyrics especialy in songs like Jesus walks. The only problem with the cd and the reason i give it 4 stars is because there are a lot of skits.

Every track reflects his masterful skills as a producer and the lyrics range from hard-hitting commentary to bitingly funny satire. The tracks that didn't make this CD (check the Kanye website to hear a couple) could make an entire CD on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying......","review":"Kanye's newest is worth it's money. As much as I look for good lyrics this album is still worth it. The beats themselves are really catchy and just great. As his debut album, I give Kanye the credit he deserves. Although some songs are weak i still say \\"GOOD JOB!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid, that's it","review":"When I bought this, I expected dope production and an average flow from Kanye. That's pretty much what I got. The skits are abit annoying, but it's all part of what he's trying to convey so I can take it. Kanye is out-preformed by just about every guest on this album(they all give pretty good verses though) but does have his moments on songs like \\"two words\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Never let me down\\". The album does get a bit monotomous and some songs are just wack (see both \\"workout plan\\"). Not a bad debut, but not anything classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU KANYE","review":"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THANK YOU KANYE WEST! I WAS ABOUT TO STOP LISTENING TO \\"NEW SCHOOL\\" RAP AND JUST STICK W/THE 90'S STUFF (THE GOLDEN ERA OF RAP). BUT THIS CD PROVES THAT WE STILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE GOOD RAPPER AROUND! ALTHOUGH THEIR ARE ONE TO MANY SKITS ON THIS CD, SONGS LIKE \\"ALL FALLS DOWN\\", \\"JESUS WALKS\\", \\"GET EM HIGH\\", AND \\"THROUGH THE WIRE\\" (TO NAME A FEW) MAKE UP FOR IT COMPLETLY. ONCE AGAIN...THANK YOU KANYE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cop it now","review":"Rap has been in a little funk for a while on. Its got to the point where its almost unbearable to listen to what these guys have to say. Plus most of their albums are not even worth the bandwidth to listen to them before coping it. It is a pleasure to hear an album well done as kanye's. The beats are extremely hot and the songs are great. Although i did not like the fact that he continually made fun of people who went to college. It was masterfully done. my favorites are jesus walks, through the wire, family business & all falls down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"kanye is a good producer, not a good rapper. the only good about this album was that it had some decent beats but the rappin was horrible. kanye can not rap at all, the only reason he has so much hype is b/c jay-z signed him. kanye needs to stick to producin and give up his career in rap. don't waste your money on this album it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"most overrated rapalbum in years","review":"It's not awful but not as good as people seem to think...All Falls down is incredibly annoying with Shyleenas vocals all over the track with no time to breath, & Work Outout is incredibly wack too with popcorn-production and corny lyrics...A couple of good songs though, that get up I get down -song, speceship , through the wire and maybe 5 more listenable tracks but other than that...Way to many skits, almost as many skits as songs on the album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Mainstream Sh*t!!! And that's being generous!","review":"Why do people listen to this mainstream rubbish? Why does everyone automatically love everything that MTV plays??? Are you all robots? The ONLY good thing that may come out of this album is that Hip-Hop producers will get more credit than they are getting at the moment. I bet you can't name any producers other than this [...]. People should know who the best producers are like DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Jay Dee. Hip-Hop is all about image nowadays, not about the actual music, and it baffles me!Please go and listen to some real Hip-Hop like Jurassic 5, Gang Starr, People Under The Stairs or Pete Rock. I guarantee you if MTV played any of this real Hip-Hop, people would love it. If you don't like any of it then fair enough (but you need your ears tested), please just listen to some Hip-Hop other than the sh*t on MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kanye needs to move on","review":"Yeah.......so an average joe like kanye west comes along and says, hey i have this original idea! i am going to preach to the world that college is not for everybody. not only that, but every song on the cd revolves around this idea. in fact, it seems as though mr. west is telling kids that going to school is a waste of time, and the only way to achieve status in society is to become a big time rapper. when college dropout first came out, i thought hey, this is a pretty good cd. but when in god's name did this man become a musical legend, a renegade of rappers? im sorry, but mabye kanye should've stayed in school to learn some modesty, because his ego is way too big as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD should be burned rather than bought","review":"And when i mean \\"burned\\", i mean that you should burn this CD from your friend rather than spending your hard earned $20 for this CD. The reason why i say that is because, yes, there are some good tracks on this disc and he does have messages in his flows that you can relate to; however, 90% of the songs on this CD are crap, and sound like they were recorded in the back of a dentist's office (while getting his mouth wired shut. lol). I won't totally diss Kanye West's style though, because if you're looking for music with messages and themes that you, yourself, can relate to than this is a good CD for that- but don't expect any hard beats or crazy punch lines in his music (instrumentally and vocally). If I were you, i'd just get the Twista CD Kamikazee if you wanna hear Kanye West do raps on good beats and rhymes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to writing love ballads","review":"alicia keys' you don't know my name and janet jackson's I want you are songs produced by kanye, and I was expecting that type of material on this album, but it just wasn't there. The music on this CD sounds no different than the hip hop music I've heard in the last 15 years. It's all about hype really, and I wouldn't be surprised if he swept the grammys in 2005 for ratings like alicia keys, norah jones and beyonce did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give credit where credit is due","review":"I give credit to people like Kanye, Fred Durst, and Britney Spears. People who do drugs need drug dealers. People who need work need employers. And people who listen to over-hyped music with no talent (which appears to be the majority(904 reviews and counting; not even 2pac got this much) need artists like the aboved mentioned. Are these artists geniuses? Some would say yes and others would say no. But they hit a string within American audiences and made lots of money. So I say good shot.If you are into hypes, trends, and simple music then give your two cents. But if you made it far enough into your overall music experience this may not be nearly talented and entertaining enough for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Hip Hop is back,","review":"Mookie Smith you're nothing but a hater it seems to me you country spick. Its obvious that you're are not a true hip hop fan because it seems that you can't recognize talent. Kanye isn't beat biting. All he is doing is Linking two periods of music that he loves together to create a new and beautiful sound. He succeeds. I'm young, and I have a respect and appreciation for types of music including ol skool. So shut with your whack review,and go learn something.NE ways this is a great CD, if u Don't get it you're definitely missing out. As said already Kanye is the Future of hiphop. NE one can be a rapper, but West is lyricist. He's creative and he's actually talking about things. This a fun album, also serious.Just all around feel good vibe music. He a real Soulful Dude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've been signed twice","review":"Kanye West is a production genius. This album is a miust get for any rap fan. If you like common, mos def and talib kawli then you will love Kanye West. The beats from start to finish are original, fresh and hot. By the way Kanye can also rap. He is a better rapper than most rapper/producers. With Jay Z on his way out, Kanye is the perfect man to carry the Roc in 2004"},{"rating":"2","title":"CRAZY!!!! Must go Buy","review":"This album is crazy, you must go out and buy it...Many people underestimated him...They were all wrong. The beats on this album are crazy all of them are HOT. Kanye's flow is diffrent from many others, in a good way. Go buy the album. Buy 5 copies each. This is a CD were you can listen to the WHOLE thing non-stop. No need for skipping. Most Anticipated Debut Album of 2004...I see why"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanye is AMAZING","review":"The College Dropout is without a doubt one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. A classic. So many memorable tracks, everyone is unique and very well written/produced. Kanye takes it to another level. He can be real, make listenable music, not like 50 cent or other \\"mainstream\\" rappers. He reminds me of a young Nas, who I consider to be the second greatest rapper of all time behind Tupac. Im not saying Kanye is the next Nas or Tupac but his future is so promising I might have to he is one day.Best songs1-Family buisness2-Jesus Walks3-Through the Wire4-Never Let You Doen5-Spaceship6-Get em high"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Channel Searching","review":"I had this phone for just over a year with no complaints.

Constructs - It Is Alive seems like it could be this toolbox, but it has some major problems. First of all, this product is for Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition, not 3.5, so you'll have to convert your finished golem if you play 3.5. Furthermore, there are a number of mistakes that can be downright confusing.

Closely affiliated to the work of Mozart, Ms. Haskil shows a strong affinity for the work of Beethoven, Scarlatti and Schumann. As mentioned in the title, this is the most complete performance of her 1953 concert at Ludwigsburg. (The Stradivarius and Monodram recordings leave out a Prelude/Chorale by Bach-Busoni and two short but precious excerpts from Schumann.)

Shades of Abbey road esp. in 'Sunny Pasture'. Feather is moving and doesn't yield easily. Highlight is perhaps 'DNA', which provides an interesting take on the prison of genetic determinitism. In a sense this song returns to the themes earlier expressed in 'Naughty Fatalist' on the debauched 'Drunk' album. The moral- we need not accept the prescription... Perhaps not as successful as Salesman and Bernadette, but this does stand as another of Vic's interesting experiments in collaboration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vic's Worst","review":"I would consider myself a huge Vic chesnutt fan, and I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. Drenched in Daniel Lanois-esque reverb, the texture and production is blaaaaaa. But, the blame may not lay solely on Vic's shoulders. I think the Keneipp's are responsible for some of this mess.The lyrics are muddled and embarrassing, the tunes are rambling (it pains me to write this, I love ALL of his previous albums).The album is not without its highlights--\\"Fissle\\" is great, and \\"Sunny Pasture\\" and \\"Haiku\\" are classic Vic ...... but avoid this album. If you are looking to discover the wonders of Mr. Chesnutt, check out \\"West of Rome\\" or \\"The Salesman and Bernadette.\\" There is absolutely great great Vic Chesnutt out there. This just doesn't happen to be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"relax, it's vic","review":"'merriment' and 'mighty monkey' are instantly classic vic songs. those who already like vic will enjoy this album, it's one of the better ones, very subdued vic, very piano, very mellow, sometimes very sad. some great vic melodies herein, even some beatles sounding background harmonies. great stuff, the one disappointment being that it's ten songs and only thirty minutes long. other than that, it's near perfect vic. another golden chesnutt if i may say."},{"rating":"2","title":"we love you, Vic","review":"Being a long and very devoted fan of Mr. Chestnut (due in part to living in athens for 5 years, about a block away from vic by the way) I can say with certainty that Vic has far outdone all of his previous efforts. However one who is not yet blessed to be acquainted with vic's music should start with \\"West of Rome\\" the move onto \\"Is the Actor Happy?\\" then \\"About to Choke\\" and \\"The Salesman and Bernadette\\" (yes I'm sorry to say but \\"little\\" and \\"drunk\\" can be discarded except for the true chestnuttophile) But without a doubt this record is the finest collection of songs and the best produced album in terms of instrumentation and songwriting style(vic certainly justifies his athens nickname of \\"the leonard cohen of zebulon georgia here) Even being a big fan of vic I would have to say that anyone with musical taste for creative and expressive songwriting would have to fall in love with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scent on the Market","review":"My first introduction to this perfume was when it was being test-sampled at The Bon/Macy's back in 1992 and a woman came up to me and asked if I would try a new perfume.

The supposed help on how to write essays and resumes states the obvious. For example, they explain that your applications should be free of dirt and stains and should be typed. If you don't already know that, good luck in college.This book claims to help non-traditional students. Of all the resources that might apply to me as a non-traditional student, I have found none worth pursuing. Either you have to pay a fee to apply for the scholarships and contests or you have to spend a fortune mailing requests for further information. I tried saving money by looking for information on the internet but ended up wasting more time than it was worth.

If you follow the recommendations and tips in this guide and use the colossal amount of scholarship information presented in the material, your chances of winning scholarship money are greatly improved. I personally was offered more than $100,000 in scholarships (free money!) from those sources listed in the book. Beside this, the tips on writing winning essays, making a résumé, and have a successful search will not only help you on scholarships and admissions essays, but also on jobs and funding in the future.

When I got a letter returned with no forwarding address, all I had to do was contact the authors through their Website ... and the new address was supplied. There are so many scholarship and internship opportunities listed, the only way not to find appropriate scholarships to apply for means either the student used this book for a doorstop or just wanted to open the book and find money inside.

As the case art indicates, Sasuke does have a notable role in the film, and though I'm far from a Sasuke fan, his presence wasn't so involved and grating that I disliked the sequences that centered around him; toward the end of the movie, in fact, I quite enjoyed his part in the events. Even if you've been less than impressed by the previous movies, I'd recommend seeing this one. It's the first time Sasuke's appeared in a movie since Clash in the Land of Snow, and I'd say he definitely makes up for the lost time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I look foreward to the Dub version!","review":"This is a Naruto Movie, with all that means.

This is certainly the direction of the country now.But Ayn Rand was not right about everything (her ideas on religion were biased) and there is a good chance her \\"prophecies\\" will not become completely accurate. If they do, the United States will certainly become a Third World country dominated by other countries who adopted our former economic system.

It is difficult to have confidence with AMAZON pricing policies!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do the math","review":"By my calculation, one can order the 5 seasons separately (the 1-3 set, plus the 4th and 5th) for approximately sixty-three dollars less than the cost of this set.How stupid do they think we are?To be fair, I do not own this set. Does it come in a gold-inlaid wooden box or some such? Somehow, I doubt it. If it came in a attache case complete with replica self-destructing tape player, it still wouldn't be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for the right reader","review":"I find this book well written and useful. Of course most of it is speculation based on what is known from ancient documents about Jesus' life from age 2 to 30 (of which there is little). But I think it is very helpful to speculate and have done so myself. It helps us to realize that Jesus was not some lofty deity who can't know what we go through, but himself experienced all the problems we have in this life, went through the same process of maturation and can sympathize and help us as we face the perplexities of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transaction","review":"This was a very smooth transaction and the book just as described. My Mother-in-Law loves this series and this particular book was a great value for book's condition. Would love to do business again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty useful","review":"I ordered this for my wife during her 22nd week after reading a lot of reviews that the 'Mini' would be sufficient for shorter people. It arrived in perfect condition. The mini snoogle was very good at relieving her back pain (which was just about starting), though it doesnt go all the way through the back. The multiple positions of use are pictured in the packaging card, but lacked any detailing. We had to guess which side was up/down since it was quite hidden in the pictures.For the price, would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It took a few nights for me to really like it.","review":"The first night I used this pillow I kind of hated it. It felt like it was stuffed too full, it was awkward to use/move and I just kind of thought I'd wasted 40 bucks. Id been fully prepared to LOVE this pillow--I really like my memory foam pillow for my head and didn't want to give it up!I planned on returning the pillow the next day, but my husband had already recycled the box. So before I put it on craigslist I thought I should try it again. And I am SO glad I did!It is comfy, for one. And for two it lets me either lay back and kind of tilted or do the same thing forward, which is great! I'm in my sixth month of pregnancy and I really needed something better than the multiple-full-size-pillows trick I was using. It can be a little cumbersome at times and I often with that the U shape at the bottom were just a little wider, but all in all I think it was well worth the money and am very glad I purchased it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable and weird proportion!","review":"I bought this snoogle mini because I was having trouble sleeping mid pregnancy and felt I need support under my growing belly. I bought the mini since I'm only 5'2'' and didn't want the regular snoogle kicking my husband out of bed. Unfortunately, I returned it. It was uncomfortable to tuck between my legs and under my belly. It felt too short. I also felt it was too hard. I tried the variety of positions but it still didn't feel comfortable to me. I prefer hugging a regular pillow lengthwise along my belly for support, or a body pillow would also be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW this is small","review":"When this came I could not beleive how MINI it was, but I tried to make it work........I ended up sending it back! This product is way too small for a grown woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lifesaver","review":"I used this during pregnancy and it was so helpful I couldn't sleep without it. It immediately relieved hip pain and leg pain while I slept or napped. It aligns you and supports you your entire pregnancy. Now, with the baby, it is still very useful for many things, including setting the baby in it like a chair on the floor while you get ready in the bathroom, etc. and for nursing support, etc. A great item, even if it's a little expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"If you ever want to sleep comfortably at all during pregnancy....you will buy a snoogle!

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING"},{"rating":"1","title":"can't support belly and back at the same time","review":"I had the original Snoogle and was looking for a replacement since it's gone a bit flat. I figured I'd try the mini out since the original did take up quite a bit of our CA king bed. I'm not that tall (5'5\\") and not that heavy (125lb pre-prego), so I didn't think it would be an issue. Unfortunately, I wish that I had just ordered another original.The mini is too small. I wanted something to support my belly and back at the same time, however the mini is too short to support both. I still use it, b/c I can't return it (since I needed to open the package to actually try it out), but if I had the opportunity to do it over again, I just would have ordered the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flop!","review":"I was excited about getting this when I was early in my pregnancy and wasn't sleeping comfortably. I will say I was let down by this pillow. It made it even harder to get comfortable. However, after having my baby it was handy when younger kids wanted to hold her, or breastfeeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortable","review":"This pillow helps out so much with comfort at night. I wish it were about 2 inches longer but all in all it was a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As much as I wanted to like this pillow, I didn't. The fabric isn't very breathable and it sits only between your thighs, which may be fine for some, but I am preferring my whole pillow length-wise to keep my entire leg in alignment. The curve in the pillow is too short would be greatly improved if it were longer. I'm 5'4 (and plus-sized) and it was simply too short. It sure is cute and I liked the fact I didn't have to use it as my neck and head pillow if I didn't want to, but I will stick with using four of my regular pillows for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable & Useless","review":"I purchased this for my pregancy and found it a total waste of money because it was so uncomfortable. After my baby came I cut it down to make a spare boppy. Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I bought this pillow thinking that it would work well with my height compared to the regular size snoogle. Wrong-O. I am 5'2\\" and it was worthless and awkward. I honestly can't imagine that the regular size would be much better. A regular body pillow would work much better and be less of a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"My husband got me the Snoogle Mini because we have a queen size bed and the total body would have kicked him out of bed. I am 5'6' but I did expect it to fit from neck to bottom as, in my opinion, the shape suggests. It doesn't fit. I have turned into every position described on the package and it was just uncomfortable. I'll try to use it to nurse or I'll use it when the baby is old enough to sit but still needs a support. If it doesn't work for either of these activities I'll come back and take another star away.Totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't really figure it out","review":"I bought this when I was in my third month of pregnancy and just starting to show. I tried it for a couple of nights and couldn't really figure out how to get comfortable with this thing. I think if it had maybe a little bit less stuffing, I would have been able to get comfortable with it, but this just wasn't working for me. I tried it again every so often as my belly grew and I'm now at 30 weeks and still can't get comfortable with it. I'm 5'4\\" and plus sized but this just isn't working for me. I'll stick to my body pillow from Target, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pregnant sleepers","review":"- supports back/belly and stops knees from rubbing together- my tossing and turning while sleeping has decreased- cover is removable and easy to wash"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was Puzzling","review":"Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm pretty petite and I could not wrap my head around it... literally. I could not get comfortable and I had to return it and buy a bigger one. Soooo happy I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"I was using 3 pillows to try and sleep comfortably with one between my legs, one under/next to my belly, and one under my head. With using the Mini Snoogle it takes up less space in our bed and I only use this and one pillow under my head now. Don't expect for this pillow to fit under your head and under your legs at the same time b/c it is the mini and is shorter. This product is great for shorter women. I am 5'1\\". I don't suggest getting the mini if you only want one pillow to use under your head and between your legs. In that case, I would get the regular Snoogle! This pillow works great for me b/c I am fine using a regular pillow for my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"This pillow has worked great for me. I'm 6 months pregnant--It is the Snoogle MINI - so it is not designed to be a full body pillow, but that is what I liked about it. It allows me to continue sharing the bed with my husband, which is very important to me!Definitely would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This pillow is amazing, even for tall women!","review":"I am 6' tall and purchased this pillow about halfway through my second trimester. As some other reviewers have mentioned, it is NOT meant to go underneath your head and between your legs at the same time. I have a pillow for my head that I prefer to sleep with, so I was looking for something that would help ease some discomfort in my hips as well as support my growing belly. Since receiving this pillow, I've been sleeping so much better! I put the curved part between my thighs / around the back of my butt and tuck the longer side under my tummy. The curved part prevents me from rolling flat on my back (a no-no once the belly starts to grow!), and the entire pillow keeps me in a comfortable position all night to prevent the tossing and turning I was doing before. I also like the smaller profile...space is at a premium in our Queen-sized bed (which is often also shared with a large dog!). I am so happy I found the Snoogle Mini!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"Works ok to put between my legs at night, but it's too small for me to use it as a body pillow. I'm 5' 7\\", so I'm neither short nor super tall. I wish I had ordered a different pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"better night sleep","review":"I gave this to my sister who is 4 months pregnant and she was so happy with the gift. It is the only pillow she uses to sleep with and she is excited to use it for other things later on after the baby comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"I haven't tried any of the other pregnancy pillows, but this one has helped immensely. The cover is soft and the pattern looks nice. Of course, it's nice that it doesn't take up half my bed.The only problem which isn't really a problem but more a matter of preference, is that the pillow is one uniform thickness (basically a tube) all the way around. I've tried to use it for tummy support but it's too thick, so I have to cram it under my stomach when lying on my side which is very uncomfortable. So I basically just use it to go between my legs and put the long end behind my back which keeps me from rolling over onto my back. This is perfectly fine, but unfortunately I will have to supplement with a wedge pillow to go under my stomach now that I'm over 5 months. So depending on how you want to use the pillow, it may or may not meet your needs.FYI, I'm 5'2\\" and the size fits me well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't comfortable","review":"This just did not do the trick for me. I'm 5'2\\", so I thought the mini snoogle would be better for me. I really didn't like anything about it. The top part is uncomfortable to use as a pillow, which is one way it is shown for usage. I have tried bending it all sorts of different ways, and just none are comfortable. It doesn't contour to my body well at all. I wound up getting a regular body pillow and am happier with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely enjoyable 80's style horror","review":"Hide and Go Shriek was suprisingly good of its type. Like Friday the 13th and its zillions of imitators, this film centers on a group of teens interested in the usual booze and sex. Gratuitious nudity is no treat for female viewers, but if you can look past it you'll find an atmospheric entertaining film. The Furniture Store is chock full of eery looking mannequins and there is a terrifying elevator scene!! Its different and pretty good for horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engineers review - does not work","review":"While trying different options for moving product (rv refrigerators) at work, this was one of 4 suction cups I purchased.

While she witnesses the behind closed doors lives of the X's, Annie realizes that money doesn't bring happinness and that Grayson, for all his comfort, is neglected by social climbing parents in a loveless union."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a flat and inconsistent film with little dramatic tension","review":"Every supporting character is one dimensional while Scarlett Johanssen, looking absolutely beautiful, is given predictable situations and dialogue against the stoic and clueless Laura Linney. The voice over setting this film up as an anthropological study does not remain throughout some of the most important incidences in the film. It becomes a non-entity set against flat, nondramatic moments. A disappointment all the way 'round about what could be a compelling subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy???","review":"This is one of those movies where they put all the funny parts in the trailer. The movie itself is not that good, and actually rather depressing. I could barely stand to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlett made it bearable","review":"Being male I found this movie's portayal of the sexes disparaging to say the least. It has women as honest, hard working, kind, and constantly taken advantage of. Men, on the other hand, bad men! Men are adulterous, sexist, selfish pigs, and always taking advantage. Except for the College Hottie (who I'm sure all us average Joes can relate to). Don't mistake me...I'm not obssesed with hating this movie or anything.

I mean, wow, big deal...rich people in NY pawn off tedious work related to parenting and other daily tasks to others. What a shocker! And the ending... well, it's all a little too nice and tidy.The main character struggles with getting close to the child she is responsible for, but somehow manages to get fired, just in time for her to write a story about her \\"anthropologic adventure\\" - which is submitted as an application to grad school. Yeah, she got close enough just to establish a bond and generate enough content for a story.

The letters and journals of these three men give a lively picture of their activities, which included meetings with King George, Pitt, and other leaders of the day.

As a result you could use this book to prove almost any point you want. It seems the author wanted the book to be all things for all people and she has ended up with a book that is nothing to nobody.

I was disappointed. The original version was subtle - interesting things happening in the background, great characters. The remake is not nuanced.

Jennifer Lopez seemed angry at the world, and it wasn't appealing. Richard Gere played Richard Gere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good watch but................","review":"There is something about Jennifer Lopez's character that just doesn't come off. Jennifer's portrayal is fine but her character seem to be (isolated is the only word I can come up with). There is a certain amount of tension between Jennifer's character and Richard's, but it's almost like with just a little bit of a re-write Lopez's character could have been of much less import, portrayed by any number of actresses, and the movie wouldn't have suffered much.

I'm pretty sure that if I did not see the Japanese version first, I would have enjoyed the American version a little more. The American version is very light fare. The movie has its good moments, but on the whole it isn't a great movie. All the performances were okay. I just wished Jennifer Lopez didn't look so...constipated. Yes sexy as usual, but in trying to look distracted she missed the mark for me. But I am comparing Mrs. Lopez's performance to the Japanese Version's counterpart. The Japanese version was a longer movie, and the characters were well established.

I would highly recommend seeing the original to see what this remake was lacking.The newer version with Richard Gere and J-Lo had a lot of quick editing in the dance sequences and the dancing did not seem as refined. Also Stanley Tucci's role was cute, but his counterpart in the original, Mr. Aoki was downright hilarious.

I also recommend that you watch the original Japanese version of \\"Shall We Dance\\", which this movie is based on. Both films share similiarities, but it is interesting to watch both versions of \\"Shall We Dance\\" and make your own comparisons. My favorite of the two is the American version of \\"Shall We Dance\\", with Richard Gere. He is a multi-talented actor with a touch of Fred Astaire. And he can really dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even J Lo is likeable.","review":"Your basic modern romantic comedy. Richard Gere is an attorney in Chicago, happily married to Susan Sarandon but confused. Something is missing that he can't confide to her. He finds something totally outside his experience, his family & wife: Ballroom dancing. Dancing can be very sexy especially with a teacher like Jennifer Lopez. She is toned down here & very modest but still beautiful. Gere is attracted to her. But there's no hanky-panky. Jusy sexy dancing. The usual complications & misunderstandings ensue & they are all worked out. It's a date movie, maybe even a chick flick, (Gere is a good-looking dude). See it with you wife or girlfriend. It won't hurt. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gere and Jaylo are Very Good","review":"Richard Gere is not losing his acting spark, in fact he is getting better and better. He works well with Jennifer Lopez, and even with a very weak supporting cast, the story still works. Oh, let's not forget Susan Sarandon, who is alittle underused in the film. Her performance is OK, but she is capable of much more. The message of the film is very good, that love and family and happiness are the most important things in life, but before family relations really work, both partners must be happy about themselves too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Film With J.Lo Doing Some Nice Dancing","review":"Do not see this film if you are a cynic and only want to see things \\"blowed up real good.\\" Because it is always romantic and often sentimental in a sophisticated way. Gere is excellent and has much verisimilitude in his portral of a man looking for something more in life. I was worried that J.Lo's part would be underwritten, but not so. Her three dance scenes are cool and erotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"I'd actually give this one 2 1/2 stars, because there were a lot of enjoyable parts to this film; plenty of laughs and good dancing scenes. Predictable plot, bad acting, cheesy script, and cheesier music make it not so good. Jennifer Lopez might as well have been a cardboard cutout for how much personality she shows in the movie. What happened to the girl we fell in love with in The Wedding Planner??!!! Aside from one scene of great dancing and a few other likable dances she spends the rest of the movie trying too hard to look sad. Way too many shots of her staring out windows looking calculatedly pathetic. Is she supposed to be tragic and mysterious?? I'm not sure. The supporting characters are what make this movie worthwhile, not the two big stars, I've never cared much for Richard Gere anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best things happen when you're dancing...","review":"Richard Gere stars as John Clark, a weary, happily married but bored man who notices a beautiful woman in the window of a dance studio, and before he knows it, he's taking ballroom dance lessons. John overcomes his initial awkwardness on the dance floor and soon finds great pleasure in dancing as well as the new friendships he makes there.This lightweight bit of escapism is a treat for fans of Richard Gere, who never looked better. His everyman character is unremarkable in every way, which makes the dramatic dance numbers even more enjoyable. Susan Sarandon is the wife who is too busy to notice the spark is long-gone. The beautiful Lopez gives a low-key performance (the script disappoints in the romance department), dancing up a storm.\\"Shall We Dance?\\" is a simple story of ordinary people who find joy on the dance floor. It's very pleasant and immediately forgettable, but would be of special interest to fans of ballroom dancing.Kona"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch","review":"Great movie! It's so much fun to watch Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gear dance. After seeing the movie my husband and I took ballroom dancing lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!!!","review":"I saw a sneak preview of this movie over the weekend with a group of fellow students and instructors from our ballroom dance studio. I absolutely love the original Japanese version of this movie, so I was hesitant to see the remake and had very low expectations.I was pleasantly surprised! While the remake cannot capture the charm of the original, it has some charms of it's own.They did have to stretch for a reason why Gere's and Tucci's characters would have to sneak around to take lessons.Tucci's character was a hoot. They could have left out the homophobia attached to why he was secretly taking lessons. I don't really think the attitude in America is that all men who ballroom dance are gay. Most of the guys I know are doing it to impress women and perhaps meet women who totally outnumber them at dance studios.All in all worth seeing, especially if you are a dancer. You will get all the inside jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"It's two fading stars (Sarandon and Gere) and a fresh faced newcomer (Lopez) starring in the only movie I have ever walked out of. This is crap. We've seen it all before.Happily, after I left, the waitress at Denny's kept me on my toe's.Really, I left the theatre. And I was the only one in the theatre. I was so uncomfortable with all concerned I had to leave.Ergo, the Ultimate Omelette.I know that in the great somewhere some idiot thought that the combination of Gere and Sarandon and Lopez would make a good movie. It's crap. Like REAL CRAP. The whole thing was ghastly. He loves/She loves/He decides to dance to woo his wife back/the teacher loves him/he has feelings for her....It all winds up in a tasty omelette served by a tired and overworked waitress. At Denny's.More coffee?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stanley Tucci, BRAVO!","review":"Stanley Tucci saved this film from a 1 star rating. He & Richard Gere's other male dance students, Miss Mitzi, the detective & his hiliarious assistant made the movie fun!! Otherwise, it was a dud.The marriage of Gere & Sarandon had no chemistry. That the wife & stupid kid showed up & ruined his big day, stunk.Jennifer Lopez is mesmerizing to watch, beautiful as always, but they stuck her in a corner! It was a crime and a waste of Lopez's tremendous screen presence."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no.","review":"Rather than typing out a long explaination behind my \\"oh no,\\" let's keep this short and sweet. Basically, about half way through the movie I got bored and started surfing the net.But at least it opened up some some time for me to bookmark some stuff for my Amazon wishlist, write an overdue email to Mom and update my blog.On a side note, Richard Gere's lack of facial expression was a bit alarming.Only watch if you think you need an excuse to free up some time for internet surfing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is the best movie I have sen for a very long time - awesome, inspiring story, very funny at times, very romantic and touching! A film for everyone who is brave enough to follow his/her dreams! I film for everyone who wants to be happy!The best movie ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An O.K. movie - definitely missing something","review":"I enjoyed the music and the dancing - not enough of it though - it was pretty to look at and enjoyed the premise of the ballroom dancing scene - However,after digesting the crux of the movie it seems really silly - True love for his wife but secret desire to dance? Why hide taking dancing lessons? Gere never came across as really loving anyone but himself - there just was not any chemistry between either women to me. Middle age women loved the end - however, to keep hidden so long from his wife the dance lessons and his new set of friends seems suspect - I have not seen the original film - perhaps the Japanese culture better explains this premise - but not in the United States -As I originally stated - good movie for the music and dancing - enjoy it for what it is - but something definitely missing in the common sense department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"I saw a sneak preview of \\"Shall We Dance?\\" tonight and I loved it! It was one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. Richard Gere was great! The movie was funny and sweet. One minute I was laughing and the next I had tears in my eyes. My favorite part had to be when he came up the escalater dressed in a tux and carrying a single red rose. He took my breath away. I really enjoyed the dancing in the movie. All in all it was a great movie. I will definitely go see it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a dancing DUD!","review":"If you've ever seen the Japanese original, this film will be a HUGE letdown, screwing it up in every stereotypical Hollywoodish way imaginable: kitsch, corniness, cliche, patronizing the audience stupidity, etc. Richard Gere is an OK actor, Jennifer Lopez is barely average (even if she's a hot babe) and this movie is just a disaster.I almost walked out after the first twenty minutes, it was so bad. The main reason I paid was the $8 tub of exquisitely chemically-buttered popcorn we had invested in, so I stayed put in order to thicken my arteries a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time. Just watch the original Japanese version","review":"After seeing years ago 1995 Japanese original I was willing to give it a chance. But what a horrible remake! Not to mention, dancing and music choices are even worse. Practicing supposedly classic ballroom waltz (or whatever it was meat to be...) to an Argentine Tango tune from GOTAN project just kills it entirely for anyone who has at least something to do with dancing. Solo danced by J-Lo had to be in cuts.... Is Hollywood no longer capable to produce anything meaningful and on their own?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, fun, and sexy...","review":"I have just returned from a sneak preview of this film. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, as evidently did the rest of the sold-out audience. This version is simply 'different' than the Japanese original. Not better, not worse. I laughed, I cried, I was swept away by the dancing, and all the characters were memorably charming. Richard Gere can still send me swooning, and his dance moves aren't bad either! I recommend this film, but only if you want to have a super good time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie review for Shall We Dance","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much and so did my husband. It was one of the best I have seen in awhile. The dancing was good and so was the music. The story flowed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Gere and J. Lo mix well!","review":"Very nice movie. Romantic. The music in the movie was great so I reccommend the sound track as well. Seeing Richard Gere and J.Lo together was both romantic and hot! Seeing Richard Gere in a tux with a rose was beyond hot! A must see for lovers of Richard Gere, J.

This particular album combines elements of calypso, reggae, and ska to formulate the impressive blend that is Roughneck's signature sound. The album appeals to pop-listeners in a general sense with all of the catchy hooks, but also to music lovers who appreciate the level of fluency with which each band member expresses himself. The music itself pays homage to 2-tone ska while recognizing its own place in the ska genre as well as the music world. The songs themselves are mainly upbeat tunes and extremely danceable. Judge Roughneck is an amazingly dynamic crowd catalyst to see live, and this album is the most representative of the band's current direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Story!","review":"As usual, Carl Weber has done it again!

When it got to the middle I was like...what in the world is going on?!?!?! lol I read this book in about 7 hrs. It was full of drama and definitely a page turner. It was definitely a good read. I liked the fact that Mr. Weber told a story without giving obvious hints to what was REALLY going to happen. It made you thing in the middle of the story but you wanted to know what was happening with the next person so you didn't have time to dwell on what could be. I would definitely recommend this book. It's actually 4.5 stars but I messed myself up by reading a headliner of a review before starting the book; therefore, I was kind of expecting something to happen... I just didn't know what."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Awesome!!!","review":"I couldn't get enough of this drama filled, page turning, suspense filled novel!

I thought the writing was juvenile and boring. And no every book is not to be \\"literature\\", but I found myself skipping through chapters just to get to the end. And now finishing, just think he had so much opportunity to write it better. He kept referring to sex as \\"put it in\\"...I was left thinking, who talks let that, let alone, what man talks like that. I also did not like how he took advantage of larger women by almost making it seem the one way she could get a man was to pick one who turns out to be gay and then after all the drama still stuck with him. He just conjured up all the stereotypes that heavy women don't have choices for a good man and that they are always concerned about their weight and threatened by smaller women. I was surprised by the number of stars this one received."},{"rating":"1","title":"So typical, no surprises on some characters","review":"well everything in the beginning was choppy and he gave the wrong character the longest chapters you had to be dumb if you didn't know brent was gay and jackie was a man. james was cool. it would have been nice to know more about sonny and what made him that way. james and his situation was good the story line was good. but it seems that the arthur didn't really want to write anything good about a straight couple thats what bother me the most that the married man was cheating and the other was crazy and the gay was a cover up. now i don't know that much about the arthur but thru his writing him seems gay its seems to be written all in the writing no women in this book got anything positive out of their situation/ so that kind of lets me know that he might be gay. cause he took more time describing the men to the tee. this book should be called the gay with sidekicks lmao. i would not buy this book. im glad i only borrowed it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I just finished reading this book last night and it was okay. It was filled drama and more drama but it didn't have the intriguing drama like the Preacher's Son. I am awaiting his book \\"First Lady\\" which will be out next year.

The Preacher's Son has definitely earned its New York Bestseller's award. However, So You Call Yourself A Man has left me dumbfounded and speechless, and not in a good way. Having read at least one hundred novels in my young lifetime, I know that I have just read a good novel when I am left wondering about characters long after reading the last page. With this book, however, I was glad that it was over so that the intense and overwhelmingly sad drama could be over. With Weber's other books, the drama is tolerable enough to end with a good twist, but rest for the characters. This book ends with unrest for the characters, and the reader as well. This was definitely not a favorite for me. Better luck next time!

I have read other Carl Weber novels before and I thought this book would be pretty predictable, ordinary, and typical. I'm happy to say that I was wrong! This book was creative, suspenseful, and page-turning. Upon first impression, I was convinced that James was the \\"screwed up\\" friend with the most issues to overcome. Again, I was so wrong! By the end of the novel, you will see that James problems almost seem trivial in comparison to Brent's and Sonny's secrets. The plot of this novel is jaw-dropping.

I could not recommend this book to anyone, because it is true that it encourages one to blame oneself for all one's problems and is not realistic. Dr. Susan Forward has a much healthier way of handling problems. She states clearly that we are not responsible for damage done to us, especially during childhood; we are responsible for taking charge of our own lives as adults. Instead of encouraging readers to disregard emotional pain and believe that they choose to accept it, Susan encourages us to get angry over what people have done to us. It is a great way to turn anger into grief and into healing. Three cheers for Susan Forward! If you are intent on improving your self-worth, ignore this book and go for books by Susan Forward and Lillian Glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Words, Not My Favorite Music","review":"I always love Petra music.

In all fairness, there is no comparing a $2000 system with a 6 hundi. It is just that, my expectations were not high with the $600 Philips, I really wanted to like this damn thing. It is beautiful in appearance, horrible in long term sound. I say long term, because if I heard this thing cranked up at an appliance store, I would be all, wooo whooo.

There is a discussion thread concerning this in the discussion area so check it out. Essentially you get significant video noise in the form of green vertical lines in 1080p. Frankly, the more I read the more I suspect that most people simply haven't tried 1080p and thus haven't encountered this yet. Or they don't have a 1080p capable TV. Could be wrong about that but I do know that Philips has their head in the sand when it comes to this problem and their customer service (if you can even call it that) is horrible. Too bad because the unit is a good idea, looks great, and otherwise functions as advertised. I'd wait until another company with a clue comes out with something similar in Blue Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy for the right space","review":"The sound this system generates does not match a \\"hard wired\\" surround system.

For the money, this is a great solution for those who want more than the canned speakers on the tv and who can't, or don't want, to install a true surround system. For those who have been critical of the auxiliary inputs being placed on the end instead of behind (and out of sight) I offer this - when mounted, these inputs need to be accessible unless you want to permanently keep devices plugged in.

It may have been short, but I'll never know because I was instantly repulsed and decided to have it end right then and there. I can handle and even enjoy your typical action violence found in movies just fine, but I'm not one to appreciate the torture of women, or anyone really, except terrorists.

I've watched the first four seasons, and they are mostly very, very good. This 5th season is not nearly so. The sets are very artificial-looking. Many of the plots are weak, and the acting thin. Leslie Warren is awful in the beginning but steadily improves as the season progresses. Unclear why Sam Elliot alternates with Peter Lupus, who actually develops a personality after four seasons of blah. I did not like that the introduction of each episode is inconsistent one to the next. Some of the character actors utilized throughout are excellent, such as George Sanders. This is Leonard Nimoy's second season, and he is not as good as in the first, but this may be due to the weak plotlines. Peter Graves and Greg Morris are the stabalizers; very good each time out.I hope the final two seasons will improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mission Impossible","review":"Very adventures and action is complicated.This series did not aged with time.Very sentimental to watch the actors in their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update in content is needed","review":"Even though I was fascinated with the Mission Impossible Series when I was a child, they helped, in certain way, the government.

This season, the show also featured Paris, a master of disguise, played with gusto by Leonard Nimoy, fresh off of what would later be a legendary performance as Mr. Spock on Star Trek.This show will always be treasured for its pioneering plot devices and its challenge to the viewer to keep up with what was going on.

I know that even they don't know all they can do, but still...Was it me or did Norman's writing get a bit mechanical? Carrie seemed to lose most of her personality.

I found his testimony to be salacious, and ultimately lost any credibility he had with me. His warning to the church is also misdirected. The problem is NOT with the contemporary authors he takes out of context to make a point, the warning should go to the church who only hears half of what these authors are trying to say. Brian is guilty of the same. His warning should be for a people who would only hear half of the contmpleteive message... Those who only want an experience OF God, and not the experience of a relationship With God, wich requires obedience, humility and faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning to all spiritual aspirants","review":"I am rather surprised at the lack of critical reviews of this book, so I will offer one of my own. My own experience is quite the opposite of Mr. Flynn's. I am a former fundamentalist Christian whose eyes were opened to the truth of the mystical, pluralistic path and the dangers of fundamentalism. Brian Flynn is a dangerous fanatic who seems bound and determined to bring out the worst in Christianity and to suppress everything positive the Christian tradition has to offer. He fails to realize that the true essence of Jesus' teachings is quite harmonious with eastern spiritual practices. He tirelessly advocates the futile attempt to know God on a purely intellectual level, while condemning as dangerous and demonic any effort to truly know God on an experiential level, as Jesus himself did. If you would like to read a book that more accurately represents the true teachings of Jesus, I would recommend Paramahansa Yogananda's \\"The Second Coming of Christ.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Christians!","review":"With the onslaught of lies and new-age technics coming into the Body of Christ, it is imperative that Christians know the Word of God, and also learn how subtle and deceptive the tactics of some so-called \\"Christain leaders\\" have become."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR ALL CHRISTIANS!","review":"This book is a must read by all Christians!!! Today, churches and bookstores (even Christian bookstores) are full of non-biblical, New Age ideas and authors that are doing a great job of leading believers off the narrow path and onto the wide path that leads to destruction. Brian Flynn does a great job of exposing the New Age practices and concepts that have infiltrated Christian theology. Not only does he give you his view (as a former New Ager), but he also gives the reader lots of examples, along with references, so that his statements can be verified. I couldn't put the book down!

The only track I really liked was Voice Inside My Head, where Natalie really showed how strong her voice is. The others songs that were passable were The Long Way Around and Not Ready To Make Nice. I found Lullaby to be 6 minutes of boring repetition. I guess I prefer a more country/bluegrass/acoustic sound, most of the songs just didn't catch my ear. I also thought that the album photographs were really ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"The first thing that hit me in this CD was, as someone else posted, that it sounded more like a Maines solo work rather than a Chicks CD.

Stylisticly this is nothing like \\"Home\\" or \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" and if that is what you are looking for, save your money, this one's not for you. I was and I'm very disappointed.

That pretty much speaks for itself right there. This album is a strong effort by the Chicks. It's right up there with \\"Home\\", but I don't feel it's as strong as \\"Fly\\" or \\"Wide Open Spaces\\". That certainly doesn't take away from this album. Those 2 afformentioned albums are borderline masterpieces. \\"Taking The Long Way\\" isn't quite a masterpiece, but it's a very good album. More polished, more mature, more adult-oriented subject matter and themes. It's part of the evolution, and I'm glad to see the Dixie Chicks survived the backlash the media created. Yes, the media created it. Ask 100 people if they support the Dixie Chicks and what they said, and you'll get 90 \\"Yes\\" answers. However, the media portrayed them as poison.

This one comes the closest to being solid, yet still manages to just miss the mark because of its lack of variety and its overproduction. Most of the songs are good, though, some better than good. Yet there is nothing as engagingly humorous here as \\"White Trash Wedding,\\" from their last one (\\"Lubbuck Or Leave It\\" is an amusing country song title, though). Otherwise, this is much more musically complex and interesting than HOME... and congratulations to The Chicks for the defiance of the red state insistence that one must agree with everything a Republican president says and does or one is unpatriotic (it doesn't go both ways, not surprisingly; if the president happened to be a liberal Democrat, it would be open season).

However songs 2-13 sound all the same, almost all having the same guitar cords and Natalie seems to be singing in the same key for each and every song.

It is kind of ironic given that many of the Dixie Chicks supporters cry \\"freedom of speech.\\"The music on this CD, which includes a lament about infertility, is pretty unexiting given all the controversy. I keep reading that the Dixie Chicks are \\"brave\\" but it doesn't take bravery to come out and say that you've changed your mind (again) and are now against Bush (again) when his approval ratings are as low as they are now.

I bought it after hearing only two songs and was quite disappointed. They had waited a while to release a new album and so you would have thought they would have produced a more solid effort.I would have to say that there are production problems that make much of the sound far too diffuse. And then there are the lyrics and Ms. Maine's tone of voice: All the whining is a bit hard to take from a group of extremely rich ladies. One song is even about one of the Chicks difficulties getting pregnant. They are even complaining now to the press about weak concert ticket sales in some markets, as if they have some kind of inherent right to sell out every show. Their CD is #1 in sales and they should be happy, but instead they're still whining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be biased","review":"The Dixie Chicks are more than a country group, they are legend. Not only have they helped boot country to become the likeable country-rock that it is today, the trio have won numerous awards, garnered huge critical acclaim and sell millions and millions of records. But how does their latest offering, the extremely personal Taking The Long Way, come up against its predecessors? Pretty darn good, actually. Though its serious overtones may be a little depressing at first (since the Chicks are typically known for upbeat, energetic tunes), the record is also the most personal of the Chicks' career, addressing many topics (including the infamous anti-Bush statement) with hit songs like \\"Not Ready To Make Nice,\\" the highlight of Taking The Long Way. There are some faster songs here, like opener \\"The Long Way Around\\" and \\"Voices Inside My Head.\\" It's not perfect, but it's definitely an intriguing and insightful album from one of music's most inspirational acts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best","review":"WOW!

The songs on the Dixie Chicks' new CD, penned by all the Chicks and forcefully interpreted by lead singer Maines, achieve an emotional maturity and depth that other writers and performers of country rock can only wish for.The title song, \\"Taking the Long Way Around,\\" says it all. Perpetual teenagers look for shortcuts to adulthood and cave in to pressure in all its forms, peer and otherwise, while real adults choose the long, hard way to personal freedom and integrity. They courageously take on a world where only skilled a** kissers are welcome, and all others need not apply. When Maines sings, \\"No, I / I could never follow,\\" I find myself thanking this free country's lucky stars that she never could."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: AMAZING!","review":"I've been a chicks fan for as long as I can remember, so naturally I had high expectations for this long-anticipated album. It completely exceeded any expectations that I had. The sound is more diverse and varied than anything else in country today. This album is country for people who hate country. The instrumentation is great- very rich and interesting without being overdone. The songwriting is wonderful and so much deeper than anything I've ever heard them do. \\"Lubbock or Leave It\\" is a sizzling, energetic romp, \\"I Hope\\" is a beautiful, soulful blues-rock tune, and \\"Lullaby\\" will absolutely give you chills the first time you here it. There are no bad, or even mediocore tracks on this absolutely stellar album. If you buy one album this year, make \\"Taking the Long Way\\" that album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Record","review":"A superb album, from three lovely women who have been treated quite unfairly, if you ask me.

'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignoring this music over politics would be a huge mistake","review":"As a non-country music, college educated professional who spent 24 years in Texas, leaving in 1988 and never looking back,my thoughts are that this album has heart and talent all throughout it. Practically all the songs are very accessible to people of all musical tastes and speak to us of the adult challenges we all face-whether blue state or red state lovers. The Chicks are highly talented musicians who continue to evolve. Oh, and they are right about Lubbock. Buddy Holly was reviled by many in the Lubbock populace in the 1950's for playing what was seen as that \\"black people's\\" rock n roll and marrying a Hispanic.

I was disapointed.TCBRN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malleable Sounds","review":"In Taking the Long Way, the Dixie Chicks show that they are a versatile group, but a number of the songs seem to reflect the musical style of the collaborating songwriters as much (or more) than the Chicks' own musical style. The result is an album that which is much less country than previous albums and at times can be fairly generic. After a few listens, three or four of the songs have grown on me, and the album is still good, solidly played music, but as a country fan, I think it falls short of other albums the Chicks have made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much...","review":"I really, really, wanted to like this. I LOVE the Chicks, always have, and totally supported them through the whole political thing. But I have to agree with the reviewers who have said that when all is said and done, the songs aren't very good. Nothing catchy or moving on here, like there usually is. Maybe it's because they used a bunch of other songwriters, or something - I don't know. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks Do Make Nice","review":"This is clearly one of the Chicks best albums to date. No matter what your politics, this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This album was disappointing, not because of the material or performances, but because of the heavy hand of producer Rick Rubin, who decided the Dixie Chicks are really a pop act. Consequently, instead of the delicate acoustic subtleties of previous albums what you get is in-your-face, overcompressed and overly-bright with an annoyingly up-front snare that bangs without variation as if it were a sequenced sample.Compare this with the classic \\"Wide Open Spaces\\", which is beautifully recorded and mastered and worthy of use as a reference for recording engineers. The contrast with \\"Long Way\\" is depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I absolutely love this CD, from start to finish.

All honest reviewers must admit that the super-patriot Dixie Chicks new CD is the greatest album in all of rock history. \\"Taking the Long Way\\" makes \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and Boston's first LP look like International Submarine Band releases. It is so good would won't be able to stop listening. You will just listen to this CD, and only this CD, for weeks or even months (maybe years?) on end, it is so good. The CD isn't just good, it is PERFECT! It isn't just perfect, it is INTELLIGENT! Listen to the lyrics and marvel at how SMART they are. The Dixie Chicks are the best and this CD is the Best of the BEST!!!

The Dixie Chicks may not come across as especially bright when you see them interviewed on TV but at least their heart is in the right place. The music is above average pop although it is highly commercial. If you want to hear music with more of a message, I recommend fellow Canadian Neil Young's latest or, my favorite, Green Day's \\"American Idiot.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back and they're good.","review":"The person who sits next to me at work told me how much she was loving this CD, so I ordered it from Amazon, and was thrilled that I got it so quickly. I put on headphones and listened to the whole CD in one sitting, something I haven't done since highschool. There's a folksy-rocky-bluesy feel to the CD. Every song is thoughtful and interesting, but the album really takes off at track #6, Lullaby. The best tracks are the life issues and social commentary tracks, but I don't mind that they spent several songs venting: receiving death threats over a comment is ridiculous, and besides, I think six or seven really great songs on a CD is pretty good. The vocals are as good as the music, which is saying something, because the music is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word... Wow!","review":"I bought two copies of \\"Taking the Long Way\\", one for my mom, and one for me. From the moment I turned it on I knew I was listening to something incredible. This album is like 70's California rock with a country/bluegrass twist. Every song has something to say. They cover everything from personal integrity, to alzhiemers, to infertility. This CD is a must have for any music lover. Anyone who says it's bad or mediocre cleary has no idea what they're listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"True class a voice from the 60's and 70's.","review":"These ladies have true class. A voice from the 60's and 70's when Dylan, Dave Von Ronk, Peter, Paul and Mary, and many others spoke the truth, often the unpopular truth. Music in years past spoke to who we where, these ladies have the class and the integrity to speak their mind. Their collective voices are those of an angel and their belief in humanity raises them above that. For those who seem concerned because they are not just purely country, understand that they have grown to the music of humanity a far greater calling. Buy two copies to show your support for our nation, freedom and morality, these ladies are not only beautiful they have the courage to speak their truth. Music has often defined us and \\"Taking the Long Way\\" is on the same path."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it! Love it Love it Love it","review":"I had never been a DC's fan.I actually didn't know them before.I just heard all their work and so far this is their best job ever.Now I am officially their fan.I love this CD. Great!Finally full of \\"meanings\\" and very touching in my opinion it deserves to be heard because it says something (Those monkeys on the barricades wouldn't understand anyway).I cannot put it down and it is very soul-touching!Makes me cry.....R"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music ... courage to be politically incorrect!","review":"I have to admit right of the bat that I was a big time Bush supporter and voted for him twice. At first I followed the PC media in mocking and censoring these ladies. But all the while in the back of my mind of was curious what their music was really like. After buying this album, I can tell you: from a die-hard Republican, these ladies have mega-guts. I have the utmost respect for people of honor like the Dixie Chicks who are brave enough to go against the PC tide and challenge others when they see a wrong being committed. Thanks ladies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new","review":"The Dixie Chicks are selling this album at a deep discount and are cancelling concerts across America. There is a reason: they're offering nothing new. More of the same. They haven't grown, and the act has gotten old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over!","review":"I heard this CD for the first time last week at a friend's house. My friend's wife actually played it twice. Now I am no pop-country fan and certainly no fan of the Chicks, but one song just seemed to blend into the next leaving me to wonder where the substance and maturity every other reviewer is talking about here. The fact that it received album of the year only highlights the sad state of the Grammies.I will admit to being quite surprised that very little of this CD was political, and will add one star to my review for that reason alone. The damage is done though! First Maines apologies for her ill-advised comments at a concert in England, then spends two years wining about the inevitable backlash she received for making them.Speaking of backlash, I guess I have set myself up to get some here from the legions of starry-eyed Chicks fans. Funny, it never ceases to amaze me how folks will rate a review \\"not helpful\\" just because they do not agree with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lackluster anti-Bush album","review":"There are two good songs on the album, and it was better than Neil Young's pathetic attempt at an anti-Bush rant, but even at Amazon's cut-rate price, I'll take a pass, and before any of you Kool-aid drinkers flame me in your tiny little thoughts, I bought the album \\"Rage against Bush\\" (various artists) because it did have qulity music.Just don't tell me that the album is quality - it isn't. I'm sure every Goth anti-Bush zealot will buy it because of its politics, but this CD will be forever collecting dust 14 days after purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"What music!!!???","review":"Ok..not country..not rock, pick a genre please. They were better before all of the political mess. Now they are LA pop wannabes, the music is not growing but has fallen stagnate to just being a political retort soundtrack. *YAWN*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and politically motivated","review":"Like Bon Jovi, the Dchix just cannot keep their big mouths shut and just give us great music. Loved these gals who are great musicians, just so tired of the rambling blather about subjects they really do not know anything about. Just stick with the music and let the lobbyists handle the bungling of the times. Oh sure, the voices are heard but I want the music to be music not some politically motivated rant and wail. Whining is at an all time high here and can we even wonder what they will have to talk about in 2009? I was so disappointed I threw this out the car window and watched with glee as a Kenworth drove over it and smashed it into little bits. Nat, well her voice is annoying in the first place so I would rather hear a fire alarm at close range. The songs are about as intelligent as a Ted Kennedy driving school manual. I hope the next album gets back to basics and they let Bon Jovi deal with being a poser."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Be Consistent","review":"I so very much agree with The Twizzler from Philly and Green-T from Chicago. All of these wine&cheese;/art gallery rats/birkenstock wearing/patchouli smelling progressives singing the praises over this group and this CD truly shows me how desperate so many of the Left are in their rage for Bush & Co.My roomate, a left leaning Dem bought this CD along with a few others lefties in her study group just \\"to show support for Natalie\\" LOL She never even opened the CD! I did and i hated it for the simple reasons:I don't like country music or folk music in general.I couldn't stand the angsty whining of these three \\"chicks.\\"I thought this stuff became passe with the death of Kurt Cobain and the decline in popularity of Lilith Fair pseudo-folkies like Fiona Apple, Morissette and that other Natalie - Natalie Merchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dixie Chicks Grammy Material?","review":"I'm still amused at all the hubbub about these young ladies. Ever since they interjected polemics into their act they've alienated a considerable portion of their target audience. Stations continue to refuse to play their songs and concert dates have been cancelled or postponed. Their Grammy wins, voted on by industry sycophants no less and not the public, mean nothing. The album title pretty much sums up their continued politically-infused tact. To that I say give me music and not your damn opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bomber","review":"I think this cd is the worst they have ever made. I will NEVER BUY another cd from this group again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Song On A Just OK Album","review":"I told my husband several months ago that the Chicks would sweep the Grammys more for their political statements than for the quality of their latest effort. If I were an artist, I would want to be acknowledged for my music than for \\"sticking it to the man.\\" I found this CD lacking. Other than the one standout single, the album just moves along with one song running into the next. Don't get me wrong; I love the Chicks. I love Natalie Maines' voice and the tight harmonies. I just find their earlier work far superior. BTW, my husband, who will defend the Chicks all day long, can't even list five songs on the CD. They're that nondescript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype - Just Look at All the Used CD's For Sale at Amazon","review":"As I type this review, there are already 52 used \\"Taking the Long Way\\" compact discs that people are trying to unload here at Amazon. Despite claims of persecution, the Dixie Chicks and their album have been heavily promoted by the media. They've been on the covers of magazines, including TIME, and were the subject of a glowing report on \\"60 Minutes.\\" Most of the reviews and stories about them and the album are more like infomercials than honest journalism. People are buying the CD due to the hype and are now obviously stuck with some bad music.Obviously, all those people giving glowing reviews of the CD are being motivated more by political bias than by what is really on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Passion, Uninspired, Hollow","review":"I am a fan of the Dixie Chicks and have loved their previous work, but something about this album seems rushed. All the songs feature lyrics which never really go anywhere, it's almost as if they're being too safe. I really didn't like it. I want my money back Natalie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried and I tried....","review":"I was not thrilled when the Dixie Chicks used a public concert in a foreign country to voice their opinions- wasn't, in my opinion, the appropriate venue for it. However, I was more then willing to buy this CD because I'm a HUGE DC fan and ready to get back to being entertained. But, it wasn't worth it- they are, to me, no longer \\"one of us girls singing about every day life\\". It was a big sob \\"oh woe is me\\" album- not up to their standards. I don't feel that this CD will last the test of time, and I'm really bummed that it's turned into Natalie's band. What happened to the sisters with the amazing instrumental talent? Maybe next time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The days of the loyal \\"red\\" country stars are dead","review":"Yes, this is a great come back album. The music is country but with that nice corporate production back ground of polished musicians that give the music a clean and marketed feel.You can get both traditional country music and progressive sounds on this album. So, if you generally used to listen to grunge music then this album is for you. Imagine it's like coffee with lots of cream and sugar. When you get used to the polished and manufactured for the masses feel of this album you'll be able to listen to more mainstream country music, like Willie Nelson.This is country music for blue state people. President Bush gets his in this album. Rotten right wing people are denounced by this brave crew of country womyn singers.Support blue state country music and denounce \\"the shrub\\", buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD But Album or the Year?","review":"I have always like the Dixie Chicks and their political statements didn't change anything for me. When this CD got Album of the Year I decided I had to have it. Don't get me wrong, its GOOD...several tracts are even GREAT...but there is also some stuff I would consider \\"filler\\". To me, this album should have never beat James Blunt's Back to Bedlam which is GREAT from the first song to the last.But, if you like the Dixie Chicks (and I really do), you should definitely get this CD. It does include some of their best work and you will have real insight into how they felt after Natalie's statements about President Bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"The Chicks are back and real strong with this new CD. It is different from all the others, but still has the crispness of the strings which sets them off from other bands. Of course Natalie is at her finest with the vocals. Harmonies are excellent and if you are a fan I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I bought this recording as a political statement; to validate the right of the Dixie Chicks (and all of us)to express personal views, regardless of the popularity of said opinions.I was delighted to find that the songs are by turn catchy, evocative, rebellious, and consistently melodious, sing-able, offerings. Add to that the fact that the lyrics are clearly, cleanly pronounced, and I find myself playing this cd far more often than I would have guessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"superbly provocative and highly entertaining!","review":"Of all the disgustingly horrible events caused by the Bush Administration, the black listing, by Clear Channel, of the Dixie Chicks is one I will never forgive. The reception the Dixie Chicks received in the Country Western community has spoiled country music for me. I will never understand how people who profess a love of all that is good about God can embrace such a mean spirited, hateful Administration. In their new album these superlative performers tell it like it is in their own, inimitable way. I would buy all their CDs to support these brave, super heroes, but that it would deprive you of the listening pleasure that is sure to be yours when you buy this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"It's not just that I agree with the Dixie Chicks politics, this CD is just outright great.If you're into their musical style, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing Album!!","review":"These women really are true Americans! They have really come through some muddy water and held their ground on what they believe in! For all you so-called fans (Americans)and radio stations that turned against these ladies you should really listen to track three because this song is for YOU!! This album is a must have!! It would be a sin not to love it, and them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD Well Done","review":"The Dixie Chicks deliver some powerful songs on this CD including Everybody Knows and Bitter End. Whether or not you agree with their \\"politics\\" this CD would be a great addition to your music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I didn't think the Dixie Chicks could get any better. Taking The Long Way is the achievement of a lifetime.ps I'm ashamed Bush is from this country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS CD!","review":"Every song on this CD is GREAT! I think it is their best yet! I am proud of the Chicks for standing their ground. Good for them. This is America and we are supposed to have free speech. Good luck to the Chicks. I don't listen to ANY of the country music stations that stopped playing their music. As a matter of fact with the exception of a few artist I don't listen to country anymore at all. Toby Keith makes me want to gag! If you are a chicks fan or just a fan of GOOD MUSIC then I would buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not awesome","review":"I'm a big fan and supporter of the Chicks. This long awaited album is great, but not awesome. I say this based solely on the fact that i felt that there isn't a really strong ballad on the CD in the vein of \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\", \\"Don't Waste Your Heart\\", or \\"I'll Take Care of You\\". Other than that, this CD is great. My favorite is the anthem to good times \\"Bitter End\\" where friends are parting ways but take one last night to celebrate the memories. Welcome back DCX. See them on tour this summer at any cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"Who cares what Americans think about the Dixie Chicks views on war? They are still the best all-female group in the world. Texans need to pull their red necks out of their backsides and applaud a group that continues to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful lyrics and music","review":"I LOVE this album. The Lullaby is delicate and precious, like the child by whom it was inspired, I'm sure. I cry every time I hear it. Not Ready to Make Nice is awesome, very powerful. It really puts things into perspective. Death threats are a bit much for some people who simply shared an opinion; an opinion that is sadly becoming more and more relevant. The one about losing a parent to dementia is very poignant. Again, a wonderful treat of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccable in every way.","review":"Incredible musicianship. Powerful vocals. Well structured songs. An excellent rock/country hybrid. If you liked Sara Evans' song Born To Fly, you will like every track on this album. Thankfully, it is devoid of any mere filler songs.Ignore all the low ratings as they are nothing but sour grapes from the radical right. None of them have even listened to any of the songs anyway so why bother trusting their opinions?If you're looking for an honest review, you can trust that this is one.If you're just looking to slam the Dixie Chicks because you're too petty and childish to stand anyone in the world who doesn't already agree with your philosophy of hatred, you're probably not reading this anyway since it has more than one star.The Dixie Chicks just made a new fan and I stopped buying whole country albums since Merle Haggard was still putting out vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats our Chicks","review":"Loved it. Every CD I get from them I love.They are truely talented ladies with a lot to sing, and say.They got their point across in this one.I LOVE MY CHICKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sassy afirmation of life after the blacklist","review":"Hooray for not giving up, not folding in, not placating those in controlof the airwaves - the shlock talk jocks ... not making nice.A solid sound and delightful lyrics; particularly strong are \\"NotReady to Make Nice\\", \\"The Long Way Round\\" and \\"Lullay\\".You go girls...."},{"rating":"2","title":"lullabye","review":"soft, beautiful sound, touching lyrics, I am so happy the chicks are back. They are the full package. They are multi-talented. Please don't waste your beautiful voices and music. George Bush is just not worth it. Two years ago, this country was in a scary place. I think people are beginning to wake up, so please stay with us. Your talent is rare and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"I love to hear muscians come together to form such great sound and harmony. Forget the politics involved -if you want, just appreciate their talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sinlge hit on the album.","review":"Ok, take the war out of it, take the politics out of it, take whatever baggage you have out of the equasion. I'm comparing this album to their last three releases, and it simply doesnt measure up. The songs (written by the Chicks themselves, and it shows) are kinda dull. No hooks. No toe-tapping. Hey, I remember when these girls could sing fun songs (Long Time Gone, I Can Love You Better), and beautiful songs (Cowboy Take Me Away, Landslide, Wide Open Spaces or controversial songs (Goodbye, Earl) - but you wont find any of those here. Just some sad, self-indugent lyrics.Buy a Dixie Chicks album if you're new to them, but don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm a big fan. This one is not thier best work. I loved their first three albums, this latest I have to say does not follow. seems like they're deviating a bit from what they do best. Listening to it actually brought me down. unlike their previous works"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sure Winner!","review":"I would recommend buying this CD. I was never into the Dixie Chicks but heard a single track and decided to take a chance. I don't regret it. The combination of words & music with the haunting violin solo's make it a winning combination. Not your usual country sound; but country matured!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmless, Overhyped Fluff","review":"Considering all the media hype and fanatically positive reviews, the songs on this album turned out to be pretty unexceptional, even boring. It's the kind of music that will soon be forgotten - but then I don't think the Dixie Chicks are about music anymore. Politically correct types will buy anything they put out and, judging by all the crazed five-star reviews, may even convince themselves that the music is something better than what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it again with Taking The long way.","review":"I just bought Taking The long way and I must say it is Great. The more I listen to it the more I love it. It's a wonderful blend of country music with a touch of rock. I have always loved and ejoyed the Dixie Chicks and this CD just leaves me to say, They did it again. Another great CD from the Dixie Chicks. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection... Again","review":"I just love this album. The Dixie Chicks are the only band in history that I own all their stuff. Also, they are the only CDs I can put in and listen to without skipping any songs. This CD is no different. Every song is great and I am so proud to be from the same state as these heros!!!Any reviews less than 4 stars are obviously not about the music and based on other factors because these ladies are awsome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, very personal music","review":"I'm not a big fan of country music, so I was skeptical when my friend gave me this CD for my birthday. That being said, it has not come out of my cd player since. Several of the songs on the album are very personal, and resonate very strongly for me on a deeply emotional level. \\"I'm not ready to make nice\\" makes me cry almost every time I listen to it. It describes my feelings about a current life situation very clearly, and conveys how angry I feel about what has happened both now and in the past. \\"Lubbock or Leave it\\" could have been my own life story with a few details changed. \\"Lullaby\\" is a beautifully lyrical love song that touches my heart. \\"Favorite Year\\" is a nostalgia driven song that makes me want to be in the arms of the one I love. \\"Silent House\\" is so sad, it breaks my heart to listen to it. I highly recommend this disc to anyone who likes music that means something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicks rule","review":"I am not a country fan but, have gained respect for the Chicks over the past couple years and have contemplated buying their albums. Having said this, I heard this album while visiting family and really liked what I heard. I can now say I like some country music and that the Chicks really do rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in delivery, Amazon made right","review":"This was my first purchase through Amazon and I waited over 2 weeks for delivery. Finally, when I complained, Amazon was able to determine that it had been lost in shipment. They sent a new CD via 2-day delivery (at no additional charge) and gave me a $5 gift certificate off my next purchase. Excellent customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, The Chicks Are Back!!!","review":"I have been waiting what seems forever for the Dixie Chicks to bring out another album!! The Dixie Chicks are by far my #1 band, as they are the only band which I own all their cd's AND enjoy every song which is presented on their albums. There debut song from this cd, \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\" is the perfect prelude to open their album with. I was a little sad and frustrated that none of my local radio stations had enough nerve to play it. *eye roll* Oh well (I guess that's why I make my own \\"radio\\" with my pod) However, I do know that when an album rocks like this album does, the radio and general public won't be able to ignore it. Open your eyes people and check out the amazing lyrics, vocals, and instrumental talent. You will not be dissapointed when you discover how much amazing effort and true talent that the Dixie Chicks put into creating this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick it to the man!","review":"I'm not a country fan (I bought the new Red Hot Chili Peppers album the day before this one) but seriously, this is good, solid music. More consistent than the previous albums. It seems like the chicks (can I say that?) have done two things here, stuck to their guns and backed up their guns with talent. For my own tastes, it probably didn't hurt that they collaborated with some of my favorite Minnesota folks (from the Jayhawks and Semisonic).There is no better way to stick it to the man (big radio) then to not back down and then succeed on your talent in spite of the forces lined up against you!Good, solid outing that will remain in play for me...right next to the Jay Farrar, Son Volt, Wilco, Jayhawks side of my CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of music!","review":"I fell in love with the Dixie Chicks shortly before they released Home in 2002 and I've been in love with them ever since. Their musical talent is outstanding and their songs always make me feel better about myself. This album made my day. It is a wonderful piece of music.I appreciate that they used their Freedom of Speech (nowhere in the Constitution does it say that freedom ends at our borders - isn't that one reason the government says we are fighting in Iraq? To give Iraqis that same freedom?). In fact, I appreciate that they haven't let the crazy, hateful, hypocrites that boycotted their music, demonstrated in front of their concerts, and sent them death threats keep them from expressing their point of view. They embody what is best about being an American - that as Americans we can express our opinions no matter how unpopular they may be. In fact, its imperative to our Democracy that all of us do that.Sing on Chicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing less than gutsy!","review":"I love the Dixie Chicks! They are gals with guts, class and talent!\\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\" says it all in this time of darkness. I'm glad they came out with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lubbock or Leave It - For the real fans only!","review":"Rednecks and country hicks are better off listening to Toby Keith or Gretchen Wilson, because this album will only appeal to the open-minded and progressive. the Dixie Chicks have constructed an album which defies any genre, and goes straight for the heart strings. Many songs, particularly 'silent house', will leave you holding back tears. That is how amazing this album is! beautiful, honest and above all, timeless. This is a must own!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Their Goals Has Been Achieved","review":"The sisters' mom is a classical violinist. A goal attributed to them was to elevate 'country music' to the level of respect that classical music holds. With this release I think they have met that goal. What an amazing collection of performances, with such depth of feeling, and personal expression. The quality of musicianship is a high as anything I have found in the classical music (where I spend most of my time, BTW).I'm not a country music fan by nature, but I am a huge fan of this music and these performers. If you were to ask me what music has most strongly moved me to tears over the past couple months it would be live performances of the Houston Symphony of the Bruckner 8th Symphony, the Brahms German Requiem, and some of the songs on this release.Bravo.--Georgep.s. I recommend the documentary \\"Shut Up and Sing\\", too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Way Home CD Purchase","review":"The product was easy to find. I like the ability to listen to tracks before purchasing. The CD came right on time and in perfect condition. I will not hesitate to buy CDs from this seller through Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Politics.......","review":"These women have something to say and do it with voices, instruments and talent, that so MANY artists are LACKING. ENJOY them for who they are and how they SOUND."},{"rating":"2","title":"2006 Album of the Year","review":"First, let me say I am not a country music fan. As a matter of fact, I loathe most country, however, the songs on this CD are some of the best of the year. The Long Way Around is a California-rock inspired rollicking good ride. Lullaby is beautiful and very touching. Not Ready to Make Nice is destined to become a classic. If you are looking for a pure slice of Americana that will convey feelings of emotion sung by clear, beautiful female voices, then, Taking the Long Way is for you.It is at the top of my list with Elvis Costello's The River in Reverse as a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy tunes with great lyrics","review":"This is different from the Dixie Chicks albums you're used to. It's much more mellow with meaningful lyrics. THe Chicks use this as a forum for the backlash they faced following their anti-Bush comments. It is tasteful and not hateful in the least. My favorite tune is \\"Easy Silence\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the chicks are back","review":"The chicks return with an upbeat album, interesting lyrics, and their usual beautiful voices and harmonies. This album has darker and angrier theme, and I enjoy some of their older stuff more, but the new stuff doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the shorter way","review":"Yeah, I know that buying the CD off of Amazon puts less money into the pockets of the artists. But I wanted to show support for the chicks, and didn't want to leave the house. You can see my conundrum. Thing is, I love their music, and I liked this CD. And, in a way I cannot fully articulate, I found it necessary to purchase this CD in physical form instead of buying it off of iTUNES. I felt that I was more fully supporting this brave group by getting a physical CD in the mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 10 bucks and more....","review":"Forget about the politics. If you're into good music, this is definitely one album you should buy. I'm not into most country music, but this one is more rock than country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"This album is well worth every penny I spent on it. The Chicks are better than ever! Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no problem with their politics but the music doesn't make it","review":"I have to admit that I was not a Dixie Chicks fan before and don't like country music. I bought this CD because it was compared to Tom Petty and other rockers and got tons of good reviews. But, while their new music isn't country, it isn't rock either.I don't know what to call it other than using some of the words I've seen other reviewers use, like \\"commercial\\" and \\"overproduced.\\" It is pop of the kind that appeals to females.I can't help but think of Britanny Spears when I hear this stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAMMY WINNERS - GREAT LIVE PERFORMANCES TOO","review":"I didn't like Country at all until the Dixie Chicks came along. I never went to concerts. I have been to three Chicks concerts and they are amazing talented women. I was so upset by the controversy because I don't want some people's opinions and politics to stop their music. I have never seen such a concerted effort to try to hurt someone. I was appalled that their friends in the entertainment business did not stand up for them. Their music is great and I wish people would just lighten up and get over it. Please stay together and keep producing the songs...they are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not a Chicks fan","review":"I'm not a fan of the Dixie Chicks, never was. I really don't like the watered down, Cookie Cutter, Pop Country stuff. However, I'm a big Rick Rubin fan so I decided to check this album out. I love the work Rubin did with Johnny Cash..... and the Chili Peppers new album is great......and The Cult, Electric album is one of the greatest albums of all time.....and The Beastie Boys.....yeah!!! Rick Rubin can do no wrong.......well almost no wrong, I guess.If you are a DC fan you'll probably like this album, but to me it sounds like Sherly Crow.... if Crow couldn't write songs and had no talent.If you want rootsy, genuine, heart felt Country get Barricades & Brickwalls by Kasey Chambers. BTW The Chicks have always said Kasey Chambers is a big influence on them. The difference is Chambers has it in her soul and the Chicks have to try to be good....and it just ain't working."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE REASON IT'S #1 ...","review":"Look down at the customer forums and most of the full starred reviews and check out the new Dixie Chicks supporters.People who've never bought a Country CD in all of their lives bought this one just to make it a hit and thereby make a statement. They look down on all of us Country fans. Heck! they look down on this country itself, Period!Real Country Music fans know what's up and we're not buying into it for a minute.So enjoy your fair weather friends Natalie.

Well, that's Ms. Maines' or Mrs. Pashdar's prerogative, but it is also ours to tell the little girl and her Dipsy Clucks bye-bye too.C'mon Nashville. Enough of the Maines, the Clucks, the Urbans, the Chesneys, the Crows and the Flats. Give us more Paisleys, more Evans - and musicians steeped in the tradition of Owens and Cash. Not some little girls sans brains and sans talent.Just read that Dipsy Cluck ticket sales for the summer shows have nose-dived into the dungheap they created. Gee, I wonder why? Maybe Natalie or some of her Neo-Fat friends can tell us all why. Then again, maybe not."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor excuse for music","review":"can't bring myself to listen to more than 20 seconds. truly sad they are so popular.

However, this new CD sucks! Sorry girls. It's very depressing, it's not the \\"fun\\" chicks as all the other CD's it's all very moody, slow and depressing and dark. I'm not happy at all and I over paid by alot of money and I can't take it back, I'm probably posting it on here soon to sell.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's Tail Wagging The Dog...","review":"I've always loved the Dixie Chicks' music, and Natalie's voice is amazing, and despite my disagreement with their political leanings, I am not disputing their talent. However, I can not in good conscience call this album one of their best, nor is it Grammy material. How can you possibly compare this album to Fly, Home, or Wide Open Spaces when only a couple songs on the CD display their real talent? This clearly is not of that same caliber. While some may say the Grammy for \\"Best Album of the Year\\" is a vindication, I say it's nothing more than a sham further proving the agenda of Hollywood to control public opinion. There are so many talented artists out there right now that I don't know how anyone can possibly say they earned this award with the current album when it is such a disappointment. It's unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Dixie Chicks CD I have purchased","review":"After hearing the Dixie Chicks sing at the Grammies, I considered purchasing their CD. I am glad I did.

Great, catchy music. I like how their style evolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the best CDs in a long time...","review":"Loved every song on this disc...the Chicks make good music, end of story. I can't recommend this enough...it's that good. They've been through so much...and it pours forth in each verse and lyric. Self-reflective, insightful, sometimes funny, sometimes angry and often poignant honest wondering and hopeful. They bare their souls in a stirring mix of almost acoustic simplicity. American underdogs sing courageous in your face.Drop your politics and give your soul something tasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The CD was completely disappointing.

They do have pretty voices. I just don't hear anything special on this cd. Sadly, Chicks fans are giving it 5 stars out of loyalty. They cheapen Sgt.Pepper and other classics when they vote this way. Please review this cd and if you give it 5 stars explain in your comments that you are merely a blind fan. Politics..the Chicks can say anything they want.

Someone answer me this simple question: I don't like Bush either and thought it was amusing when the Dixie whatevers put him down, but when a group calls their own fans stupid and they still buy the music? I guess they proved their point with all the raving reviews here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One Bites The Dust","review":"So, let's see... The Dixie Chicks have totally abandoned the musical style that made them famous (has anybody heard from Martie and Emily's instruments lately?)in favor of a bland, guitar-based pop. They've gone from writing and/or performing happy, up-tempo music with a wicked sense of humor in favor of coming off like a collection of whiny, preachy kvetches. And then to make up for all that, they've decided to go out of their way to annoy the majority of their original fan base. While I may own several Dixie Chicks albums, this one will not be staying in my collection long enough to join them."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Very whiny. The lyrics and their voices make me cringe. I regret buying any of their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slap in the Face","review":"The grammy award given to the Dixie Chicks for this album is a clear slap in the face meant to belittle our President of the United States and Commander and Chief when we are at a time of war. Whether you believe in the cause or not, we have men and women making sacrifices for this country and betraying them with this sanctimonious award to the Dixie Chicks is typical of the \\"Hate Our Country Left\\". I've been listening to country radio for a long time with alot different stations and I've never even heard one of these songs being played in my area of Texas. These are talented ladies who should be recognized for their art and not for their hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic!","review":"save your money! ... the bargain bins will be full of this album very soon! You'll be able to buy this garbage very cheaply very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge as Art","review":"The Dixie Chicks have told off their critics in this album. Their song \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\" builds on all their country roots and takes it to new highs. Amazing arrangement going from a soft growl to a roar and back. The album is worth getting for this cut alone but the rest of the tracks are equal in weight. The arrangements are dense and interesting, the emotion shines through on every track, and anyone who knows the story of how Clear Channel set out to destroy their livlihoods will cheer them on.It is not all about their trials and tribulations, they end with an anthem of hope and they fill in the nooks and crannies with heartfelt ballads.I cannot recommend this album highly enough. I gave away my first copy and ordered it again. Listen to any track on it and you will be sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"They DESERVED the Grammy!","review":"When I first heard that The Dixie Chicks' latest album, Taking the Long Way, had one the Grammy for Best Album of the Year, I just assumed that \\"the powers that be' were helping the Chicks lick the wounds inflicted by the rednecks at ClearChannel in reprisal for the Chicks' saying that Bush made them embarassed to be from Texas. I was wrong. This is clearly the best album of 2006 and perhaps the best album in years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True (S)Hero's!","review":"\\"Not Ready To make Nice\\" IS THE SONG of the year if not 00's for me. I was a mild Dixie Chicks fan prior to 2003, but after the brave statement Ms. Maines made in the Uk, I took a whole new look at this group. I have not had this cd out of my Cd player since I got it Tuesday, it is smart, sassy and some of the best music I have heard in a LONG time. The Dixie Chicks are Shero's to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite cd! ......Love the Chicks!","review":"I had never even listened to The Dixie Chicks, UNTIL this album. I have to admit, I was curious after the whole \\"Bush\\" statement, & once I heard \\"Not ready to make nice\\" (which made me cry it is SO powerful...and not just the whole political aspect, but the lyrics had a special meaning for me, and some of the stuff I have dealt with. Let go of the past controvercy, listen to it with an open head and heart, and you can't help but be moved by most of the songs on this album. The more you listen to it the more you will LOVE IT!

I don't like Bush and so I was swept up in the pro-Dixie Chicks hysteria that seems to gripping many people. (Just look at all the zealous five-star reviews.)The music, unfortunately is pretty blah. The vocals sound like whining and the music is unremarkable except in that it is overdone. I noticed another reviewer used the word \\"commercial\\" to describe it, and I would agree with that.This is really about marketing and capitalizing on the anti-Bush sentiment out there, which I share. The CD is obviously a big seller right now but I don't think that it will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicks at their best","review":"I have all the Chicks CD's and this one is the best yet. I listened to the whole CD before buying it and fell in love with it the first time I listened to it and bought it the next day! There are so many favorites on this CD but if I had to pick out the best they would be the tracks \\"Easy Silence\\", Lubbock or Leave It (which definetely ROCKS), \\"Silent House\\" and \\"Voice Inside My Head\\". This 49 yr. old LOVES this music.......GO CHICKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Flick","review":"Excellent album on its own but you need to see their movie \\"Shut Up and Sing\\" to fully appreciate this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The Dixie Chicks have come back! Yippie! Sure it reviews their last couple of years but listeners can relate on a personal level too. As always- the Chix are strong in vocal and instruments. Have you looked at all the people that went in on this album? WOW! Lots of big names! Buy the album! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Butchered the Dixie Chicks??","review":"Politics aside, I eagerly anticipated the release of this CD. After listening to it, all I can say is \\"where did they go\\"? Their previously joyful- to-listen-to music has been replaced by the rantings of a bitter woman (Maines). P U."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditzy Chicks","review":"The bubble-headed bimbos in this band have been acting like the worst of politicians: They apologized for dissing W when he was popular, and now, looking at his poll numbers fall, they are flip-flopping and trying to retract that apology.With this CD, the Ditzy Chicks are shifting their sound from country to pop. As you can see from the CD cover photo, they are trying to drop the rural, country girl image in favor of a new urbane one. (And even their most ardent of fans will have to admit, looking at the CD cover photo, that all three have got the most vacuous \\"the lights are on upstairs but nobody's home\\" look in their eyes.)The real problem is with the music: The songs on this CD range from mediocre to awful. And some of the lyrics are so bad as to be unintentionally funny.Someone should explain to these poor things that protest songs are supposed to be about injustices to the people - not injustices to the band members!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is mainstream garbage","review":"This album is the worst mainstream piece of garbage I have ever heard. The only reason they won so many grammy awards is because the academy of music is a bunch of left wing liberals and they want to stick it to the president.Real good, basically your telling people its ok to bash your country while playing in another country and then we will reward you with a bunch of grammy awards for it.Complete drivel, these losers will never get a cent of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars for this mess!","review":"Bush bashers or not....this album's content is all about the Bush comment and backlash The Chicks received a few years ago. If they really wanted to move on they would have stayed away from the topic in their music (at least for 98% of the album) but it is too redundant in this album. Not their best work and I used to be a huge fan but they are losing me by the year! Not worth the cash to buy this one. Hopefully they will produce a more rounded album next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertain us, keep your political thoughts to yourself","review":"I have been a long time fan, but..... I was very dismayed to hear what Natalie said in concert, overseas. We pay entertainers to entertain us, not cram their political views down our throats as the only realistic, viable opinions. The freedoms we have in this country come from a long line of soldiers that put on the uniform and stood up for what America stands for. I saw them last week on the Oprah Winfrey show and as the song says, their not ready to make nice, granted the lyrics could be applied to many situations, but in this case we know what they refer too. They owe this country a big opology, and until I hear it, I won't buy their cd's anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Horrible, and a piece of Trash","review":"If you liked the purity of all the instruments on Home you will hate this Album.The Chicks have gone steadily downhill since Home.On their World Tour album they included that stupid steel guitar which completely drowned out the banjo and violin.This in your face, I can say anything I want, and you can kiss my rear end attitude shows how little class they now have.There isn't one good song on this album, plus I only heard the banjo once and very little violin.Save your money, and don't waste it on these fools.They need to get back to what made them popular in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad album","review":"The Chicks should sing and get out of politics. This whole album is geared to making a statement. Shut up and sing girls!! We don't care about your opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shocked former \\"fan\\"","review":"After buying this CD ~ the CD isn't all that great by the way, most of the people on here who are giving it more than 3 stars are on here for political reasons, obviously ~ there was a statement made by the chicks which said they don't want any fan who has Toby Keith or Reba McIntyre in their disc changer. I was appalled and immediately took action...I threw \\"Taking The Long Way\\" out the window. There! Now everybody's happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matured?","review":"The review said they matured but it seems to me they've matured from the Dixie Chicks with a wonderful bluegrass sound to Natalie Maines & the Dixie Chicks. The sisters are fading into the background. I bought their previous albums for the bluegrass and because I thought the sisters did such a wonderful job with their respective instruments. It's so sad that one blurt of no real significance has changed all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Girls. Not Even Close","review":"There is so little energy and verve in this CD compared to Wide Open Spaces and Home as to make me think it is a parody of the Chicks or an elevator music knock-off. About the only spark is contained in the stupidly defiant Not Ready To Make Nice. Please Chicks, clear your mind and find some songs that don't make me want to stab myself in the eye with a pencil. I hope they get back on track with their next album because this one has derailed (temporarily, I hope) what looked to be a great career just a few years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop City","review":"I loved the Chicks first three studio albums, Home was great, and the Top of the World Tour CD is the best concert recording I own (we're talking over fifty years of \\"record\\" collecting here, and including Newport Jazz Festivals). Beyond that, I'm in synch with the Chicks politics. But my musical tastes and politics have nothing to do with each other. My muscial tastes are eclectic, or at least that's what I like to tell myself. But I can't handle this just-plain-boring CD. All the songs sound pretty much the same. There's little heart and no real fun. It's hard to hear the music for the noise. I guess this is what must pass for pop music these days -- it's certainly neither bluegrass nor Nashville country (hat acts and all). I attended the Chicks' opening night in Greenville, S.C. three years ago, which was a wonderful experience. However, for the upcoming concert I'll wait for the reports. If it's anything like this CD, I'll be staying home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The Dixie Chicks are in a special league of their own and this album shows how incredibly resilient and creative they can be. I love it! As someone said earlier, it's an album that grows on you. The more you play it the more you want to play it. You go girls! I was also tickled that they won the Grammy after I bought the album. Yes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why apologize if you're not sorry? That would be lying.","review":"This is a review of the album, regardless of what the chicks have said in the past. The album is solid. It's a great buy, and there's a reason it's selling so well. Bravo to the chicks. A fantastic record. Very driven, and musically strong. Natalie's voice has really grown."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"these girls are just the best. im so impressed with how they are not afraid to back down from their critics. this is a daring and inspired album, my favorite of theirs and easily one of the best of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album yet!","review":"This is their best album yet. \\"Not Ready To Make Nice\\" is superb (the music video is awesome too!). Bought the album because of this song but was pleasantly surprised that I ended up enjoying the rest of the songs in the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The low price is a giveaway","review":"I should have known - this album is just for the diehard fans. How good the Chicks were on Wide Open Spaces, this falls far, far short of my expectations. Ballad after ballad, the album fails to deliver. Strong harmonies, sure. Good vocal sound, OK, it's there. But albums are ultimately about a story; if they are not, I'm not interested. I'd rather go to a place like iTunes and purchase the songs I really like and skip the rest. 'Taking the long way' lacks the story I am looking for, the composition as a complete album, a sense of integration if you will, synthesis. And that's what I should have known before rushing to buy the CD on Amazon right when it came out: the price says everything. If it's really a rock-solid album, it won't be on sale for just under 10 bucks. They'll want more because they know it's worth more. This is just to fill the Chicks' coffers and they should be ashamed for doing that to their fans. Two stars at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average pop cd by a no talent group","review":"I am a huge country music fan. I have never been a fan of the Dixie Chicks because their music has never been country in my eyes. The Dixie Chicks do not have pleasant sounding voices. Their old songs never appealed to me and their new anti America, Anti conservative, anti southern, anti country music and their fans mentality do not appeal to me. If you are a hateful, bigoted, close minded person, this cd is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This is my first Dixie Chicks album and I am not disappointed. I am not a country music fan, but this album is very good--a bluegrass, pop infusion. Love the smart lyrics and progressive attitude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! IS THIS CD OVER-RATED","review":"I read all the great reviews about this CD and so I bought it. Now that I've listended to it, I can say that it is grossly over-rated and over-hyped. As other reviewers have noted, it is overproduced and the sound is poorly mixed. The music on most of the songs is a real mish-mash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album showing their diversity","review":"I heard \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\" a few weeks ago and haven't stopped listening to it at least a few times a day. I love that they aren't willing to return to the music scene with their tails between their legs but are instead continuing to stand up for what they believe in.After hearing the entire album the night before the cd was released (a genius marketing tool!) I was blown away at how different this album sounds compared to their previous albums and love the fact that no matter how they experiment musically, they continue to put out great music that remains distinctly Dixie Chicks. The Dixie Chicks not only continue to make great music, but are true role models that remind me why I love this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced - Reminds Me of Stevie Nicks \\"Street Angel\\"","review":"Most reviewers seem to disagree with me, but I found this one overproduced. The Dixie Chicks seem to have sought to change their sound, and, while they accomplished that, they went too far. I can hear some good tunes through the messy music. This one could have been much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their absolute best - don't be without it!","review":"The Dixie girls' vocals are better than ever. Lyrics, of course, are primo and to the point. Gotta love women who stand behind what they think instead of wimping out for the cowardly radio stations who prefer to cave in to a small amount of screamers rather than the majority of their fair minded listeners.

This one doesn't compare to their great albums in the past. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking The Long Way","review":"I am not into politics, but am a big Dixie Chicks fan.But.........They should never have released this album. The songs lack any excitement, which I have come to expect from this great trio.It sounds like they have gone into the studio and run through every song with the session musicians just a few times, before going for a take.There is a sad lack of 'arrangement' throughout the album.The whole album becomes a bore after the first few songs.There is no variety of tempos to keep one interested.It just goes from one dull track to the next dull track.Although I love the girls voice, this is just too much to listen to, all the way through.Please don't put out your next album until it's ready to be proud of, like your previous ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the spunk?","review":"I'm a big dixie chicks fan despite Natalie's attempt to mix politics with entertainment. I even enjoyed the pre Natalie Dixie Chicks. But I wont stay a fan long if the albums are as dry as this one. The part I like most about the chicks seemed to have fallen by the wayside. There weren't any toe tapping, sing-a-long songs. I didn't like the remake of \\"mississippi\\" I thought the original played during the Rock The Vote concert was better. I understand the Dixie chicks had some important things to say here but I feel there could be a more positive way to do it. Sorry girls, still waiting for a good come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but no major hit","review":"I think this cd is a good Dixie Chick's cd. I have always loved their music, and it remains true to their style. However there is not one great hit, like \\"Cowboy take me away\\" or \\"Wide Open Spaces\\", on this cd. They seem a little bitter in some of their songs, but overall it is good Dixie Chick music. I think we all need to move on, and just enjoy the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing - not a good effort","review":"I like the DCX. I think they are the best thing to happen to country music in a long time; a breath of fresh air. I think their best effort was FLY with WIDE OPEN SPACES a close second. They sounded like they had fun recording both of these CDs, and the bands were outstanding.But TAKING THE LONG WAY is slow and boring. The songs just run together and all the fun is gone. The band is just average, like the music.I see many of the other reviews rate this 5 stars. I guess I just don't get it or understand their enthusiasm. It's just not the same sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife likes this one better than me - But I'm the one writing the review","review":"My wife bought this one. She thinks it is decent and says she would give it three and a half stars but I'm the one writing the review, so you're going to get my opinion.The music on this CD reminds me of Billie Myers, only, on many tracks, louder and with less harmony. It is the kind of CD that's going to appeal more to women than men.I read quite a few reviews here at Amazon that claim this is \\"the best CD\\" they \\"ever heard\\" or \\"the greatest CD of all time.\\" It makes you wonder what they've been listening to. Better than Led Zep IV? The Stones' Exile on Main Street? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"I looked forward to the new Dixie Chicks album, but was quite disappointed. The one star rating is for the two passable songs on this CD, \\"The Long Way Around\\" and \\"Not Ready to Make Nice\\". The rest are really quite boring. By the fifth or sixth song they were all blending together.I don't have a problem with their politics. I recently bought Neil Young's \\"Living with War\\". I don't have a problem with the branching out into country rock. I do think they should have found some good songs to cover instead of doing all their own stuff.Maybe they felt they should make this statement, but for the great musicians and singers they usually are, this is a pretty poor attempt.Not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dixie Chicks fans apparently don't read newspapers...","review":"It has been more than three weeks since Natalie Maines denounced patriotism - but their fans still keep writing reviews here at Amazon claiming they are \\"patriotic\\" (see below). How can you be both patriotic and against patriotism at the same time?The music on this CD quite unexiting. It would almost be boring except for Ms. Maines whiny vocals, which are irritating enough to keep the listener agitated. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I get it already","review":"As a fan of the Chicks' music, I'm disapointed to say that this is pure political agenda driven CRAP, though I think we pretty much all expected that. This album is basically an in-your-face retaliation of their past fallout with the political crowd. I'm all for free speech, but if your a firm believer in not mixing music and politics then this isn't for you.Hey Chicks, the true fans could care less about your political beliefs, right or left. Just stop with the politics and play MUSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are all mindless swine","review":"Since the fanatics are bound and determined to have all the one-star reviews removed, I'll try a new strategy: I'll give the Dixie Chicks five stars and still call them out for being ungrateful, unpatriotic hacks who hold most of what America stands for in complete contempt!Because, really, all the fanatics are concerned with is the appearance of greatness, despite the lack of it on this CD or anything the Dixie Chicks say or do.I'm really surprised by the number of reviews from people who bought this CD and give it a high rating only because of the Dixie Chicks' political views. How many are wimpy NPR-listenin' city folk liberals driving around in their SUVs and feeling all warm and smug because they have a Dixie Chick CD in their glove box. Not that they actually listen to any of that...but they support them. You are truly lemmings running for the cliff.(Let's see how long this review lasts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earls' having the last laugh!","review":"A conspiratorial retrospective of a young lady sticking her foot in her mouth and then watching an entire industry trying to help her unjam that big foot from her tiny little mouth.I listened in secret, sorry folks, the ship sailed off before this one could get on board.

But i'll be damned if this cd isn't pretty good. I originally bought it because I agree with their politics, and found the first single to be stuck in my head. I soon found the rest of the cd to be done very well. On a completely unrelated note, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT SUCKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying it anyway !!","review":"I grew up on R&B, Soul and Jazz, listen to all kinds of music.

The Dixie Chicks have taken an evolutionary leap in their career with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss!","review":"Nearly four years after their last studio album \\"Home\\" and a little more than three years after \\"the incident\\" The Dixie Chicks return. Not content to continue on the path they had been on for several years the sound here is different from what we've come accustom to from the trio. The arrangements find the banjos and fiddles still very much in the mix, but less prominent than before and producer Rick Rubin, while avoiding an overly slick sounds (the is NOT a Shania Twain album and for that we can all be grateful) does give them more of a rock polish.Chick fans who might be wary of such a shift can rest easy -- the trio's trademark harmonies are still in abundance here and shine through on virtually every track. The first few listens might disappoint someone expecting another \\"Home,\\" or \\"Wide Open Spaces,\\" but the patient listen will be amply rewarded. This is first rate stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks Overcome The Drama and Deliver Incredible Music","review":"I was never really a big Dixie Chicks fan but this album is even better than all the hype would imply. I'm a New Yorker and not into country music at all but the writing on this album is so honest and beautiful that it transcends its genre. Their sound is very modern, incredibly catchy, and yet comfortable and inviting at the same time. Songs like \\"Easy Silence\\" make a reference to the pain they've gone through and the crazy times we live in as they discuss who will be the next person who is crucified. It's not all melancholy, though. \\"Not Ready To Make Nice\\" is an anthem of defiance and one of several bold, aggressive songs on the album. See also \\"Lubbock or Leave It.\\" These chicks are great songwriters and have created what should the be the Grammy-winning Best album of the year so far. They deserve the overwhelming success they are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching!","review":"This was the first Twila Paris album I bought! It is great!

It is very sturdy for a wire rack but look at the measurements before you buy. It might not be deep enough for you, and the middle shelf is only five inch high, so don't expect to stack a lot of plates on the middle shelf. For my purpose, it was perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, not as viewed!","review":"I purchased this organizer so I can stack my coffee cups and saucers to eliminate putting one cup inside the other. Unfortunately I have 3 different cup sizes and none of them was fitting below like the picture. I need to mention that none of my cups are really large since I do not like them.... I am talking for \\"illy\\" type cappuccino cups.The only thing I can fit below and in the second self was either espresso cups or a stack of three saucers. It ends up taking up more space than creating. This is the worst type of organizer that I have purchased and unfortunately it is not worth returning it since the seller does not cover the cost and it is a bulky item."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Shelf Cabinet Organizer","review":"I purchased the 2 shelf wire cabinet organizer to improve storage in my kitchen pantry. It's great! The product is sturdy and sits stably on the wire pantry shelving. The 3 tiers enable me to store paper plates, bowls and napkins with easy accessibility and less wasted space. My only recommendation is that the depth be increased. I intend to order another unit today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Organizer","review":"These shelves are functional and durable. I bought 2 for my kitchen cabinets and they are great for holding plates of all different sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compact shelf organizer.","review":"I bought this without realizing the size. Once I put it on the shelf I wasn't sure what I would be using it for, as the shelves in this organizer are shallower than hoped for. However, I have come to realize that my 9X13 glass cake pans sit on it perfectly with a little bit of room, if needed. It will eliminate chips in the sides from being stacked and suffled around. I can even put a smaller pan inside and still place it on a shelf. I am glad I ordered this. For my plates, bowls and cups, however, I will still stay with the china dish racks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tippy","review":"I was disappointed with this for dishes as shown. There is little support on the sides and wasn't perfectly flat. We are still using it but not for heavy plates and dishes - instead for lighter items in a different cabinet. I wouldn't purchase of dishes, especially if there are children who will be grabbing the dishes off this rack. I did find another one that was much more sturdy that I am very happy with: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LZCCM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"Loved that I can organize my cabinets with this shelf! Now I can easily get the dinnerware that I want!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cabinet Dish Organizer Rack","review":"Returned this item due to it not holding my Fiestaware dishes. I thought from the photo & description I would have no problems having plates,cups,bowls all fit onto rack for better organization of my cupboard. The dishes were too big to hold all onto this rack. I decided to purchase a smaller corner rack to stack my plates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !","review":"What can i say?

Why? Because I already own that book & could have saved myself [the money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"This is a band you hear good hype about. And then you listen, and you are vastly disappointed. This band is riding the Converge/Eighteen Visions/\\"noisy-hardcore\\" trend. There is nothing special, because the vocalist sounds a good part like Jacob Bannon from Converge, and alot of the riffs sound like old Eighteen Visions. Skip this and wait for the new Madball or get the new Seventh Star cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultimate bastardization and genericism of -core music","review":"This band,with its meaningless phrase-name and stupid album title, is pretty f'n bad.

If you listen to this you need to stop kidding yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut!!","review":"This cd is spectacular!! And by the way, they sound nothing like Converge, which is a good thing!! And what does it matter if they were once rapcore.

Get this cd.....it's really great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Converge?","review":"Alright I am in agreeance that this CD is totally unoriginal and pretty much pointless but where do you get off comparing them to Converge? Converge is a completely different sound (technical, noisecore, etc.) I think you'd be better off just saying the usual troglodite comments we've come to except from this site such as \\"this CD is gay\\", \\"this CD sucks\\", etc. Please just leave the \\"Converge rip-off\\" comments out of here for they are deceiving. On Broken Wings sounds nothing at all like Converge. Period. They have more of a breakdown, breakdown, breakdown, bad melodic singing, breakdown, followed by a final breakdown sound to them. Bottom line: if you want to hear good music stear clear from this mess and stick to the likes of LFO, Harvey Danger, Wheatus, Dynamite Hack, etc. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring","review":"This is one of the most dull cds ive ever heard.

Cal explains how the busy springseason brings together players with a job to do and rostersto write. The author explains that a visit to teams in springtraining provides the best opportunity to view players inclose proximity. This work is perfect for baseball enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for children","review":"I bought this book for my son and was quite surprised to discover that some of the pictures were inappropriate for an eleven-year old. I'm hardly a prude but I can't understand why a book on this topic would include sexist, suggestive photographs of female fans. I try to teach my son not to view women as sex objects but a handful of pictures in this book have little to do with baseball or spring training and do just that. Shame on the authors, who should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down on quality...","review":"While the digital photo album is a great idea this one lacks the resolution to display quality photos. If quality is a must for you then I wouldn't even consider this product. The resolution is only 320x240 dpi, regardless of the 640x480 dpi printed on the box, even for the Photo Album Plus (Kensington will tell you it is a misprint). There are wavy lines rolling across the pictures and one side of the screen is lighter than the other. Maybe this is why they are not selling these anymore...

For financial reasons, I was unable to hire a doula but had heard they could be a big help and this book came highly recommended. I was hoping for a section on breathing or relaxation techniques. I came away with the feeling the authors felt no birth experience could be a success or enjoyable unless a doula was present. There was a very clear message that the father could not be a sufficient coach and his role was periphery to the doula. I was disappointed in the lack of encouragement the authors gave the father to be an active participant in the whole birth process or that the mother would lose control of herself if a doula was not present. It was almost a throw back to when my father had to fight to be at my birth and that was 30 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother's-to-be please take a look!","review":"any woman or couple who is expecting a baby should take the time to read this wonderful book, then check out the opportunities for labor assistance in their area.

My dad had Warrior is a Child on cassette. I rediscovered the old tape when I was close to highschool graduation. At the time, I was going to be a music major in college, so I was listening to any keyboard driven album I could get my hands on. I loved it! Her band is tight, and the chords are awesome! Several years later, I bought \\"Same Girl\\" (1987) That's a real good one, featuring Matthew Ward.***** For every heart I don't think was as good as those two albums, although Never Ending Love and You Have Been Good are well done.

They just search the tech support site for an answer.They said my iPaq must need new software, but I am up to date with bluetooth drivers and it still won't work.Basically, the tech support guy said sorry, you're on your own, so the headphones are going back to Amazon. I looked at their tech forum (buyers with problems asking each other for help) and noted the same problem for several other models of iPaq.If they worked, I would probably give 4 or 5 stars. The contruction is good and they are designed well, but if they make no sound, whats the point? Don't buy these unless you are sure they will work, but there is no way to do that, so, DON'T BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex subject is introduced well.","review":"This newest edition remains a popular book in educational finance courses in Texas and elsewhere.

The book has evolved well over the years, and this latest update does an excellent job of introducing EDAD majors and others to the complex world of school finance."},{"rating":"2","title":"rockin' episode","review":"Throughout the series, there were several episodes with titles inspired from movies that Jackie Chan starred in. This is one of them (from Shanghai Noon) and is one of my personal favorite episodes. Starring the Moon Demon, Tso Lan, this episode centers on our characters taking a trip to the moon to open the Portal and to banish Tso Lan back through it. Tso Lan is such an awesome demon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute episode","review":"In Chinese mythology, the Monkey King was a mischievous but benevolent character who genuinely cared for the welfare of his subjects. Here, he is far, far, far more mischievous than benevolent - and a heck of a lot more annoying, even more so than Jade could be in some of the episodes. You can't help but feel bad for Jackie and really root for him here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad this villian didn't come back...","review":"This was a fun episode with a cool villain I wish had come back for another appearance. Overall it's a fun episode with some comedic scenes and nice action scenes, showcasing some of the best of Season 2's abilities. A shame Origani wasn't used again or developed further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ep","review":"This is kind of like 'Back to the Future Part III, in this case the Chans have equivalents in the Old West. You have Jackie, Jade, Uncle, Valmont, Finn, Ratso, and Shendu all in the Old West and dressed accordingly. I liked seeing Valmont again, but all in all this episode, while entertaining and still a good one in the series overall, was lacking and could have used more development and a new story all together, if this episode had say, explored the history of the Demon Sorcerers or the such, it would have had more substance even if they had used basically copies of today's character like this episode did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun episode","review":"The Chans go back to Mexico, and are visiting El Toro and Paco and find themselves investigating the Mexican legend 'El Chupacabra'. El Toro gets bitten/scratched by it a d unfortunately it is like a werewolf bite, as El Toro changes into Chupacabra. But there is a happy ending to this episode since it's a kid's show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun episode","review":"Jade is integral in this episode, but not in a bad way, the storyline suited her. She befriends a girl who is trapped in a temple and cursed to be its guardian all the while Jackie is being duped by a monk who wants the treasure of the Lotus Temple himself but is not willing to pay the price. Pretty sweet ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite classic","review":"Finn is the star in this episode, and thankfully as Jade took over way too many episodes. Yes, Jade is in this one, but the story is focuses less on her. A cursed emerald is passed onto the Chans and they must return it to a certain spot in Ireland to undo the curse of bad luck. Finn really shines in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"So mcuh potential","review":"This episode was a lot of fun, but it also had so much unused potential. A small group of monks come to Tohru, thinking he is the Chosen One, and that leads to him being targeted by the villian. However, it is revealed that the real Chosen One is someone else - and the writers could have made a different (and better) decision than this. Also, what is explored in this episode is never brought up again, which wasted a chance to explore a cool idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute parody of Agent 007","review":"In some episodes, Jade worked well, but in this one I just found her character annoying and unneeded. This episode parodied some aspects of the James Bond series, including a villain and a henchman with special abilities. Necrosis' name fit him, and Hoyle's abilities made it clear where his name comes from. Definitely a good episode, but would have been better without Jade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should last more than a few months!","review":"I've had this telephone for five months and the cordless phone is no longer working. That is not a very long life, especially considering the cost. Regarding the answering machine, when people hang up before the message is finished, I hear a telephone company recorded message saying that they have dialed the wrong number (or a message similar to that)..it repeats a few times with their beeping noise before it actually turns off, and it is very annoying. No other message machine has ever done this. I really liked the idea of the corded phone as well as the cordless with this model, but I should have listened to the salesmen when they told me Sony cordless phones are returned more than other ones. I didn't because when it comes to cordless phones, I haven't had much better luck with Panasonic or Uniden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sony Product I have ever owned,","review":"I thought since this was a Sony phone I would enjoy it for a great length of time. I have never been so wrong. The Cordless portion of the phone has broken 4 times. The first few times we sent it back for repair (about a month without the phone). Then they sent us a refurbished version of the phone, which worked for a bit, and then the battery went bad (not long only about 2 months). So I had to get a new one. Then JUST after the warranty was up the cordless phone 'TALK' button stopped working followed buy the '2' and so on. Now I can't even use it. This phone is an awful choice...look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent reader with curious stories","review":"There are three novelettes here. The first is about a German who comes to stay with her teenage Petersburg penfriend, the second about a pet Polar Bear and the last about a shipwrecked boy.The text is up-to-date and not patronising with the minimum of footnotes.Critically speaking the stories are genuinely weird especially the true one about a polar bear who thinks he's human and who lives in a tower block. Apparently it was also made into a documentary.If you can't find a suitable reader, then this will suffice and should take you a couple of weeks to progress through. However the varied language used shows you how Russian verbs are used in context, and thus the book will last you a long time as a grammar reference. There are also short annotated Russian stories for learners in the weekly English version of 'Moscow Today'. Check this out too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"I have found very few books geared for English speakers at the intermediate level, so if you fall into the same category, get this book! The stories are engaging, and there are a lot of words to learn and lots more to relearn.English translations for many words and some phrases are included along the bottom of each page. The only thing I found odd was that some very difficult words were not translated, yet some of the easier ones were. But even if it had no translations at all, I would still recommend it.One more thing: If you find the first story to be difficult to read, start with the second story and move on to the third - I found them to be much less difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts to see all the typos and mistakes.","review":"As a native speaker of Russian, I thought the book was nothing else, but an insult. Good stories. Would be interesting to read for learners of Russian. They could even benefit from it in terms of grammar, spelling and punctuation if...it didn't have a great deal of typos and mistakes. As if it was not proofread for spelling, grammar or punctuation at all. Would I recommend it for my students? No! Good-looking cover and the pictures, but the way the stories are put onto the paper - it's just a shame. I wouldn't complain, if I got it for free, but spending $10 on it was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting stories, needs a proofreader","review":"As an intermediate student of the Russian language (I have been studying it mostly on my own for a few years) I found the stories in this book interesting and very readable. Most of the words unfamiliar to me had footnotes and many of the few that didn't I was able to guess from the context.The thing that bothered me and kept me from giving this a higher rating was the abundance of typographical errors. It seemed there was at least one per page. One is even in the title of one of the stories in the table of contents (the word for \\"bear\\" spelled with a \\"b\\" instead of a \\"v\\"). In most cases I was able to spot the errors for myself but sometimes I found myself wondering whether a word was unfamiliar or just misspelled. Also, in at least one instance the wrong translation was given for a word (it can be translated as \\"rudder\\" as an adjective, which was the meaning given, but in this case it was being used as a noun meaning \\"helmsman\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Intermediate Students","review":"This book contains three stories that are used as the basis for improving your Russian. The format of the book is excellent, and it is good to pick-up a book that helps the intermediate student. There seems to be very few books in this range outside of the world of academia.The only bummer with this book is the wierdness factor of the stories. Maybe the author assumed that you should be at the intermediate level by the time you're 9 or 10 years old, because these stories are not aimed at an adult audience. One would think that the authors could come up with some relevant stories for a broader audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"I received a refund for both the shipping and handling and the cost of the book at separate times after contacting your customer service and explaining to them that I had not received the book. I contacted by e-mail your customer service explaining to them at least on 2 separate occasions that USPS never acknowledged picking up the item from Amazon but only acknowledging that they received notice to pick up item. This must have been to difficult for your customer service department to understand. When they sent me the refund for the actual item they had enough forethought to ask me to inform them if I did receive the item.Well, I have not yet received the item and to this date I expect that USPS has not yet acknowledged ACTUALLY PICKING UP THE ITEM FROM YOUR LOCATION.

The wood shaft on half of them was brittle and would splinter upon attempt to sharpen.I tried several sharpeners thinking the blade might be dull. All sharpeners produced the same result so I decided to try a variety of other pencils, standard and colored. All sharpened perfectly.Bottom line is unless you love activities of futility, get another, any other, colored pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crayola coloured pencils","review":"I am preparing for my elementary-level art class and have just spent almost 40 minutes attempting to sharpen a box of crayola pencils.

I would recommend that you increased the amount that you can purchase in a twistable form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't sharpen the pencils","review":"The lead keeps breaking.

Do not waste your money on these unless you're trying to improve your pencil sharpening skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"It's been years (or rather dozens of years) since I've used Crayola products, and I have to say I was not at all disappointed when I picked these up after such a long time. I use Prismacolors in my professional work, but wanted to cut costs and use cheaper pencils for random doodling/color-books. The color in these pencils is far better than I had expected, though obviously not comparable to higher-end products. The colors that come in the box are fantastic, but I do find certain shades are very close to each other. Other reviewers have mentioned that these pencils break easily, but I haven't had any trouble when sharpening them. I might suggest investing in a better handheld sharpener if you find them breaking on you. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to buy from Crayola."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best things in life can be cheap!","review":"Never assume colored pencils are for children. Never assume that a cheap art item is a poor quality art item. Crayola, for me, are best known as the most afforadable and widely ranged set of pencils on the market.They have hard lead that gives very smooth laydown. With these pencils, it is always best to start out light and layer your colors until you get a sleek, natural result.The problem with Crayola is that the lead is too hard for blending, i.e, 'pushing' the colors into one another. If you are the type of artist who is into such things, I suggest Prismacolor pencils. But you can mix a little with a white Crayola pencil, so give it a try if you like.Overall, wonderful for hardcore traditional artists or beginning scribblers. It definately won't burn a hole in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead Broken inside both boxes of pencils, unable to sharpen","review":"I ordered colored pencils because I couldn't find them overseas (military) at the beginning of the school year. The shipping time was great, but the quality is lousy. Not sure if the damage occcurred with shipping or with the product, suffice to say that it isn't worth $6 in shipping to return $12 in pencils. My children, who usually don't complain, were both mad because the lead kept breaking when they sharpened the pencils and they had to throw several out. Either the quality is lousy or the packaging was a bad idea (they were not protected in any way, just directly wrapped with a cardboard box that matched in size of the two boxes ordered). The pencils themselves were not broken. Mad at myself for wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality on these coloring pencils","review":"All the color pencils are broken inside, my daughter could not color with them at all.

He loves markers, but his 2 year old brother was a bit too enthusiastic with them on my furniture, so we've got the pencils instead.The colors are great, but the quality is atrocious. You need to sharpen them every few minutes (if you want a decent job), but they are so brittle I keep dumping broken tips. The only good way to sharpen them is by using a sharp blade, but it's time-consuming and not exactly safe with 2 active boys roaming around. We have a box of cheap pencils my husband got in some airport in Europe couple of years ago and they still have some juice (OK, lead) left in them! The Crayola won't last more than a couple of month for color-happy user!"},{"rating":"2","title":"16 Cents Per Pencil","review":"No one can resist a pack of these babies for 8 dollars. Hell, even professional artists that use artist quality can't let these go for this awesome price even if they rarely use them.It's just too much fun to gaze upon them on the shelves of Wal-Mart, but I have to say they look better on your bookshelf at home. Alright colors, not the best quality to lay down, but fun when your cousins come over for some art projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great colored pencils","review":"The pencils did come already opened and spread throughout the box, however none of them were broken.

This helped some, but the ice cream was still gritty and and grainy and it did not melt like ice cream or soy ice cream.

I was very skeptical when I first saw it: How can cashews and maple syrup even begin to satisfy my craving for a rich, creamy frozen dessert? Well, they can and then some. I couldn't be happier with the taste and texture I found with the first recipe I tried (chocolate, of course). Also, the recipes are very easy to follow and take very little time. And the selection of recipes is mouth watering; there are so many great flavors to choose from.One thing readers should be aware of is that almost all of the vice cream recipes use cashews, which can be pretty expensive.

Too many changes in too little time and besides, you had me at cannibalism.I think Barker should've left his story at this: The powers that be in New York City are part of a cult that feeds on human beings and therefore plan and cover up the killing of civilians. As far as horror goes, this isn't all that implausible. Cannibals exist and governments sacrifice their people all the time.There's a time to be fantastical and a time to reign it in and the basic ingredients of this story lead me to believe it would've packed more punch if Barker kept it simple and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific short stories.","review":"Reason I like Clive Barker's work is because his writing is highly visual, emotional, and twisted. Visual and emotional, you'd have no problem understanding. Let me explain the \\"twisted\\" part. Many horror stories focus on horror itself. But what I found to be different with Clive Barker's work is that there is something more. There is humor, joy, meditation, blank stare, pleasure, smirk, and such that contradict things that normally accompany the idea of horror. Books of Blood is good example of this. Each short story is highly efficient and effective. A wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close to literary genius as you can get.","review":"The Books of Blood were my introduction to the works of Clive Barker, and I can only bow to his genius. The collection of stories in the Books of Blood demonstrate the depth of his imagination that is rivalled by none in his field, and the fantastic merging of (get ready for the cliche) reality and fantasy. Tales like 'In the Hills - the cities' antaognise deeply buried primal fears, and drag them kicking and screaming into consciousness.By these volumes, your literary life won't be the same without them.Pity he has to make the films though. Candyman ? Hellraiser 4 ? Give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rawhead Rex Rules","review":"I agree with \\"Stunning\\" Rawhead Rex is the best monster story ever written! Too bad they made it a movie. I love most of the stories as well. RR is enough for me to recommend the book. Mr. Barker ropes you in to his graphic writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I'm not big horror reader these days, but I used to read Stephen King, and always liked the darker fantasy stuff, not to mention all the splatter movies we used to watch in high school, so I wouldn't say I'm adverse to it. Barker has been widely hailed as \\"the future of horror,\\" so I figured I'd take a gander at this collection of 16 stories originally published in 1984, to see what all the fuss what about. Well, maybe I'm just jaded or am too grounded to reality, but I found the seven stories I read to be fairly boring. There's plenty of blood, but nothing I found particularly shocking or scary. There are good premises here and there, but somewhat haphazard execution--which Barker himself obliquely acknowledges in his introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I am an avid fan of Stephen King, Dean Koontz and horror in general, but had not read any of Clive Barker's offerings. I purchased this book hoping it would introduce me to another good horror writer, opening up another vein from which to mine the dark and fascinating tales that I have so enjoyed from these other authors.As you might have guessed from the title of my review, this mine is empty, you'll have to dig elsewhere.Barkers' tales are childish and unimaginative. They don't end so much as stop. The author seems to think that a shallow tale embellished with enough vivid descriptions of blood and gore will somehow become a decent read.Don't waste your time on this one, the cover illustration was the best part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Gross Out Horror","review":"Who could really top \\"I have seen the future of Horror and his name is Clive Barker\\" in praising these books? Granted Stephen King was a bit premature with that assessment and Clive Barker would go on to write children's books and \\"dark fantasy\\" (usually without the dark) and beautifully rendered paintings in prose, but that doesn't mitigate the power of these originals.When I first read these stories I was shocked by the power they had to make me nauseous. Upon reflection (and with his strange career) I see that there's also a power that they have in taking the reader to the world where a woman can twist bodies, a monkey still stalks the rue morgue and other joys of the flesh. It's as if these stories are the culmination of the promise in the Hellraiser movies - they take you to Heaven. They take you to Hell. You don't care because you are enjoying the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Implicit becomes the Explicit","review":"In all the best horror there is a strong undercurrent of perversity, of the repressed, unacceptable desires that afflict everyone in a civilized society. The most salient feature of Barker's fiction is that he takes this element that frequently remains only implied in much of the horror tradition and places it right on the surface.The Books of Blood are a good introduction to Barker's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case","review":"It's hard to find a decent case for this phone without paying more than it's worth.

Other than one person trying to find her daughter and mild discusstions of racial issues, nothing really happens until the last few chapters. I thought the characters were not very well developed. The author hints at their issues, but never really tackles them. She seems to bring up lots of issues and then fizzles. I think this book could have really made a difference to non-bleivers reading it, but instead Jodi seems so shocked by her imperfections and those in others that it comes across as very pious - especially the arguments with the husband. I was really dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"I picked up this book because I kept running across it in various bookstores! It took a couple of chapters to grab you, but once it did, I found drawn the the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen to them.

Doesn't all of Christendom have one single original bone in its body, or must we keep doing watered down versions of the stuff the world likes. Jesus was an innovater, not an imitator. This is marketed (and titled) to look like thay YaYa Sisterhood book. It is a decent and funny book in its own right but I was really put off that it tries to identify with a secular work.

And they do not provide tracking information. You might want to consider that before you choose to place an order with them. I am extremely dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and laborious to read","review":"This book reminded me of a reality show...a boring one. It is written from the point of view of Jodi, a teacher in an urban school who lives in Chicago. I would expect that she would have a small level of street sense based upon this but she has none. I also did not understand why she was 1)worried about everything, 2) insecure about everything and 3)crying over everything. She felt bad because her family did not throw a parade after her return from a local conference. She felt jealous because her husband took her daughter to a pancake house. I'm thinking, \\"Get over it!\\". Also, I had read half the book (glutton for punishment) and I could see no real point in the story or steady increase to a climactic point. The story just meanders through someone's life. In all fairness, my negative viewpoint may be based upon the fact that I just could not relate to the main character. Others, who enjoyed the story, may have been better able to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yada Yada Prayer Group","review":"If you have always attended church, been a \\"good Christian girl\\", don't have a prejudice bone in your body and thought you knew what it meant to have a servant's heart, read this book. I couldn't put it down. Each day I anxiously anticipated the quiet moments when I could catch up with the Yada Yada sisters. Their lives will influence you to look at your world as God's world. It inspired and informed me about the cultures outside my church walls. I suggest you order all in the series because when you finish one, you'll want to continue the your connection with the Yada Yada sisters. Neta Jackson has provided the perfect vehicle for opening our hearts and minds to the struggles, fears and victories of our sisters in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your eyes","review":"This book has a way of making you look at yourself and then realize you are really human.

Don't miss the others, because they won't let you down either."},{"rating":"1","title":"yada yada blah blah blah...","review":"One of my best friends gave me this book, and she usually has great suggestions, so I was excited to read it. However, even a couple chapters in, I was ready to slap Jodi, and I only got more annoyed as the story went on. She was the most shallow, jealous, snotty character in any book I've ever read. Sure, all characters have flaws. But Jodi seemed to have every flaw. Any character in the book that Jodi didn't like or made a snide comment about in her head made me like her less and the other person more. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was on everyone's side but Jodi's. And that is not something you want in a main character.I did enjoy some of the plot, and the camaraderie that the members of the prayer club had together. But I'm certainly not going to be looking for these books in the store. If I can't feel sympathy for the narrator and main character of the story, then as a reader, you've totally lost me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This is the first in a great series. You will be hooked so go ahead and buy the rest when you get this one. I pass mine on to friends and they come back asking for the next one.

It has really changed the way I pray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling mysteries unravelled in Dark Tides!","review":"WOW! Transylvania Chronicles I: Dark Tides Rising is one of the BEST (if not THE best) campaign style modules I have ever read, and I have been playing RPGs since the Chainmail packet in 1976! The authors take you through at least 300 years of gaming in a flash, planning for just about all contingencies. Besides that, there are storyteller hints from how-to style through atmosphere, and they include dozens of (slightly altered for fantasy) historical incidents to throw in as filler throughout the game! All I can say is, since I am currently storytelling this game. In closing, if you are interested in Storytelling Vampire: The Dark Ages at all, this is DEFINITELY the book to pick up. Just be ready to switch to Vampire: The Masquerade at some point, since this 4 module series runs the transition between both games, and details over 800 years of Kindred history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Perfect","review":"Imagine my surprise when I find that the LARP chronicle that myself and four others had been planning had essentially just been published by White Wolf.

We previously had one of the 7d programmable Honeywells. This one is a huge step down. The temperature swings drastically past the setpoint, both up and down. It's difficult to program. You have to pop the cover plate off to make any adjustments other than a quick up/down. We also miss the target feature where it learns the time your house takes to get to the setpoint and compensates.This one will get banished to the garage shortly and we'll be investing in one of the better Honeywells. I'd suggest that you skip this one and either save your money on a basic model or spend a little more on the better units, especially if you value maintaining a constant temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review","review":"Chose this thermostat because it was one of only two recommended to control our pellet stove. Once programed, it appears that if you want to override the programed temperature, you can only do so for a 2 hour period. For example, if you will not be home for a day or so, you can't over ride the program to stay at 60 degrees for that time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapola","review":"I'd give it zero stars if I could. It's IMPOSSIBLE to program. Maybe it's just the particular unit that I purchased but I've never had a more difficult time programming a device. The directions stink. Changing the batteries is another battle I could do without - they don't want to stay in the unit and I use tape to hold them in, and I have to change them often. Had a Lux 500 which you could program blindfolded (almost). The only reason I bought this is because that's all they carried at the local hardware store and I needed an emergency replacement for the Lux. The next one I purchase will be a Lux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for less then 48 hours","review":"I installed this unit around 8:pm Friday night by 11:pm Saturday the heat would not turn off automatically.

I like it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"It's hot this summer in Central Texas and we grew weary of the house being so warm when we came in from work. We decided to check into a programmable thermostat. We found this one, and we are extremely pleased. We ordered the thermostat, and paid a HVAC technician to come in and install the unit. It has worked flawlessly from the start. It is able to be programmed to go into a sleep cycle at night, to shut off in the AM when we leave for work, and to come on before we come home from work. It works well and we have no problem with the programming. We can also override for faster cooling if needs be. We would recommend this model to anyone for their basic thermostat needs; I don't know if it makes a difference but our house is about 1450 sq.ft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected","review":"Not very happy with this product. It would turn on for about a minute and then turn off. I don't think cycling the furnace on and off every 10 minutes is good for the furnace.

The instructions said to remove the jumper wire in the connection terminal if you had a two-wire control circuit. I did as instructed; the furnace came on but would not quit. After I played with the unit for several hours, my wife checked the Honeywell website, and finally found that the instructions there said that the jumper was mandatory for proper operation if you had a single transformer and a two wire system. I put the jumper back on and the thermostat has worked flawlessly since. The thermostat works really well, but the directions stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of box it didn't work","review":"Just installed this to replace a Lux unit that failed. Installation is pretty easy but it will not turn on my furnace. It will only turn on the blower motor in manual mode.

I also did a quick search online and the failure mode I have seems to be pretty common with this Honeywell thermostat model judging from the online postings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap. You get what you pay for.","review":"I picked up this 5/2 Honeywell thermostat because it was about $10 cheaper than a White Rogers version (that I had at my old house and liked). I figured, what could be so different? Well, a lot.1)the cover is not hinged, so for 'fiddlers' who like to change settings, it's a total pain to pop it open and get inside to adjust programs. You are able to adjust temperature temporarily without opening the Honeywell cover, but it eventually reverts to the program. .2) no backlight3) battery consumption, for some reason, is really high. My first set of fresh duracell AA's went out after 6 months4) non-intuitive displayI could provide a lot more detail but the bottom line is if you're the type of person who is constantly checking your thermostat and likes to adjust programs frequently, look elsewhere. I don't know the model number but there's a 5/2 White Rogers with a swing down cover that works great - spend the extra $10 on that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"prefer a different brand","review":"I found the instructions confusing at the most key part, ie, where to insert the wires, and where the J-switch goes. The screen doesn't light up which is a pain when trying to check temperature or change settings at night. You have to take the cover off to change settings, the cover doesn't flip. The screws were difficult to access with a standard Phillips head, down in narrow channels. You have to toggle between one display to see actual temperature vs set temperature, instead of being able to see both at once.

Jimmy Autrey didn't disappoint me with this book. \\"What Big Teeth You Have\\" is both ultra-violent and poetic at the same time. It's obvious that Mr. Autrey is a lover of the vampire genre and has gone out of his way to create a story that feels familiar yet is totally fresh. It's also refreshing to read a vampire novel that isn't a carbon copy of Anne Rice's work.I especially enjoyed Autrey's use of fairy tale imagery to give the tale a wonderful gothic quality. In fact, I'd describe this book as a reverse fairy tale where all the wicked characters take center stage. Just like the villians in your favorite fairy tales, Autrey's characters have all the over-the-top evil qualities that help make a fun read. I can see this book growing a cult following.This book made me an instant fan of Autrey's work. If we're all lucky maybe he'll put out a follow-up novel one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"the video moved kind of slow","review":"the video moves slowly and in my opinion does not do a good job of preparing someone to trim their own horse.

Besides the money, I mean. There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.

Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"This book was edited by Hienlein's wife, Virginia. If you have read Tramp Royale, you will already have seen that Virginia seemed to be a vain and foolish woman, dull witted at best. This book certainly affirms the dull witted concept. It is overly catagorized, with many sub-catagories containing only one fragment of a letter. As a result, a striaght through reading jerks you all over the calender and back again in the space of a few pages. Very annoying. This would have been a far better book if the fragments had been presented in the order they were written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book That Should Not Have Been Published","review":"Heinlein's letters to his editor and others displays a meanness of character that is best forgotten.

The majority of the letters here are between Heinlein and his agent, though a number are between Heinlein and editors, or between Virginia Heinlein and others. There are glimpses into Heinlein's personal life, and just a tad of a look into his political interests. There is quite a bit here about Heinlein's working habits as a writer and his experience and interests in engineering and the military. True fans will want to read this.

It covers the pure .Net stuff pretty well and goes into all of the APIs in some depth, and it is probably the best book on the GUI side of .Net. But it does not address the hard stuff.

Unfortunately, it disappointed me by covering basics for pages and pages (like drawing circles) without getting to anything a developer can actually include in a professional application. Key topics weren't covered: data binding, MDI interfaces, real custom controls, etc. etc. etc. Afterwards, I stumbled across a much better book (although a little short): User Interfaces in C# (Macdonald), which has great ideas for implementing all these sorts of things.

But this book does not give you a real-world-app, but the knowledge of details that make you build one. The appendix of math and string class will be helpful for anyone doing real programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Avoids using the .NET environment, wich is a bit silly.But that way you learn and understand more about C#, you have to do it all by yourself(if you wish).

Reminds me a little of reading Stroustrup (though it's not *that* bad).I've been programming in C++ for years, and have generally enjoyed jumping over to C#. I have not enjoyed using this book.

Quibbles? Some lax editing (for instance, on Page 12, it says date when I am pretty sure he meant data) but as a writer myself, I know how difficult it is to get a \\"perfect\\" book out the door.

I think a lot of innocent people are going to lose some serious money, just because of the \\"Petzold aura\\".Petzold's style hasn't changed a whit... even though he has migrated his code from C to C#, it's still the exact same stuff. Entire chapters dedicated to drawing curvey lines, and hand-painting fonts on a screen. You will not learn the C# language either... I repeat, this is not a tutorial.I've read both Programming Windows 3.1 and Programming Windows 95. They taught me the structure of Windows programming fine, but in a decade of programming, I've never done a thing that even closely resembles what Petzold does in his books.Programming is about forms, data, transformation, and storage, and there is nothing here along these lines.

Unfortunately, that is not the case with Super Apollo 47:50. Santiago's voice is powerful (as usual) but, the music is just not what you come to expect from the Apollo Sound. I don't know if it's the arrangements, the musicians or what but, it is just uninspiringly bland. You really won't get the hard hitting, salsa dura from the 70's. There is one HUGE exception on this album that saved it from becoming a total failure and that is \\"Vigilandote.\\" This song is the epitamy of \\"salsa gorda\\" with fantastic hard hitting salsa combined with in your face lyrics and a vocal performance only Santiago can put on.

Ms. Parks is not one of them. She may be a gifted playwrite and novelist, but she's not a narrator. You'd think someone who works in theater would understand the concept of voice talent, and make her publisher hire some to read her book for the audio version. Alas, Ms. Parks undertook the job herself, and the effect leaves a lot to be desired. For example, if you're going to have your characters speak in a regional patois, you can't then read it as though it's beneath you to speak that way, hesitating just slightly before each mispronunciation or grammatical error as though to disassociate yourself and make it clear that you don't speak that way.

Have you ever tried to listen to the lyrics in any of his songs? If you like him, obviously not because he doesn't talk about anything. Alright i'm going to try to keep an open mind here, but let me tell you a little story. Last summer i was at home flipping through channels when i came across the video to \\"back that thang up\\" i was awstruck. It was the single most disgraceful thing to hip hop i'd ever seen. Earlier this summer that all changed however when i came upon the Nelly video. He is the wackest rap performer ( i'm not even going to call him a mc or rapper) to ever pick up a microphone. If you are a Hot Boys fan you might like him however.

I did like him at first...\\"Country Grammer\\" is a catchy song that grows on you. Overall, the album has a few catchy songs, some mediocre beats, and cliche lyrics. If you happen to enjoy hip hop that has no real meaning, no depth, & you just want something to bob your head to, then pick this CD up. Personally, I'm tired of hearing it on every radio station.Before Nelly blew up, before the St. Lunitics got a taste of fame, they did actually have some potential. I remember hearing the St. Lunitics on the radio just a couple years ago. I doubt anyone outside of St. Louis even knew who the hell they were. I liked them then & I expected a lot more...Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop rap, LOL","review":"Well if you apreciate hip hop for deep and poetic lyrics that rep somebodys pain and struggles and life experiences, then this isn't for you. It is more of pop rap disguised as southern flava rap. And it works sometimes like on \\"EI\\" ( a catchy song, you'll never stop singing it) and a few others. I also liked \\"Rid Wit Me\\" and basically all the singles. But for the most part Nelly just doesn't have anything worth listening to. He's not real down to earth or flashy on the other hand, and his beats are kinda tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the milestones in the downfall of modern music","review":"This is what I consider one of the cornerstones of when hip-hop went bad. There are literally one or two DECENT tracks on this album and the rest are strictly cheerleader \\"rhymes\\" with little \\"flows\\" mixed in between... Almost all songs sound the same, except for \\"Ride Wit Me\\" which is one of teh standout songs on the album, but was completely sold out on the radio. Additionally, on Ride Wit Me, everyone else who flows on the song sounds better than the \\"front man,\\" Nelly, and makes you wonder why he was the St. Lunatic with the album out first.It's too bad that MTV has ruined Music so much by making it more of a fashion show than about GOOD music. If you're looking for something with a hot fresh sound, pass on this ish... If you need a random CD for Skeet-shooting target practice, pick up about 10 copies...

Nelly was on the fast track into making it big, he also was bringing his freinds along which was cool of him. At the time of Nelly's first appereance to the charts, Marshal Mathers was out and crackin', but he topped him too. the song, \\"country grammer\\" was nothin' but the best and so was the rest of his cd. I was just lovin' the way he wasn't like everybody else he defintly had his own sense of style which attracks me to him. Also, he wasn't into talikng about sex,money and cash like everybody else. Instead he talked about being broke and having to make it through in life which is what the magority of people were and still are going through.His lyrics defintly related to everyone and people were defintly feelin' what he was saying becase he was all real.Nelly i love you, you is so bomb and keep doin' what you doin' because we're all lovin' it -gone-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"Well, maybe you'll know the St. Lunatics from this. The songs with them are awesome. Most of these songs ARE cool. Some exceptions are stuff like Greed, Hate, and Envy. Most of it's cool. Some songs are weird. My best example is Batter Up.

He is the modern day version of MC HAMMER. Take a look at the music he is making now. This album is commercial as hell but when you slide down Nelly's resume it gets even more commercial. I mean how low can you go? Country grammar has some decent beats that get professionally wasted but the number one beat waster in the world. Nelly is the WORST rapper actor to ever walk this earth. What we need to do to people like this is to yank him off stage and tar and feather this klown. Check out real hip hop like Mos Def and Immortal technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool","review":"Most of the songs on this cd are pretty good. Like most people, I bought this cd mostly for the song \\"Country Grammar\\". But listening to it, I found that this cd has a lot of good songs such as \\"E.I.\\", \\"For My\\", and \\"St.Louie\\". But there are a couple disapointments, such as \\"Thicky Thick Girl\\", \\"Greed,Hate,Envy\\"(good song, but bad beat), and \\"Intro,Interlude,and Outro\\"(not songs but they are pretty stupid).

I hope nelly reads this himself, (or asks someone to read it to him) and he thinks about everything I said before he comes out with another cd that makes my ears hurt.

When I listened to this album for the first time, I thought it couldn't get any worse....then, in 2002, he came with an even worse album (which I've already reviewed). Weak beats with an even weaker rhyme style...but, what do you expect from a \\"rapper\\" who's fan base consists of middle school girls.

Rap aficionados are, in the main, illiterate, inarticulate, and ignorant people who will never be able to compete - they've already taken themselves out of the game.

Nelly is 1 hit wonder, I don't care how much albums he sold cause M.C. hammer with 15x platinum. What makes a great m.c. 2 me is lyrics not beats or chorus. Nelly's album has beats & catchy chorus but no LYRICS. Not once he spit anything that makes me want 2 get up and rewind that. I don't like when all a m.c. rap about is \\"girls, cars, & money\\" but if u going 2 do this at least display lyrics like Jay-z. Nelly is a 1 hit wonder cause like always hip hop fans will move on 2 the next \\"hit\\" club song. Real rapper like Eminem, Rakim, canibus, Wu Tang, Big Daddy, 2Pac, Krs-one, mos def, Xzibit, Jay-Z and etc. real have their place in the hip hop hall of fame. While like M.C.

Musically, it is quite catchy, with overamped bass that both moves your body and lowers your SAT scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and Simply put . . . .","review":"This album clearly displays the one thing many people have known for sometime. Nelly is not, nor will he ever be, hip-hop. Nelly is a true disservice to those great artists that established what hip-hop is all about. Do yourselves a favor and go listen to The Roots, Wu-Tang Clan, KRS-One, and there are so many others, I don't have time to name. Just anything but this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated (extremely) 1.5 stars","review":"People blew this CD way out of proportion on how good it was. Yeah it sold 9 million and held #1 in the Top 40 charts for a good minute, but c'mon people. He remade a song to when girls were in preschool playing jump rope. I think he did a decent job, when trying to please a certain crowd (mainly the crowd who listens to a lot of alternative music and very little rap). Now the rest of the CD really didn't appeal to me except Batter Up and E.I. (before they became hit singles) Some of it was pointless singing and weak catchy rhymres for an attempt to get your ears in tuned, and to get airplay on the radio (a good example of this is the track Loven Me). I can sit here and type about how bad Nelly is as a rapper, but that would be very pointless. So to however many people that do not have this album, you can get it to add to the sales or you can be real about it and just not buy it and never think of it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just How Good is Nelly's Country Grammar","review":"This rapper needs no introduction. Just in the first week Nelly sold over 1,000,000 copies of his new album \\"Country Grammar.\\" Since then he has spent his time up in the secend and third slots on the billboards and currently has the second most sales. This soundtrack includes 17 hot tracks including his smash hit \\"Country Grammar.\\" Also appearances from the St. Lunatics, Cedric The Entertainer and the one and only Lil Wayne. This is not a cd with only one smash hit and the rest is trash. All the songs have incredible rhymes from the New and rising star Nelly and all have great beats and rhythms. E.I., St. Louie, For My, Greed,Hate,Envy and Tho Dem Wrappers are also future smash hits. I think this is the best album out, and Nelly is one of the most talented rappers out there. Go out and get this album. Keep on watching DFX on MTV cause Nelly's new song E.I. just was world premeired. Nelly keep on doing ya thang and watch out eminem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the bleeding.","review":"This guy is shameless.

This is the first disk that actually offers more than 1 or 2 hit songs. I have requests for about 8 different songs on this disk at any occasion. There aren't many disks that can provide even the regular Joe a full 35-40 minutes of hits on one disk from one artist without it being a greatest hits or compilation disk. I rate this disk \\"best buy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Grammar- St. Louis Style","review":"Nelly's Country Grammar received a rating of four stars, for several reasons. The first reason is that many of songs, such as \\"Country Grammar\\" and \\"Ride Wit Me\\", have a strong bass sound, which fits the lyrics to create a strong sense of emotion and feeling. The second reason is that the CD contains many beats and rhythms that make you want to sing and dance to the music. Whlie the CD has many positive points, it also has negative ones as well. This brings attention to the parental advisory and the reason behind it. The parental advisory is to heed parents of the amount of cursing and verbal sexual content. Since many of the songs have cursing in them, it is important for parents to know that the CD should not belong in the hands of anyone under the age of 16."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for casual rap fans","review":"I am a hardcore rap fan, and I like this album. Very catchy songs, and cool beats, but Nelly just doesnt seem like a hardcore rapper and is obviously not a gangster rapper.

The beats are tight and the guest artist provide tight flows to mix up the albums quality.

Just listen to this paragraph... \\"How irritating it is to be out walking your dog, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine, and suddenly find that you are about to be attacked by a young child.....\\" There's more.. and she tries to soften her response later in the chapter by obviously trying to cover up how she really feels about children.

Not to mention all the previous comments that agree that this camera is NOT worth any price.It's really cute, sure, but the monitor on back is grainy, and my screen had a huge line down the center. The flash is really bright and over exposes the pictures. The pictures I took with flash on look one dimensional and the grainy. The ones without a flash are barely visible (I was in a bright room.)To zoom, you have to go into a menu to select options. The picture is very rocky when you're looking through the view finder.Great price, but save your money for a better camera. Not good if you care about the quality of your pictures.Don't fall for the looks, pay attention to the comments and DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture quality is awful","review":"I received this camera as an anniversary gift from my company.After taking several pictures at different resolutions and downloading to my laptop, I realized how poor the quality of the pictures were.

I figured I could carry it around more easily than a standard digital camera. Like everyone said, it wouldn't stay charged for very long, and you can tell it's cheap. I didn't read the part about it only being Windows compatible, and my Mac says it can read RAW images like the camera creates, but it won't connect with my Mac. It always says that there are no pictures. Even when I take the memory card out and put it into a memory card reader on my HP printer, it says that there are no pictures. I would highly discourage anyone from even considering buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Purchase I've ever made","review":"I think this camera is the worst camera I've ever seen.

There is NO switching to new batteries when the non-replacable internal battery goes dead, which it did after about 15 pictures. I purchased this camera as a Christmas present. It worked for about 36 hours and then ALL it would do was beep 3 times when any button was pushed. Oregon Scientific was non-responsive to numerous emails and calls. They finally responded after 2 weeks but by then I had already returned the camera.

The door for the battery compartment is extremely hard to open. The first time I used it I forgot to put a memory card and the built in memory only held 45 pictures. The display screen was pretty impressive. But I could never download the pictures. When I installed a memory card the camera would not turn on. When I removed the memory card it would turn on. I tried inserting 3 good memory cards with the camera on and I kept getting error messages saying I had to format the cards. I formatted one card and still had the same problem. All 3 cards worked fine in my other cameras.

CMOS is old, normally used for security cameras. Even though I don't own this camera (and I generally hate reading reviews by people who don't own the product), I have owned a Polaroid camera of similar specs & price - with a CMOS lens. It mysteriously died in less than a year (company would service, but it would cost almost as much as purchase price for part) and picture quality was horrible. I regret not having done my research, b/c I took pics of my first baby with it and now with my second baby on a Canon, I can totally see the difference in quality.General tip I've learned: if the company doesn't have a history of making cameras (35mm cameras), then don't trust it!

Because of its short length, or maybe because of its light tone, it's not usually considered among Dostoyevky's best or most famous works, but the novel is full of tense moments, great humor, unbelievable yet classic characters, and a number of conversations that will actually make you angry--conversations between the leech of a visitor and his meek though gracious patron.I've read almost all of Dostoyevky's works, and this has always stuck out to me as one of his most enjoyable.

But hey, let's face it, it was recorded for the most part in the 80's, so, you can't expect it to be perfect.Overall, the answer is no. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. I don't know what you've got to be taking to think it's good, because it's not. As a Christian music and Newsboys collector, this was the last Newsboys cd I bought, and thankfully so.

It would be easier to understand the charaterizations if they weren't so terribly dated now - while the copyright is 1983, based on the TV shows cited I suspect the ideas might be a bit earlier. There are things that mention answering machines and microwaves, and it's hard to remember what I thought about them when they were first showing up; and of course all sorts of fashions in houses, clothes and so on have shifted the markers. But much is based on occupations, and given the depth of the changes in the job market as blue-collar jobs went overseas and white collar workers were replaced by computers, there are quite a few observations that just don't make sense any more.However, it's still fairly interesting reading. 25 years ago, I'd probably have given 4 stars - the author does do a certain amount of sneering and superiority that is grating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about fear","review":"This is a great book club book because you can count on a lively discussion.

Ostensibly a critique of our social classes, particularly the pathetically insecure MIDDLE CLASSES, this book is yet another opportunity for the late Paul Fussell to express his elitist disdain for most of the rest of us. He excels in revealing the mediocrity of most of our colleges and universities but what he is really after is the celebration of X-Class members like himself.

I did not expect it to be as funny as it is and can recommend it on the dark humor alone, much of which made me laugh out loud. Even twenty-five years after his observations so much of it rang true and revealed things to me in plain sight that I had not noticed before. The section on Education has lost none of its bite or accuracy, only gained in value as the situation seems to have gotten worse since publication. Other things are dated though. Many of the fashion signifiers are worn by nobody now, also his elevation of \\"white wine\\" as the exclusive drink has not aged well at all, and the decades of real estate speculation has made many of his judgments on the class meanings of various home styles obsolete for many parts of the country, but this is a very valuable book and a fast fun read though it does induce some discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch!!!","review":"When you strip away the veneer, what you are left with is the truth.

It's a romp for the first few pages, but just gets more and more spiteful as it moves along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading.","review":"This is worth reading, but Fussell's liberal bent mars the book. One example is where he points out that the upper classes don't dye their hair, but let it go grey. And the accompanying unflattering illustration is of Ronald Reagan, a senior citizen when President, with brown hair. The suggestion is that Reagan was low class because he died his hair. BUT REAGAN'S OWN BARBER SAID REAGAN DID NOT DYE HIS HAIR. His barber said he'd cut hundreds of heads, and knew the difference between dyed hair and natural colored hair, and that Reagan's brown hair was natural. This is just one example to show how Fussell's bias makes his take on things less than objective."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close to 5 stars, but....","review":"This book is politically incorrect.It is also very entertaining.I saw many people I've met it it, me included.Although the book is 2 decades old, it holds up well as a scathing look at middle class America.The only thing I found annoying was Fussell contempt of religion.To equate Christianity as being a mark of only low class people is stupid.Other than that glaring bit, it's fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professor Fussell needs a lesson","review":"Save your money, don't buy Class: A Guide Through the American Status System.

So, he's using the word \\"class\\" in the sense of \\"that dame ain't got no class.\\"And, for that reason, the book is really pernicious, making us think that status is something that actually matters. Fussell may feel that his superior education gives him the right to look down on fat women in stretch pants, but Dick Cheney, with his prole's jutting jaw and crummy degree, still decides the energy policy of the US and gets us into a stupid war, a war incidentally that the likes of Paul Fussell would have been forced to fight in before he got that superior degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Most of the interesting comments in the book are quotes or direct references from The Preppy Handbook (which is actually an interesting and funny read).

If this type of topic interests you, The Preppy Handbook is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not current, not funny","review":"Paul Fussel attempts to analyze social class in America by illustrating how one can identify a person of a particular class by the way they look, dress, act, and live. His point, further, is that social class is painfully obvious despite the attempts of many (so he claims) to deny it's existence. But so many of his examples are outdated. Some are still true today, but housing and fashion have exploded since this book was originally written in 1983 and what was true then is not necessarily true now. Further, the author's attempt at humor comes across as simply condescending and rude. It was painful to trudge through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Very good read, author is funny, witty and intelligent. I was glued to it till I read it. It is still relevant even though it was written in 1992. Class society is our reality, and it is so truth for other countries besides the USA, even for communist countries too. I am highly recommending it to my friends that are brave enough to face this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I bought three copies of this book to give to my friends. By far a read I would suggest to anyone who is interested in why we do what we do."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the lame side","review":"If I were Jilly Cooper, I would have been rather upset with this book, which borrows exceedingly heavily from her book of the same title. Fussell quotes it extensively, borrowing much of the format and most of the ideas from her book, which predates his. If you want a book on class, get Cooper's, which was just released in a new edition. It's just as funny and not nearly as rude. Fussell says no class is better than another, but Cooper clearly believes it. One gets the impression that Fussell read Cooper's book and thought to himself \\"Gee, somebody should write one of these about the United States!\\" And did. But Cooper was first and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boyz finding their groove","review":"this is when the newsboys are finding their groove, and songs like Kingdom Man and Israel rock, and One Love and Taste and See have the euro-beat, pop rock sound they later became known and successful with, like on albums, Not Ashamed, Going Public, and Go, and those four songs stand up as good as Newsboys hits. It is more raw sounding and simple, and not so refined like the next album, Not Ashamed and onward are, and this is why I like most of it and gave 4 stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Has A Virus After Knowing About It For 3 Years","review":"I ordered the Barrons How to Prepare for the ASVAB with CD Rom for a Christmas present. The main reason I selected it was because of the CD, and I felt my son would probably be more willing to study something on the computer. When I tried to load the program, found there was a serious virus on the CD. I sent emails to the Customer Service department reporting the problem, and to ask for a new CD, but they have never responded. Now after reading other reviews I see this problem has been around on the CD since 2003 over 3 years. I find this inexcusable on Barrons part not to have resolved the issue in this time frame. I feel this product should be immediately be pulled from the market. I'm surprised that Amazon seeing these reviews about the virus hasn't allready done so. Don't waste your money on this product, especially if your buying it because of the corrupted CD ROM program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virus on the CD-ROM","review":"The book seems good. However, The main reason I chose this study guide was the included CD-ROM. When installing the program on my computer, Norton Anti-Virus detected a virus. The \\"W95.CIH.corrupt\\" virus at 61% of the install process. After reading about this virus, I tried an install with anti-virus turned off. The ASVAB program would not run. I contacted the Tech support at 510-796-9608, (per the setup menu). The english was so poor on the automated message, I had no idea which selection to make. At the end, I left a message and have not yet heard from them. So far, the CD-ROM is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful study guide -- but too many errors, and a virus on CD","review":"This book was useful as a preparation guide for the ASVAB, but it was clear that the publisher didn't spend much time proofreading it. There were numerous spelling and grammatical errors, and the practice tests had several questions with wrong answers and/or bad explanations. In one case the question consisted of a statement and choices without any question! I expected better from Barron's. We didn't use the CD at all because we also had the virus problem mentioned in another review below."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different book!","review":"To be fair, I've given it 2 stars. That's because: 1) it WAS a multiple choice test; 2) it WAS broken up into sections; and 3) I did take it on the computer. If you're looking for understanding the test in theory, this book will work. Otherwise, the similarity ends there. Other than the example questions, NOT ONE of the questions in this book was on the exam I took (the example questions on the test are the same or similar to the example questions in the book). I just looked at another book advertised here on Amazon and it has at least one of the questions that was on my test (\\"The Best Test Prep for the ASVAB\\"). In addition, there was a section in the exam that was not in this book - it's about putting shapes together. It would have been nice to be able to practice that ahead of time. Finally, if you are able to get the CD working, the CAT test on the CD allows you to go back and review your answers; the actual ASVAB CAT does not! Do yourself a favor and buy the other book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful View of the Hajj and Mecca from 3 Perspectives","review":"This is a wonderful documentary of the Hajj with an inside view of the sacred city of Mecca. As a teacher of religious studies, I have seen several good documentary depictions of Mecca, but this is the best I have seen as it gives the viewer the perspective of a woman from Texas, a man from South Africa, and a man from Malaysia. This documentary takes the viewer on the Hajj, recounting the preparation for the Hajj, the journey to Mecca, and the various rituals associated with this Pillar of Islam. Most interestingly, the viewer learns about the meaning of the Hajj for the Muslim pilgrim. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Introspective of a Pillar of Islam","review":"This is an extremely well done documentary. As a new Muslim, it gave me a brief idea, both physically and spiritually, of what what the pilgrimage will entail for me sometime in the future, God willing. In addition to what the pilgrims go through, it was very interesting to see \\"behind the scenes\\" of what the Saudi government does to prepare for the onslaught of millions of people who come from all over the world. My only criticism would be that I wish it were longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSIDE MECCA","review":"I shared this video with my daughter and some friends. The documentary opened our eyes to the difficulties of making the Hajj (journey to mecca). We realized the Hajj is like a religious triathlon. Each step of the journey is shown and the story behind the traditions are explained well. The photography of the city, the mosque, and the Kaaba involved us. I thoroughly enjoyed the video and learned a great deal about the sacrifices of Muslims who make the Hajj. The film was the source of learning and good discussion among my non-Muslim friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Film","review":"In fact vey good film related to Hajj in Meca and give simple explation for the hajj rolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful","review":"You will invariably connect to at least one of the profound interviews in this book.

There is a story, a message, a revealation for everyone. Mr Green talks about the whispers in our lives, but the whispers in this book actually shout out at the reader to grab hold of life and live it. Really live it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book seemed to drag somewhat. The story was about a rich spoiled young lady that was bored with her life and decided to switch lives with her poor friend. Even though she grew up with the poor friend, she did not have a clue the struggles she went thru each day. The rich girl becomes struck on her boss. The hero/boss is a self proclaimed Christian that asks the heroine/rich girl to sleep with him..... This is where the book lost me all together.I was shocked and disappointed that Love Inspired Books would allow this book to pass thru the editing process. I have not read all of their books, but I have read a lot of them and have never read a book where the Christian hero/heroine requests sex without the benefit of marriage. The Christian is to honor and respect those that we love and set an example to those that do not know God as we do. If we do not, then we are of this world and not of His."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patchiz (DAH MAHN) reveiw","review":"This album is one of Twiztids best works yet, Although Mirror Mirror straight up sucked with exeptions of one or two songs, this album has the same studio sound but Gets me goin as much as Mostastless. To me the highlights of the album are Afraid Of Me, The Only One, And Hydro featuring Krazy Bone. THE END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat People are hard to kidnap","review":"After a disapointing showing in Mirror Mirror, Twiztid comes back extremely strong with The Green Book. I was very skeptical of this album.. I didn't like the original \\"The World is Hell\\" and didn't like most of Mirror Mirror. I was blown away by this album though, the remix of \\"The World is Hell\\" kicks..., not to mention it has a guest verse from Esham. \\"Marsh Lagoon\\" features an awesome story, beat, lyrics, and vocals on the chorus from Psychopathic veteran Legs Diamond. Probably my favorite track on the album. Other highlights include \\"U Don't Wanna B Like Me\\", \\"Serial Killa\\" (/w Tech N9ne!), \\"White Trash Wit Tat-2's\\", \\"Afraid of Me\\", \\"Fat Kidz\\", \\"Hom-Sha-Bon\\", \\"FAT KIDZ\\", and the great rock track to end the album, \\"Darkness\\". Buy this album now if you were ever a Twiztid fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Book, Shangri-La, and Repentance","review":"Twiztid did the Green Book. This was a collection of more personal songs. That's why it's very different.It's very different from other Twiztid CDs.For one, it's very off/odd when Psychopathic make sad songs. I thought all of their good songs can be played live. When you listen to good Psychopathic, you don't leave depressed.What sucks truly sucks about The Green book. It's all the hype. The hype was better than the CD itself.It's got a couple of really good songs on it though. Marsh Lagoon is a hell of a good song. That song and the artwork/booklet is the reason you should buy this CD. It's too depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I don't understand. Mirror/mirror was an EP with B-sides and side projects, and it was better than this. GOD! Every song has the same drum pattern. They put out a version of \\"The World is Hell\\" on their website that was much better than the remix here. Get Mostasteless if you've never listened to Twitid before.It start out okay but gets bad really fast. It picks up with Frankestein. Every Dies and Hom Sha Bom almost make up for the sh*t tracks. Fat Kids is boring and has bad rapping, but there's a line in the song that makes it all worth it. Darkness gives the album a really anticlimatic feel. It's like failed attempt to make a boring grunge song.This just feels like nu-metal or techno. Really repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twiztid at their best","review":"This album is the best, tied up there with ICP's Amazing Jeckel Brothers. All the songs on here are awesome! When I went to a store and I scanned the CD to listen to samples, I listened to about 4 of them cause I loved this one song and I would play it over and over and over again, it's called Afraid of Me. It's the most deepest song you'll ever find. It talks about how life can be hard at times, but you just gotta hold on, and it talks about that be yourself, and don't change for the world. Anyway, back to the whole album, BUY IT!!! All the songs are great, especially Afraid of Me. 5 STARS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"After listening to the entire CD, it is nowhere nearly as good as I was expecting it to be.Out of all of Twiztid's albums this far, the beats on this CD are by the worst. They all (with a few exceptions) have the same drum pattern, and all come out sounding boring and repetetive. I was looking forward to listening to \\"The World is Hell\\" with the added verse by Esham on the album, because the version that they posted on their website was very good. Apparantly they decided to remix the song for the album, and gave it a beat that was much slower than the original, and sounds like most of the other beats on the album. I think that they were trying to be \\"experimental\\" on this CD, but the way it turned out, it's hard to listen to the CD all the way through, and it has very little replay value.The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of the few listenable tracks (Nikateen and Serial Killa) and because the artwork/packaging is creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't tell me this is music","review":"what is music now? just 2 freaks in trenchcoats screaming profanity over a sorry background? tell me you don't really think these freaks are real musicians do you? how can they even be selling this? this is nothing more than 2 alchoholic, pot smoking idiots screaming out profanity for an hour. if you have some sense you might avoid freaks like these, they are not artists, their idiots! please don't buy this, this is so awful! one sounds like he's on helium and the other sounds fried! how is this popular? this and all the other horrible records coming from physcopathic records are horrible. insane clown posse? what is the world coming to? the only decent album physcopathic records ever released was the insane clown posse's amazing jeckel bros. and thats only because it featured snoop dogg, that was the only reason. music from this label and every label like it is garbage, reconsider buying this please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new - Songs sound the same","review":"If you liked Mirror/Mirror then you will like this CD.

All of the songs are great. Even the two short ones. There are a bunch of guest apperences. Ever one of them is on the song best for them. It is a very original cd and for those saying mirror mirror wasn't good probably couldn't name a better e.p. in the world. But this L.P. is great.

Keeper's Story was an interesting book. My favorite character was Keeper the dog. He had a bushy tail and made up poems for everything that happened. He spent much of his time looking for his long lost sister, Wispy. He lived with many different people to survive. One of them that I liked was a young girl named Emily. She loved him very, very much. Keeper's enemy was Scar, a dog who liked to attack other dogs and human beings. Keeper was scared of Scar, but, in the end, Keeper was brave and stood up to his enemy. If you would like to know if Keeper finds his sister, then I recommend you read this exciting book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Service","review":"I bought this DVD from the Reagan Library after watching the coverage of Reagan's funeral service this past summer. I was fascinated and moved by the protocol of a State Funeral and the love that protruded through the Reagan family and this nation for President Reagan. It is rare in our country that a State Funeral occurs and where the entire nation takes a moment to stop and notice. The DVD provides coverage of all services that occurred - (1) US Capitol Rotunda Service, (2) US Capitol Rotunda Depature, (3) National Cathedral Funeral Service, (4) Reagan Library Family Service, and (5) Reagan Library Final Sunset Service. The services were all presented without commentary and allowed me to experience the procession on my own. As a bonus, there is historical footage and photos of President Reagan. In short, this DVD provides a complete and dignified farewell to one of our nation's leaders that can be revisited and shared with future generations to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"They came not to honor Reagan, but to bury him","review":"I wanted an historic overview of the Reagan presidency - what I got was a c-span like account of his state funeral.

It reminded me, with the dialogue format, of some of the \\"channeling\\" books (like Seth or the Course on Miracles), but without even the substance of those books.Rather, the authors seemed to concentrate on people's childhood troubles, just as a psychoanalyst would, regressing them so as to uncover the beginnings of their psychological problems.This, to me, is not a useful procedure, but obviously, some people are helped by it.

So what you have is a self-setting clock that you have to manually set yourself, a thermometer that you have to mentally adjust downward by 5 degrees, and a forecaster that provides a rough but useless idea of the day's weather. If the above is not enough to dissuade you, consider this: (1) the touch screen buttons are absolutely useless in the morning when your hand-eye coordination is at its worst, (2) the clock's \\"snooze\\" button annoyingly becomes a \\"sleep\\" button after several minutes of radio/ringing, (3) the radio reception on this in my area is worse than any other radio I have tried, and (4) as others have mentioned, the clock is invisible when the lights are off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks better than it works","review":"I needed a clock radio to fit a small space in my bathroom and thought this would be perfect.

The outdoor temp never sends it's signal and my nightstand is a little higher then my head so since the clock is slightly angled I can't read it at all, even with the dayglo on.

This is a book on the development environment itself, not on the applications that you may be developing. While you could, of course, use a simple text editor to write code, using a development environment will assist by providing tools to make the code better, faster to write, and most important much more bug free.The database integration is the specific area in which JDeveloper is separated from other Java development tools. JDeveloper provides for database connectivity in a way that greatly simplifies the development of a business application getting data into or out of a database. Since it was written by Oracle, it obviously concentrates on using Oracle. If your company is an Oracle user, this approach is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good soundtrack to a good movie.","review":"\\"Boys and Girls\\" was a good movie,but the soundtrack I like even better than the movie.Let me start out with the good news before I get to the bad.The best song on \\"Boys and Girls\\" ,in my opinion,is \\"Stop the rock\\" by Apollo Four-Forty.My second favorite song is by Settle, entitled \\"I know a girl\\".\\"Iknow a girl is so magnificent,I think we all can relate to that song because,no matter popular,cool,or how tight you are ,there's always someone we want to be even though we logically know that we can't be that person or whatever you want to be.I know we all fantisize about being something we are not.I think the message from \\"I know a girl\\" is that we need to except us and every living thing for what he or she is.Now for the bad news.

Here in Brazil it is very expensive. I found this nice offer at Amazon.com and ordered it. The fragance is awesome. My disappointment with this purchase is due to the fact that in any moment they advertised it as a refurbished or not new item. When I received the package the perfume's box was totally opened and the seller sent me a note saying that the perfume was used once (or something like that). I felt cheated and was very angry but couldn't send it back and ask for a refund cause I was coming back to my country. I have bought at Amazon.com before and it never happened.

And for any of you who don't know FAKE perfum typically smells like that. It smells NOTHING like the other THREE bottles I have ( I like to stock up as this perfum is so hard to find).

It appears Autumn Story, amongst the works of Landolfi, is an aberration."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sagas","review":"The Laxdaela Saga ranks up with Njal's Saga and Egil's Saga in terms of literary quality and thus should be a part of any saga lover's library.The saga tells the story of the residents of the Lax river's dale from the founding of Iceland until shortly after the conversion to Chistianity. It is full of humor (the episode of the killing of Helgi, when Helgi strkes Thorkel through the door, wounding him through his helmet, and Thorkel's response is to tell folks that someone is, most certainly, at home). However, what makes this saga truly unique is its handling of tragedy.In many ways the feud in this saga is similar to that in Njal's saga. Both feuds are between friends, but the fires are stoked by women, for example. But while Halgerd in Njal's Saga is often a less-than-sympathetic figure, Gudrun here is entirely sympathetic.All in all, this is an impressive saga and well worth reading. It has romance, comedy, tragedy, and much more.

Breaking the rules to mend the problem is uncharacteritic thinking in Japan, and that proves to be the reason for his ultimate success: no one knows how to deal with such incomprehensible behavior.This fascinating legal thriller is an intelligent, not a guilty, pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Arrived ripped.

A great opportunity was lost. Having that much talent assembled and watering down the performances was a big misfire. Where was performances from Lazy Lester, Jimmy Vaughn? Was Clapton invited. Instead we got Steven Tyler, Macy Gray, Joe Perry and a host of other performers that do not connect with the Blues.Performers like Cray, Burke & many others were matched with songs that felt awkward.

King, Clarence Gatemouth Brown, Solomon Burke, Odetta, Natalie Cole, Ruth Brown, etc. are all so fabulous it makes you sick that you missed this great concert. Unfortunately, there is one performance that this film could have done without. Macy Gray was in way over her head and she may have felt it.

Starting with an African piece from Togo, and moving through slave and turn of the century black music, the concert functions as a sort of history of the movement. Except for a few back stage interviews, marvelous black and white archival material, and short interviews, this unadorned documentary lets the concert speak for itself. Listening to ninety minutes of the blues, I was struck by the powerful simplicity of the words, and how merely knowing the words and the music by no means adds up to the blues. Except for John Fogerty, Bonnie Raitt, Aerosmith and a couple others, all the musicians are black, which makes for a strange setting when you realize that most all the people in the audience are wealthy whites (similar to an NBA basketball game in this regard). Yes, BB King gave the final two songs. This film is a music lover's delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not an expert on the Blues, but...","review":"I caught this documentary on StarZ one Saturday morning and WOW!

Buddy Guy, Solomone Burke, Ruth Brown, Mavis Staples, Bonnie Raitt and Natalie Cole, to only name a very few. WoW!Awesome performances and background information on the performers. I would have preferred Chuck D's performance to be left out.

I would not waste a penny on it (unless you want the entire collection for show). I have bought the two out of loyalty (and excitement at first) and I feel shame in saying they are terrible albums. They exhibit none of the passion, emotion, or desire I have come to love over the years through all the various bizarre roads which have been taken.

I think this album, the other Ohgr album and the newest Skinny Puppy is some of my favorite industrial work of all time.The tracks are extremely catchy and often repeat in my stereo as by the time I finish the album, I want to listen to the first song all over again.Some of the tracks on this album are a little boring for me as they're not as innovative but my tastes are extremely picky. To find a CD with even 3 songs I like is a rare find, and this is one of them as there are at least 5 songs I need to re-listen to all the time.The hidden track is very interesting as it's one of the beats that you can tell they were toying with but never got it to sound like a true Skinny Puppy type song as it's a little silly. IT's enlightening to hear some of the work that Skinny Puppy plays with and wish they would include more of these misc tracks on their albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohgr!!!!!","review":"This is a nice piece of work!!!

By the time I reached the last 1/4 of the book, I could care less about a cave or anybody that wanted to be in one. I don't know what editors get paid, as far as salaries nowadays, but I know this one got paid too much, for Allison definitely needed an editor. A good editor. Cavedweller had the tendency to drag on. Allison, in spots, repeated herself.That said...I still liked the book, a lot. Delia and Cissy are stand out characters. Dede is a pistol. The plot was realistic. Cavedweller also displayed Allison's wonderful sense of humor, such as the transformation of Nadine. And that wonderful line where Tacey, a young black woman tells Cissy, \\"My daddy always said that white folks are simply crazy. He also said that black folks are crazy too, but we aren't simple.\\" *LOL* You gotta love it.This was my first time reading Allison. It won't be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"Bought this on a clearance rack and can now see why it hadn't sold. The characters were unexciting, and the story dragged on and on. I read 4 books while having this one unfinished on my night stand. I've never read any of Allison's other novels, but after reading this one, I don't think I'll jump on the chance. Dede was the most interesting character, and even she couldn't keep me involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat-footed prose, paper-thin characters; needs editing.","review":"A flat, meandering, shambling book; most characters are distinguishable from one another by name alone (although, as a \\"good read\\" it gets better at the end).

If you want California angst, read Joan Didion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this book","review":"Ugh! This book was a gift, so of course I read it. Don't waste your time! I read it a year ago and it still sticks in my head as one of the worst books I have read in quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"um, delia? where are you?","review":"Have you ever been at a party and struck up a conversation with a stranger, who proceeds to tell you something intensely personal, possibly even his or her whole sad life story? The end result, of course, is that you don't know this person any better than you did before. You have learned a lot of personal details, but the individual remains a complete stranger. This is CAVEDWELLER in a nutshell. All these characters, all these details...but who are these people? For Christ's sake, make me care about them! No such luck. Still, I'm looking forward to D. Allison's next book. After all, BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA was in no way a fluke."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly crafted, poorly realized","review":"I was most bothered by the poor characterizations in Cavedweller. Countless times the characters turned themselves out in the most unlikely ways with no motivation or tension to explain this. I suspect Allison is ill-suited for the omniscient voice. Her incessant narrative mind-reading drove me up a tree--although this artifice was surely necessary to explain the characters' eternally bewildering behaviour. I thought the beginning was quite compelling, however, and it wasn't until I was halfway through the book before by disbelief could be suspended no more. The relatively strong caving sequences leant the second half of the book some cohesion but came too late to save the novel as a whole for this reader. The story takes place in a rural (or suburban? I couldn't tell) Georgia town called \\"Cayro\\". I was telling this to a friend and his immediate response was \\"Like the syrup?\\" which I found an inscrutably apt perception."},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoyable","review":"Enjoyable novel about relationships between women, as friends and family members. The characters are a bit on the stereotypical side, but it's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Human!","review":"I found these characters, & their lives, so human. I cared about them all (even the bitter Amanda) & their personal relationships - to themselves, their family members & neighbors,& their circumstances. And beautiful, beautiful writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I found this book to be the story of a dysfunctional family of strong women who manage to function in spite of themselves. I was struck by the thought that these women, if seen sitting in the coffee shop or the beauty shop, would look like an ordinary group of redneck women with probably not much of interest going on in their lives. Wrong! The book is in need of some editing to cut down on a huge bunch of words adding nothing to the story, but otherwise is well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mother Runs Off with a Rock Star and Leaves Her Children Behind","review":"This book is poorly conceived. The plot is fragmented, the writing awkward, and the characterization is superficial and contrived. Overall, it was a big disappointment.The novel is about a woman who leaves an abusive husband and her two daughters to run off with a rock star. The rock star dies and she returns to the small Georgia town she left in order to reconcile with her children.I recommend readingBastard out of Carolina: (Plume Essential Edition)by Allison instead of this. 'Bastard Out of Carolina' is a fine book that is beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I avoided reading Bastard Out of Carolina for a long time as I had heard how emotionally intense a book it was. When I finally read it I agreed with what I had heard, and was engrossed and engaged and impressed and touched. I looked forward to Cavedweller, expecting another beautifully written book. But I was disappointed- there were alot of sloppy errors that did not allow me to suspend disbelief (no, it is not 3 am in California when it is midnight in Georgia), characters were explored and then dropped (who was the main character?) and the story meandered with no real point that I could make out. Too bad; I agree with other reviewers that this half-baked work needed more time and an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I really wanted to like this book but couldn't get there. Well written but poorly edited - use of wrong character name, wrong word - this is a disjointed story. There are too many undeveloped characters and subplots that don't seem to add much or go anywhere. And these are really hard, sad characters, most of whom make it to the end with some resolution for themselves but still remain sad or disillusioned. I knew nothing of this author except for her book, Bastard Out of Carolina, which was also sad, raw really, but readable. After reading her biography to try to understand her point of view I suppose I understand her characters a bit better but life doesn't have to be a recurring awful. I stayed until the end, read every word, but now I'm sorry I did. I've been depressed for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great novel by Ms. Allison","review":"Dorothy Allison would probably be my favorite author, therefore I've read practically everything she's written. Although when I read this book, I didn't get the same feeling that I did from Bastard out of Carolina or Two or Three Things. It didn't have the same gut-wrenching writing or intense emotional situations, but it's still worth reading if just for the experience with the author whose sentences are liquid poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaay Toooooo Loooooong","review":"Allison either needs a new editor, or she should have made this book into three different novels.

You can also adjust the height of the shelves by moving the rails up and down. They are held by plastic hand screws on each side.

I ordered 3 of them for our bathroom vanities. Our vanities have lots of space but were lacking in shelving. This item provided us with lots of space for all of our bath items. It was easy to assemble and the shelving just snaps on. Love the fact that the shelves are moveable which was important due to being able to jockey them around the drain pipe. Excellent product.

I moved from a house that had about 75% more room under the sink than what I have now, so I was really struggling to find something that worked. I can say this works great! The only thing I did wrong was assemble it before I put it in, and then had to take it apart to fit it around the pipes...DUH! It holds tall bottles, heavy items, and gave me the additional room I needed to store away all my things neatly and organized. I might actually get one for my husband's side of the sink just to get him organized even though he says he doesn't need it! I imagine this would work great under the kitchen sink also for additional storage. I also like that the plastic shelves can come off for easy washing over time without having the take the whole thing apart.

The letters are edited to the point where the point of the letters is often lost and too many letters aren't included, for whatever reason, perhaps because of the shortness of the book. It is not particularly good editing to have one letter commenting on the amusing story contained in a letter from the other party when the letter with the amusing story isn't included. However, if you are already a Mitford fan, the book is still worth buying and reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"benbrook,tx","review":"cant wait for grandaughter to open i know she is going to love this apron, i wish they came in ladies sizes also, but it is just so cute. i love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"only day 1 but I love it","review":"I have had this only 1 day so far but it is better sound than the jabra I had and it really is as seemless to switch as can be with my samsung 900, even at my desk I can make calls/receive them from either the desk or cell phone without it missing a beat...This price is cheaper than the headset and stand alone (289 on Amazone too) and the HL10 H=Handset L=Lifter is an awesome product too for office productivity!!I had the CS 50 and loved it and this one does NOT have the same range but it has worked quite well and done so well over the 30 feet it says for bluetooth, atr least thats been tested a bunch with the desk unit since I done make a habit of walking away from my cell phone...PLantroinics is proud of their products witht he price, thats for sure, but this is a well designed and great working product.

Consider Joy Division's wholly original synthesis of the power of punk with the pulse of disco as its musical framework injected with visionary lyrics and then consider that, since punk and disco so drastically changed the musical landscape in the mid-70s, now 30 years ago, there have been no new musical forms other than rap. Ian Curtis strived for beauty and love and understanding but was too often confronted with horror and despair. He lacked a common language and felt too deeply. Ian Curtis allowed us to take an intense journey from a comfortable distance by exposing his soul to us. Heart and Soul - one will burn. Closer is one of the ten greatest rock albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another concert unearthed","review":"A remastered version of Joy Division's second [and last] official album. The second disc features a live show from 1980--unfortunately there are few left in existence and sound quality is always an issue. Great to have another one however.Recommendations for JD in studio, etc. still are the 'Heart and Soul' box [if you can afford it] and 'Substance' [if you can't]. 'Closer' is a great album, but I prefer JD without P. Hammett strangling their sound. You will get tracks from it on both of these compilations.Speaking of a live disc, the best is still 'Les Bains Douches 18 December 1979'. Absolute classic that captures the amazing power of this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing Beauty","review":"This is one of the most emotionally affecting albums I have ever heard. Its sad melodies weave into your mind and Curtis' voice becomes a permanent fixture. I do not agree that it makes you suicidal however. It may strengthen such feelings within those who struggle with these thoughts, but it can also become like an old friend, one you will revisit many times who lets you know that things could be worse and the sadness in life can be contained by the power of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely devastating masterpiece","review":"As I have mentioned in earlier reviews, it is impossible for me to define which Joy Division album is the finest. But in terms of expressing desparation and devastation, Closer is the quite possibly the ultimate record. Especially tracks like \\"Twenty Four Hours\\", \\"Passover\\" and \\"A Means to an End\\" are so powerful in their total desparation that they are almost physically hard to listen to. The production quality is not near as soft and friendly as it was with \\"Unknown Pleasures\\", only adding to the record's pressing and desperate mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark music for downer people","review":"Like slowing down on the highway to catch a glimpse of the twisted, mangled bodies being pulled from a car accident, this album might appeal to those curious to uncover the bout of depression that ultimately took lead singer Ian Curtis's life. To most others, however, this will sound like a lot of self-wallowing B.S. Pull the shades down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly a classic","review":"jesus after my review of the movie \\"10\\" i need to do something serious. first off joy division was introduced to me by my bass teacher in mississppi when i brought in NIN FRAGILE for him to hear. he said that if i liked this i would die over joy division. needless to say i am still alive but this is a truly beautiful album that is haunting in the sense that the lead singer hanged(?) himself soon after this album was finished due to a rocky relationship. true art. if you dig VELVET UNDERGROUND and ARE A SONG WRITER LIKE MYSELF YOU WILL APPRECIATE THIS WORK OF ART.

Many wondered why Ian Curtis killed himself, who said drug, epilessia.Nothing of this.. Ian was a sad person, married and his wife had managed to get ridof that sadness. The only solution for Ian was to disappear for ever from his sadness. I wonder ifin heaven will he be happy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy Division's Finest Hour","review":"The second (and final) album from Joy Divison, Closer is their magnum opus, their finest hour. However the only downside to that is the tragic ending to lead singer Ian Curtis, who committed suicide before this album's release. Despite that, Closer is a masterpiece in every since of the word. From beginning to end, Closer will have you by the throat. From standouts such as The Eternal, Means to an End, Twenty Four Hours, and so on, Closer is an album that deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album, worth all of your pennies..","review":"This is the better of the two Joy Division albums, though their first is an excellent album itself. This music is just so charged with the intense feelings of Ian Curtis, you can't possibly describe how heavy this album is. I won't say more. Just go and buy it.

Dr. Ballard and Dr. Keyser have written this book to inform the entry level learner about their passion of the Old Testament. Not only was Dr. Ballard a fabulous teacher, but this book allowed one to experience the faith of a spectacular man. When it came time to sell books back to our bookstore, I kept this book.

The premise of the book is good but it just never gets to any real intrigue or edge of the seat suspense. Mr. Skinner has great characters -they just don't seem to mesh together. And some of the scenes have no relationship to believability. Perhaps, this one was just too much an attempt to produce book #2 too soon. Wesley Farrell was a great character developed in book #1 and I was truly disappointed by his character in book #2. And if I knew a woman's liber, I would not recommend this book to her because the role of women was insulting and demeaning. Better luck next time - bring back Mr. Farrell with all his charm and mystic of book #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PU, no hum","review":"Dropped these into a MIM Strat.

If it were in the English it was originally written, we could barely read it.It doesn't add quite the insight as the Geneva Study Bible but still does what I need it to do. It does confirm the Geneva Study Bible.I ordered a used copy but it looks new and came in less time than I was told. I use it to supplement my study with the KJV and NIV.In my opinion, a good buy for serious Bible study."},{"rating":"2","title":"A myth in the making","review":"This is mythology in the making!

It could have been done better ... in my humble opinion; there are others out there that exceeds far better than this one.But for those who are collecting for 100th Anniversary of RMS Titanic for their Library; it is a nice addition to the library and leaving it there with others in chronically order, however, to be frank and honest, you would find the exact same issues as I have reported.

I also bought Season 2 and 3 which are not damaged and play without incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is finally over","review":"So incredibly excited that this show is FINALLY going to be on DVD!! I am addicted to catching the episodes on WGN in syndication. Hope they keep seasons 2-6 coming out right behind it. I agree with the other posters, the best crime drama, so full of entertainment. My hat is off to casting, there is not a weak actor/actress in the bunch. And Don has not received near the credit he deserves as an actor. He can communicate so well without any dialogue. His facial expressions, his eyes, they say it all.October can't come soon enough!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HURRAY!!!!","review":"Thanks Amazon.com, the writers, producers and actors for FINALLY bringing NB to DVD. This has been such a long time in the making and we are VERY happy to finally be able to watch every episode. This was one of the greatest crime dramas on TV. The viewers were angry, shocked and saddened to learn that CBS would not renew it. We were definitely CHEATED! The relationship Nash and Joe had inside & outside the office was terrific. To get drama, comedy and emotion all in one episode week after week is very artistic and truly amazing. I cannot wait to add to the NB collection with the remaining seasons. I hope we don't have to wait as long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Show!","review":"Nash Bridges is an amazing show. I remember watching this show when I was younger. It's action-packed and funny. The only down-side is the price. The price is pretty high for only 8 episodes. Since Nash Bridges first aired 3/26/96, the first season doesn't contain the usual 20+ episodes. However, if the price doesn't bother you, GO FOR IT! Nash Bridges is amazing and if you are a huge fan, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, NO FEATURED MUSIC","review":"This was probably the release I have most waited for as of yet. A fantastic show finally out on DVD, however, the DVD does NOT CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL MUSIC. CBS must not have secured the lisences to use ANY of the original music featured on the show. After watching the pilot episode, \\"Big Me\\" by the Foo Fighters and \\"Please Call Home\\" by the Allman Brothers have both been replaced by instrumental overdubs of different music. This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I for one am incredibly disappointed that the DVD's do not contain any of the music featured in the show. Hopefully, from now on, CBS will obtain the lisences to use the rest of the music featured in the other five seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Travel Handbook","review":"I purchased this guidebook because my much trusted travel store 'highly recommended' the book. I have traveled all over the world and I have never been more frustrated, and annoyed, at a guide book than I am with this one. It has been completely worthless - from a useless and incomplete language section, to poorly edited maps (or no maps given), recommended Pousadas with no address and no phone number, to sections that go on-and-on about what to do while in a town only tell you to hunt down the local paper (which is in Portguese)to find out where to go for a \\"do not miss\\" experience. A three year old Lonely Planet has been far more useful and accurate than this latest edition. My question - who writes and edits for Footprint and what are they smoking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Footprint makes decent guidebooks, such as Footprint Brazil, but but unfortunately, they tend to do a lot of political editorializing that makes unnececssary reading for someone seeking out a travel destination (see their blatantly Anti-Israel guide to that country for an example of this tendency) Until they change their editorial policies, socially conscious and culturally respectful consumers should spend their money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of this one","review":"First of all - the one star is because the website does not have a zero star option. This was a story so unerotic and so completely off-putting, I do not know why it was even published by Blue Moon. These erotica publishers buy entire catalogs of old \\"erotic\\" books from the 50s and 60s and republish them, and although the average is good, and some are very good, there are also some which are really bad. This one is really bad. There is no sex in it. There is a lot of hinted violence and non-consesual activity along with pop psy exploration of the heroine's thoughts and feelings. Very unappetising. This is not what I look for in erotica. If I wanted moralising I could get it at the church for free - I do not want to pay 8 bucks plus shipping and handling for what is essentially a bad sermon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravishing erotica!","review":"I have read various erotica novels that have left me satisfied -- so to speak. The Ravishing of Lesley is both erotic and profound. After she abandons her husband and children, Lesley makes a journey to a beautiful villa in England, where she sets out to vent her deepest sexual desires with gusto. The sexual descriptions in this book are quite explicit -- the most important element of a good erotica. Also, there's a great deal of profound meaning in this novel. Are you a big fan of erotica? Then I suggest you read The Ravishing of Lesley."},{"rating":"2","title":"got to be careful","review":"the magnet can harm the psp. alot of the parts are metal. if you put it near psp parts will get moved around. gotta be careful with this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in 9 months, bad customer service","review":"When it worked it was pretty nice.

THAT is the TRUE story, taken from transcripts, police reports, etc. Sanders was not the lead inspector on this case, and seems to be taking credit where it is NOT due. He was being trained at the time by the real lead inspectors, and is attempting to pass himself off as the one that solved the case, which he is not. It is shameful that someone would try to take credit for a case which he did not actually solve.

This totally ignores the Vertigo \\"Vamps\\" series, from which only 2 short story arcs (out of a project 5 or 6 I think) were ever released (and only the first of those collected, I think), but were also quite good.The big problem, is that this collected edition, now listed by Amazon as out of print, was NEVER RELEASED!!!!!!!!!I waited well over a year for the thing after the projected release date . . . waiting and waiting for the release . . . it never was . . . and now they have the nerve to list it as \\"Out of Print.\\"Arghhhhhhhhhh!Pretty good story, SOMEONE at Vertigo, PLEASE PRINT IT IN A COLLECTED EDITION LIKE YOU PROMISED!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cactus jack the early years","review":"The Movie advertised is wrestling NOY A MOVIE = no Ann Margaret , NO Krik Douglas- the description belongs to The Villian not the Title listed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but line between PxDx and ANb just got blurred","review":"First of all, I really like this album. It is friggin heavy and fast as all get out! The lyrics are disturbing as well as the story surrounding it. However, the great thing about Pig Destroyer is that up until now they have been a totally separate entity from Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Scott Hull's other band. Terrifyer is the first album where the music sounds a bit too much like ANb, ala \\"Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope\\". Past efforts by PxDx have had more of a goregrind feel to them (think Mortician with a bit of punk put in the mix). That is not nearly as prevalent on Terrifyer, and I can think of at least three places in which an almost exact replica of an ANb riff is placed in this album. But, being as I am a fan of both bands, this album will still impress you with the precision with which Scott Hull and company rip through the albums 22 tracks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grind Your Mind!!!","review":"PIG DESTROYER - Terrifyer-This is some dark, twisted and evil music... yet I can't help but love it! PxDx is a 3 piece grind band that fuses many influences and has a sound so thick that it would consume many 5 pieces in their entirety. The blister guitar work of Scott Hull drives the charge while the rhythmically precise drumming of Brian Harvey holds it together. J.R. Hayes, who has my vote for the craziest lyricist vocalist since Today is the Day's Steve Austin, is in charge on the mic, pushing chaotic extreme vocals to new levels with a voice which is brutal yet still (at times) audible.So what you ask does PxDx sound like you might ask?Devastation!

The bristles fall out (all without me even noticing or being aware). So when we go to check the filter baskets, WHAT A MESS.

The only cons I have seen so far are that the seat is a bit shallow for a heavier person. It is plenty wide, but seems like if it had a bit more depth it would be more comfortable.

Thank God Bruce and Adrian are back and there presence is definately felt throughout the cd. Having three guitar players is pure genius because they all have distictive styles and by letting them shine instead of the Bass gives the cd the best sound. Along with the time changes and harmonies missing from some works it is all here. And by having Bruce back makes it better. I thought Chemical Wedding was awesome I cant beleive he outdid that. It is good to see he hasnt missed a beat at all i swear you would think he never left. I love all the songs but i really cant stop playing Fallen Angel Wicker Man and Nomad they just stick out and Thin Line Between Love and HAte is like nothing they have done before. I really hope this cd puts them back on the metal map because this cd is a new classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the last few...","review":"While I don't pretend to be the biggest Iron Maiden fan in the world, they are still one of my favorite bands. As such, I was in no way disappointed by Brave New World. I'm genuinely glad that Bruce has returned to the band, as his voice encapsulates the ineffable Maiden sound. Each song is consistently impressive, although it took me a few rounds to be completely hooked. Unlike previous albums, these songs seem to spend longer building themselves up instead of reaching out and grabbing you immediately, but this is fitting given some of the songs are quite lengthy (and I'm a big fan of long songs). The guitar work is excellent, with clear, poignant riffs and distinctively powerful solos, while songwriting is in top form. Sometimes the lyrics are repeated a little too often, but this I can live with. Not Maiden's best album, but definitley one of their better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave old sound in a new world...","review":"I grew up as a teenager with Maiden so when I heard Dickenson was back with the band I ran out and bought the CD the day it was released, and was blown away. This Disc does not have a bad song on it. With record company's flooding the market with the same type of music, it is refreshing to see older acts using their STRONG FAN BASE to produce music their way and be succsessful. I have followed Bruce in his solo career, and loved Accident at Birth, but Maiden is where it is at. The talent and energy this disc packs is incredible. I have not bought a Maiden CD since SOMEWHERE IN TIME, so if your an old time Maiden fan do yourself a favor and get this CD. Enough is enough of this PANSEY music. It is time for ROCK-N-ROLL to rule once again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet ,another Metal Great disappointment","review":"Man, this is an overrated album if the reviews here are to be believed, there best come on!I was really looking forward, when I bought this CD to be Extraordinary with Bruce & Adrian Smith back, Iron Maiden was back!! Yea finally. Three axe men, man this was going to be a guitar fest?Most of the songs are mid tempo, Boring and long without power.Guitar parts are bland at best with three axe men how can this be?Bruce's solo albums \\"Accident of Birth\\" and \\"Chemical Wedding\\" are better than this album.I never play this album although it does have about three good songs on it.I was disappointed big time with another great metal band putting out a bland album so I give only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chorus Overkill","review":"Brave New World: the upsetting first release of 21st century Maiden which follows the same pattern, track after track, and simply does not rip. As the title of this review implies, the idea was, after having played the chorus a lot, and taking the music slightly elsewhere, to come off strong with another one of those choruses and drag it to the end of the song, which is the case with 99.9% of the record, and this makes the album suffer from too much repetition, and the songs are too dependent simply on the choruses. Most songs on this release are extremely \\"let's sit around in this studio for and hour or two and see what we come up with\\" sort of songs. The songs worth noting are \\"the Wicker Man,\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" I'll take this over Styx's \\"Brave New World,\\" but come on... this was way too contrived!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Maiden?????????","review":"Wow, what a humongous disappointment this was! At first, I was more than excited for this album to come out. Well, after buying it, all I can say is IT WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!! Aside from the opening track, \\"The Wickerman\\", this album sounds more like a Kamelot album than it does a classic Maiden album. If you are looking 4 some good Maiden, buy \\"Number Of The Beast\\", self titled, \\"Killers\\", \\"Piece Of Mind\\", or \\"Powerslave\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful album","review":"This album really sucks. Those songs are horrible. Dickinson just repeats every chorus over and over. In Wicker man, the chorus is \\"your time will come\\"...repeated 4 times in a row, with horrible guitar in the background. Then you actually get a chorus where he says it EIGHT times in a row. \\"Brave new world\\"? Same thing...\\"in a brave new world\\" repeated 4 times is the chorus...and once again, for good measure you get a chorus where he repeats it EIGHT times. \\"We're blood brothers\\"...well take a guess what the chorus consists of. Yup, were blood brothers repeated 4 times. Beyond the painful choruses , the rest of the song is bad as well. Very weak guitars, and not at all catchy or headbanging music. I mean, this album just really sucks. LIsten to the track \\"The Magician\\" by Dickinson or \\"Wasted Years\\", to hear good Maiden."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE MASTERPIECE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT !!!!!","review":"BRAVE NEW WORLD is not the masterpiece people are talking about. IRON MAIDEN released five great studio records: IRON MAIDEN, KILLERS, THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST, PIECE OF MIND and POWERSLAVE. After that, everything they released, however good it might be, was second-rate material. Their great merit was not to sell out to MTV standards, and this fact alone made their fan base to stay loyal even after the horrible albuns they released in the nineties. With BRAVE NEW WORLD, thing were considerably better, but the presence of Janick Gers still in the band assured that some of the weakest parts of the bad albuns are still in the band, i.e. - lousy guitar solos by Janick. And waht about a new \\"idea\\" discovered by the band, that of repeating choruses at least twelve times (in sucession !!) ??!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"thats the first thing that comes to mind when i listen to this album. i love this album. i just cant get enough of it. it is right up there with classics such as powerslave, and number of the beast. every song on this gets 10 out of 10, it is just amazing. dont judge it by the first few listens, i didnt like it at first. however, it will grow on you, and you will love it. enough said, buy this if you just like music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Perfection","review":"I only bought this album, because there weren't any others I really wanted at the moment. I was kinda disappointed by Maidens last 3 albums, and didn't think this album would be much better. I pop in the CD and hear the sweet sound of Dickinson's vocals. I COULD NOT STOP LISTENING To THIS ALBUM. I listened to the entire album and there are no fillers at all. The lyrics are excellent (unlike some other maiden songs) cough \\"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\\" cough. I suppose if I had to choose the best tracks I would choose: \\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"Nomad\\", \\"Navigator\\", \\"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\", and \\"The Wickerman\\" But, all the songs are definatly listenable. Ladies and Gentalmen, his is the album of the year and quite possibly the BEST MAIDEN ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd rocks","review":"I bought this cd right before christmas,I drove to California from Texas with my brother and we listened to this cd over and over again!I was giving my son a truck for Christmas(HE is 17)and the truck had a 4 thousand dollar sterio system in it.When we arrived in California.I was at a relatives house and the truck was ripped off in broad daylight!I got the truck back the next day but the sterio was stolen and also my cd\`s.I was real upset about the whole situation,but the same day I got mytruck back I bought This cd again and rocked out the rest of the week in California.Even my son liked it!I know I didn\`t get into detail about the songs,But if you like smokin heavy metal,Iron Maiden is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"you would think after all this time, that maiden would burn out, no way, with bruce and adrian back into the line-up, Iron Maiden delivers a really power house of an album. this album is worth buying. i was unsure about buying this one, but when i saw them on their BRAVE NEW WORLD tour and they played half the album live, i was sold immedietly. it was like a rebirth of their music. i went out the next day and bought it. this is definently one of the best. you would be stupid not to buy it. rock on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and a half stars","review":"It's absolutely unbelievable that Iron Maiden are still putting out music that's this good more than twenty years after their first album. By now they've more than proven themselves one of the strongest bands in the history of popular music. Instrumentalism is excellent here, and Bruce Dickinson's vocals are still as strong as ever. If you liked metal in the 80s, Brave New World should be in your collection. Iron Maiden has progressed a little over the years, but BNW is completely untarnished with the alternative sound that messed everything up so badly in the nineties. This is the same old Maiden, still kicking [it].Highlights are: The Wicker Man, Brave New World, The Mercenary, Out of the Silent Planet. Every song is good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Comeback","review":"I bought this CD when it first came out.I must say I really liked it.It is great to have the old Maiden sound back."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME GREAT SONGS!!!","review":"BRAVE NEW WORLD got many great songs like THE WICKER MAN, THE GHOST OF NAVIGATOR and OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET...By far the best album since FEAR OF THE DARK, and a well return from Bruce after a fantastic solo career!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return To Form.","review":"After their downfall in the '90s, which wasn't bad at all but Brave New World is quite a bit better than their last 2 albums. Bruce and Adrian are back and it's how an Iron Maiden album should be. It's a solid album and a great comeback. The Blaze Bayley-era wasn't bad but this is their best since Fear Of The Dark. The Wickerman is a great opening track and the whole album's great, now I understand why it's one of their best selling albums to date. Dream Of Mirrors is another powerful song which is in my top 10 Iron Maiden songs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden....They Never Stop","review":"This is a album any Maiden or Metal fan MUST have. Not only does it have some great guitar solos but they mix it up with slow synthesizers and then on to heavy full on Maiden. Dream of Mirrors is a great 10 minute song with slow and fast paced riffs. If your just starting to be a Maiden fan, or just like to get there CD's this is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid latter day Maiden- good album.","review":"This was Bruce Dickinson's reunion album with the band after an 8 year absence. It is the best album since his return. The songs are pretty catchy and the musicianship and production are epic and top-notch. If you enjoy Maiden, you should definitley pick this one up after getting all their 80's albums. Though it does not match the fire, intense melody and inspiration of their 80's classics, Iron Maiden are still putting out solid, quality work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ambitious, but sometimes overlong epic Maiden album.","review":"Brave New World is better than most comeback albums that bands come back with. Metal bands always say \\"we're returning to our roots!\\" or \\"we're going to really push the envelope and go all out with this!\\" Brave New World actually does a little of both. Iron Maiden shoots for a very epic sound while using the classic Maiden techniques. Some of the songs are a little slow at some points, but none are bad. These points are what brings the album down to only four stars. Maiden picked up the pace a bit in the two albums that followed though, especially in A Matter of Life and Death.All in all, this is a great album that belongs in any Iron Maiden fan's collection.Personal song picks:The Wicker ManGhost of the NavigatorThe NomadOut of the Silent Planet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comeback","review":"...if that is what it should be called. This album is great, and it is good to hear Bruce singing again with the band he should be in. Blaze was a great singer, it's just that his singing style didn't belong in Iron maiden(With the exception of the X-Factor). The only \\"bad\\" song I have heard is 'Ghost of the navigator'. I just don't like. Otherwise it's a great album. The line-up is great. Three of the best guitarist ever on the same album. I am glad that they didn't fire Jannick. He belongs in Iron Maiden with his raw style. The Best songs on this CD are without a doubt 'The Wicker man', 'Blood Brothers' and 'Out of the Silent Planet'. This album is not just for Maiden fans that is for sure. My other complaint about this CD is that some of these songs are too long. Like 'Dream of Mirrors', 'The Nomad' and 'The Thin Line Between love and hate'. Now all I have to do, to like the entire album is to listen to 'Chost of the Navigator'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"This C.D was higher than my expectations. In my opinion this album contains Iron Maiden's best line-up to date. With Steve Harris hammering away at the bass, Janick,Dave and on the guitar, Nicko on drums and \\"The Master\\" Bruce Dickinson singing like he was 24 again makes this album near perfect . The highlights are \\"Out of the silent planet\\",\\"Brave New World\\",\\"The Wicker Man\\" and \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\". The chorus's are uplifting, unlike the majority of previous Maiden albums. Although I've been a fan of Maiden for a mere 2 or 3 years, I own nearly all of their albums and I'm only 13 years old. This is Maiden's best album in my opinion. Five and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden: Made in 2000!","review":"Another great piece by the hardest working band in the industry!Just as I used to so look forward to new Maiden albums as a teenager, I can now enjoy the same level of intensity from these masters as an adult. \\"Brave New World\\" is the latest, and one of the best, samples of Iron Maiden's methodical, complex approach to merging hard rock with classical styles and history.Thank goodness Bruce Dickinson is back!If this album is any indication of what their upcoming tour will be like, I will not miss it.UP THE IRONS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up the Irons!","review":"Maiden displays a good mix of their best sounds..from Piece of Mind to Seventh Son. Uniquely, my favorite tracks come later on the CD...(Track 9) Out of the Silent Planet, and (Track 10) Thin Line Between Love and Hate. Great songs! Nothing quite as memorable as the Trooper or Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner, but, this mix of music works! Maiden has always had that tight sound that nobody else can mimmick. The thump of the bass guitar and drums is carried on throughout Brave New World, making the listening experience...very, very enjoyable. Welcome back boys! See you on tour with Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-l-ford!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Maiden is back","review":"Finally got Brave New World today and I must say it's a pleasant surprise. While it's hard to say if this album will hold up to the classic Maiden albums (Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave) over time, it's MUCH better than anything they released after 7th Son. A lot of fans think the downfall of Maiden was when they lost Bruce. I think it was when they lost Adrian Smith. Janick Gers wasn't a good replacement for him - the twin guitar attack of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith is one of the crucial elements to Maiden's sound. And Gers couldn't pull it off. Now that Adrian and Dickinson are back in the band - the classic Maiden sound has been restored. (I wish they'd let Gers go and just get back to the classic line-up.) Skeptics should check this album out - Maiden is back! Looking forward to seeing them in the US - nothing beats a Maiden show. Up The Irons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest album since the 80's","review":"Iron Maiden is back and the most definatly prove that with this album. Good metal, that really grabs you inside the music, if you know what I mean. Maiden fans, you'll love this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars-A few great tunes...","review":"Got this Tuesday. I really like \\"Wicker Man\\", \\"Out of The Silent Planet\\" and \\"Dream of Mirrors\\". The cd as a whole may grow on me in time, but I was hoping for something to rival Bruce Dickinson's last two solo cds, which are more Maiden than Maiden, in terms of powerchords and heaviness, these days. Instead, we have a lot of long, melodic arrangements similar in sound to the two Blaze Bayley discs, right down to Bruce actually phrasing some of the lyrics the way Blaze did. An ok effort, but just not full of heavy Smith/Dickinson tunes or Harris tunes taken from books or film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are these other guys talking about?","review":"Aside from Wickerman, this is not a good album. In fact, it's boring. We've heard all these old tricks and melodies before, only in more creative ways. The production on this album is also horrible. I almost thought it was recorded in mono. The people giving it 4 or 5 stars are probably old, tired durds desparate for Maiden (and therefore them) to relive their glory"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre release from a talented band.","review":"I was so excited when I heard The Wicker Man on the radio. It sounded like the Iron Maiden I loved back in the eighties. Wicker Man is indeed a good song. So are The Mercenary and Dream Of Mirrors. The rest of the album sounds like it was done by the numbers. Slow beginning, hard rocking, slow ending. This trend seems to have begun with the song Fear Of The Dark. It is nice that Bruce and Adrian are back in the band, but I believe that three guitarist is a bit superfluous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"There's not much to be said about this cd that hasn't already been that. The line-up changes and reunition, etc.One first listen, the songs may not strike you. On my first listen I was thinking \\"I hope this grows on me!\\" and it did. After it growing on me, I believe this album is my favorite Iron Maiden album behind the 2 Paul Di'anno cds. It is a close one with \\"Piece of Mind\\", but I think I prefer BNW. The songs have some of the best melodies you can imagine. Most notably on the monster epic \\"Dream of Mirrors\\". Hell, all the songs have incredible melodies, riffs, tempos, time changes, etc. The production on the bass and drums is really amazing, leaving a clear, pounding, feeling. The production of the album entirely is really good. I really like this album, and listen to it quite frequently. It's not one of those-listen to once throw away albums. This is the real deal here. All you can expect from Maiden surely turning out better than you thought. This is Brave New World."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Greatness","review":"When I Purchased this album 2 years ago, I did based on the fact that I love Iron Maiden's past work. I also had heard the song \\"The Wicker Man\\" and I was blown away. When I put this cd in my cd player-I was stunned. The first four tracks of this album are truly amazing. There are some not so good tracks later on, but the cd is still mind-blowing.1.The Wicker Man (4:38) 10/102.Ghost of the Navigator (6:51) 10/103.Brave New World (6:20) 9.5/104.Blood Brothers (7:15) 10/10-on of the best song's I've ever heard.5.The Mercenary (4:43) 7.5/106.Dream of Mirrors (9:22) 8.5/107.The Fallen Angel (4:03) 9/108.The Nomad (9:06) 5/10- the worst on the album-basically a waste of space.9.Out of the Silent Planet (6:27) 9/1010.The Thin Line Between Love And Hate (8:26) 8.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"AAAAA!!![...]SOOO SO GOOD!!![...] MAIDEN IS BACK!!![...]","review":"By the time I was thinking about how the world has ceaced to make that SO D*&( GOOD HEAVY METAL that used to be heard in the 80's from bands like Black Sabbath or Judas Priest(except for a few and VERY good bands like hammerfall), this CD came to my hands and I was absolutely blown up!!![...] It's SOOO GOOD! It's not a copy from any album from their glorius past.. it's a BRAND NEW ALBUM capturing Maiden's powerfull energy that they once had and channeling it through the waves of this BRAVE NEW WORLD!

In my opinion, as long as they have Steve Harris and Dave Murray in the band, they are maiden...anyway on the with the review...Bruce Dickinson reunites with the band in Brave New World and folks what we have here is a reunion album like no other. While other bands may reunite for financial/fame reasons, Maiden's BNW album sounds just like any of their great stuff from the 80's. They're sound is not changed and comprimised like other bands today that reunite. This album is kick a$$ from start to finish. Key cuts include: Blood Brothers, The mercenary, the nomad.If your a new or aged Maiden fan, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic metal is back!","review":"Now THIS is what Iron Maiden is supposed to sound like. For those of you who grew tired of the worn out, ... attempts by Blaze Bailey ..., then you are in for a treat. The return of both Bruce Dickenson and Adrian Smith has Iron Maiden sounding like their 25 again ....Either way, this album is definetly a must for die hard Iron Maiden fans, as well as those who just appreciate classic metal. One thing Maiden has a talent for is they stick to their guns, yet they don't sound repetitive every album. You always know it's them, without saying \\"yeah but that sounds exactly like their last album.\\" I'd give this one 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Maiden Ever","review":"I have been waiting for this cd for a long time, and it was worth the wait.

Forget X-factor, Virtual X, and even Fear of the Dark this is Maiden how it should be. The songs remind me of Seventh Son era alot. The structures and changes are stronger than ever. To quote a friend of mine it is a good day to be Metal. Also the Wicker Man promo has US Tour dates which are for early Augest. This album Kicks it old school."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD I OWN","review":"I started out buying the Rock in Rio dvd, and let me tell you, that rocks so hard, there is no other word to describe Iron Maiden but awesome...every song on Brave New World rocks harder than the last, even though i have to say the Wicker Man is the best out of all...but seriously, get this cd, it's worth every penny, you will NOT be sorry! and while you're at it...pick up your copy of rock in rio on dvd or cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the beast for 21st century","review":"When Iron maiden announced their release date for \\"Brave New World\\", I could not wait.

That is what I really call HEAVY METAL.. A unique style, unique lyrics Given by the best. Although I like Metallica, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, and Malmsteen, they nothing like Iron Maiden.All the 10 songs are great!

This is truly amazing stuff, their best CD in 12 years or possibly ever, every song is incredible. Musically, the band are at their most progressive and the songs have many different variations, not just your typical verse/chorus songs here. For example, track 6 clocks in at 9:21 and never gets boring. For anyone who has never bought an Iron Maiden album before, this is DEFINENTLY the place to start. Great in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eighties Masterpiece","review":"Eighties? Yes, Iron Maiden is back with its full 80's splendor with Brave New World. If you like that era arena rock, you'll be delighted with this new release. Others might find this a little outdated. Bruce Dickinson is back after a very successful solo hiatus, as well as Adrian Smith (my favorite Iron Maiden guitarist I must admit). The maidens play here at full energy and passion that seems to have subsided in their last few releases (although these albums were good as well, don't get me wrong). Every song here is unique and grows on you as you listen to it again and again (and you will want to listen to it again). My current favorites include The Wicker Man, Ghost Of The Navigator (reminds me of Rime Of The Ancient Mariner), Brave New World, The Fallen Angel, The Nomad,... ok ok I just like them all! 'Nuff said, rock on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Maiden is as piercing as ever...","review":"As a die hard fan, it's good to have Bruce and Adrian back. Never slacking, Steve and the boys press onward in yet more intricate melodies and guitar work.I saw them in concert in Portland, Maine earlier this month supporting the Brave New Tour. They may be a bit older and wiser, but they still play just as hard. Their show just as good as always. I've always called Maiden Cerebral Metal; metal for the thinking man due to mythological and literary based lyrics.

This is so far off from their classics (I would say that that would include everything up to Seventh Son). This is so dull and unambitious, that I was totally blown away - the wrong way. Jannick Gers is HORRIBLE. His presence totally ruins the Maiden formula, and his solos sound like $hitty Craig Goldie (Dio)/Reb Beach (Winger) noodling. Nothing, I repeat NOTHING on this album is even close to Maiden standards. If you gave this more than 2 stars, you are incredibly out of touch with what this band was all about. This release sounds like a Queensryche or Dream Theatre album - or dare I say Grim Reaper or Helloween. Putrid is the only way to describe this. Even filler songs from past albums (such as quest for fire or deja vu) are a thousand times better than anything on this disc. Use this disc as a coaster for your beer mug and pop in piece of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometime sit's better not to remain then reroute","review":"Although that title is appropriate more to In Flames' ne album, it still a goog summarizer of what this particular album has to offer.A that would be - nothing. Just an old memory, a shadow of what was used to be one of the best, if not the best bands ever created by mankind - the difiners of heavy metal as an actual genre.They indeed changed the style: simlified melodies that gives you the feeling that this comeback was just ment you to spend your money.

That's the big news. Adrian Smith is back too. But this new cd is perhaps even worse than '98's \\"Virtual XI\\", with not one great song and few inspired performances.

They are back with the old sound but re-invented they sound so new and yet we can recognize the riffs we the fans love so much. They sound so alive and as well so heavy but with a great aproach to progressive music wich is more than excellent. If people thought that Maiden couldn't get any better they prove otherwise this album musically is the richest one and the songs are just perfect each one is a classic IRON MAIDEN IS DEFENETLY THE BEST BAND EVER! I feel so proud of being their fan for such a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden finds themselves again-sort of","review":"Yes, this CD has some rocking songs and is better than any album since \\"seventh son\\". I particularly like the Harris/Smith songs. I wish the hole album were written by them, although Murry is good too. Right away, I loved The Mercenary, The Nomad and of course Wickerman. However, the band needs to get rid of Gers! His solos are terrible, but the're not enough to ruin the album as a hole- it does grow on you. Bruce sings strong again and isn't as rough as on Fear of the Dark. Overall, the band has recaptured some of the glory days but three guitarists is a crowd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back !","review":"Fantastic. A must have for very maidn fan. The Nomad is one of the best IRON MAIDEN songs ever. A new classic. If you lik'em, don't exitate. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up The Irons!","review":"Just when you thought it was safe to tuck you children into bed? Up pops Eddie! through our bedroom window. Finally! Bruce has returned! to claim his throne as Maiden's lead throat. I am not going to plaster you with this and that's but what I will say is that this is a well writen, Well played Maiden Disc made in the past 10 years. Bruce's Vocals are clear and full of range as better then before, And can Nikko play drums! And never leave out the three axe slash line up and no I am not forgetting one of the best bass players ever! to grace the studio and stage Steve Harris. The Wicker Man is a start to a great beginning, Brave New World still shows the change range at a given time and one of my Favs. Dream Of Mirrors. What you get here not Just a slam in face re-awaking of a Metal band? You get the when you back is turn the master strikes off your Head. Brave New World. Welcome back Iron Maiden."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killers are Back","review":"Killer to hear new Maiden. It's been a while. This album completely rocks. It is true Maiden at a highten maturity levell. I'm a thirty year old metal fan from Tampa. When I was a kid we used to jam to local garage bands like Nasty Savage and Savatage. Watching Groups like Maiden and Metallica grow and go through all the changes good long running bands do is awesome. This album is all there. Classic Maiden with obvious years of experince behind them. I don't think this one was forced by contract, from start to finish it's well composed and everything fits true Maiden form. The only thing missing is the cover art. It's good to see Eddie again, but he looks alot better on my \\"Aces High\\" picture disk. If any Maiden fans out there have a copy of Purgitory, I'm a player. Buy this cd, put all knobs to the right and be ready to have Eddie knock your living room down, pick you up and fly around the world like Number of the Beast did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Maiden Rises like a Phoenix","review":"This is a great album, When I first heard \\"The Wicker Man\\" I couldn't wait to get my hands on this piece. Especially since they didn't fire Janick Gers, who is in my opinion the missing link in Iron Maiden. They just Needed Bruce and Adrian again. Like on their previos albums the only problem which I could detect was the lenght of some of the songs. Like Dream of Mirrors(Two minutes could be cut of), The Nomad(THree minutes chop off) and Thin Line beetween Love and Hate(3 Minutes could also be cut off). The best songs on this album are without a doubt The Wicker man, Blood Brothers, Dream of Mirrors(Despit the lenght) and Out of the silent planet. Now I'm waiting for the Maiden re-union. When Smpson, Burr and McBrain all play the drums. Di'Anno, Bayley and Bruce sing side by side and Stratton, Smith, Murray and Gers play together. Now that wold be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Maiden \\"Brave New World\\"","review":"This is one hell of an album. The year 2000 and Iron Maiden is still rocking strong. This album is nothing short of heavy hitting and some of the songs will get you pumped. 2 of my favorite songs on the album are \\"The Wicker Man\\" and \\"Ghost Of the Navigator\\". It's over all an awesome album and definetly worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of The Beast","review":"Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith are back. Maiden rules again!!! BNW is not the best album forever, but it is good. Ghost Of The Navigator, Brave New World, Blood Brother, Dream Of Mirrors... Maiden, I will love you forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better from Bruce and Adrian...","review":"It never seemed to me that Iron Maiden were repeating themselves until Bruce left and Blaze got in. There's not a single original riff or melody on the albums that he sang on, and when Maiden anounced that Bruce and Adrian were back, I was hoping that their creativity would come back with them. I was wrong. Altough \\"Brave New World\\" is way better than \\"The X Factor\\" and \\"Virtual XI\\", there is nothing new or exciting about it. The songs are just boring and lack lots of imagination. Bruce and Adrian seem to be playing only for the paycheck, and even the songs they wrote (wich are few) sound dated and uninspired. I guess that I better stick to the old albums or the Dickinson solo stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"no pebozo you yo-yo","review":"this is way too repetitive...songs kind of sound the same...lacks in the composition department...pebozo claims this band influenced the likes of Fates Warning...b.s. pebozo; Fates was influenced by the true masters of progressive rock...Rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another boring CD","review":"another boring maiden CD, but the stefords will claim it to be one of their very best.

If you think 'load' from metallica is bad listen to this and you will change yor mind. At least metallica has gotten better since then. If you like britney spears and the backstreet boys, you miight like this album.Don't worry pantera or metallica, this isn't much of a threat.

I had never heard Maiden before but always wanted to. I looked through some cds at a store and saw this cover. I that it look pretty wicked and picked it up. This album was a life changing album for me. My perspective on music totally changed. My focus as a muscisian and a songwriter changed. These guys are now my favorite band by far and its all because I decided to buy this album. If there is some other kid out there who is like I was then, I hope they pick this up because it may do the same for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Maiden album ever!","review":"This is definetly the best maiden album that there has ever been, it is consitently brilliant from start to finish. For me the stand out tracks are \\"blood brothers\\" \\"dream of mirrors\\" and \\"the nomad\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Maiden Album of All Time","review":"Like most people, I was turned off by Blaze-era Maiden, and I was very disapointed with their last four studio efforts.But Brave New World is just that, an incredible journey through both classic Maiden nostalgia and modern sound. The album's 1st single, the Wicker Man, is energetic with the classic Maiden sound, but the marathon songs Blood Brothers and Out of the Silent Planet both have a new, modern feeling to them. But then The Nomad could easily have fit into Piece of Mind or Powerslave era without anyone blinking an eye.Maiden has both matured and improved their musical ability. The three guitars works nicely, and the only song that sounds cluttered is The Mercenary. But even that song is good. Unlike their last 4 albums, there isn't a SINGLE throw-away or filler song. I'm utterly amazed. If you're a lapsed Maiden fan, then it's time to check them out again. I definitly recommend this. If I could, I'd give it 6 stars.This is their best album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album from Irons","review":"Hey This ia a damn good album maybe not the greatest in the band's mighty arsenal but it's right up there with some of the best , anyway The top three tunes on this one are \\"Wickerman\\" , \\"Ghost of Navaigators\\" which makes a great 1-2 punch to open the album and then \\"Dream of Mirrors\\" another awesome track it's long but holds you're intrest all the way through especially the chorus . In short any hard rock/metal fan should pick this up , even if you aren't that familar with Maiden ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is definately one of my favorite Maiden CDs, every song is amazing and the lyrics are some of the best Iron Maiden has ever written. The only song I dont like on the CD is The Nomad, but that is made up for by songs like \\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"Brave New World\\", and \\"Dream of mirrors\\". This is arguably their best album and for very good reason. I couldnt take it out of my CD player for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Iron Maiden album since Powerslave!","review":"I got this Cd a while ago and at first I didn't think it was all that great but now it is one of my favorites. It's right up there with Number of the beast, at least in my opinion. The songs have a rousing power metal feel to them at times but that is all the better for me because I like bands like Blind Guardian and Helloween. All of the songs are great and worth listening to at least once. Don't become impatient with the songs that start slow like Dream of mirrors. Give them a chance and they will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of five best metal albums ever! Bravo!","review":"It is a wonderful and schocking comeback! Nobody would have expected to listen to such a great IM music again! The troopers in complete formation did it again! Together with Hammerfall's \\"Glory to the Brave\\", Nocturnal Rites \\"Sacred Talisman\\", Rhapsosy's \\"Legendary Tales\\" or Gamma Ray's \\"Somewhere out of space\\", this album maintains our hope that true heavy metal will never die, despite conter-attacks from non-value bands like Limp Biskit or similar!

The first 45 pages discuss how to build log cabin furniture and simple brush camp and lean-to structures. Pages 46-47 introduce the more extensive cabins. You'll find structures measuring 12 x 16 feet to chalets that function as inns for many weary travelers. Drawings are pen and ink and show mostly exteriors. The interior drawings that are shown are interesting, showing fireplaces, stairways, furniture, and beamed ceilings. If you love adirondack style cabins/cottages this book will help to feed your imagination. If you were hoping to look at floor plans... get out your magnifying glass. Most of the floor plans are no more than 2 inches square. I still love this little book and refer back to it all the time. It would be a nice addition to your collection of log cabin books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Scanning","review":"We were excited to read this book and get to know the more rustic ideas of log cabin design and construction. We had no idea that the copy we would receive is hardly legible. I understand that this book was scanned from the original 1920 work but I would think that the scanning would not have chopped the ends off most of the sentences. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enchanting Piece of Scholarship","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Thorough, evocative, thrilling, and comprehensive in its scope, it was a delight from beginning to end.I completed a major in Geography at Illinois State University many years ago, where Powell taught at one time, and I am embarrassed to admit the sad truth that in all the courses I took nary a word was ever mentioned about the great man. Considering his extraordinary contribution to our understanding of the natural world, it is all too sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"History lover's special","review":"A detailed look at one of our unsung military heros that pursued his passion.

It's not preachy, doesn't profess to offer answers. Rather, it offers a direct way into what some consider a difficult, even unattainable practice. Mindfulness is a miracle, Thich Nhat Hanh says and to be present to what is actually happening -- pleasant or unpleasant -- is a great accomplisment. To be present for another person is a great gift. It's what our partners, children and friends really want -- our true presence. Here's a guide about how to get here.So, in this book, there is a path laid out, with infinite variations possible, for bringing more mindfulness into the lives of individuals, families and communities. Goodness knows we need guides like this in these times of fear, violence and uncertainty. They steady us on the path and allow us to discover our connections with all beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt hear from him and now I have two books!!!","review":"It took forever to receive it and would not respond to emails.

The ball can actually help you stretch and support your body. Very good DVD. The instructor is very clear on her instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"i love sarah ivanhoe as an instructor. This is a great workout video. She gives poses in full and in modifications that you can do depending on your skill level. There are some great stretches on here, a shoulder stretch in particular, and warrior pose is challenging but fun and blown palm is challenging for your balance. She is very down to earth and you can connect to her well. i have seen good results, trimming down and more toned with this video used on a daily basis and it does not get old. I am not in bad or good shape. i am somewhere in the middle and i found this video was fun and challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so difficult....","review":"I bought this looking for uses for my recently purchased ball, and while I enjoyed the video, it is not nearly as difficult as previous reviews made it sound.

I got the stability ball to improve my horseback riding, and the Yoga has really helped my balance and flexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"balance ball yoga","review":"I love this CD. I have a deteriorating disc and purchased this CD to help with back pain and balance. At first there were asanas I had trouble with being stiff and painful, but I practice everyday and have become flexible and pain free over the last few weeks. This is a great CD for those in pain who want to start getting back in shape and be pain free again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are not fit - this is THE way to get started in yoga","review":"If you, like me, are overweight and not very fit, but very interested in doing yoga well, this is the video for you. The use of the stability ball allows those of us who are less like gumby and more like bluto to acheive the harder positions and stretch without killing ourselves. If you are a larger person, some of the traditional yoga positions put enormous pressure on your joints and extremities, but using the ball allows the weight to be more evenly distributed and makes it much more comfortable and pleasant to perform the routine. Sara Ivanhoe is knowledgeable, very personable and a pleasure to spend time with. The workout is somewhat challenging, but is well paced and gives you ample time to achieve each pose. I cannot say enough good things about this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful yoga ball workout","review":"This workout is super...the concept of using a balance ball to do yoga poses is great. I love my ball workouts, but most of them are pilates-based and not very relaxing. Sara is a great instructor. I have enjoyed her Candlelight Yoga dvd for a long time and was glad to see her as the instructor of this practice.

She found them while browsing children's shoes online. They're cute online, but they are even cuter in person. They fit my daughter well and just look so comfortable. The brown goes with most of her outfits and the cutouts give it such a sweet, delicate look. She was wearing them when she first learned to walk at almost 11 months old and these easily gave her the support she needed. I get comments from people all of the time when she has them on about how precious they are. People are always asking me where they can buy a pair.

Supposedly, barefoot is best for little ones, and these shoes are pretty close. The soft soles are very durable. My little one loves to walk indoors and out and these shoes show very little wear. They are cut wide, so pudgy feet will get a nice comfortable fit. I would recommend these shoes to everyone. They are worth every penny.

Itwas not worth the dollar -- a candy-bar would be a better use ofone's money. I liked Feist and Wurts's Empire series, but obviously Feist cannot write without help. First, the book is filled with cliches that make you cringe and hope that he is just joking, that he really does not mean to write this rip-off of Tolkien. Second, the plot is confused, badly developed, and hard to follow. The characters are walking stereotypes, I wished I could kill them all off by page 2. Feist is a rampant sexist, he obviously does not take women seriously; his female characters are even worse than the males (if that is possible). Finally, the book is just boring. On a plane, if a very bad movie is shown in a language you cannot understand, the Feist's book may provide some distraction. On a bus or train -- looking out of the window will be much more entertaining and fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the loser has NIL points !","review":"Am I glad that I did not buy the book, but a colleague of mine. As much as loved Feist's Midkemia Saga as a computer game, the more disappointed I am after having tried to finish reading the Saga.In the German language we have one word for it: Schmalz, schmalz and more schmalz.

They travel together with Macros the Black, the greatest magician alive and atempt to beat back the powerful entity known as 'The Enemy'.

I read all the books of this saga without getting bored. However, it is a kind of mixed soup, you have a middle-earth kind world with magic and magicians, there is also alien invasion, also gods, a part of the book is on the outerspace, there is time travel...To me the writer mixed it all different fantasy elements, so everybody can find a piece they like. Not my favorite"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME,JUST NOT AS GOOD AS MAGICIAN","review":"If I ever really enjoyed any of Feist's works, I really enjoyed this amazing masterpiece. I don't think it should even be compared to Tolkien like so many others have done. This is an excellent book with wit and humor(I thought it was the funniest in the series). Of course, it can't surpass the two Magician books, they're simply the best. Oh yeah, I just want to say something, women readers might find Feist's female characters disgusting, but I'm a guy so I really didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, simply Amazing","review":"Feist concludes the Riftwar Saga here. High Fantasy gains a new advocate as Pug and Tomas begin a journey to save their world from an Enemy beyond their reckoning. Along the way, many pieces of the previous three books fall into place, and the puzzle picture they create is genius.Not to be forgotten, the \\"mere mortals\\" lead by Prince Arutha combat the Enemy's forces, gaining allies they didn't even know existed, and gaining common ground with a foe they thought long gone. Together they wage a gripping defense against an insurmountable foe.In the end, Feist follows the age-old philosohy \\"Leave 'em wanting more.\\" I closed the cover on Darkness at Sethanon glad that he has written many more novels since.If you have not read the entire Riftwar Saga, you are missing out on an unforgetable experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it","review":"I did not like it. That is all I need to say. I had read \\"Magician\\" years ago ,and I had worshipped it at the time, but after reading Robert Jordan, and Terry Brooks and countless other fantasy writers , this book was just a bore. The writer has just made a mistake common to amateurs, the good people are very brave, courageous and have great leaders, while the bad ones are just like chickens waiting to be deceived, and killed, and the only advantage they have is the numbers. I think to write more realistic he has to be objective"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing end to an otherwise great series.","review":"It starts off great but comes to a predictable ending.

It is crazy, it is loud, it is quiet, it is everything you would want from a cd. Kerman uses amongst more traditional instruments like guitar, drums and bass, crazy things like a doorbell and a toypiano. It sometimes reminds me of Zorn, but above all it is a typical Cuneiform-cd.

Dee Lambert"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"This is a very good workout however I wish the description would have included a list of items you need to get started and use throughout the workout. They were small items such as a towel and pair of weights but it would have been nice to know before I hit play on the DVD! Overall a good workout and I look forward to seeing what my results look like on day 21."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good combo of Stretch and Strength","review":"For the past few months I've been using \\"10 Minute Solutions Pilates\\" for a stretch and strengthen day on my 1/2 marathon training plan and was really dissatisfied with it (minimal results in flexibility and strength). I ended up getting this DVD to replace it. I did it for the first time yesterday and liked how Denise used a lot of stretches in each segment (this workout comes after my long run the day before, so it's really nice to get all of those muscles stretched out). I felt like it helped to realign my body and release some of the tension. As far as the exercises went, I was initially a little disappointed in the arms and abs portions (lower body was good). I just didn't feel the muscles working, but, today my body tells me different. Everything is sore (and keep in mind this is after doing \\"10 Minute Solutions Pilates\\" for about 6 months). This DVD seems promising to me. It's always good when something isn't complicated, but produces results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Simple workout for all the trouble areas of a woman's body. No equipment required. You can feel the results the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice change","review":"I bought this dvd because I have been using Jillian Michaels dvds and feel I am bulking up instead of stretching out. I had Denise Austins pilates and yoga videos when my children were younger and I kept tone and the weight off. Now I feel as if I can't lose weight and I am bulky. I have always enjoyed Denise's approach, and feel Jillian is a brute with boobs. Yes, her videos shape and define, but I like a lean, tone look and feel Denise's pilates gives me that. I think you can get the benefit depending on what you put into it---tighten your muscules, push yourself more into the pose. I definitely don't think this is targeted toward a beginner, although it would be a great video to challenge you. I consider myself to be in good shape, and feel the different muscles moving with both this dvd and her yoga dvd. I am frustrated with Jillian and although see results in muscle tone, I do not see it in becoming more lean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good and Effective","review":"This workout is definitely more low-key than Austin's other productions. I have her Hit the Spot Pilates DVD and it provides a heavier, more Pilates-based workout than this one; however, both are very effective.If you are desiring more crunches and ab-focused exercises, go with Hit the Spot Pilates. If you want an easier Pilates workout, I'd highly recommend this one.Either way, Denise Austin is the way to go. I have tried other Pilates workouts from various instructors and they do not provide the same post-exercise-good-feeling like Austin does. She knows her stuff!Side note: For this DVD, you will need a towel and light weights for the exercises. For her other Pilates DVD, no props are necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The ab portion of this workout is a joke. Let me first say that I am in good shape. Working out for years. Yoga for 5 years. Pilates on and off for 2 years. Maybe I need something way more advanced. The leg and arm potion of this is pretty ok. The ab section is a JOKE. Way too easy. Even a beginner would laugh at the ab section. If she performed more reps than this would be much better, maybe even effective. In fact I actually like the ab exercises, but she does like 5 reps so you feel nothing. Also she does not give any direction so ....you may want to view it first or be familar with pilates before you begin. If you want a good ab workout do anything by Cindy Whitmarsh. She is the best trainer I have seen so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"I used this workout twice and it was too easy. I did not feel like I was getting a workout. I thought Denise Austine was too perky, fake, and annoying. I gave the DVD away.

Brin masterfully crafts a stunning work of fiction which intertwines the serious themes of humanity, socio-racial interrelations and genetic engineering into a heartwarming saga of friendship and survival. The authors investment in the story is quite evident. The character development is superb, allowing the reader to become utterly immersed in the far-future universe of space travel. My only qualm with the story was its slow liftoff. The action was rather flat up until 1/3rd of the way in while the last quarter of the book was packed to the gills with non-stop suspense. A little less on the front end would've been preferable, especially for those who are not avid SciFi readers. Notwithstanding, its an outstanding story and a worthy read. \\"A\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Dolphin starship captains are the coolest.An interspecies earth spaceship, humans, dolphins, and a chimp, make a pretty important discovery that your secretive alien types don't want the young upstart race to know about.

A book where nothing interesting happens, with uninteresting characters, and best of all, a resolution that is supposedly galaxy shattering but we cannot explain why because human language cannot convey its importance (this is actually in the book folks).I gave the series a chance with 'Sundiver' and found it below average. I gave it a second chance with 'Startide' and it was mediocre. I am done wasting my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Brin gives you high adventure and a good time.","review":"It's always a pleasure to find a new author who writes well. Startide Rising will take you into galaxy of intrigue and danger. A place where humans are considered backward and in need of a protector species to uplift them into galactic society. A lot of species think 100,000 years of servitude would have been a fair price to uplift the humans. But the human aren't cooperating. They have uplifted themselves (very rare) and uplifted two other species besides (unheard of).

I read it because it also won the Hugo and Nebula awards. It is over 400 pages and the first two or three hundred are boring. Brin opens a number of threads but in those 400+ pages, he only manages to resolve one or two of them. The revelation about the agressive dolphin was good but other than that, the rest of the book felt like a waste of time. Very disappointing after reading all the glowing \\"10\\" reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the best, then you haven't read much.","review":"I'll admit, David Brin is a talented writer, but this book is far from genius. He writes about a thousand different storylines, and then ends every single one with a perfectly happy ending. I won't give away the book, but trust me, everything works out perfectly. It's cheesier than a Brady Bunch episode. The ending was an incredible LETDOWN. Aside from being shallow, the science behind the book was bad. Any linguist will tell you that the explanations about communication were weak. You can't make the dolphin species talk, and then not explain it. This book really has some low points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, Dolphin Rubbish","review":"Yuk.In this series, the author includes dolphins as some of the main characters.They wear harnesses with various contraptions attached in order to interact with their environment and they have been genetically improved so they can communicate with their human shipmates.If you can swallow that you may like this series.

Everything in this book _works_. The idea is intriguing, the characters are engaging, and Brin's treatment of the aliens is convincing. My favorite aspects of this book are the poetic language and thought of the neo-dolphins, and the way in which Brin makes you sympathize with even the \\"bad guys\\" in the book. A must read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but not my cup of tea","review":"I bought this book on impulse and because it has generally good reviews but I had to put it down after only getting about a quarter of the way through.

Why did it take so long! It could have been done in half that many pages! And then the resolution was way too short! I would have loved to see what happened beyond Mr. Brin's ending. He should have taken those 150 pages he didn't need for setup and used them to expand the resolution. For pages and pages, I was like, \\"Ugh, enough with the dolphin-speak and the reiteration that there's something strange about the planet! Get on with the story!\\" It was so frustrating.Now I'm wary of picking up the next book in the series, The Uplift War. If it's as slow as this one, I'm not looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"The story may be considered strong, but there is one truly annoying element: most of the characters are DOLPHINS. DOLPHINS speak English, travel in and command starships, and seem to be superior to humans. This is the kind of novel that influences many to pass off sci-fi as a joke. I couldn't make it through 50 pages before I stopped in disgust. The fact that the novel won the hugo and nebula is rediculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saga excellent","review":"I purchased the first three books of the trilogy and have completed reading STARTIDE RISING ( #2 ) .

The heroine, Juliet Winterton, despite the fact that she is supposed to be quite sensible, kind, etc., does many illogical things (like imagining she can pretend to be the viscount's wife, go about in the village *as* his wife, and not in doing so force him into marrying her) and many unkind things (constantly speaking to the viscount as though he were some shady character trying to take advantage of her when she's the one trespassing on his good will, and deceiving most everyone).I liked the viscount, but I found it very unlikely he would put up with Juliet's shenanigans.If I hadn't so disliked Juliet, the book might have been pretty good, but there you go. She irritated me beyond belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming heroine, hero, my favorite my E. Hendrickson","review":"The premise of this book---that a young woman fleeing from home happens upon a small country home with an absent Lord and then pretends to be the new wife of the Lord, a man who has never ever been to that particular location due to his preference for London---is very far fetched.

This novel is mediocre at best, and tedious at its worst. The plot device of the masquerading spouse had been deftly executed myriad times in a number of Regencies, but not in this instance.The protagonist its not an ingenue, she is an imbecile. Her character, and that of her slightly less idiotic false partner, suggests that the author has an inferior understanding of either the prevailing social strictures of the period or of the necessity of having a credible storyline. Either way, the plot unfolds in such a way that one should only continue reading if one wishes to test the bounds of incredulity.The fact that a novel is fictional should not necessarily require the reader to suspend disbelief.

That's right, the folks from Superstars of the Yesteryear took what was a classic and edited down to less than ten minutes.

There must be a point somewhere in this book, but I gave up before I found it. If you are interested in a collection of random thoughts that make little sense, a 'framework' for asking questions that by the time you get through it the only question you ask is 'how much did I pay for this?', then this is for you. Each 'phase' of the approach (4 of them) is ~50 pages that are written like the SOPs for GE in 1949 - way too many words, too many bullets, statements so obvious that you can't even believe they are in print. You thought asking questions was simple, huh? Think again - it can be so overly complicated you don't have a clue what a question is when you are finished. Overall, this is a total waste of trees and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had one for years - bought one for my daughter","review":"We decided our daughter was finally old (and sensible) enough for her own pocket knife. As a long time user, it had to be Victorinox. There are huge numbers of Swiss Army Knife variants, so I went to the Victorinox web site and used their tool for choosing a knife. After specifying the blades I thought my daughter would most appreciate, the site recommended the Mountaineer knife.It turns out this is the same knife I've had for 15 years. Who'd have thought our disparate interests would be best met by the same knife, but so it goes. Anyway, I can testify to the knife's build quality - everything still works and nothing's fallen off or broken after 15 years sharing a pocket with my keys. The blades are still sharp and shiny. They open and close firmly - nothing's loosened.If you want a pocket knife, get a Victorinox, but use the tool to choose the best knife for your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly melodic, uplifting trance from the heart....!","review":"This is the fifth and final single of Ian Van Dahl from their debut, release \\"ACE\\".

After raised the outside legs to make it level, the height to floor was extreme and I couldn't touch it with my feet (I'm 5'5\\".) We were able to pry out the inside adjusters and cut off ~3 inches of the round plastic legs with the chop saw.

I am a fan of both Douglas Adams and Monty Python (here represented by Terry Jone). Unfortunately, the book which is based on a forthcoming CD-ROM game, reads like a CD-ROM game set to text. It lacks the inventiveness of a full-fledged novel (humorous or otherwise). I didn't give the book a 1 because there were a few funny, inventive moments widely scattered in the text. Wasted money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing. More like a hint book for the adventure.","review":"I couldn't help thinking all the way through reading this that it was \\"a novel of the adventure game\\". There's so manys parts where it's blatently obvious. People being unable to get through doors before various tasks are accomplished, needing to find various objects, etc.There's a load of sex and swearing throughout, but that doesn't disguise it's paper thin storyline and characters (see also \\"The Illuminatus Trilogy\\").All in all a real dissapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"I played the computer game, I got the book. I loved the game, I destested the book. It was ridiculous. Absolutely nothing happened, and it in no way resembled the game. For example, the main idea of the game was to find the parts to a cyborg's face and brain. They did mention this in the book, but it took up about a paragraph. The book shouldn't even have the same title as the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"possibly the worst novel ever written","review":"The plot has promise, but the execution is incompetent, and the (attempts at) humor infantile.

Why? Why? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that should have undergone SMEF itself.","review":"The worst thing that Douglas Adams could ever have done was to allow someone to write his book for him. Starship Titanic showed great promise, based as it was upon Adams' ideas. Had it been written by him, it would have contained his exquisite use of the English language, his humour, and would have had far more relevance to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy. Instead, it was entrusted to someone who evidently had no interest in producing a memorable piece of work. The humour, as has been said, is infantile. And yet the book cannot even be said to be aimed at children, owing to the often somewhat risque subject matter. I have not as yet seen the game, which I am sure is a far superior product to Jones' novel (as I must laughingly describe it). The characters are pale and, paradoxically, have no character. The plot, under the author's oafish pen, is quickly ruined and rendered inelegant. An extremely disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Attempt to Market Douglas Adams's Name","review":"If Douglas Adams were dead, he'd be spinning in his grave. This book, billed as a 'Douglas Adams' novel, is really just a very cheap attempt by Terry Jones (a very funny man) to write a book in the Adams style. It does not come off very well -- in fact, it reads rather like a piece of low quality high school fiction. The book is based on a stragegy game by the same name which was designed by Douglas Adams -- the book appears to be an afterthought inspired by the game. So, if you're looking for some new material from Douglas Adams, get the game, or go back and re-read some of the classic Hitchhikers or Dirk Gently novels. You won't find anything of that calibre here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm saddened by this publication","review":"I guess I should blame it on Douglas Adams for having the idea in the idea in the first place, but I CAN'T! He's my favorite author! I'm still having trouble dealing with the fact that he produced this.Still, I could blame Terry Jones for writing the stupid thing, but I CAN'T! Monty Python was the greatest comedy troupe ever! I could always count on him to give a funny one-liner or to do that great screaming woman voice. I'm having trouble dealing with the fact that he wrote this. All those sex jokes in the second half, give me a break! It gets old quick.I only gave this 2 stars because, even through its faults, ther are a few funny scenes involving robots."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Titanic sinks again","review":"I read this book on a nine hour flight. The reason it took so long was the fact that I actually would sit stunned that men who have made me laugh hard enough to hurt could have writen this drivel.

I read it in one day, but I really don't think that it mattered that I read it at all. I enjoyed it, but I am not sure that I really am glad that I read it. It is based on a video game and I just didn't understand much of the action (mostly sex and arguing about free upgrades). I would recommend this book only to Adams or Python fans. First timers shoould read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite amusing and satisfactory, while not pure DNA","review":"Though it lacks the intricacy that is the signature of Adams, I find this a refreshing take on the video game's plot, and grant that its want for subplots is the cost of bearing the same name. Overall, a pleasing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"This is one, if not THE, worst book that I've ever read. If you're interested in the plot, go play the computer game instead of reading this book. Douglas Adams actually worked on the game, for one thing. It's like Myst meets Hitchhiker's Guide. It's fun, amusing, and it's got puzzles. The book, which he didn't have much of a hand in, is horrible. Really, trulely horrible. It's no wonder the game didn't sell all that well if this is what people read. This book is random, pointless, and not at all funny. I chucked it shortly after I got it. Of course, that meant I had to find some poor being to pawn it off on, so I donated it to a library instead. I actually feel sort of guilty about that, since it really was that horrible. What if *gasp* someone actually tries to read it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starship Titanic is a good book.","review":"Starship Titanic is a good book, but not compared to the books by Douglas Adams.

You have to give him that. His one-liners may be great, but he fails to emulate Douglas Adams in furnishing that essential interconnectedness of the Hitchhiker's trilogy, with plots, sub-plots, sub-sub-plots, ad nauseam, all explained and part of a fine, funny fabric. This is a take-off on the Titanic and unfortunately for Jones, this will also sink without a trace, and no, no mega-million blockbuster will be filmed of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"frantic and dull at the same time","review":"Reads more like a description of a movie - lots of action, plenty of screaming and running in circles, plus sex. Disappointing, considering the talents of the authors. No plot to speak of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sinking!","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed the Hitchhiker series, I found this story most lacking in the wild lurches of plot that sustained the humor of Adams' other series.

I will try the interactive game, and I hope it's better than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This book is just horrible. I can't see a grade schooler turning this in and getting more than a C-. The attempts at humour fail miserably. The plot (and there is only one, and you can hardly call it a plot) is entirely uninteresting. This also bears no resemblance to Douglas Adams' writing, nor does it even give you any insight into the Hitchhiker's universe. I'm embarrassed to even own this book. I'm surprised Douglas Adams agreed to let his name be put on the book. Read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The game is awesome!","review":"I think you guys haven't been with the game enough. When you play it, it really puzzles you. But you can just play around with the Bots. You guys probably haven't read the magazine. Most of the answers are in there. Not to mention that each sentence, ad and announcement is funny. You really need to use each of the senses. The Music room and Bomb and Titanic Tittalator are really easy if you use your common sense, do stuff the most practical way, and realize that the Succ-U-Bus doesn't like sauces.This is the best video game I've seen.

Only buy this at discount or better buy used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a disappointment.","review":"I'm so bummed. I thought that this would be a really great book, well within the spirit and method of Douglas Adams. What a crushing disappointment. The dialog is wooden, the characters shallow, hopeless caricatures of themselves, there's no motivation for their actions, and the writing reads like a parody of Douglas Adams. I'm only halfway through, and I don't find the book engaging, interesting, or even vaguely engaging. I must admit that I've read nothing by Terry Jones in the past, but I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams, and have read all of his books several times. For those that might be interesting in purchasing this, I discourage you from doing so. It is, in my mind, the only flaw in the writings of Douglas Adams. Although he did not write it, he certainly had a hand in it. I'm left wondering: What was he thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Douglas Adams fans should keep away from this book","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. How Douglas Adams could allow this crap to be published under his name completely puzzles me. I'm really disappointed that Adams lets his fans pay good money for such lousy reading.The plot is non-existing, the characters are flat and uninteresting and the whole thing is meaningless. It's a pity, because I really looked forward to this book and have enjoyed Adams's other work immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A commercial for the computer game","review":"This book was written entirely to promote and support the computer game Starship Titanic. This is not a true Douglas Adams book, and he should be embarrassed to have lent his name to such a blatantly commercial product.

Some cookie cookbooks are just a collection of a bunch of similar recipes. This book has many recipes for all sorts of different kinds of cookies. This book features pecan balls, shortbread, mascarpone creams, brown sugar balls, and so much more. The book gives in dept instructions on decorating.

That is why I put four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I found the doughs to be difficult to work with (they were very dry and crumbly, hard to roll out, etc...) and I took extra care to follow the recipe exactly. When it comes to holiday cookie making, I like it to be simple and straight forward. I do not want to start adjusting recipe's as I only do this once a year, so for me this book did not work.I was also disappointed in the photo's. You never really got a clear look at what the cookie should look like, as they tended to blur the photo slightly (nice effect, but not in a cookbook!). They also did not always tell you how to decorate the cookie like it appeared in the picture (snowman cookies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Dough!

I would suggest getting Robeez shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vickers' fan finds this cd a great disappointment","review":"In my enthusiasm to own what I seriously hoped would be a collection of Jon Vickers' recorded successes, this turned out to be an extended interview, by a commentator who obviously knew his stuff and a singer who knew only his stuff. The interviews thus are far too long, and the musical selections far too short, to be of serious interest to almost anyone. One can learn almost as much from a quick read of the cd liner notes, as from the interviews, which shows how very superficial Mr. Vickers can be, even on his own turf. Amazon commits an error of its own, by failing to emphasize the preponderance of the interview time. While statements are made in the disc contents section of the product features page, this is too little, too late. I am giving my copy to my local library, in the hope that they can put it into circulation and someone will get some use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, but....","review":"This interview/recording clip collection is absolutely fascinating. Many interesting anecdotes and insights are provided by the interviewer and especially by Mr. Vickers. The recording clips are tantalizing and exquisite, but in some instances frustratingly short!

Rangers sometimes have to act as firemen, paramedics, police officers, etc. I thought the book was very interesting and I learned alot about park rangers and how the Parks system operates that I never knew.

If there is dust on the screen before you apply it, it will create an air bubble where the dust particle is and if you don't take great care putting it on, an air bubble will be present (just like when you apply a bumper sticker or window sticker to your car). I messed up the first time I tried this and it sucked to play it with air bubbles but, when I applied it the second time and took great care doing it, it looks fine, with no air bubbles AND I have been using the same one for about 8 or 9 months. Once it is applied correctly (with no air bubbles), I see no reason why I should ever have to change it out. I would recommend these to anyone who has a PSP.

Although sound and picture quality are not up to today's standard (who's surprised?) I dare call it a gem. And besides, it's the only SONNAMBULA on DVD todate. Moffo's singing is absolutely delightful and the camera loves her. Of the supporting cast I'd like to particularly mention tenor Danilo Vega and bass Plinio Clabassi. Both fine and very able singers. Bruno Bartoletti is the conductor and, among others, should be remembered for many years of excellent work at Chicago's Lyric Opera.

We look for clarity, dolby style sound, with the quality being the center piece.I like to watch operas in my house because, although I do not have the excitment of the direct view, the sound and video are excellent. I made quite an investment into the sound and video systems that I work with. The DVD in question, does not provide the today's exigence for neither the sound or for the image. It is deplorable to watch, and it kills the beautiful Bellini's music.It is only for the collector of music history, or for the ones that would like to have the material proof of the evolution of the recordings and their quality, during different stages of electronic discoveries, in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it!","review":"We got this toy for our 6 mo old son along with the little cookie monster.

When it was listed as in \\"good condition\\" I wasn't expecting it to be written in - a lot ! Why would I want a workbook that was 1/3 filled in ? Having home schooled for 24 years and purchased used books whenever possible, I was surprised and disappointed. This is my first unsatisfactory used purchase from Amazon. I incorrectly assumed this workbook would have very little writing in it because it was not a good fit for the student or teacher, making it nonreturnable but useable. I felt the seller was deceitful by not disclosing the amount of filled in units. So,I ordered a new book from the publisher so I knew what I was getting and can start in the beginning.

How great it was to grab something like this off the shelf and find something to take home that sounded a lot like the crap your friends were listening to, only the message was upbeat and positive.I'd have spotted them the extra star had the sound not overlapped so much with the stuff that Jyro and Jerome were putting out. While these two bands are similar in many ways, Mortal was spearheading the effort to bring a hard, industrial sound into the Christian camp.Definitely check out the album \\"Fathom\\" by Mortal before you jump head-first into this, as it may be more up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found","review":"The Lost Soul Companion is a mix of touching stories, cautionary tales, quirky anecdotes and tidbits of personal wisdom that touch the heart and spirit.

The appropriately-titled \\"Flashback\\" sounds like it has the same rowboat sounds on Neu!'s \\"Im Glück\\". \\"Lieber Honig 1981\\" continues the melody of \\"Menschen\\", and other than the title, has nothing to do with Neu!'s \\"Leiber Honig\\". The album manages to end on a high note with \\"Das Yvönnchen\\", a great instrumental that sounds like a track off their debut album. The Japanese reissue of this CD on Captain Trip has two bonus songs from the final La Düsseldorf release, a Maxi-Single released in 1983.

Very plain, even boring metal songs, silly male backing vocals. The big exception is Goin' Wild, which is a fantastic, raw, energetic anthem, probably the best song ever released by WOW during her solo years. The Motorhead cover is OK, and so is the live version of Ain't None of Your Business. Decide for yourself if this is worth the price of the album.If you like Wendy O' Williams doing metal, better buy the Plasmatics' Coup d'Etat CD. If you like Wendy O'Williams doing punk, better buy the Plasmatics' New Hope for the Wretched CD, one of the best hardcore punk records of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...","review":"This is the pan that caused me to buy the rest of the calphalon one infused line, easy cleanup, just the right size pan,and you can use any utensil.

I use it for cooking spaghetti mainly. It is deep enough to keep food inside instead of all over the stove. Then it is wide enough to cook lots of food as well. Overall a good buy. I am sometimes brutal if Calphalon doe snot add up to my expectations since their pots costs a lot. This one is worth it.Be careful because there is only one pot when in the ad I bought from had 2 pots listed-- I was later told by the Sellers that it was an error. As a follow up I did some price comparisons to make sure I was not being ripped off. A price check shows that the listed price for this pot is the most reasonable of all.

Mark Heath's \\"Drawing Cartoons\\" is the first \\"how to draw\\" book to help me learn how to \\"think like a cartoonist.\\" Most drawing books I've seen in the past give the reader step-by-step line drawings to copy. While this approach often results in a flashy finished-product for the reader, the beginning cartoonist is left without the \\"tools\\" for creating drawings from scratch, on his or her own. Mark's emphasis, in contrast, is on arming the beginning artist with the means to create his or her own cartoons from the ground up. For example, he advises, \\"cartoons don't perfect detail, but rather, suggest detail.\\" Advice like this helps the budding cartoonist think like a professional.

About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down. I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).

The fan has a tendency to come unbalanced and start buzzing loud enough to be heard in the next room with the door shut. I bought three of them and both started giving this problem within 10 days of continuous use. The buzzing issue can be triggered by repositioning or touching the enclosure slightly or by opening or closing drawers in the desk that it is resting on. The buzzing can be stopped by taking the case apart and applying pressure to the bearing at the center of the fan (underneath the sticker), or sometimes by stopping and starting the fan, but it usually returns anywhere from 10 minutes later (for the worst one of mine) to 1 week later (for the best one).

At the beginning its not too bad, the fan level noise is not loud. After some time or just moving the drive a little to the side, everything is so damn squeezed in that it starts to create these unbelievably loud sounds. You have to remove all drives, turn off the hard drive and play with it maybe hitting it softly so that things move back into place and the awful sound goes away.

Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase.

ROTJ has its moments (particularly tracks 7 and 9 on disc 2), but overall Empire is more consistent. Also, and I was surprised and dismayed to find this, a few tracks have pretty poor sound quality. An example of this is track 2 on disc 2, the \\"Luke and Leia\\" theme. It's a beautiful piece of music, but you don't have to turn the volume up that high to notice major hiss (particularly if you're wearing headphones), which is really annoying. Still, at its best, Jedi is very good music. It just has the misfortune of coming after the ESB soundtrack, which, in case you haven't noticed, I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"I really love this soundtrack!

(In fact,it's a shame there weren't additional books set here) The main character is an enigmatic, brilliant, and incredibly driven man that we never really get to know. Instead, we perceive him through his interactions with a varied cast of interesting \\"side\\" characters. We track our mysterious and chillingly efficient protagonist as he works his way to the top, and along the way we get to look insidethe minds of the facinating supporting characters that his actions affect.

First through illegal society, then through legal society and alien politics. Around mid-book the author switches character perspectives, and I didn't enjoy this as much, because it moved the focus off of the main character and onto the reverberations of his actions. Plot-wise, it makes everything work out neatly, but less interesting than maintaining a focus on the protagonist.I liked the book, and the final lines of dialogue were a satisfying ending.

This was probably one of the last recordings to come out that had a crossover of rap and Hard Rock before the rap-core and rap-metal bands (Kid Rock, Rage Against the Machine and EDL) came on the scene. Before what we had were artists like Run DMC that decided to do a song with a rock Band like Aerosmith or Anthrax.

She blends characters form the celtic Irish classics (the cattle raid of Cooley etc) such as Cuchualian and Connor king of Ulster with historical characters, notably Emperor Hadrain. The most important facet of her writing however is the ability to create characters who while appearing at home in the iron age (or the stone age in the case of the Tuatha de Danna) are still hugely sympathetic for the modern reader. The development of the central characters effortlessly draws the reader into the semi-mythic plot. Lugh the harper and ex-king of Connaught must return to Ireland to attempt to save his friend Cuchaulain and face the wrath of Maeve Queen of Connaught. On the way he becomes entangled in the Roman's plots to invade Ireland as they are added to the increasing weight of Cucaulain's enemies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Ending to a Two-Part Saga","review":"Yes, this book is the sequel to the book \\"A Shadow of Gulls\\". It continues the story of Lugh the Harper and the terrible Queen of Connaught. As I read the book I knew what was going to happen in the end in the final battle, but it did not diminish my pleasure in the story. This book, like the first one, is written in the first person, so it really personalizes the story. It felt like I was there as a guilty observer to the grand passions, intrigue, love and battle scenes. Ms. Finney is a wonderful writer, and her research is superb.

The talents of these icons of oddity are barely shown, for the matches often end very quickly or through outside interference, continuing a storyline that the DVD doesn't present at all. All of the sound comes from the original commentary from the matches, so it feels like you've come across someone's VHS tape that has been used continually to tape shows and you end up with a smattering of matches that make very little sense because there's no sense of context.I'm rather sorry I even watched this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the price is right!","review":"This inexpensive issue has a mixture of early and later Betty Boop cartoons, some with the TV releasing logos.I searched in vain for some of my favorites, these really are some of the lesser Boops.

Episode 4, saw the war between the sexes in full blossum, & the last two episodes is when the series hit its stride. The characters & their very strident differences came out in ways that you knew would make for a far better second season.

DVD features are not excessive but decent. Best feature -- the \\"Late Show\\" appearance from May of 1995 that inspired the show. I was at that Letterman taping. Mel Gibson was the primary guest (he rode in on a horse and was there to promote \\"Braveheart\\" which was to open the next day), Romano was next, and final guest Tara Fitzgerald got bumped. You can hear my laugh when Ray reaches for his keys in his back pocket - I anticipated the punchline.The ELR shows themselves represent what can be so great about sitcoms --- slice-of-life comedy that doesn't seek to be offensive or controversial. ELR explores the minutiae of family life and family dynamics that many of us can identify with and, from a safe distance, laugh at.Everybody Loves Raymond?

I can see that after time this hinge may come loose from the lid as it is held with two small wood screws, but would be easily drilled through to add bolts if needed.

It's bigger than it looks and very roomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but not sturdy","review":"This toybox looks very nice and I love the color. However it is not what I would expect for the price. The wood is thin, and the floor of the box will not support heavy toys. For this price I would expect a solid piece of wood to support toys.

Since it was a \\"safety\\" hinge, I was very reluctant to drill new holes for fear it would no longer have that safety feature.The Kidcraft rep was very nice and helpful the FIRST time I called.

Half the time, when I pick up the carafe, the whole machine comes with it.-The water level markings on the carafe started to come off within about 3 weeks of use.

I do not think they are weatherproof but after flashing and the trim, they will be protected enough.

I have driven hundreds of them now and not one has stripped out or broken. This despite using an impact driver.Kreg offers lots of lengths, different threads, specialty coatings and in various quantities. Obviously, it would be costly to buy a box of every variety to cover every possible use, so you do have to research and order appropriately. I got the box of a thousand and used an amazing number of them, so get a bigger box than you think you will need and you will have a nice collection of spares for those unplanned projects in the future.The screws are good for other tasks and so don't necessarily have to sit around waiting for the next Kreg project.My order was Prime, so the cost for a a big heavy box of quality screws was very reasonable. It was cheaper than other leading brand and its shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor renovation","review":"Love Kreg tools and accessories, HATE the new screws with square/phillip head.

So I thought this 1000 pack would be just fine. I was a little surprised when I open it and find a different style screw and screw head. These don't grab as well as the screws I just used up. The old screws would bury themselves through a piece of pine if you let them. These will strip out sometimes. But my major complaint is the Square-Phillips Combination head in these screws. The square drive does not hold as well as in my last square drive only screws. The fit of the \\"square\\" part of the pocket is not as accurate and leads to a sloppy fit. I also wanted the square only for my application and was not happy to find this subsisted without any mention in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Less Versatile than the Fine Thread","review":"I've found that the fine threads are more versatile than the coarse.

You have to get it screwed on pretty tight so no air leaks in or all water will leak out, too.The unit is a pain to clean since the white water unit sits inside the red water tray. Dirt and whatever gets under and between the two pieces.All that I could have put up with if there would have been a way to hang this unit off the ground. I tried everything. No matter what I did (even drilled a hole in the side of the handle) nothing could successfuly keep the unit flat enough to prevent all the water from leaking over the sides.I bought two of these and trashed both within a couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very easy to use and cannot do many things well..","review":"The Software claims to support many phone and allow sync with outlook.

It doesn't rise to the camp level of producer Irwin Allen's \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" nor is it as violently pornographic as \\"The Towering Inferno\\". The special effects don't rise to the level of previous Allen efforts but they're not bad. I was under the impression that the star-studded cast was in paycheck mode and that may be the case but it's not apparent that they're phoning it in. Noteworthy: How many films sport so many Academy Award winners (Paul Newman, William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons) and Oscar nominees (Burgess Meredith, Valentina Cortesa, Pat Morita).

Still, can't blame the whiteboard for bad pens, so I give this five stars easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the old stuff","review":"I'm sitting here with my last remaining scraps of an old Avery brand dry erase sheet product I purchased years ago and this product that I ordered recently.

They cling well for short periods of time, a day or so. These sheets tear easily making it difficult to detach them from the pad. They are reusable. However, the natural indentations from writing and left over marks make reading from the back of the classroom difficult. You cannot reuse more than three or four times. Overall a decent product but very expensive when you look at how often you have to switch to the next sheet. I found some other stuff that comes in a roll, stays up because it's sticky and easily costs pennies in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool product that spurs instant conversation","review":"I love the static cling on \\"white board\\" sheets.

Not only does Norton have better translations of the stories but also there is an appendix in the back of the volume offering some critical expositions of Chekov's works.Please keep in mind also that Chekov had a social conscience as well. He did not write merely for capitalistic reasons but wrote about Imperial Russia as an observer and expositor of its decline and eventual fall. Through his various humanitarian activities amongst the Russian peasants class he was able to see first hand the poverty and degradation that was endemic in late 19th Century Czarist Russia.Chekov's stories are brief windows or vistas into the depths of human character. Unlike Poe or O Henry, there are no \\"punch lines\\" at the end of the story...but you do come away with a deeper understanding of the spirit in man.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jam Packed Short Stories","review":"What a surprisingly, insightful collection of literature by the one and only Anton Chekhov. It is absolutely mind-boggling how Chekhov was able to put so much emotion and so much psychology into such short pieces of literature. It seems so unrealistic that so much emotion can be packaged up into a neat little section of a couple of pages but the feeling that is left with the human reading it speaks volumes. Hell, some of his inspired critique is so much longer, drabber and drier than his intimate stories. The intense recollection at the fact that no two human beings can ever feel the same thing is positively saddening or enlightening. Oftentimes, even both! Also, Chekhov's ambiguity sets up for the readers individual interpretations of each of his works. Chances are, you'll feel some sort of camaraderie with one or more of his fluctuating, fantastic, invigorating, and clearly ambiguous characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chekhov's Amazing Grace","review":"This slim volume of Chekhov's stories was in excellent condition,chaste inside its plastic wrapping.As these are quintessential life tales it is appropriate that they remain intact and well-protected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Checkov is one of the Best Russian Authors","review":"Chekov is not so much prone to the soap opra like stylings of his contemporiries.

I also ordered the HTC HSJ-1414 mobile base for the Jet WBS-140S and it doesn't fit the saw.I was impressed with the look and feel of the Carter guides, but it doesn't help much if they don't fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is So So","review":"On the Jet 14 inch bandsaw the guides will not mount properly if your saw has the post with a 'V' notch running its length, the guide will fit but but it will not center properly. The upper guide can be mounted upside down after turning the mounting post 90 degrees but then the post locking knob will not secure the post properly. You can always replace the post with a full circular one.I would not recommend this guide system unless it is modified. Nor is it a worthwhile device if you change blades often. Adjustments require the use of three different size metric allen wrenches and the adjustments for the lower guides are a pain to get to.I have gone back to my 'cool blocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard to Adjust","review":"While this thing works well, don't get it if you are going to have to change blades a lot.

Perhaps he was parented well; perhaps he had mentors who knew how to behave appropriately in public and private; perhaps what we see as wise and ideal was more normal when GW was young.No matter.There is no statute of limitations on wisdom.

Adam Haslett takes Washington's writings (actually his copying of other's works)and annotates it to bash all things having to do with George W. Bush, Republicans and conservatives.

For that we owe him all the reverence he gets and then some. But as to his being some sort of brilliant 14-year old with these tremendous insights, it's not correct. Washington copied these rules from a translation of a work produced in the 1500's by Jesuits. The Jesuits actually had a few more. Unfortunately, we can't really give him credit for recognizing the importance of the rules and feeling a need to copy them - the copy was most likely assigned as an exercise in penmanship.BTW, the rules are available all over the web for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Codes of Conduct","review":"This collection of rules of civility was copied from a larger volume by George Washington as a small boy. The larger volume was used throughout the 18th century for the character development of upperclass gentlemen.

I was facinated with the book, but I had no idea that my 4 year old son would find it so interesting. Boys love rules and they want to know what the rules are, who made them, and why. Although a lot of the rules are somewhat dated, most can still be applied to daily life. My son loves to have these rules read to him and reminds me when I break one.

I can't figure out what those enthusiastic reviewers were talking about regarding this book. I found the book confusing and overly technological. Halfway through I stopped caring about the fate of the main character, or even feeling the need to have all the mysteries resolved. Far from being written in the feminist sci-fi spirit of Griffith or Gidman, A Thousand Words For Starnger seemed like an imitation of all the bad, techie sci-fi that's on the market. The instituations and people populating Czernada's universe were hopelessly hard to follow. Unless you feel like spending hours puzzling over an unclear, uninvolving book, I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions and Wonder","review":"\\"A Thousand Words For Stranger\\" left me seething with questions and filled with wonder.

I give two stars instead of one because the movie in it's essence is fabulous, the print is just shameful. You can't read some of the title cards as they are copied to largely to fit on the normal television screen. The quality of the transfer is so bad it can be hard to watch. Considering the restored/authorized version exists, no one should ever purchase the \\"Hollywood Classics\\" print. The restored version looks fantastic, has interesting featurettes about the making of the film, has title cards you can read, and has detailed descriptions of the scenes that aren't included in the film as they have disappeared through damage/fire/degredation.

It's got MP3 playback, and accepts CD-R and CD-RWs, which is a handy feature, though one that I rarely avail myself of. It's pretty basic compared to all the ultra-expensive models that are on the market, but for the price, it's a great deal.

Second, sometimes it turns off/sometimes it doesn't after pushing the power button. (that is simply unacceptable) Third, sometimes the backlight works when it's supposed to, sometimes it doesn't. The Activesync w/ Avantgo has been highly unreliable, perhaps 1 out of 3 times (max) does it sync successfully. The last time it synced up, it erased the settings/channels that were set-up w/ Avantgo. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED, because I had really high hopes and expectations.

Mine has the same issues as everyone else...the filter is full of water and grounds at the end of the brewing cycle and what did make it into the carafe is also full of grounds, and when it does brew correctly, it is luke warm.

In fact, it shuts the unit off after making only a teaspoon of coffee regardless of how I try to use the feature. Additionally, when the pot if \\"finished\\" (the mfg says you can tell by the guggling sound) if you remove the carafe the dang thing leaks out the last of the water left in the filter holder onto the counter. Forget that stuff about the carafe keeping the coffee hot for hours. It simply does not. You can also count on having grounds in your cffee mor eoften than not.

It is a poor design which causes frequent overflow of the grounds basket.The rubber nipple on the basket is fragile. Mine broke after 10 brews. The pot's position on the plate is critical to getting it to drip properly or you have an overflow mess.I am currently propping the pot under the drip with a coffee spoon to get it to drip properly and that doesn't always work.

But convenience and functionality, it falls flat.We use the timer function and about 1 out of every 3 mornings I wake up to the coffee pot 1/3 of the way full, yet the pot has been made. Why? Because the pot is extremely difficult to place correctly so that the coffee drips properly into the caraffe. If it is 1 millimeter off then the pot doesn't recognize the caraffe being there, turns off the drip and goes ahead and makes the coffee. What happens then? A big mess. The basket overflows with coffee, which luckily for the most part drips down the side and into the caraffe (along with grinds). The rest of the coffee stays in the basket until you readjust the caraffe... and by then the coffee is cold anyways, defeating the purpose of the caraffe.BTW, Consumer Reports ranks this pot #24 out of 25 pots for a reason. Just wish they would have rated it before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Keep Coffee Hot","review":"I've tired of the hastle each morning making perk coffee then transfering it into the thermal carafe that keeps it hot almost all day.

The first time we used it, the filter basket didn't fit properly in the holder which caused it to overflow and it leaked all over. We had to remove the basket and dump over 2 cups of coffee. The warmer plate was not warm and the machine turned itself off after each brew cycle. Coffee did not stay hot for an hour in the decanter. Continued to leak and I returned the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a zero star rating for this product","review":"I wish I had read the Amazon customer reviews before wasting money on this coffee maker. It is very poorly designed. The carafe does not engage correctly with the plastic lever that opens the hole at the bottom of the coffee basket no matter how you jiggle it. As a result, best case, you get a partial carafe of coffee with a coffee basket full of grounds and liquid. Worst case the basket overflows. The carafe is supposed to keep the coffee hot but is not very well insulated, apparently, for the coffee cools quickly. Overall, I think it is the worst product I have purchased since I bought a diesel-powered Oldsmobile. If someone tries to give you this coffee maker, turn it down. I hope the materials are recyclable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it to work","review":"We replaced our 3rd Krups with this. My wife assembled it and when I awoke the coffee had not even started. I checked her work, and it seemed fine. After jiggling the pot and filter holder it started going, but would not release into the pot. I double-checked. After more jiggling, it started flowing.I noticed a small rubber nipple on the underbelly of the filter mechanism. I do not know what it does, but if it must be there, then I do not think that the machine will last more than a year. It is going back today.Who said that building a better mouse trap is so easy ?This is our second DeLonghi appliance that looks great, but doesn't work so good. But beauty is only skin deep (at least in the kitchen appliance world.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a horrible product!","review":"This doesn't even deserve one star! Liquid doesn't drain from the basket, so it overflows! DeLonghi wouldn't make good on it! I used it for a few days without a problem (other than lukewarm coffee) but then it totally went to heck in a hand basket. Please don't waste your money on this crummy product that the company won't stand behind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"While sleek in design, the product failed to live up to the one promise that made me want to buy it: the ability to keep hot or warm coffee which had already been brewed. Unlike conventional electric coffee makers which cost $20 or less, the DeLonghi had no facility to keep the coffee warm other than the insulating qualities of the cannister. After a short period of time, much of the heat in the brewed coffee was gone and there was no way to get it warm for drinking other than to pour the coffee into a saucepan and heat it on the stove or, alternatively, to pour it into a cup and heat it in a microwave oven. The less expensive conventional coffee makers have a hot plate which keeps the coffee hot as long as the switch is on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"We've used this for the last year, and we've put up with it spilling over once in awhile when the grounds get stuck in the drip mechanism. We are patient people. But lately it has started turning itself on in the middle of the day (I'm not making this up, and no, the timer was not set.) I've come home and had the coffee maker burning hot to the touch, with no water inside. The first time I thought maybe someone had bumped it, or it was just a quirk, but when it happened a couple more times, I started to worry. I contacted the company, but so far there has been no response. I would not leave it plugged in unattended. We're looking for a new machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have been patient with this machine for almost a year but now I've had it! First, the water level indicator doesn't work, so no matter how much water I pour into the holding tank the little ball thing doesn't move. The basket holder is hard to open, the permanent filter makes the coffee taste bad so I chucked that thing and use paper. The aroma button makes no discernable difference, so don't buy it for that feature. There's constantly coffee and grinds all over my counter top because it leaks out the bottom somehow. The seal on the lid seems to be loose or something because there is always leaking when I pour. And, the coffee doesn't even start out hot enough, so the thermal carafe is kind of a moot point. Saving graces (that just aren't enough)are the timer and the overall sleek look of the machine. I'm headed out to look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee machine we ever bought !","review":"We bought it last night after my other machine stopped working. we tried making coffee this morning and after half hour, the coffee was warm, not hot in the carafe...we still have the box so we will go bring it back tomorrow. don't bother with this model. it's not good. we've always used DeLonghi and our other machines lasted over two years. this particular model, well, let's just say this time we didn't get a good deal..."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"we got this as a wedding gift and it worked ok for about 2 years, but there are 2 plastic parts that have broken in the last month making it unusable. would not recommend this machine or this brand to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the directions for a perfect cup of coffee!!","review":"This thing has gotten a bad rap for lack of common sense. This thing doesn't spill and it keeps the coffee hot for a long time. I just dumped coffee out from yesterday and it was still luke warm even. One step people probably forget is to rinse the carafe with hot water before you put it back under to brew the coffee. If it just had cold water in it, then the coffee is being brewed into a cool pot - no wonder your coffee isn't staying warm. If you rinse it with hot water before you brew - your coffee will be warmer and stay hot longer. This is standard practice with ANY stainless steel carafe.All in all, this is one of the best coffee maker's I have ever owned. Don't be fooled by the bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"Sorry, folks but I didn't like it and can't share the same enthusiasm as other commentators do. Wasn't even able to finish this 3 hour flick. Maybe I'm already too old for this kind of movies. The idea of photographing the young girls' panties using acrobatic movements doesn't talk to me much. Neither \\"religious\\" and underground \\"cult\\" aspects of the film were interesting for me. To my mind, the Japanese cinema greatness, like that of the Italian cinema, stayed in the 50's, 60's and 70's (Kurosawa, Shindo, Suzuki, Imamura, Kobayashi, Teshigahara, Ozu, Mizoguchi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful ride for your emotions","review":"It's pretty rare to find a four hour movie as compelling as Love Exposure. The director has a kinky sense of humor that manages to be sincere and innocent at the same time as the Yu Honda embraces his inner pervert like a form of sacred art. I haven't seen a movie that mixes the sacred and the profane so much in lighthearted way without losing too much to cynicism. The mains are wonderfully acted, I loved Yu Honda, Yoko, and even the disturbingly evil Ai. The story weaves and bobs around themes that would be verboten in popular movies, but in this context, it has an ease of boundaries and fluidity. The genre-flux from rom-com to kung-fu movie to melodrama is done effortlessly and as the captive audience, I had no choice but to let the movie take me along for the emotional trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fastest 4 hrs of my life span...","review":"Sion Sono is currently my favorite film-maker right now..

Some other great songs are Giving Up On You, Yeliel, and Broken Vow (what a powerful song and voice). I can understand why people compare her sound to Celine Dion(my favorite artist) because they are quite similar. I remember when I first heard I Will Love Again I thought it was a new single from Celine Dion. Lara has a very soothing voice that will relax you when you just want to unwind.

Lara Fabian has an incredible voice and isn't bad looking either. She's a star in Canada and Europe but most folks here don't even know her name. This album was supposed to be her introduction to America but it failed. Why? Who knows? The songs are a pleasant blend of power ballads and pop which was quite popular at the time. My only small nitpick is that Lara didn't sound like she was really comfortable singing in English. It sounds a little like she had no idea what the lyrics actually meant.So, is this album worth buying? Yeah sure if you love Celine Dion or Mariah Carey (before she got hooked on Hip Hop) and you want lush, romantic music. It's a mystery why Lara caught on here. I'm hoping the studio bosses will give another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another Celine Dion","review":"Well, for me, this album sounds just like Celine Dion's album.

Her voice is very powerful, as demostrated in this single, I ranked her up there with Celine Dion.On the power of this one single I bought the entire album, thinking it would be more of the same catchy pop tune type songs. I was disappointed to find that the rest of the album was filled with lack luster ballads. In which Lara rarely if ever uses the entire power of her voice.While she undoubtedly has talent coming out her ears, the record label should have picked a different single to represent this album. \\"I Will Love Again\\" sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the tracks on the CD.If you think you may like Lara, I encourage you to wait and see if you like the next single.Lara has talent but this album is a poor showing of it.

Turns out she tries too hard to copy other artists and it shows. Embarassingly shows. She steals from Celine like crazy, even the gestures, breathing, and emotives. But she can't pull it off. Her voice is not as refined or powerful and huge like Celine's. She'll always be second rate and pales in the shadow of Celine but I guess that's as far as she will go. Let's be clear here. She's has nothing that could catapult her into the world of super stars. She's not original or talented enough.

I only use them in -very- hard woods, however, as the head is quite a bit smaller in diameter than the washer-head pocket hole screws people are most familiar with. That means two things: it's easier to sink the head into the surface of the wood (not a good thing), and it's easier for the pieces being fastened to work themselves loose. That's not to say these don't have their place. For really hard wood, like teak, the head is more than large enough to hold firmly.

I dont think i've ever heard a reading this bad! So again, great Author, great Novel, great series, and even packaging. Terribly done narration!Some examples of great narration that i've heard for audiobooks are \\"The Talisman\\" by Stephen King and the \\"Icewind Dale Trilogy\\" by RA Salvatore. Great talents!!This one....noooo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sci-fi book; but not a very good murder mystery.","review":"Asimov puts together another excellent sci-fi novel.No one handles a mixture of robots and humans with thesame panache as Asimov. As usual the famous three lawsof Robotics are called into question and Asimov playsupon the intricacies of the interpretation of the lawsmasterfully.However it is not a very good murder-mystery. The endingdoesn't follow naturally from the facts presented earlierbut is kind of artificial; the author springs new stuffon the reader and explains it all away - ratheruncovincingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This book explores what will happen in the future when people move off Earth and colonise other planets, eventually rejecting Earth's ways which increases the hostility between the two factions under the guise of a murder mystery. A spacer (i.e. not from Earth) is killed on Earth and Detective Elijah Bailey is assigned the case. As a compromise he is given a spacer partner who turns out to be a human-like robot.As with all books not set in current time or in history the book has to spend a lot of time setting the scene and exploring the social climate and social consequences of Man's actions and the murder side of the book is a bit rushed and not fully explored. It is a brilliant future/science fiction/robot book, slightly let down by the murder mystery side of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caves of Steel","review":"Isaac Asimov does it again, his Robot series is one of the best. I would also reccomend the Foundation series. If you want to read Classic Sci Fi then this is your Author."},{"rating":"1","title":"cardboard 1D","review":"Too shallow, stiff and hokey. No action. No emotion. A great plea for ZERO POPULATION GROWTH! tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly his most readable fiction","review":"This book and Asimov's The Naked Sun, where Elijah Baley appears again, form a delightful pair of what is probably Asimov's best, and certainly most readable, fiction. Less epic and visionary but more approachable than his Foundation novels, the book also introduces one of Asimov's most memorable characters, the android detective, R. Daneel Olivaw.Together, Baley and Olivah make a great detective team in this futuristic murder mystery novel, which also contains some of Asimov's first speculation on the social implications of robots and androids, and he also discusses the Three Laws of Robotics for which he became famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Incredibly interesting and elegantly written. Asimov delivers an amazingly human story set within the confines of an intriguing mystery. Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of adventure and deep ideas.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This book is sci-fi mixed with mystery. It has social and possible future conflict as well. It has something for everyone. I recommend this book to anyone one who likes fiction and to Asimov fans, it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of class conflict.","review":"With books like this Asimov takes a better look at society rather than this mystery. We have the decadent and few Spacers and the pragmatic and many Earthpeople. Alot of political plotting, like in all his books, but surprising more interesting than Foundation (possible because it is more basic). Recommended for any Asimov fan. One of the least dated (and most prescient, with mentions of solar power and recycling) of his older novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super book that shows an interesting future for Earth.","review":"Asimov's wonderful mystery/science fiction novel that sets the stage for his whole robot series has a good mystery plot. The whole book's setting, however, is in some ways more interesting. The idea of a future Earth as being a few huge cities with tens of millions of people who have never seen the light of day is disturbing and thought-provoking. Though the mystery is not extrodinarily complex, it is interesting when put together with the setting which makes the book even more interesting. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, not a great mystery.","review":"Okay, first I'll point out that anyone who regularly reads mystery novels will identify the murderer early on (at least I did). However, Asimov is not a mystery writer, he is an SF writer. As an exploration of a world of the future, this is absolutely top-notch. Furthermore, the way in which Bailey discovers who is the murderer is well done -- after all, Bailey doesn't know he's in a murder-mystery book plot, so he can't identify the murderer the way we can."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Caves of Steel","review":"The Caves of Steel was the first book in the Assimov foundation series. I found it to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This book is a fun, and easy to understand book. It will drive you into wondering who killed Dr. Sarton as Elijah and R. Deneel try to come to a solution. This book is very unpredictable, and exciting. This book was the first book that I have read by Assimov other than short stories in Robot Dreams. That is a collection of short stories by Assimov which is also excellent. So, I recomend this book to everyone who likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met long ago, but the memory warmly lingers","review":"I met Marcus Tulius Cicero many years ago, when I was a small child and he had been dead for many centuries. Our introduction, by way of this book sparked my eventual love for Roman, literature, society, culture - you name it. Taylor Caldwell presents a more than plausible version of the fine print, the details leading up to the murder of............."},{"rating":"1","title":"An execrable book: how not to write historical fiction","review":"I only finished this book because each page was a new revelation in how *not* to write a book. Turgid, redundant prose; cardboard characters; plodding plot -- Caldwell has them all. Most risible is the way she interlards her wooly-headed pseudo-philosophizing throughout. Wait, no; most risible is the way she feels it necessary to cast her hero as some sort of proto-Christian devoutly inquiring after the prophesies of the Jews and awaiting the coming messiah. Even the history of the period is perverted, glossed-over, and twisted to suit her desire for eschatological analogy. There is absolutely nothing of value in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worthwhile time spent reading this most marvelous book","review":"I originally read this book back in the earl 1960's. At the time the US was experiencing the watt's riot. Berkley and all kinds of disorder. This book is really about the fall of the Roman Empire with Ceasar and Ciceiro. At the time I thought oh my Goodness this is what is happening now. Recently it came to my mind and I purchased a used copy of the Pillar of Iron. It is a very awakening experience to read history repeating itself. It could be about todays US world. Time well spent to read this book. Amazon has access to many of the old used good works and the price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Don't Write Books Like This Anymore","review":"Excellent book based on the author's original translations from the Latin. Brings the life of Cicero and his contemporaries to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific Tenderness","review":"Linda Dyer is a true original --- entirely serious and entirely quirky, scientific and funny and tender. What she sees, she sees closely and clearly, but there is always a heartbreaking tension between the perception and the yearning. Almost anything, it seems, could make its imprint on her like sand on a beach: and if she turns her light on you, you will be seen both accurately and through a large and generous lens. Having the chance to wear Linda Dyer shades by reading her poems is a gift that will wrench and wreak joy out of you altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst film i have ever seen","review":"I'm serious...If you are thinking of renting or worse still buying this then DON'T....If you are thinking of watching this for free then don't cause you will be seriously wasting 90 mins of your life...Bad Acting, Bad Script, Bad Plotline...Bad , Bad Film.........Just watch Seven again as this is what this Film wants to be and fails.....MISERABLY...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking Time","review":"I have probably watched 5,000 movies in my lifetime. Out of all the movies I've ever seen, this is the #1 worst. The whole time watching it, I kept asking myself \\"How was this movie made?\\" \\"Who looked at this script and said, this is brilliant?\\" The one positive thing to say is that future serial killers may watch this movie and realize serial killer isn't as cool as it used to be. This movie should be called \\"Taking time,\\" because that's what it does. It takes your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Movie But Nothing New!","review":"This is a great movie don't get me wrong. But it's like so many other movies. This FBI agent girl gets into a case and has to track down some guy. The movie has some twists but it's pretty much predictable. You can pretty much guess through the whole movie and be right. There is some action but not alot. There are some gory scenes but they are really not that gory. There isn't really anything that special on the dvd. It just has some basic bonus footage you can see in about every dvd. If your sick of predictable movies and worn out acting stay far away. But if your new to the genre looking for a kind of scary slow action paced movie this would be your best be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good movie!","review":"Ethan Hawke gives a credible performance in this regrettable movie and Angelina Jolie is beautiful, as always. But if you are looking for a believable plot--one that will withstand multiple viewings--you best look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fast!","review":"Got my dvd three days after ordering! Including sunday! And DVD was in great shape! Realy happy with it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scariest Scene Ever","review":"There was the scene where Angelina laid down on the bed -and with no sex to expect-was a scene equal to that of the shower scene in Psycho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking Lives - Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)","review":"Didn't care for this movie or Angelina Jolie's performance. Did like Ethan Hawk's acting along with Olivier Martinez. Movie was gory and didn't like the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herring, anyone?","review":"This ridiculous attempt at something devious and twisted ends up only tortuous and unnecessarily confusing. A review quoted on the box says, \\"It will keep you guessing until the very end, and even then you'll be wrong!\\" Inundated by red herrings, I stopped guessing about halfway through and just waited for the revelation scene which, when it comes, will surprise no one who's ever seen a suspense film, despite the movie's attempts at misdirection. The ending is unbelievably silly (by which I mean both silly and unbelievable). Also unbelievable is that someone who looks like Angelina Jolie would fall for someone who looks like Ethan Hawke. Their love scene is embarrassing...and noisy. Two stars because one is as low as you can go; I save one star for something like an Ed Wood film."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Justice Done","review":"I went to great lengths to get a copy of this as i was not interested in watching it on the big screen.I have seen comparisons being made between this and 'Lambs' but really this comes as a cheap imitation of the genre. It has been touted as a remake of a novel but really what were the writers thinking.It boasts of a great cast but what were the actors thinking? Ethan Hawke tries his best to save his half baked role. I was most interested in watching the movie as we do not exactly get to see him in too many movies.Angelina is today's Sharon Stone, she probably is a bit more wilder than Stone. Angelina does seem to be having a star hangover and needs to put more into her performances which these days seem to be neither here nor there. She however seems to be performing the steamy scenes with gusto, would like to see the same in some of her other performances.All in all a good waste of talent and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, and tired.","review":"Boring and tired murder mystery that takes all its parts from better movies and still makes a mockery of itself in the mystery department with a killer that can be spotted a mile away, and an ending that leaves you scratching your head on why you wasted you're time with this film in the first place. I do like Angelina Jolie but she should fire her manager for helping her pick out this film to star in.Let's hope Miss Jolie can find a great film before it's too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of trash","review":"As hard as it is to get an original movie idea looked at, there is always someone ready to drop a million on a piece of crap.This movie offers nothing new in any way.Saw the flick in the theaters and almost walked out.The sex scene was not needed and felt unrealistic to the characters. The ending was total garbage leaving you with a \\"what, thats it?\\" It's almost as if the writers gave up and didn't write an ending so the director picked up the camera and invented a total waste of time-rushed ending.You could put gallons of blood and thousands 'ol big lips boobie shots and it would still be worth a dvd rental at your local gas station on a weekday as you sit in the hospital with broken legs and unable to move...anywhere.B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not spectacular, but worthy","review":"Aside from the ending, which I thought was misplaced and hurried, the movie was enticing, surprising (at least to me) and fun to watch. I liked this much more than Secret Window and recommend this as a great late night thriller to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicatable","review":"I am a big fan of Jolie's but I say pass on this one. The movie is very predictable from start to near finish. I was hoping for some twists and thought the predictablity was a ruse...it wasn't. Angelina's character is shallow, not the strong character we're accustom to for her. And there is no spark between her and Ethan Hawke making their relationship unbeleivable. I suggest waiting and renting this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the directors cut made more sense.","review":"We watched the fullscreen version of this flick and I found it tedious and unbelievable (for the genre, anyway). The first few minutes were very creepy, but once the story went to Montreal, that atmosphere vanished. I thought the Angelina Jolie character lacked any spark and Ethan Hawke wasn't much better. The ending made even less sense than the rest of the film, but I could have dozed through a scene or two and missed something. Like I said in the title, perhaps the directors cut was a better film. I doubt it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking (2 Hours Out of Our) Lives","review":"Wow, Angelina Jolie is gorgeous. Other than that, there's not much to recomend this film. I don't understand why these writers, directors, and actors want to make thrillers, when they really (apparently) don't know anything about how they work.The plot turns & twists in \\"Taking Lives\\" are interesting at first, but soon tax the viewer's patience. The whole segment with Kiefer Sutherland is ludicrous when one takes even a split second to think about it. As is the jaw-dropping ending sequence.To add insult to injury, there's a \\"Gag Reel\\" included among the DVD extras. What is this, \\"Smokey and the Bandit?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent thriller","review":"Angelina Jolie plays an FBI profiler on the tail of a murdering maniac who steals the identities of his victims. His latest victim, played by Ethan Hawke, may very well be their biggest suspect, and the man he accuses, played by Keifer Sutherland, may not be who you think he is. I thought the development of this film was spot on and held your interest as the plot unraveled. The ending was shocking and deffinatly a head turner. Once you start to understand whats going on you'll be glued to your seat for the last few frames of the film. Angelina is steller as usual, and Hawke channels his likability we saw in Training Day for a very fine performance. Keifer is always a favorite, and while he's not in the film very much he still leaves his mark. I would recommend for anyone who's fans of the genra. You'll be pleased, because while it's far from perfect it pacts a punch that will leave you anticipating another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good thriller","review":"While not on the level of \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\",\\"TakingLives\\" is still a good cat-and -mouse film noir thriller onits own terms.Sharply directed by D.J. Caruso and well-writtenby Jon Bokenkamp from Michael Pye's popular book,backed by asolid production and brilliant editing by Anne V.Coates,thefilm moves along briskly and works up a good head of suspense.The performances are excellent,with Angelina Jolie and EthanHawke especially outstanding.It's nice to see Hawke playing a real creep for once.The movie has enough twists and turns to keep you interested thoroughout.Not as good as \\"Mystic River\\",but worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This movie is a case of having high expectations only to fall incredibly flat. From the moment that Ethan Hawke's character shows up in the movie, it is obvious that he is the killer, period. Once that was established, the movie was dull and boring. I will say that it was nice to see Ms. Jolie in the buff, but it isn't enough to salvage this train wreck of a movie.Hey Hollywood, try producing a real murder mystery that you can't guess inside of 15 minutes. Just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Taking Lives\\" nothing new.","review":"\\"Taking Lives\\" is an ok movie. It provides some twists and turns but is mostly predictable. Some surprises are ok but not enough to carry this movie. Proceed with caution when seeing this one. I recommend seeing \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or \\"Seven\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"I was very caught up in this movie from the first incredible scenes to the final twist. I have read the other reviews and maybe I'm biased because I LOVE Angelina Jolie but I thought this was a great movie. I highly recommend it. The violence, sex, and little bit of nudity all added to this movie. I did not have the plot figured out right away and was highly impressed with how this movie kept my attention all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Taking Lives is one of those films that turn out to be a big dissapointments. There has been to many movies that have had the same premise. This thriller is not that thrilling. The acting is not all that great. Some things in the film also make no sense. Angelina Jolie has no chemistry at all with her co star Ethan Hawke. If you are looking for a thrill this is not the movie to watch. And if you still want to see it I suggest you rent it instead of wasting your $20.00 on a bad movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad...","review":"Every 'suspense thriller' that comes out these days has a huge obstacle to overcome: the obligitory comparison to 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS', or 'SEVEN'. How can ANY movie of such type hope to compete with these shining achievements of genre filmmaking? The answer is , of course, that they can't. 'TAKING LIVES' however, is at least a solid thriller that held my interest throughout. Ethan Hawke playing against type was a nice change of pace, and the lovely Angelina Jolie is always a welcome addition to any production. She may be mailing in on this role, but the woman is a vision to behold. Bottom line: I was entertained. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow-the worst movie I've seen all year","review":"Yikes-this movie is just so so bad. Can I start off with the fact that they claim they're in Montreal but then the camera pans the most famous building in Quebec City? The movie is trite and cliche, with never an original thought or twist. My husband and I came up with much better twists that we thought would be coming but oh no. The screenwriter had to go with what has been done over and over and over again. Boring, bland, bad acting and predictable. See it only if you're interested in Angelina Jolie getting naked. Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofiest flick of the year","review":"I watched this DVD with friends and afterward said \\"I didn't realy understand the supernatural angle.\\" I was surprised when they said it wasn't supernatural thriller, so we went through the DVD and picked out many instances where rules of time and space get bent to benefit the plot. There's a hardly a scene where the alert viewer won't say \\"Hey wait a minute!\\" Mystery fans expect better writing than that. Also notice the chase scene where the bad guy's gun changes from an automatic to a revolver and back again. I still can't even swallow the basic premise - a serial killer who does not just do \\"identity theft\\" but literally moves into his victims apartments, lives their lives (and even pays their bills) for years as if nobody would notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and predictable","review":"You can probably guess who the villain is before you even start watching this movie. Yes, it's that predictable. And so is the car chase scene and the sex part. I don't know what the \\"director's cut\\" entails, but the movie is bland and lame. Nothing thrilling or sexy at all (no, I'm not a desensitized viewer). Acting is Hollywood at its most boring, and the storyline just never engages. Mildly entertaining on a stormy Saturday night when you got nothing better to do -- I watched this over a tasteless after-work dinner -- but otherwise worth skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst So Called Scary Movie Since Texas Chainsaw Mass.","review":"Too predicatable, not scary in the least, completely unoriginal, not one good performance, the first scene was okay but the rest of the movie was an absolute waste of time. 1 out of a 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Angelina Why?","review":"Boring and flat. The acting lacks enthusiasm and the script lacks credibility. I generally love Angelina Jolie, but she was apparently as unimpressed with this movie as I was. Ethan Hawke was uncharacteristically boring. The script is beyond lifeless, and to all the critics who compared this piece of celluloid crap to The Silence of the Lambs, maybe you ought to rent Silence of the Lambs and see how wrong you are. What a waste of 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tired","review":"Boring and tired murder mystery that takes all its parts from better movies and still makes a mockery of itself in the mystery department with a killer that can be spotted a mile away, and an ending that leaves you scratching your head on why you wasted you're time with this film in the first place.

Angelina Jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately. But I will say that I am happy that she went to see an Expos game while in Montreal... and that she shows us some skin here. The kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is SO ANNOYING!!! Someone needs to steal his John Lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film. One bonus in here is that Marie-Jose Croze is in it albeit briefly. She should have been the lead. She's hotter than Angelina and a better actress (see Munich). This film is also beneath Jean-Hugues Anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun Ethan Hawke any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated R for retarted","review":"Wants to be se7en, but can't hold a candle to it. A really, really stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Canada part of the USA?","review":"This movie is terrible. To begin with, what is the FBI doing investigating in Canada? I thought Canada was an independent nation...with their own government agencies.Secondly, the movie takes place in Montreal while on film all you see is Quebec City...thirdly, Angelina Jolie has turned into a parody of herself. Plainly overdone, she tries too hard to be incredibly sexy.So much wasted talent, Hawke, Sutherland.. etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, worth watching","review":"A good movie that I'd definitely watch again even knowing the whole thing. I think it's done well: acting, pace, story, etc. And, unlike some other comments, I really had no problem with the ending. In fact, I rather liked it and felt it sealed my 4-star rating. Though I'd have given the movie '4' probably with a different ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Little Picture","review":"Sure wouldn't recommend it for the kids (although they probably take much worse than this in stride daily). I see it has been around a few years so is likely to be familiar to most who keep up with films. At any rate, if you can take more than a little violence, nasty pictures, and a touch of sadism, this one will grip you with its tale of a serial killer, the Canadian police whose job it is to find him, and, naturally, the beautiful FBI agent borrowed for the occasion to help the police. The stars and supporting players do a good job with appropriate scenery complementing the action admirably. Some twists and turns flavor the dish and a brief bit of modest nudity with suggestive sex, adds that extra touch of spice to go with the beauty.Brief appearances by Kiefer Sutherland and Gena Rowlands are welcome touches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true Must NOT see!!","review":"Taking lives starts out pretty good.. you get to see how the killer started out with this insane act and it gets you intrigued to begin. However, the exact second they shoot you into the present time, you know who is causing all the \\"taking lives\\" chaos! The movie had a certain amount of potential to give you a nudge off your seat but unfortunately they didn't get far enough to even attempt!! This was not anywhere near as suspenseful and exciting as I had hoped!! Don't waste your time viewing Taking Lives, it's a bomb!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb","review":"Most of the other reviews are exactly right. The quotes on the casefor the video promise that you'll never guess what will happen next.False! Most of the plot is very predictable and obvious. Sutherlandis barely in the movie at all in spite of his star billing. Jolie's characteris weird and oddly motivated. Ethan Hawkes acting is awful. On topof that, please explain to me why an American FBI agent is helpingout on a CANADIAN case anyway? Plus the sound volume does roller-coasterup and down. Bad movie.

I will not give it way but the commercials and the fact that it has been done before kind of killed the suspends the movie tries to have. Angelina Jolie is a good actress but she needs to read her roles more carefully, and this movie is not one for her to remember. E than Hawke is fine as well, but I could not get into his character, and Kiefer Sutherland does a throwaway role that adds nothing to the movie at all. Olivler Martinez has the worst part in the entire movie, and he comes across as unlikable which is hard because it more of a script problem than a personality one. The movie feels like it was just put out there with any thought, and the whole dark scenery just makes the viewer depress with what they are seeing. Take a walk out side before you put your money down for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Total Guys Movie","review":"This movie was made completely for men here are my reasons:Its a very sylish film.The plot is cool, great murder mystery.Angelina Jolie is mad hot!There is a sex scene with Angelina Jolie and you get some very nice views of her lovely body.There is a cool car chase scene that ends with a sweet explosion.If you are a horror fan there are some pretty scary scenes and alot of gore.The twist ending is jaw dropping!This is a great movie to watch with the guys. I had my buddies over drank some beers and had a great time watching this movie, its a lot of fun, and plus Angelina Jolie is so sexy in that sweet sex scene! It also works as an action, mystery, horror, and suspense film. Its not great but a lot of fun to watch!

The true star is actually Ethan Hawke. Unfortunately, this movie is slow, even boring at times. I don't know how you can take such a promising story line and make such a boring movie.

AND the second one (a free replacement from Home Hardware). Made of thin plastic, this part is a typical built-in obsolescence piece of xxxx. Third one now seems to have a broken element. Not getting another one.I'm here on Amazon trying to figure out what to get next. But my partner likes the quality of the capachino it makes. So if you buy it, be very careful with that frother. You need the correct-sized cup [=small] or else you'll easily bend it and break it."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete, and missleading.","review":"The picture showes espresso maker with two espresso shot cups, that are not included with the product. Also, I like to make cappuccinos. If making a cappuccino, I need to supply my own container to steam my milk. Last, there is no way to steam milk without making espresso at the same time. So if you don't make it exactly right, you need to start over... This is the first and last time I will buy online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Latte maker","review":"All the reviews I read before I purchased this item said that the coffee maker was purchased to make lattes. Several reviews mentioned the steaming wand being difficult to use, but that they managed in the long run. Well, I feel that the wand is impossible to use as there is no way to chose between the espresso selection and the steaming selection. If you follow the instruction regarding the coffee and the water portions, you have great espresso, but if you want to steam milk, you need to put in more water, but since there is no way to select steam, you have to try and steam the milk while the espresso is brewing and you end up having watered down espresso or steam milk that is not hot enough. I have resorted to just heating my milk up in the microwave and have more of an espresso with hot milk as opposed to a latte. If you want to make lattes, I recommend looking for another espresso maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst kitchen item i have ever bought","review":"i hope to spare someone else the pain of buying this. i just watched a fountain of hot water shoot out all over my kitchen counter as i tried to steam a cup of milk. not being able to select between 'steam' and 'brew' modes is staggeringly stupid. i am going to deposit this in the garbage and buy a different machine. and to the person who said this is common in cheaper machines, i have NEVER owned or even saw a machine that has hot coffee shooting out the front while steam is pouring out the side. that's just stupid and dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not steam milk...for the first few months...","review":"I'm updating my originally bad review. First the original:Very disappointed in this. It does not steam milk, no matter what type of milk I use, no matter what angle I tilt it at. I had a cappuccino maker for years so I know how to steam milk, and this thing just does not do it. I almost always have to run a second batch of water through just to re-steam the milk and try to get a little froth. Usually, though, I just suffer through a cappuccino that is no more than milky coffee, no froth. Bitterly disappointed.Several months later:Unexplainably, this thing started steaming milk properly. I did nothing different. Same milk. Same angle and depth of pitcher. But now it creates so much froth it will overflow the pitcher if I let it. I can't explain it. So if it doesn't work at first, I suppose you can just keep using it for a few months until it learns how to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought!","review":"I thought it would work better. It is very hard to get 2 cups in there and have room for the steamer cup to fit. The steamer nozzle doesn't come out very far and is not long enough. The steamer also doesn't work very well. For regular milk it is fine as long as you don't want much froth. But if you try to use anything else (I like soy milk), it doesn't froth at all. I am not please with the performance of this product and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Terrible piece of junk! Worst espresso I have ever had. I own Breville Cafe Modena espresso maker and it's great! I wish I never bought this machine. Amazon lied about rebate too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live to its expectation","review":"I have purchased this espresso maker in January of this year and last August it just stopped working. The on-light is lit but no steam is being produced and if I remove the lid after a while, the water in it is not even hot. I don't use this machine that often. I mean once a day which is not a lot. My previous espresso machine was a Mr. Coffee and because two of my children were living with us at the time, it was being used about three times per day and it lasted about two years. This machine does have a 1 year warranty but since I only paid $35.10 is not worth shipping it or bringing it to the nearest DeLongui service center which is about 35 minutes from home. Next time I pay a little more and buy a better one. For now I am using a Betty Crocker that I picked up at a yard sale for 5 bucks. Is not top of the line but at least is making me some espresso which is more than I can say about the DeLongui."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD PRODUCT","review":"Is not available a switch for stream! Is a cappuccino maker? no, just a coffee maker. is a fake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst coffee machine ive ever owned and the worst product ever received from amazon.","review":"When I first unpacked this I noticed tiny metal fillings in the reservoir. Upon starting it up to clean it out with a run through with hot water the safety cap leaked.So I planned on returning it at that point but just wanted to see if I wanted a replacement or refund.Does not produce crema in fact it burns espresso badly.You have to froth milk while its dripping coffee.There is no way to get an exact amount of water to pull espresso shots and have enough steam left over for milk so you will always make a huge mess.The frother is short, angled horribly, and does not work well.This is a machine for people who do not understand coffee whatsoever.I would not even recommend as a drip machine.DO NOT PURCHASE FOR ANY REASON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it after five days","review":"We've previously used Krups and Capresso espresso makers that are similarly priced to this one, but this is the worst of the lot.If we fill up the reservoir with water, it starts draining from every orifice until it is an inch or two below the rim. We checked the instructions, but could find no indication that it was supposed to be doing this.When we added the amount of water the instructions indicated, it only made about half the amount of espresso it should have, and if we added some extra water, it sometimes overflowed the carafe. We were completely frustrated with the inconsistency of the unit.The only thing positive thing I can say is that the reservoir cap is very sturdy.We have returned it and will go back to Capresso. That one never drained water or overflowed the carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must brew espresso and steam milk at same time - boo!","review":"I was by no means looking for a high end espresso machine, just a functioning machine. This one is not. The espresso maker functions like a coffee maker (will brew until all water is gone). If you want to use the steam wand, you must add a certain amount of water (per directions) and steam at the same time you brew the coffee. Therefore, when the water runs out, you're done. You cannot steam milk unless the coffee is brewing. This design is completely ridiculous. I can't believe that there are so many positive reviews!! Prior to purchasing this machine, I had a Mr. Coffee low end espresso machine and it worked way better. I returned this one and purchased another Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMP","review":"I wouldn't reccomend this product. It doesn't heat well at all, and it runs out of steam before the mild is even room temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like froth this you will have to toss!","review":"This is an alright maker. The problem is that you can not fit the glass carafe or any normal sized mug under the frother. The nozzle does not extend beyond the machine and there is simply not enough room to get a mug under let alone move it up and down to froth the milk. I regret my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent espresso...will break in 5 months and they won't honor warranty","review":"I bought this espresso maker last September and at first I was pretty happy with it. It made decent espresso and unlike most reviewers, I didn't have trouble making foam. However, after only 5 months of using the machine it broke down. It just won't heat up the water, it really won't do anything. It is normal for these machines to break (though maybe not this fast). But what happened next is what is really bad. I called Delonghi, as the machine is under 1 year warranty and they did not want to honor the warranty. The excuse they used was that the machine was manufactured more than a year ago. So basically even though I bought the machine 5 months ago ago, they found an excuse to avoid honoring the warranty. Then they told me that I needed the original product receipt which I don't have anymore. However they should foresee that most people do not keep receipts. I HIGHLY ADVICE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, even for the price","review":"Just adding my agreement with the negative reviews. Received thi as a gift, but even for free it is almost useless. Might work OK if you are standing there to catch the exact moment when you can steam the milk while the coffee is brewing, but if you run out of steam and put more water into the machine to steam the other cups of coffee (remember it makes enough for 4 servings) you can't stop the extra water from percolating through the coffee making part. Either you end up with watery coffee, or a flood in the tray or have to put another vessel under the coffee spiggot.Coupled with the short little barely accessible steam spout and awkwardly placed steam knob (I don't have 2 right hands) it makes the morning cappucino not worth doing. I have had a number of other inexpensive expresso machines over the years and this is by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than desirable","review":"Not up to what I expected.I used my reward points to get a deal and everything about it just falls short.Not enough water in the tank to get good steam.Needs refilling after making expresso.The wand for steam is miserable.I'm sure some can get it to do the right thing but after experiencing using my son's Hamilton Beach I think I just need to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made but OK in a pinch","review":"We have a different primary home model that we use daily and only bought this for traveling. I feel it's very cheaply made and find it disappointing that you need to add water each time you want to brew. We made it work but would never have this as our primary home espresso maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Espresso-Awesome Price!","review":"There is probably not a better espresso machine in existence for the money! Sure you can spend a few hundred dollars, but with this little gem, there is no need. I am very happy with this purchase- it is a solid machine that is easy to use and one heck of a great cup of espresso. Thats my opinion, but it could be the caffeine talking- ha ha ha! Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not froth milk","review":"The expresso part of this machine works great, but it does not generate enough steam to froth the milk. Very disappointing, would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"While the machine may make 4 espresso shots it only steams one cup of milk per 4 shots. Very ineffective when everyone wants a latte. I wish I had purchased the Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail delonghi","review":"This is by far the coolest coffee machine that is at a low price I own two delonghis this model an the bco120t and they are both the best things ever this company really knows what they are doing these machines make personal coffee extremely fast and deserve credit for truly making convenient delicious custom coffee I definitely recommend this to a coffee snob or just an everyday coffee drinker this machine is impressive as well as other delonghis.
