I may not have enjoyed it as much as I did ENVY, but still, I thought the characters were strong, the plot was great, and the prose went very well. I would highly recommend this book to suspense readers. Oddly enough, there was a bit of romance, but SB did a wonderful job in this area too. She's one of my favorites lately. I'll be looking forward to her next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull.","review":"For an author that wrote Envy, The Alibi and Witness, I am surprised when I pick up one of her books and it's sooooo dull. Like White Hot. I had a hard time finishing all 579 pages and think the whole of the story could have been summed up in maybe 300 instead. I wasn't impressed with any of the characters, the dialogue got to be monotonous and I think the editor failed when he/she didn't chop about 2/3 of it. The surprising twist wasn't surprising because had Beck honestly represented what it appeared he did until the last 5 pages, Sayre and him wouldn't have ended up together and we knew that was a sure thing before I began reading it. Sorry, this one was a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Envy","review":"I read envy a couple years ago, after my best friend said it was good. I loved it. I liked it so much I even bought her next book in hardcover. The Crush. That book was just ok. So when i saw this one, i remembered how much I liked Envy. Figured The Crush might have just been a fluke. This book was pretty boring. It went on and on and on, and it was too long. Some of it was interesting, and the end was good. But the middle of the book was pretty much pointless. I enjoyed her characters, just thought it could have been shortened by a lot. I just bought one more Sandra Brown book and if she doesn't pick up with another good one, she goes on my list of one hit wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Romance Novel","review":"This was my first and last Sandra Brown book.

Until White Hot all of her books were reliable page turners in interesting settings.This is the first book of hers where every character was despicable except a former high school quarterback who is in a minor role. The heroine's actions were not credible given her description. The revelation regarding another main character came too late to be satisfying unless one read the entire book again to see where things might have been interpreted differently. Who has time for that?!If you like Sandra Brown skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Hot","review":"Great book. Sandra Brown is not only an original author but a great one...

This album has a little of each western European country's music from the medieval period. Though three or four of the recordings aren't of the best quality recording (the musicians are top notch, it just sounds like an old recording) It was an excellent purchase. I initially purchased it because I was buying anything by the Ensemble Unicorn, and found several other ensembles on this cd I enjoyed just as much.

I had been very interested in reading the series of (10) books Envanovich has but when I received this one I figured what a better way to see if I like her writing style.The Rocky Road to Romance was a fun and quick read, unlike many books I have read who take 150 pages to explain what Evanovich writes in 50. That's not to say she is skimping out on anything, the book was fabulous and I wish it didn't end.I agree with the other reviews where if you want to get away/ or take a break from the other \\"meatier\\" books, this is the book to do it with!ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanovich has written much much better","review":"Daisy is a grad student with far too many balls in the air (and jobs for that matter).

It was so difficult trying to comprehend complex formulas when the examples given arent even correct! Wrong values, wrong, math, wrong symbols, mislabeling...and we're only to chapter 30 so far.Simple things are OVER covered to the point of exhaustion, but when the chapter on filters came up, there was nothing to give examples of how to figure out how to do the problems at the end of the chapter.

I hoped it would expand and enlighten my own unarticulated thoughts on the human animal, and its disconnect from the natural world. I was so disappointed that the book, in my opinion, failed to really explore and run with this large and very important issue. I found the writing difficult, and it often seemed that Livingston was writing for an academic journal, and was mainly interested in discussing and rebutting esoteric points with his fellow ecologists, rather than exploring a larger and broader view of his subject for the general audience to whom the book was intended. I found the book tedious and repetitive, and a chore to read. The infrequent moments when the author did actually write clearly about his larger theme of humans as a species cut off from nature tended to be sarcastic quips against society, which I thought diminished the points he was trying to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Apart","review":"I bought a pair of Justin boots approximately six months ago, although not worn that frequently, the seams joining the front halves of the uppers to the rear are coming apart.

Her songwriting is also excellent and consistent throughout this set. She has a knack for taking some of our most universally shared feelings and setting them lyrically in a unique musical setting. In \\"River Canyon\\" she sings, \\"In time the river smoothes edges once so rough the way love softens places in the heart.\\" I have two favorites on the set. The first is the slow \\"Jessie (Going Through)\\" that reflects on the experiences a child goes through when their parents divorce and how they carry those feelings with them into adulthood. Her melody is gorgeous and distinctive. On \\"One Step at a Time\\" she gets a beat going with another beautifully unique melody, \\"We'll climb & go higher, higher, oh, and the sun goes down on the valley below.\\" Tucker alternates between slow melodic tunes and midtempo toe tappers. This is a sweet folk gem you will not want to miss!

Back in the LP days, Antal Dorati recorded this symphony with a London pickup orchestra for Mercury. It is one of the greatest Haydn recordings ever made.

There is so much education, information, and beauty in this book, that it is not a expenditure as much as it is an investment.This is a book that can fit into any mood you may have on a day to day basis. From the tragic action of Beowulf to the sentiment of Milton to the comedy of Chaucer. This is a book for a lifetime, not a semester.Pundits who criticize NAEL for it's \\"perceived\\" over coverage of poetry, are being short-sighted and unappreciative. One should not question the quantity of literature, but the quality. Those same people would probably criticize Dickens and Steinbeck for being too \\"wordy\\".This book is a must-have for anyone with the smallest amount of passion for English Literature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"like other posts have said, the idea is cool, however, the product is defective.

I tried 2 different brands of batteries (yes, I used all 3, I know theres a battery compartment on the back), and it doesn't work. Unfortunately I didn't get to use it until about 2 months after I bought it, so it's not under the 30 day warranty the company offers.

It does eat batteries rather quickly, so do make sure to have extra ones on hand. I wish it had a stronger vibration, but the 3 speeds it does have are just fine.

Now I just need to see if it can withstand the test of time. The clit stimulator is in just the right place and I like the fact that there are no bunny ears to irritate. I could move it freely and have no pinches or pulls. Definitely gets the job done quickly and is fairly quite until you turn on the rotation. Then it's a little noisy.

I need pretty slim vibes, and this one has a really good circumference (not as slim as a normal slim vibe, but not as thick as a typical one). The vibration and rotation sttings are wonderful, I love that they can work individualy or together. One of the best things about it its that its very quiet! I have roommates but I'm sure no one can hear the vibe in my house, especially if I keep music or the tv on. I like this line of vibes and they all seem to have that quality.My one problem with it is that the shaft is too long vs. the clitoral stimulator. I can't get the stimulator anywhere near my clitoris. But I have a relitively shallow vagina, so this probably isn't the case for anyone. But I have to use another vibe in addition, so it is a pointless feature for me.And on the smell...I've never really noticed it. Once when I was in the tub, but it wasn't so stron that it bothered me."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks great.. too bad it doesn't work","review":"Well, this is the second doc johnson product I've ordered.

I thought maybe the batteries were bad so I got new ones and tried those.. still nothing. I shook the product gently... tried holding it at different angles, pressing the buttons lightly.. holding the buttons.. turning the dial/cap.. and it was as dead as it could be. So.. I'm sunk.

The vibrator featured multiple settings and worked very well. One of the nice features of the product was that it was waterproof, which made cleaning it very easy. Battery life was okay--about one hour of use before the three Triple A batteries needed to be changed.Then it broke after 2 months of very intermittent. The vibrator would simply not turn on. Changing the batteries did not fix the problem.This is certainly NOT a value, in my mind. I would recommend looking for a more dependable vibrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful...but doesn't hit the spot","review":"I was super stoked to get this from my fiance for Christmas since I own another Lucid Dreams product...however when I broke it out of the package and tried it out I was rather disappointed. It wasn't quite thick enough for my liking, nor long enough to reach my g-spot. The clit stimulator didn't hit my clit. :-( It is rather powerful and I do like the rotating head, but it didn't hit the spots it should have quite right. It's not nearly as thick as the picture makes it seem, but I also like them really thick and long. It also is rather loud! Even on the lowest setting it is louder than other vibrators I have had. I overall gave it a 2 star since it was quite powerful and I do like the rotating head, but it didn't hit the right spots and is much louder than it was claimed to be. Overall I was quite disappointed. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy.. these guys are getting rich off of defective merchandise.","review":"Brand new right out of the box ( and wow does it stink ) with brand new batteries right out of the package and nothing.no power, no spark.. no nothing..Thank you \\"sucker\\".. no returns is what they are saying.I will never buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This was a total waste of money.

I never did really use the rotating funciton, it makes an odd noise and it really didn't do anything for me. I love that the clitoral bit doesn't have anything extra to it and is smooth.

It contains three of the most popular musical works for children, by famous composers, which are accompanied by narration. The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of John Lanchbery, performs admirably. But the really outstanding thing about the disc is the narrations. Barry Humphries performs them all. Or, rather, Barry Humphries being 'Dame Edna Everage' performs two of them and the third one is performed by Barry Humphries being Barry Humphries. For many people, his moving narration of 'The Story of Babar, the Little Elephant' will come as a delightful surprise because they have never heard his 'real' voice before.

It is full of factual and logical fallacies that sound good and could be disasterous for public policy and debate if followed.

Welcome to the world of the self-employed. Read the comments of others, and you will understand the message. Basically, the world is changing, labor is cheaper in the 3rd world (duh!) and you better learn new skills. The other 400 pages are examples.

This is a sensationalist book for non-economists who wish to sound like they know economics.The premisse is that the world will be in trouble because productivity is rising too fast (faster than demand) and so prices will plummet, so will earnings, and so will standards of living. This is the old argument that leads to the conclusion that one day robots will do it all and there will be nothing for humans to do. It is an argument that has been refuted, as it is clear that, as soon as we are able to produce more of something than we can consume, we move on to produce other things that are needed. The author assumes there is a limit to things and services that can be produced, which has not been the case and there is no reason to believe that it will be.This is inane economics for the populist mind at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Globalists Disavow this book","review":"This is a well written book. Congratulations Mr. Greider. However, his anaylsis is of the worst kind. He takes a kernel of truth and constructs a scenario wholly devoid of critical thinking: so he is not an academian. However, he has a reponsibility to present valid, relevant, concrete examples to support his scenario. Instead we get a vaugue book filled with easily debunked innuendo. If you are truly against globalism, then do not use this book to support your agenda, your arguements will be ignored at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent clarity for economist and layman alike","review":"How refreshing it is that in a nation with a plethora of spin doctors we find a person who writes succinctly and without hyperebola about our current economic and political reality. While he does not give us any clear direction about what to do about unfettered global capitalism, he does give us access to information generally hidden by the media moguls about what has been happening in a seemingly irrational world. He does give us anecdotes to deregulation; but, I agree that they have little probability of happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles: just can't get enough...","review":"Fans of the Beatles who can't get enough in the way of biographical coverages won't want to miss WE ALL WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD: THE LIFE OF JOHN LENNON.

This biography is published to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death and discusses his Irish roots for the first time, packing vintage black and white and color photos into a survey of the music and the man.

Ugh. I just wanted to slap him for being dumb. The only character I was halfway interested in was the crackhead and it wasn't even necessary to make him a crackhead.

The events that happened just weren't very believable and the characters didn't have any depth. Plus I didn't like the fact that he used stars to cover up the curse words, like we're not smart enough to know they're curse words. If you don't want to write the curse word, then don't use it. I found the plot to be very silly, and it took me forever to finish it because it was kinda boring. I wish I could take it back to the store and get my $13 back because it's definitely not worth it.

It ends with a promotion of activism and a description of a gay Latino organization that is fighting the disease. Every GLM that I know in San Francisco owns a copy and every gay person of color should go out and buy one for themselves.

But!The movie succeeds on many other levels that make it a great, epic fantasy adventure. The director has done a great job in composing the whole thing the right way-by building up tension, enriching the storyline with new characters that all contribute in one way or another to the grand finale, revealing the mystery surrounding the hero and the plot itself step by step and delivering a great message at the end.

I have to get up and turn it off until I get cold. Then I have to get up and turn it on until I get too hot. This is an advance?

The safety features are good but are kind of for show if you ask me. If the heater is on its side then I don't need a little light to tell me thats whats wrong and the same if something is in front of the heater, If the heaters not on then I could see that something is touching it before I could see the light. Another thing is it boasts that it can heat a medium size room but we had to put it in the smallest room in the house. And lastly, it quit working all together after only three weeks.

Many of the building blocks he mentions are applicable to other genre's and this DVD, overall, will give you much to think about and expand on. My enthusiasm is partly because based on other DVD's of this series I've seen (see below), this one really surprised and enlightened me, setting a standard that few of the others have reached.*As an addendum, stay away from anything by Richard Walter. His DVD lectures are useless and comprised of the most imbecilic, idiotic and useless observations as well as his annoying habit of continually running off on inane tangents.

I was EXTREMELY dissapointed.A lot of what the movie said and showed simply wasn\`t true! Flower\`s sister Petal was killed by a goshawk not a snake. They changed the name Bulgarion to Titan and Ziziphus to Regan. They completely left out Flower\`s cousin Risca\`s one-year reign as leader of the Whiskers. Zaphod and Yossarian were Vivian rovers not Lazuli, and when they joined Whiskers they joined with six other Vivian males. Flower did not win her first battle with the Lazuli, she lost it. The movie needed more action (it was to slow moving) . Plus this movie does not show enough of Flower\`s early leadership. Flower, Vialli, Holly, Yossarian, Zaphod, Argon, and the other meerkats aren\`t played by the meerkats there supposed to be. Flower is played by six different females.

The Seasons 1, 2 and 3, I agree, is a tribute to Flower, the matriarch of the Whiskers clan of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert. But on the last season the film tries to continue the story with Flowers' daughter Mozart. They show the troubles of the clan without a strong matriarch as Flower.The work of the reserarchers that make this movies possible was great. I like meerkats and I recomend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie is not a tribute to Flower. It is not even factual.

The value for me was that these are real, down to earth, practical principles which we can adopt to try to model the leadership behavior of such a great man.

The thoughts and paragraphs jump around as though the manuscript was put together from scrambled notes. Much better to actually buy the writings of Winston Churchill and hear his story in his own words. I got much more about reading a three page account of Churchill's crash while learning how to fly from one of his early books than I got out of this entire book.

This is not a biography in the traditional sense of the word, no; it is a vicious hatchet job.Through his persistently negative line of attack and dependence on unnamed or biased sources Goldman paints the ugliest portrait of Elvis imaginable. But he doesn't stop there. His depiction of Elvis's parents as the \\"Beverly Hillbillies\\" and his condescending reconstruction of the sort of gospel show that inspired the young Elvis could even be considered racist.In short, \\"Elvis\\" by Albert Goldman is a thoroughly despicable book, written IMO by a thoroughly despicable man -- hold your nose and read it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Credible","review":"This biography reveals more truths about Albert Goldman than it does about Elvis Presley.An experienced reader will quickly detect Goldman's biases and turn instead to a credible writer to learn the truth about Elvis.Goldman's greatest skill is in finding unflattering words in his thesaurus.Ultimately, Albert Goldman discredits not Elvis Presley but himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash! trash! trash!","review":"This book, is completely worthless.

I would like to see how many records Albert Goldman could have sold (cetainly not over a billion world wide) or do a concert via statellite that was watched by over a billion people. And most of all, be accepted into the Country, Gospel, and Rock n' Roll Hall of Fames. No other entertainer has ever done of any these things and never will. But Elvis Presley did. Besides being a wonderful entertainer, Elvis Presley served his country, respected his parents and took care of them, loved his family, was a good friend, and cared about his music and his fans.

I mean, yes, I disagree with the fact that some story elements are missing, Mood and the Example Of Play section for example leaves you kind of lost.Call me Technocratic, but I feel that the Paradox system is efficient, and the read overall isn't as confusing as most players can rumor it to be. \\"It's like rolling dice to a freakin' VCR manual!\\" I got the substance out of this book, but the actual purpose of a Mage after the Ascension War is still hazy to me...Which actually leaves a player with more reason to become an Ecstatic.

First of all, there are new rules concerning Avatar Winds, a bogus idea that makes crossing the gauntlet harder for magi. Second, the traditions are now almost the same, only varying in their beliefs and specialty spheres. In the old version, Cultists of Ecstasy got all level 1 spheres as always active, but no more. They also cut out a lot of information concerning talismans, sanctums, familiars, and such. I will admit that the rules have been clarified, and that they made Paradox a greater threat, but they did not bring back the rotes list like I wished they would, and only barely even mention that rotes exist. In all, I'd say to go for the second-edition if you can get your hands on it. It is a much better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The writers obviously did not understand what Mage is all about.

Or at least, someday, their cause might win, even if they do not. In this version of Mage, that 'hope' is gone. The Ascension War is lost, and all your character does is sneak around, living his or her little life. Not much of a higher purpose involved there.I haven't purchased the book, just flipped through it at a bookstore and looked at a friends. I wouldn't spend a dime on this travesty.

I don't know what White Wolf was thinking when they put this together but it completely ruins the game as a playable system. The only possible chronicles that could come out of it are either Technocratic ones or Tradition ones involving the overthrowing of the Technocracy.It was a definate given that the Technocracy would eventually win the Ascension War, but it was altogether a concept that should have been left up to the Storytellers and players to decide. But this book gives no leeway in the World of Darkness for mage players to evolve any sense of creativity or spontanaeity without serious repercussions from paradox. And nobody likes that much.My suggsetion is that you just stick with the Second Edition rules and system and say the ]heck] with the Third.

However, I find the glider to be overly loud (not the music, but the motor). In addition I find the motion to be jerky rather than smooth as the name suggests. My baby does seem to enjoy the gliding motion sometimes, hence the two stars. However, the motion is so jerky that when the baby has just eaten, I cannot put him in the glider with motion or he'll spit up his milk.Also, I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the base is so heavy as to make moving the glider or using it on a table impossible or at least not feasible."},{"rating":"1","title":"To BIG buy a bouncer","review":"I got this for my baby shower and was excited to try it out.

Nothing will keep a baby asleep longer than one of these.Cons: Heavy - can't really move them around easily. I have had 3 of these over the course of having 3 kids. They all seem to develop black spots on the pad under the top cushion. It looks like a mildew. Since the middle does not come out you can't get it as clean as you might wish. That being said - we were able to throw it into the wash and it was fine. You just need to clean it beyond a surface clean if your baby is spitting up or has a diaper leak. If you buy it used - just go to the Fisher Price website and buy a new cover for $12.I know the mildew comment will freak many of you out and prevent you from buying it.

First of all, it's HUGE. Secondly, it's increeeeeeedibly loud. Not the song - the motors working. I couldn't believe it! We tried it two times with my son and he hated it. I couldn't fathom turning this on because of the noise. Try to go and hear it for yourself before you buy it.... perhaps if you're looking for white noise, this would work for you.

I did contact the company, who claimed the product was not defective and offered me the option of purchasing a replacement cover for an additional cost.

I put a set of cheap D batteries in it that I paid $1 for at Target the day I brought her home 10 days ago. We run it all night long on low and the batteries seem to be going strong still.

While I imagine this bumper sticker is probably not the best way to make friends--and mental disorders indeed are not a joking matter at least not close to my vicinity--it still remains that even if it WERE 'politically correct' and NOT misinformed... the joke itself is still plainly not funny.(And I won't even go into the hideous font and color.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Make Sense","review":"I'm all for making fun of people, but this message is not clever because it does not make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasing","review":"The liner notes say he studied with Ireland and was influenced by Sibelius. Really? I hear the sweetness of the former, but not the Scandinavian's complexity. Instead, I hear a man who delighted in being a sponge and integrater (ok, not a word, but it should be). There is Debussy, Faure and even Smetana here, but always with a kind of British crispness overlaid. When he goes folk, he looks west across the Atlantic, not over his shoulder at the Slavs. That keeps the piece dreamy, but reformist. The G Major is a special kind of synthesis of compositional strengths and will stay with you for some time (the Adagio presages a significant theme in Shosti's 8th St Qt). The playing is critical here, since the pieces, often gently romantic, might easily go mushy without the interpreter's respect. Maggini does it right. And those liner notes mention a Cello Concerto written for the composer's wife.

This was by far the worst. It is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, and the illustrations are very poor and difficult to decipher. I got this book because it includes three practice tests, but I found over 20 factual errors in either the questions or answers in the practice tests (and those were just the ones I caught! I hate to think about how many there were that I didn't catch). Many of the questions were unclear and grammatically problematic, so that much of my time was spent simply trying to figure out what the question was trying to ask.This book needs an editor badly! As it is, it is a crime they take money for it. As far as I am concerned, you would be better off not buying a book at all than buying this piece of [stuff] and receiving bad information."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST review book.","review":"This was far and away the absolute worst review book I have ever seen for anything. It was full of poorly worded questions with even worse answer explanations. Tons of spelling and grammatical errors and other mistakes, like an answer being listed with the wrong letter. Is the letter or the answer correct? Who knows? These people need an editor, or need to go back to grade school. I can't believe they publish this book without spell checking it. Very frustrating to attempt to study out of this.

Some sections of it repeat almost verbatim other sections, while some sections gloss over important bits entirely. The entire section on plant biology is only 10 pages long. If you think you might need to know anything about plants, try another book. The diagrams aren't very helpful either. There are better Biology review books out there. Try \\"Biology Made Simple\\" by Rita Mary King for a very basic overview of biology or try \\"Biology The Easy Way\\" from Barrons which is much more in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible horrible horrible book","review":"I don't even know where to begin with this book. Its written in granny print so just because the book looks huge and full of information its because the font is big enough for you to read from 10 feet away. Has very little information and this is evident when you start taking the \\"practice\\" exams in the back of the book. Sure they explain the answers but you wouldn't be able to find any of them in their so called \\"comprehensive\\" review. The practice tests are full of spelling, grammar, and answer errors. The tests don't even closely resemble the format of the GRE practice book. In the practice book from ETS there are approximately 40 questions based on data analysis, the tests in this study book contain 4. This book was a rip-off. Shame on the publisher for releasing such an unrefined piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Warriors Highly Recommended","review":"In his year-end column for World War II Magazine, book review editor Robert Citino selected American Warriors as one of the best World War II books of the year. I agree. History books should be informative, accurate and readable; American Warriors is all of these and more. The author brings to light the military careers of five of our recent presidents, highlighting their naval service in the Pacific. Extensively end-noted, American Warriors draws on interviews with more than 100 veterans who served with the presidents as well as on a comprehensive bibliography of primary sources. Folklore has no place in this well-researched book. Presidential scholars will find it a dependable resource; more casual readers will find it swift paced and enjoyable. I highly recommend American Warriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"My wife loves this comforter. The eyelet is very nice and it comes with two shams and a bed ruffle.

Also, one of the shams has a yellow stain on the back of it. I am using it as a blanket under a really nice comforter that I remove at night whenI go to bed, so these problems don't bother me and the shams and the bedskirt are not being used.

But since they aren't insulated, I always need to wrap them in a small towel just so my bag doesn't get wet whenever we take it for short trips.Anyway, just this morning I gave DD her new Playtex cup and added maybe 2 blocks of ice to make her drinks a little bit cooler but after few minutes the bottle started to \\"sweat\\"..

They are nicely insulated and fit the hand well. However, when knocked over they leak. Granted, when they hit, only a couple of drops fly out. But if left on their side they seep liquid.

I love that they are insulated, cute, and especially that they are actually spill proof.After and emergency room visit with my 18 month old this past week my opinion on these sippy cups have drastically changed. I no longer care if a sippy cup is cute, insulated or, spill proof. All I care about is that it is safe for an active toddler to use.My little girl while scooting off her seat (low height) fell catching herself with her hand that held the sippy. The sippy ended up breaking the skin under my daughter's jawline so bad that she needed 2 layers of stitches-a total of 15 stitches.I know the possibility of this happening again is probably slim to none but I felt the obligation as a mom to let otherr parents whose little ones use these sippies or are thinking of getting them are just aware of a possible safety issue with this sippy and an active toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spill proof","review":"My girls have had tons of brands of sippys that would spill over time due to them chewing the part they drink from. This is great because even if they did chew on it it wouldn't effect the part inside that keeps it from dripping. My girls love drinking from these cups and pretending they have coffee since they look so much like coffe tumblers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus for Quoting Eudora Welty","review":"As might be clear from the title, this is Southern folk, shot through with memory and heat. Kate Campbell quotes Eudora Welty on the fusion of past and present, living and dead. One song includes sound bites from George Wallace and Martin Luther King, whose voices -- espousing and denouncing segregation -- sound remarkably alike. Some of the songs are excellent, particularly in the second half of the play list -- Jerusalem Inn, Trains Don't Run From Nashville, and -- ending the CD on the best note -- Bury Me in Bluegrass. All that said, there's a torpor here too, not a whole lot of passion expended in the playing or the singing and a couple of very weak songs -- Locust Years, the album's shortest cut, seems endless and trite. Good, but makes me wonder if she challenges herself more on some of her other recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trip to Amateur Night","review":"Songs from the Levee is one of those CDs that I should like, but just can't.

The girl is the smartest, one boy a bit nerdy, and the other eats a lot!! Sound familiar to anyone who has read Harry Potter! Instead of a mark on the boys head, as in Harry Potter, the boy in this story has a mark on his hand. In J.K. Rowlings books, the evil is referred to as the \\"Dark Lord\\", in this series, they are called the \\"Dark Hand\\". Also, there is a dragon in the 3rd book, that has absolutely NO bearing on anything in the story whatsoever so what is the point of putting him into the story at all? I was VERY disappointed with this series and would NOT recommend it to anyone. I am surprised it was even published. Emily Drake is definitely just a J.K. Rowling wannabee.

The characters are dull, the dialogue is so ridiculous it's laughable, and the plot goes nowhere. I can't believe I waded through to the end of it, hoping it would get better.Does anyone want a free copy of the second book in the series?

No book has touched me to the core at this point in my journey than \\"Telling Secrets\\" - for Buechner has pricked my heart like no other.In an unassuming style and a tender but poingient language, Buechner draws out of the reader their own secrets, portraying the healing that comes from vulnerability, and helping us become human along the way.This is not merely a Christian or spiritual book, but a book wrapped around humanity which encompasses our faith, feelings, hearts, minds and bodies.Thank you Fredrick for your secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, good condition","review":"This book was shipped to me very quickly, and was in very good condition, with a small amount of highlighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like quality older sounding stuff but this is nothing specially at all.","review":"Really thought one song outstanding and the rest blah or not worth listening to.

Content-wise, there are a range of themes and topics covered--this book deals with both practical worship leading tips as well as theology of worship issues; it is a real handbook and thoughtprovoker for any worship leader, and a great resource for your worship team--the chapters are short enough you could read them at the opening of your rehearsals to help your team come together in unity and grapple with the deeper issues of worship.

The journey of Edna Elaine Moses from being the wife and representant of satan, to becoming saved by the Lord. Many of rebecca Brown's concepts are antibiblical, they are not supported by the bible. Dr. Rebecca Brown or should I say \\"Ruth Bailey\\" has misinterpreted or misunderstood the bible. We don't need to lie in order to preach.

Interplay offered little or no forethought to the sophiscation of it's audience. Jazz like this is so limited in scope that it is positively uninspired. Jessica Williams saves the day and her piano genius transcends the obvious lack of talent in the rhythm-section. Interplay is a disappointment to die-hard jazz fans everywhere, and certainly won't inspire today's youthful audience. Too bad for the ever diminishing Bay Area jazz scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first P.D.James and I loved it!","review":"Somehow, I missed reading any of James' books, but I hope to rectify that soon! This book was well written - an intriguing mystery with a satisfying ending that didn't disappoint the reader. A young, lovely maid with an unsavory past is found dead in her bed - after making a startling announcement to her employers and their friends. Enter Adam Dalgliesh, detective extrordinaire, to sift through the evidence and come up with the solution. A good read - I recommend it to mystery lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first P. D. James book","review":"I must confess to never really being a P. D. James fan. Several years ago I began to read one of her books (can't remember which one) and found it so dull that I put it down and didn't read another of her works for many years. Figuring that her first book might be a bit more easily read I picked it up, and enjoyed it very much. It's rather the typical English murder mystery that was being published in the '50s and '60s, when this one was written. It involves a murder at the home of relatively wealthy folks, with a locked door mystery, and abundant suspects. The ending was the usual \\"gather all the suspects into one room and have the detective unravel the crime scenario for them\\". Even though it is typical, she did put a bit of her own spin on the tale, and that's probably what made it stand out at the time of publishing. There's really nothing in it to make one think that this writer was a great new talent, but it is enjoyable none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover Her Face.

Adhering to a classical mystery novel plot style, James gives us the skeleton of a book with no special characteristics whatsoever, and in the process robs the reader of any reason to go on reading. Absolutely nothing about this book captured my interest: the plot was weak, the characters were vague and stereotyped, even the prose lacked charm. I didn't care whodunnit!

I'm surprised that the rest of the Dalgliesh books got published after this snoozer.

I suppose it's not her fault that the book is poorly edited (I'm picky that way) - but the characters are never developed to any significant extent. Even at the end of the book I hadn't developed any attachment to any of the characters. I don't think it's my lack of experience with post-war England - but James doesn't go to much effort to describe the emotional underpinnings that help the reader unfamiliar with the social circumstances to feel an emotional bond. I feel more connected to Jane Austen's characters, centuries distant, than I do to James' decades distant characters. I may give her one more shot, but I will probably look elsewhere for a new mystery writer to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish..","review":"This has to be her worst novel.

The plot was seamless and flawless. The only slight annoyance to me was the conventional end-game parlor convocation of suspects, which did, however, have the benefit of providing a review of a complicated plot. The dialogue was witty and natural, unlike the work of many more recent, less gifted authors. James is in same class as Sayers, Marsh, Murdoch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pulp Fiction Philosopher","review":"P.D. James combines wonderful plotting, page turning style and bits of philosophical insights centered around a rock solid protagonist, Adam Dalgliesh.

Unfortunately that's all she utilizes. Concepts such as character development, plot, pacing, and good storytelling are neglected.

The beginning song is great, the rest are not so bad. I'm giving it a 9 / 10, because not every movie's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every girls dream","review":"Well i am a big girl here - 31 - so I can't comment on the toys education or durability as it doesn't need to be those things to me.

In fact the bonus episode The Final Decision may be one of the best X-men episodes, but come on. I wish they'd start releasing the whole series on DVD. The way they've done it, they're just teasing all of the fans out there. Throwing us a bone every now and then.I think there were probably some episodes that might have given us more insight into Wolverine than some of these did. Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape would have been a good one, but They're still good episodes. I love the commentary. It's very good, although he could be a little more relevant at times. I'd say over all it's an excellent DVD, picture and sound are great. It's just too little, but it's not too late. If they'd get a TV station to start showing this again, peak some interest in the young kids, they could sell the whole series on DVD and it would sell great. It's one of the greatest cartoon series of all time and they should market it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffer Stuff","review":"First Off this DVD only has 5 episodes1. Out of the Past2. Out of the Past II3. Nightcrawler4. The Lotus and the Steel5. The Final Decision (Bonus)Only 1 episode really has to do with Wolverine. The rest is fluff. In \\"Out of the Past\\" Part one we see how Wolverine got his claws. In \\"Lotus and the Steel\\" he goes back to a monastery in Japan. In the third and fifth episode, Wolverine is just a regular X-men. This DVD is just a way the studio can make a quick buck because of the X-men 2 Movie hype. The X-men Animated Series is great and should be released as a BOX SET, not single discs. But getting back to the DVD. There are other episodes that are probably better for this DVD. Like ��Red Dawn�� with Omega Red, ��Repo Man�� which tells of his claws and time with Alpha Flight. ��Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape�� tells of his time as Weapon X. And ��Old Soldiers�� which is about his adventures in WWII with Captain America. But technically the transfers to dvd look clean and crisp."},{"rating":"1","title":"we need boxsets","review":"This is exactly why Amazon needs to make a deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

Dr. Kelsey was a rude, cold female lead who only really liked Conor for sex. She didn't want to be with him because she thought he'd only think of her as a sex fling and still have other women.

It is very difficult to approach these works (esp. the Missa Prolationum) with a larger ensemble knowing that the beauty of the work lies in its subtleties. This is very difficult to achieve with a larger group of singers, no matter how professionally they are trained. This is best accomplished by a smaller ensemble. In this case I would direct the listener to a recording of the Missa Prolationum by the Hilliard Ensemble on EMI (EMI 7497982). This is the best performance I have heard of this work. Virtually everything else is a let down. If you don't believe me, find the Hilliard Ensemble work and compare for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"No continuity, no racing, just clips.

To be honest, I found myself a bit disappointed with Modesitt. The previous books of this series were easy going, straight forward, and a pleasure to read. \\"Fall of Angels,\\" however, immediately immerses you up to your ears in fabricated technilogical terms and ideas. I, personally, found it so boring, and difficult to follow, two or three times I thought I'd just throw the book away. Fortunately, I gave Mr. Modesitt the benefit of the doubt, and was richly rewarded. Anyway, rather than giving a vivid account of the pages within, I leave it to the readers to judge for themselves.

However, he alone can't carry this whole show. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is painful to hear.

His convincible, vulnerable Quixote touches the heart and soul with \\"The Impossible Dream\\", and he sings a stunning rendition of \\"Dulcinea\\". Mastrantonio's voice leaves some to be desired, uncommitted and shaky on some songs but strong and vibrant in others. Sabella is a great Sancho, but whenever I hear him I still hear Pumbaa :) All in all, even if the show is lacking, Stokes' voice is beautiful and anyone who appreciates Broadway will appreciate this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this version like a plague","review":"This is the ugliest version of La Mancha I heard. I was excited when it was released by amazon.com, only to be disappointed by Mitchell's singing. He is so overacting, like an amateur has been who had seen better days. His impossible dream is so loud, not idealistic, but brash and loud. The duldinea in this version is all screetching. The orchestration is also pedestrian. It doesnt help differentiate the reality from the \\"dream\\". La Mancha should be a story within a story, i was expecting an orchestration with many levels, this is simply flat and boring. Save your money on something else. This is in the same league with another boring re-release, Denise van Outen's Tell Me on a Sunday.

I've never read Nicholas Sparks before but I loved The Notebook (movie) so I thought I'd give this one a try. Right away, I was bored. All the characters were too nice, doing everything in everyone else's best interest, pretty much all the time. I didn't feel a deep connection between ANY of the characters. I think Sparks was trying to portray love at its highest form, where everyone thinks of other people's needs first, but it just didn't work for me. No excitement. John was so good and \\"reformed\\" that he barely wanted to kiss Savannah. And yet, he blows up over her suggestion regarding his father (whom he never felt particularly close to). He falls in love too fast, is then scared to act on it, and the story overall feels like it was trying too hard. I'm hoping the movie will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Notebook meets The Bridges of Madison County!","review":"This was a realistic tale of two-star crossed lovers. I enjoyed reading it immensely! The only way to describe it is that it's The Notebook meets The Bridges of Madison County.

So while I like the idea and storyline of \\"Dear John\\" I just simply did not think the execution was very good. The writing was amateurish and the characters were all very one-dimensional. I would like to see what a more capable writer could do with this same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"The thing that made me not want to read the book right off the bat was the fact that he gives away the ending in the prologue. The plot was ok, but it was just too predictable. Nicholas Sparks becomes very monotonous in his writing at times, which makes reading some of his books tedious. Honestly, this book made me mad with the way it ended. Not one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT READ REVIEWS","review":"#1 I read reviews to see if people with similar taste in reading liked or disliked a book. I read the reviews of Dear John and realized that about every third review gives away an important plot detail. Kind of like people telling you parts of a movie before you see it. Please don't ruin the experience for others.#2 Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author. He is the king of romance, however he is not a soldier. He does not know the military, and while I praise him for the dedication of the book, his lack of knowledge is painfully obvious to the 3 military guys who read his books. It isn't that bad, and if you aren't in the Army or haven't been to Iraq, his descriptions are just fine. Above all, the story is incredible. It's a heart wrenching, tear-inducing, smile provoking, unconditional love type romance that he is famous for and does so well. It does leave you wanting a part two. The end is bittersweet and you don't know weather to be happy, sad, or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Book Yet","review":"I bought this book the day it came out, as I always do with his novels. I have liked all of his books, but this one I LOVE! This story will get right to your heart and make it melt. The characters seem so real, like you actually knew them.

They always seem to \\"grab\\" me and not let go until I'm finished. This one however, didn't hold my interest.I don't really know what happened with this book. Was it written to fulfill a contract obligation? It's not like a true Sparks' novel at all.First of all, I didn't care for the characters. I felt nothing for John or the vacuous Savannah. It was just so much filler. Too much going to war, waiting at home, it seemed to be just something to fill up the page.I did feel a little for John's dad. I felt sorry for him and truly hated it when he died.But going into a Sparks novel you know someone is going to die. And it usually breaks your heart. I usually care, I usually cry, this didn't warrant that.I gave it only one star because I know Mr. Sparks is capable of so much more. Hopefully, we will see that before long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad","review":"Great read just another tear jerker.

She turns out to be a vacuous, spoiled, selfish brat who leads John on. It progressed slowly, with characters that were just unlikeable. It was trite and quite frankly Johns self defeatist attitude was just as annoying as Savannah's falseness. Just a waste of time and money. Sparks books are usually good but this one has the tone of a novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment and very depressing","review":"I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning, but horrible ending.","review":"Thought this book would be a good romance, which it was @ first. but then took a horrible turn. I HATED the ending!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear John","review":"This book is a true tear jerk-er, no doubt, but it's also a wonderful story of an impossible yet unwavering love between two people and an even more wonderful story of love and understanding between father and son. If your looking for a cookie cutter happy ending love story this may not be your book, but if your looking for undying, unconditional love this book is worth a try. I will read this book again one day and it will remain in my permanent library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better romances out there","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. It felt rushed and shallow from John's perspective. I didn't get the depth of feeling that normally accompany a plot like this. Instead it felt like a chronology of events from when they meet until the end. And although I enjoyed the premise and found the ending sad I felt it an appropriate ending. It was about the only thing I truly felt was done right. I doubt I will go see the movie now, since I only read the book because the movie looked good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you like cliche","review":"I have read many Nicholas Sparks books and for the most part have enjoyed them. I loved the notebook and I am always hoping that he will write another book along those lines. This book is over the top and very dissapointing! I found myself skimming and skipping pages of the book and a general feeling of annoyance as I read. One of the main problems with this book is that it is so cliche it is ridiculous! Almost every page is filled with either a cliche sappy romance scene or overkill on tragedies and the worst part is the way it ends. I felt like it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real love","review":"It's about the real love, you can see how love its the most important thing.You will cry, laugh and even get mad. The movie is so bad... nothing like reading the book.Is the cain of a story that you will remember for ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear John","review":"I loved this book. I run hot and cold on Sparks, but thought this one was a real winner. The plot is very engaging and his writing style is delightful to read. I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the character's actions (e.g. Savannah not waiting for John) were disappointing, but I could get past that because I was so wrapped up in the story. I really felt like I knew these people and I could actually understand her decision, even if it was a choice I wish she hadn't made. I would love to read a sequel to this book!Bottom line: Nicholas Sparks at his finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed reading Dear John. It's not just about John and Savannah's romance but also about John's relationship with his father and how over time it evolves into something much better than they had before. Sparks does a good job of showing that although mistakes can be made in a person's youth, it doesn't mean they're a lost cause. On a negative note, I wasn't real happy with the ending. John's a nice guy but the ends a little unbelievable no matter how nice he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed. Not a fun or flowing read","review":"I was disappointed in that it was a very hard read. The flow was not easy nor natural. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. But not in this instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always a fan, but not my favorite","review":"I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and have read every one of his books many times over. I was really anticipating this book, but felt disappointed while reading it. The writing style is very casual, awkward and lacking \\"spark\\" between John and Savannah. It often seemed more like a stiff, researched play by play of the day in the life of a soldier rather than a classic Sparks love story. The most redeeming quality of this book is the love story that developed between John and his father, which moved me to tears. Although this turned out to be my least favorite Sparks book, I will not hesitate to pick up the next one on release day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear john","review":"This book was amazing. It made me cry, and although I wish some things could have been different I loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It dragged...","review":"Didn't care for it much, haven't watched the movie either even though I love Channing. Sorry but It dragged way to long for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"After all of that development of how much they loved each other, Parts II and III just ruined it. It skimmed through 9/11 and the war, and why he stayed in the military longer. That was put in the story just as a little interlude of why he didn't come home at the end of his service. There was no depth or feeling about what that meant for anyone. Then, all of the sudden she found someone new, and when he returns, low and behold, she's married to Tim who happens to be dying? Wait, what just happened here? I didn't find what any of them did as a sign of true love. John, Savannah, and Tim suddenly became victims of their own selfish thoughts in the name of loving the other too much for their own good. Selling his Dad's coins for that? Stealing John's girl? Dumping John because he hasn't come home yet... to be with your best friend instead? I give it 2 stars because the love seemed like it had great promise to mean so much more, and it fizzled at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing and not beleivable","review":"i think that this is a classic case of purposely trying to give a book an unhappy ending regardless if it fits the characters or not. in my opinion, the ending would have never turned out this way if the characters were real. not believable...depressing....waste of two nights. thank goodness i read it on my kindle and didn't pay full price for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much...","review":"Yes, I read it and yes, I wanted to see how things happened. With the beginning I just knew it wasn't going to work out, yet I kept thinking that maybe the Dear John letter wasn't the end. Realistic? No. Desirable? No. Sad? Not really. By the end I thought the story was just too much schmaltz. My book club loved it (or so they say), not me. I've read better by Nicholas Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending","review":"I enjoyed most of the book until the ending. It really ruined the book for me. I wish I had never read it. One could make the argument that the main characters' relationship would never have worked, but I disagree. I did not think the ending was realistic. Really, who would ever do what this character, John, did? No way. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I enjoy all of Nicholas Spark's books...some more than others...but Dear John is an excellent book! It does need a follow up book...which i was hoping his next book (The Choice) would be....but i don't think it is. Dear John is a must read! I couldn't put it down. I was hoping for a different ending though."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"I was almost surprised to like this book, because I have not liked all of Nicholas Sparks' books. I was especially skeptical after reading a 73 word sentence in one of the first pages, I don't like overly flowery language. BUT, I have to say that I got into the story, and didn't put the book down until long after the rest of my family had fallen asleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"It took me forever to finally read this book but when I did pick it up,I could barely put it down. This book is truly tragic,romantic,and endearing in Sparks' signature style.The relationship of John and Savannah was truly wonderful to read about. I loved reading about how a boy finally became a man and the steps it took for him to get there. I thought that John and Savannah were gonna get married and just grow old together but of course,there's always a curve ball that Nicholas Sparks always pitches to his readers whether you see it or not.This book is another awesome read from Nicholas Sparks. I can't wait to read his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"sheilady","review":"I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in this book. I have seen the movies made into books of his but this is the first book of his I have read. I read a lot of romance books and like to leave reality behind, even for a short time by reading. I realize that reality must be in there some, but when you finish a book it is nice to feel good at the end of it, even if it maybe a little sad, but this left a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt if I ever buy anything of his again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, but entertaining","review":"I admit, I used to think Nicholas Sparks was dull and unimaginative, and that ALL of his stories sounded the same but with different characters, but after reading almost all of his books, I have to admit that I like his simplicity, and he has slowly become a favorite of mine. I was excited to hear about \\"Dear John\\" coming out, since my husband is a Marine. The book was great at the beginning (aside from using the word 'portending' about a thousand times) up until Savannah sends him the fated \\"Dear John\\" letter. I understand, waiting a long time for a loved one while he is in the military and deployed is painstaking. But to break up with them for choosing to defend your country over being with a loved one? That's a little BS, if you ask me. Especially after John sells his father's collection for a lousy price and then gives it all away to help Savannah's husband. No one in their right mind would do that, but then again, this is Nicholas Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear John review","review":"This is my first, and maybe last Nicolas Sparks book. I read it simply because of the military situation. It was a bit boring, but found it to be a quick read. I had absolutely no interest in Savannah at all. What was so great about her? My deal was with John. As short as their relationship was, I wanted to tell him to \\"Get over it already!\\". His depression when they are apart, to the point where he was an outcast with his other squad members in his unit, was just pitiful. No friends? Kept to himself. Whatever. The only true interest in this story was John's relationship with his father. I'm going to stick with Spark's movies only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hoping to like this book since of course the Notebook by Nicholas Sparks was such a huge success. This book was very one dimensional and elementary. The book was predictable and the characters became annoying after awhile because they were so whiny. Perhaps this is Nicholas Sparks style, but if you are looking for an interesting, unpredictable love story that wasn't written for a 13 year old, this isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror Story for Soldiers","review":"This is a screwed-up thing to make a romance novel out of. (Yes, I realize it was written for women with no exposure to the military and only romantic notions of undying love to go on.) For deployed military personnel, a spouse or fiance is often all that's keeping them going and suicide can result from things like this. Romantic? Hardly. Savannah is a no good cheatin' 'ho. No way would John sell his father's coin collection to help her out when the new hubby gets cancer after that-- Made your choice tramp! No you can't come back when he's dead! Save your money, buy something else. This is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it past page 70","review":"I read \\"The Notebook\\" a few years ago and loved it. Read \\"A Walk to Remember\\" a couple of years later, and thought it was ok. Picked up \\"Dear John\\" this week and I just can't stand it. The writing is just bad, period. The characters are so predictable. I think I've grown out of Nicholas Sparks. There are much better books out there - life's too short to read this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Absolutely the most depressing book I've ever read. Well written and kept my attention, but I was very disappointed with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longing for Something More","review":"This story lacked something that I feel is fundamentally required for a love story to be functional. And Nicholas needs to write a new story line, not Rich girl loves Poor guy who can never be together after one great summer fling, and then years of agony go by before anything comes back together for the couple...COME ON.And the movie is not anything close to what you would expect after reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Mixture Between Love and Sadness","review":"\\"Dear John by Nicholas Sparks was about a heart broken love story. About no matter how passionate love can be, long distant relationships don't always work out.I loved this book, it was a great mixture of love and sadness. After the first chapter, I was hooked...\\"Read more at: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ticked me off!","review":"After much dileberation I think I have figured out why the book bothered me so much. Its like the author didn't have a clue about military life. He made it seem like the couple had no choice but for them to be apart. Either the love was so deep and intense that they would have made it work by marrying and her moving to Germany with him or the love wasn't what he portrayed it to be and wasn't worth the sacrifice. The author wrote the book like all military men stationed over seas can't have their families there with them and while in a few cases that is true it is not the norm and definetly not in Germany as far as I know. I guess there would be no epic heart wrenching ending if the author had done his homework but I felt the lack of knowledge on the subject just made the whole story irritating..."},{"rating":"1","title":"love sparks but disappointed with this book.","review":"i love n. sparks and this book was great until the end. i dint think it was fair the soldier didnt get a happy ending. if any one deserves a happy ending its hi. sorry this review is horribly written. im writing it on my kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best love story I've read in a long time","review":"It just broke my heart the way fate had it's hand in this one. How can 2 people totally fall in love like that and NOT be together??? It is just SO wrong! I think i felt said for John and Savannah, for Tim and his autistic brother, Alan, and for John's father for his world that he was trapped in. I was brought to tears more than a couple of times at how heartfelt the story was. Another great one for Mr. Sparks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending ruined the book","review":"I really enjoyed this book but just couldn't believe the ending. I know that I should be prepare for it after reading first chapter, but somehow I though there is no way these two won't be together.I would give it 5 stars if only the ending would be different.After reading that John sold his dad's coins that he was collecting for all his life to save Tim ( by the way he didn't have any guarantee that he will save his life! And who would do that after the guy stole the love of his life?! ).And to write that the realetionship between John and Savannah would never work after all that happened to them!!!! How in the world relationship with Tim would ????? Obviousely Savannah is still madely in love with Jim and still looking up to the moon and thinking about him constantly.How Tim can be with her knowing that? This just shows how nice guy he is.....The ending made me feel like I wasted my time on this book. I will never read Sparks book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dear John\\"","review":"Dear John,Next time fate smiles on you: Finish your time in the Army, let fate take its course with the husband of the women you love, Marry your soul mate, raise the autistic child of the fore mentioned,and now deceased, husband of the woman you love, keep your father's coin collection to honor his memory, have two children with your soul mate, and...

That is not the same thing as a hardback book. I returned it and am still searching for a real hardback of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very real and close to the heart","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks and he definitely did a wonderful job when writing this story.

With the love of his father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story - 3.5 Stars","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It's a typical Nicolas Sparks book in the sense that, if you're a fan, it won't disappoint. Good writing, interesting story line, and of course, a believable romance at the center that will probably leave you in tears. I've also seen the movie, by the way, but I preferred the book to it (as is often the case for me). I would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I actually found this book boring. At times I had to make myself keep reading. I couldn't idenitify with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to read;predictible;sad","review":"The only thing I really liked about this book was the father of the main character. He was quirky and different and throughout the book you begin to understand why. The rest of it reminded me of a Soap on television. I would recommend this read to anyone who wanted to kill time on a plane ride or just needed something easy to read that would not make you think. Otherwise read the paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was realistic, refreshing, and didn't have the normal anticipated ending of most romance stories","review":"I liked this book because it didn't have the typical ending. From the minute I picked this book up I was hooked (as I am with most of his books I read). Although not my favorite (like Three Weeks with My Brother), this was a truly good read. It made me remember what it was like to be young and in love...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear John","review":"This is a beautiful and romantic story of a young couple who fall in love after meeting at the beach in North Carolina during the summer one year. John is an Army Sergeant on leave and Savannah is a college girl helping to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. They notice each other for the first time on the boardwalk. Savannah's purse falls from her shoulder into the water, John dives in and rescues it while the Frat boys stand and watch. She notices then he is a caring and tender man, although not her type with large tattoos and a crew cut. Shortly afterward, they begin an unforgettable summer romance. Unfortunately, John must return to the Balkans where he is stationed. Additional stress is added because John is so far away and then later reenlists for another term. The book is about true love, commitment and caring about another's needs above our own. It is truly inspirational!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!","review":"Let me start by saying.... I LOVE NICHOLAS SPARKS. I was very disappointed in this book. I thought the charactors were not believable. The middle of the book was slow, more about the war then the love story. I give all his books a 5 star, but just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I was dissappointed when I read this book. Normally, I rush out and buy every book he writes, then I can't stop reading them. When I finished this one, I just sat there and thought, \\"Wow, that was just not good.\\" All that anticipation for a book, then I am not even satisfied. I will have to try his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab your tissues","review":"I've been looking forward to reading this book for months now. I received it the other day and ended up being so into the story that I couldn't put it down (except to sleep). Wow. Almost every single Nicholas Sparks book makes me shed a few tears, but in this one, I honestly could feel the pain that John was going through. This is a great book to read on a cold winter day, curled up with a blanket. I felt that John and Savannah were people that I could have known and cared about. Some readers thought \\"Dear John\\" was too depressing; but that's the way life is sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reason to swear off this author","review":"Having read several of his other books and enjoyed his storylines, I expected a modicum of character development. This book was thinly written and provided no plausability or engagement with any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly mediocre, very disappointing","review":"I honestly can't understand the gushing reviews for this simplistic, bland novel. About half way through I went back to Amazon to see if this was in the young-adult category, because that's how it reads: Teenaged, uncomplicated, lacking in depth and complex emotion and very self-indulgent. There's very little real storyline here and it's full of page after page of incredibly stilted and trite dialogue. I not only wasn't invested in what happened next to the characters, I actually couldn't care less."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE John Tyree, hate Savannah - spoilers","review":"I really loved the character of John Tyree but could not stand Savannah. She did not deserve such a man. What a horrible ending for this book, though I am very glad John did not get stuck with her for the rest of his life. He deserves so much better.The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because I cared for John so much, and for his father, too. In fact, in my mind, the love story of this book was between John and his dad.Whatever you do, DO NOT listen to this audiobook. The narrator is HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I picked up this book after a friend of mine asked me to read it with her. I agreed and read it. I must say this is one of the worse books I have ever read. Nothing ever happens in the story and it was just a huge waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Story About the Gift of Giving.","review":"At first I wasn't into it, but the more I read, the more I came to care about John and Savannah. I really loved the way Savannah opened the door for John to understand his father and his disorder better, bringing them closer together.I liked Tim so well that, in spite of John losing Savannah, I was glad she married him because he was as good a man as John and--in some ways--maybe even better. Talk about switching places! This is a beautiful story that lives up to the old saying, \\"If you love somebody set them free.\\" You know the rest. This is one of Nicholas Sparks' most well-structured and touching novels yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Sparks Fan","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and this one is as good as the first. He is the type of author that you just can't stop reading his books are very hard to put down. The way he captured the loneliness of the gulf war was wonderful. It gives you a new view on things and helps you to see how heartbreaking it can really be. And what the true meaning of love and sacarfice. I won't give away the plot but I will say this it is a truly good book and I know if you start reading it you won't be able to put it down. I give this book a 5 plus stars and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Nicholas Sparks, keep writing novels like this one.","review":"I have always been skeptical about romance novels and must confess I was never a fan of The Notebook or A Walk to Remember. However, throughout the years I have become noticeably more interested in Nicholas Sparks novels. Dear John is an addiction and I couldn't put it down. I admire Sparks' ability to create real characters and prove to his readers that happy endings do not always occur the way we would like. Its not as good as The Last Song, but it is a novel you dont want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor John","review":"Loved the book. I could relate to the characters, especially Savannah.

Definitely a keeper and will be reading again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet and Pretty Predictable","review":"Well...what can I say? I'm a sucker for Nicholas Sparks, and picked this up in paperback the other day. I finished it in about a day, it was a pretty easy read.The characters were likeable, but the storyline felt a little lacking. Knowing that Sparks books pretty much always have a sad spin, it wasn't hard to figure out the ending. I was not surprised, it ended exactly as I figured, but the ending did seem a bit too...perfectly bittersweet.I won't give any spoilers, just suffice to say, if you like Sparks other melancholy romances, you will enjoy this one. No surprises, but Sparks knows how to write emotions, thats for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Author!","review":"Having 4 kids, reading usually put me asleep until I read his books.

As always written very well but a sad ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okay Love Story","review":"Dear John was a very \\"Nicholas Sparks\\" type love story. If you like him (or the Notebook), you will like this book.It's about an I don't give a fish sort of guy who meets a sweet, innocent-like girl, Savannah. They fall in love (shocker!), but since John is in the army and is on leave, he must go back to where he's stationed, Germany. Their relationship is again, very Nicholas Sparks in that it's just like any normal relationship. It gets rocky then calm again.Why I gave it four stars is because I didn't like the ending, but you will ahve to read it to find out!!Can't wait to see how they turn this one into a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear John by Nicholas Sparks","review":"From my prospective, I give this book a 10. It was absolutely beautiful, powerful, and moving. It was full of desire, love, heart-break, regret, and so many emotions that I just couldn't put this book down. I read it in no time because I had to read about Savannah and John's happy ending, but when it didn't happened, I was so lost for words. I couldn't get the ending out of my head for atleast a week and I couldn't get over the love that John carried for Savannah. So much, that he left her so she would be happy with Tim. This book will definitely teach you a thing or two about love and the true meaning. Nicholas Spark did a fine job on writing this love-story and as of now, is my favorite author. I definitely recommend reading Dear John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am confused!!!","review":"Would someone please explain the ending to me.

We were trying so hard to listen past his voice and just hear the story, but it was inevitable--we had to shut it off. I was terribly disappointed. My theory was that the actor chosen to read for this had to be dashingly handsome. My theory was correct--he is gorgeous.

Dear John is a wonderful love story that makes you realize sometimes life is not always a cup of tea, and opens your heart to the possiblity that love, as strong as it might be, might not last through the changing lifestyles and triumphs of time. Great story, amazing ending. I loved this book, I even bought a copy for my grandmother!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Enjoyed the book over the movie, although Channing Tatum did a great job.

Defiantly a book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This was another one of Nicholas amazing books. The talent he has is more then words can express. What a wonderful story from beginning to end. This story touched my heart. Very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche after Cliche","review":"I have read several other Nicholas Sparks books in the past so I knew not to expect literature, but rather a quick easy read. Unfortunately, this book offered up only cliche after cliche. After reading the first couple chapters, I could tell you exactly what was going to happen (although there were some twists that added a little to the story, which is why I gave it 2 stars). Sparks really needed an update in conversational language that people use today, because these two sounded nothing like 20 somethings around 2001, especially Savannah who sounded like a 50's era character most of the time. He also relies to heavily on letter writing and completely ignores modern ways soldiers and their families keep in touch. This couple has none of the magic or spark of Noah and Allie in the Notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the movie but ABSOLUTELY read the book","review":"If you are a romantic at heart, then this is the book for you. The book is about two people who fall in love but because of circumstances they have decisions to make, a life to live and other people to consider. What's more important in life the love of your life or the life you are living for other people? Forget the movie, the casting was horrible, no chemistry, the script veered from the story line of the book, so for me you absolutely must read the book. I really enjoyed it and I'm sure you will too.Short review from me:If you've ever stood on the beach, looking over the ocean and had your mind wander back to a past love this is the book for you !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wellllll.....","review":"Ok, Dear John was written by Nicholas Sparks, so I definitely enjoyed it. With that said, this wasn't my favorite novel of his. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something less than satisfying about the book, especially the ending (which I won't give away). However, I did particularly enjoy a few of the characters, and Mr. Sparks' books are always very readable. It's a good book, but if you're looking for something even better from Nicholas, go for \\"The Wedding\\" or \\"A Walk To Remember\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings all your emotions to the edge. Great book.","review":"This novel continues Sparks' undoubted ability to pull at the reader's heart-strings.

At least four other authors wrote books with this same title in the past five years. Very contrite.I am not a NS fan but thought I would give him a shot. Who knows, as the author of about eight books, maybe he learned something at this point. Not a chance. Get this one from the library. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"This is my favorite by Nicholas Sparks. Mainly because this story is the story of mine and my husband's life. We met and fell in love in North Carolina as well. However, it was Fort Bragg, not Wilmington. He is in the Army. Got stationed in Germany, left me behind then got deployed. Of course there are a few differences, I don't want to ruin the book for anyone. The ending yes, is less than ideal. But it's realistic. This is a fantastic book, like all of his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite tear jerker","review":"I read this book in one day! I give it four only because the story is a little predictable and follows the \\"typical\\" love story cliche's throughout. However, if you're in the mood for a typical girly romance story that actually doesn't end with \\"happy ever after\\" then its definitely an easy read and it will hit the spot. Without giving too much away which is hard to do because its really not that complex at all, the story centers around John Tyree who having grown up as somewhat of a bad apple ends up enlisting in the army. On one of his leaves he falls for a kind, caring and gentle hearted girl named Savannah. This story teaches you a great lesson in what true love means, sacrificing what you need in order to make sure your loved one is happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish love won in the end","review":"This was a great book like many of Sparks's books however the ending was just wrong. In a fairytale like this book I think that love should win. John spent his live waiting on this girl and she in return loved him jsut that same and I just wish it had a better ending for both of them. I feel like the book has left me hanging and I wish I knew what went on after she looked at the moon one last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"I just finished this book, and i have to say i was disappointed! The writer portrays Savannah as this honest southern bell, and she is not. SPOILER. While John is deployed she never mentioned anything about Tim at all. { his parents death, opening the ranch,and having lunches with him all the time} She kept a lot from John that, in the long run, would have given John some closure. I like Tim's character, but he isn't spotless either. He knew what he was doing. John had some disappointing moments here and there, but in the long run I liked his character. By the end of the book i have to say that I really hated Savannah, and found deep respect for John. Lets call a spade a spade. Savannah is a cheater. { on john and tim}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I always considered myself a fan of Nicholas Sparks.

I had no choice, really - the kids found it at the grocery store check-out. The kids liked it - they didn't notice that the animation was no better than 1960's Hanna-Barberra cartoons and that the story was 3 stories awkwardly stitched together. If you liked the moral theme of Atlantis, don't ruin it with this dumbed-down cartoony follow-up. The orignal Atlantis was a visually stunning masterpiece of animation almost in the league of The Lion King and Fantasia. This DVD is not nearly worthy of the Disney name ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever wrote this movie should quit the film industry!","review":"I don't expect much from Disney's straight-to-video sequels, but this one has simply got to be the worst of them all. First off, this film has absolutely NOTHING to do with the city of Atlantis. Instead, it focuses on three separate and unrelated \\"mysteries\\" that have an eerie resemblance to episodes of Scooby Doo. All the characters return and Kida decides to see what it's like on the surface. She's supposed to go and help, but all she does is dally around being stupid. Her involvement has nothing to do with the movie until the end. This movie is only a mere 80-minutes, but after the first 45, I was ready for this film to end.Bottom line, it's hard to believe that the writers at Disney Television can lack the imagination and creativity to make a movie that's even a little bit worthwhile. I seriously could've come up with a better story....one that's about Atlantis! Avoid this at all costs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BACK TO HELL FROM WHICH YOU CAME! 2.25 OUT OF 10","review":"Atlantis: Milo's Return is absolutely horrible, and there is almost nothing good to be had from this craptacular movie experience, except divine hatred for all things about Disney sequels. The plot is simply too hard to figure out, and it will only piss you off when you're able to figure out some parts of it. Everything good about the original has gone horribly wrong in its hellish sequel. The original actors are basically no where to be found in the sequel, which also ruins the experience. The artwork doesn't seem very good either, and will only make you wonder how a Disney movie can manage that. If you value your soul, please avoid this awful movie at all costs if you don't wish to get a glimpse of hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney sequelitis hits rock bottom","review":"No, the original movie was not great, but was worth a rent to keep the kiddies happy. But this is completely worthless. The three stories it tells are so weakly joined that I suspected they were originally made to stand alone as three episodes of a series, a suspicion that is confirmed by other reviewers. I guess I should know by now that Toy Story II was the exception to the rule-all the other sequels ground out by the Disney sausage factory are mostly made in order to continue to sell the merchandise and promote the inevitable, poorly-drawn television series that try to cash in on the movies' success."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed TV series...","review":"This is a compilation of 3 TV afternoon episodes which, after the brass at Disney TV animation viewed them, decided not to make any more, and release them on DVD after interstitial connections were made to sort of make them into a movie. Much the same track taken with \\"Belle's Magical World\\" and \\"Cinderella 2\\". When the studio execs judge that the three test episodes of a projected TV afternoon series aren't good enough to make it on TV, the DVD obviously won't be very good, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not rent, and definetively do not buy!!","review":"Probably the worst Disney-release I have ever seen, badly drawn, and no \\"movie\\" at all, it is a collection of three different, but thin(!) stories.

I did buy Treasure Planet, Spirit Stallion of the Cimmeron, and Spirited Away. I have a whole list of collections of cartoons, but I have to admit the original theatrical movie is much better than the video release sequal.First of all the characters look very different. For a 2 hour movie, they put three different adventures into it. They should have just kept the story to one big adventure. Also, I'm not too sure but the voice actors might also be different. There is definitely a lack of a evil villan in this sequal.I would not recommend this dvd. I would prefer you buy the new release of Star Trek Nemesis instead. It just also came out at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scary","review":"This movie has ice spirits and fire spirits and coyote spirits made out of sand.

If you just look at the front cover of this DVD, ull notics that the faces of Milo Thatch And Kida look VERY different.

I miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats, and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful.

The first 3 tracks are the ones most likely to be released (the first 2 have already been released as singles) with the third song, A cause, being my favorite. It's very rock and rolly, has great notes for Celine to hit, and in general, is fun to listen and sing along to. The rest of the CD has some other nice songs to sing along with but I don't think the material adds up to the greatness of D'eux. This CD is still a must-have for Celine fans such as myself, but for others I would try the tracks before I buy just to make sure that it's up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pas tres bien ma belle","review":"I'm not carzy about this CD.

What makes the story compelling and unique is that his true love is the angel Xas, who fell out of the sky one dark night in the vineyard, and then promises to return on the same night each year.From beginning to end, the Vintner's Luck is a compelling and pleasureable read. If you enjoy reading historical fiction, fantasy or love stories, if you are looking for a book to read beyond your usual interests, if you want to take a book with you on a trip which will have you oblivious to the discomforts of travel, then read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe 2 1/2 stars - A silly book","review":"The idea that an angel would fall in love with a man is interesting, but the man is completely uninteresting, as is the parallel story of the man's fortunes and ever-growing family -- may of whom are just names to confuse the reader. There is a side story of a murderer, who cares? There are some discussions between the angel and the man, not very well done. The chapters are mostly short, corresponding to the annual visits -- an old writer's trick to avoid having to write a cohesive story.

The Angel Xas is definitely the centre of the story, but (and perhaps foolishly) I expected a gentler and more angelic character. So if you're looking for the standard story of beautiful angels with wings that smell of snow, this is not for you. That aside it is still an engrossing and clever read, and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"odd writing","review":"I gave up about three quarters of the way through. I would read passages that I thought beautifully written and interesting, but as the story progressed, the characters became many and unnecessary.

As a cynical sceptic I started this book defying it to grab me, but once I met Xas the angel I was hooked and could not put down what became a totally believable experience. Sobran the vintner with all his doubts and passion and all too human failings is a wonderfully depicted character, as are all the others in this rivetting novel. Xas, the angel with wings that smelled of fresh snow, is a magnificent creation, wise, kind, caring and just a bit of a rebel. A deliciously convoluted plot, filling and satisfying, with many inviting philosophical pathways to traverse at your leisure, and a most unexpected but rewarding ending. Beautiful prose.

When I saw this peformance listed on Amazon and read some of the reviews, I couldn't wait to get the DVD. What a disappointment!First of all, the disc I received was defective. The last two songs would not play, and my BluRay player started making a clicking sound like the laser head was banging against the wall. Second, I knew the concert was filmed in black and white, but I wasn't expecting the lighting to be so bad. It looked like the theatre lights were turned off. Besides James, most everything else was a shadow. Third, the camera angles were beyond amateurish. There were a lot shots taken from behind with the view of James partially blocked. Some of the shots didn't show his feet until the dance moves were almost over. Fourth, the quality of the sound was poor. The DVD looked like the thing was shot in the early 1950's. not 1968."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This has got to be one of the greatest performances ever available on DVD. The incredible originality and talent of James Brown and his players are on full display in this 1968 concert. You can read elsewhere about the social setting and great contribution made by these musicians (and dancers); as well, rest assured, this is one of the greatest live performances you'll ever experience. James Brown is in his prime; totally confident, totally in sync, like his successor Prince an extraordinary singer, dancer, showman; his band is fully up to his standard. What a great DVD, and what a great price! Great crowd too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the legacy of James Brown","review":"This concert is obviously being marketed by it's historical context, taking place on the night after Dr. King's assassination. It is also a good performance by James Brown, but then, he never put on a bad show. However, the lighting of the DVD is so bad it's almost un-watchable. It's amazing it was shown on television that night because it looks like it was shot in a coal mine! If James Brown was still alive he would never have authorized this DVD, because he always took pride in his product and his responsibility to his fans.

I was very ignorant for many years pertaining to the catholic church, though being a Catholic myself. I did not understand many of the things which the church practiced. My Lord and Savior is leading me on a path back to his church. In doing so he has blessed my family and I beyond words. He is truly our Lord and Savior. If I had to describe in one word the church's teaching contained in this book it would be \\"Fullness\\". I sincerely hope this review helps in your selection. Enjoy and May God Bless you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it somewhere else.","review":"The basic content is there but the book is super small and the binding prevents you from reading close to the margins.

I have found there has been adjustments to the Catholic Church ways of thinking. This is an excellent book with very easy and understandable writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catechism Review","review":"The book contained all I expected.

I agree. The Catechism is an invaluable resource in helping one to know and understand their faith and is chocked full of insightful citations to the other two must-read books mentioned above. You can read it from front to back or use the Subject Index to find what you're most interested in. This version is also very small (you can easily hold it in one hand) but the font is still readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor! Incomplete edition","review":"This Doubleday edition of the Catechism is incomplete - it lacks the Index of Citations and Glossary, and the Subject Index is incomplete. It is dishonest to present this as the second edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding read!","review":"I highly endorse this version of the Catechism for Newbies such as myself that are just starting out.

But as for this particular edition, I recommend it. It is very portable, good hardcover, good paper quality, the font is nicely sized and easy to read. And vey importantly, easy to find a paragraph as the numbers are clearly listed in bold font at the margins of each page. Get this version and use it as a reference for many years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"If you are looking for a catechism that is handy to use, this is it.

It serves its purpose well for traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catechism of the Catholic Church","review":"This is the latest official version of the Catholic Catechism (as of Jan 08). This is set up in an outlined version, although it is very thorough. Footnotes are employed to verify the information, which are often biblically based.A companion reference of some sort is helpful in explaining this information. This could be another learned person of the Catholic faith, or one of several publications available. Even though the book can be difficult reading, the information is the bottom line of what Catholics believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break it Up!","review":"+JMJ+I do not recommend reading this like a regular book. I think it would be much more worthwhile breaking this up into manageable and readable sections, so you don't get overwhelmed. Also, I would recommend praying through the Catechism, and really finding what speaks to your heart in each section. This Catechism is so comprehensive that it could be easy to get lost or overwhelmed, but keep at it! This is our faith, and if you want to know your faith, read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhanced my Catholic religion","review":"This was a book recommended by Father Corapi who is an authority on Catholicism.

Coupled with an audio class on Roman Catholicism by Dr. Fhil Fernandez, I was able to make real progress in understanding the very complicated doctrines of this world religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The index is basically useless when looking things up for me. It's set up in a unique way. Make sure you read the note in the beginning of the index. And it will explain it. Other then that. I flip through it and find it riviting. It's great to understand things more in depth as a Catholic, and will certainly help my faith be in a better direction. This is a must have for any Catholic. It's just understanding the index that is the problem. Other then that. great explaination of the commandments, and the prayer our father, and understanding the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Overall Selection","review":"This CD features a wonderful assortment of some of Sibelius's best works. The quality of the recordings is very crisp and the performances are certainly satisfactory, if not even better.

I want my $2.85 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Paul Roche Translation!","review":"This is not the modern and very fine Paul Roche translation, but rather the 1912 stogy, antiquated translation of Francis Storr.

I will be asking for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oedipus at Colonus","review":"Oedipus at Colonus was a fairly good sequel to Oedipus the King. In this book Oedipus and one of his daughters go to Colonus the Gods sent sickness because he killed his father and then married his mother.This book was a lot easier to read than I was expecting. Usually I have a tough time reading these old kind of plays but this one was written in such a way that I was able to understand it which was a plus. The whole plot is really good; Oedipus's sons are fighting over who gets to be king. If you read any of the previous stories of Oedipus you should know about the oracle. This is a wonderful element to these stories. When you hear the oracle's prediction you know that you should believe it because of what happen in the first story. Recomended for ages 15 and older."},{"rating":"1","title":"THe plot is interesting.","review":"I thought that it was really weird that he killed his father so he could marry his mother, I didn't think that things like that happened way back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophocles and Roche: A great tag-team","review":"Sophocles' masterpieces cannot be acclaimed enough for their fluidity, coherence, content and style. Indeed, I have never read a play that captured my heart and soul as much as Antigone, and I have never had more interest in any story than that of Oedipus. Roche's translations are the best ever produced by human hands. The text reads perfectly, as if originally written in English (although not in an english style), yet it more accurately represents Sophocles' work than any other translation on the market. Roche has used his great poetic skill and love of greek to create a triumph of classic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very captivating","review":"This is extraordinary story and easy to follow. It is easily comparable to modern socitey. The tragic flaws in Creon and Oedipus are very defined. This is a classic \\"must read\\" !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting story, full of irony","review":"I just recently completed the Oedipus trilogy for my Junior Honors English class. I found the stories captivating and intruiging, and loved Sophocles use of language and beautiful dialogue. Readers must remember though that the story is a MYTH, not a non fiction book; and Oedipus was not at fault for his sins. Otherwise, these stories were beautifully written and for those interested in Greek Mythology, these scripts will intice you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best undergraduate cognitive text around","review":"Written with clarity and eloquence, this text emphasizes the empirical nature of the field and never \\"dumbs down\\" the material.

Overall I was satisfied with this seller and plan on buying from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good introduction, but way too much.","review":"This textbook is a fairly good introduction to cognitive psychology, but is way too dense. By that, I don't mean it talks about stuff too much, but it talks too much in general. Depth is good, but without illustrations, the text and meaning doesn't come up. All 500 pages of this book are primarily text, and thus it is boring. And when you consider each chapter is 40 pages long, no illustrations, or at least very little pictures and diagrams, doesn't really help you gain an interest in the ideas the textbook tries to present to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mower!","review":"We purchased this mower about a year and a half ago. It is not very rugged to say the least. The \\"steel\\" bends to easily making the mower not work properly. The cutting blades have flown off twice. In one instance, the blade shot through the red metal structure. Thank God no one was standing nearby or they could have been killed.

Swishers view of the terrain is more in line with how a finish mower should perform. Once you spend an additional est 300 dollars to reinforce the towing assembly be very careful with the manual extension cord use to engage the mower blades. This repeatedly comes loose and must be checked frequently. Replacing the belt is not an easy task either. Once you make the modifications still use caution. The towing are is this products weakest link."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy machine for the price","review":"I received the Swisher 44 12.5 HP pull-start trail cutter a week ago and have used it fairly heavily on some rough terrain since then. It works as advertised and makes short work of heavy brush. I'm pulling it behind a Yamaha Rhino 450 with no difficulties. The Briggs & Stratton engine runs fine and starts easily enough that I would have a hard time justifying the additional cost of the electric starter. So far I have no regrets in purchasing this unit instead of a DR. My only complaint is the high cost of shipping, but I don't have access to a local dealer, so what're you gonna do? I wish the hitch attachment had a bit more vertical adjustment available, but I can work around that. So far, so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and high quality CD at a bargain price!","review":"This is one of my favorite collections from NAXOS.

Many of my favorite pieces are featured here: the Waltz from Sleeping Beauty, the Waltz from Serenade for Strings, Andante Cantabile (Symphony #5), June (Seasons), and many others. The musicianship of the artists and the sound quality are excellent. High quality CDs need not be expensive. I bet you'll enjoy this CD as much as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, but stretches stories unneccessarily","review":"This is not a book without merit; it simply is a book that strectches out storylines that could have been wrapped up in one book. Toby Holt stills has to quell the northern tier from Ma Hastings and Red Cloud, such as he had to in Montana. Meanwhile, Beth Blake undergoes captivity and a homicide trial that has little in the means of suspense.Still, I like the story dealing with Toby's and Gentle Doe's affair, and the introduction of Kale Salton continues the Ross tradition of having \\"ladies of ill repute\\" seens as angels trapped in a bad guy's profession. I give this book a generous 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The OTHER Schumann","review":"I bought this because I wanted to hear something that Clara Schumann had written. I listened several times, and find these to be very enjoyable, and well constructed. Despite speculation, we will never know how well Clara Schumann might have been as a composer if she had existed in a different time, a different culture. At least we can listen to these and know that she was not just a good pianist, but an accomplished composer as well. Some will say these are not original, not profound, etc. I can only say that they are really fine music to enjoy, and I recommend this recording highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of Schumann","review":"The best of Schumann is the only CD that failed to please me.

I got the men's as I wanted the black skates with black wheels (don't care for the white women's skates). I normally wear a size 7-7 1/2 shoe and got these skates in a size 6; they are slightly big on me (I tried on with thin socks), but will fit better with shoe inserts. I didn't go down to a size 5 as then they would have probably been to small/tight on me. The skates look great and I was skating around all night in them.

Of course, he unwrapped it and threw the box away. We didn't get to the rink until a couple of weeks later. When he tried to skate, I saw he was having problems. I checked his skates again and noticed the front wheels on one skate were really wobbly. There was a washer missing... didn't see it when I checked the nuts. Since he had already worn them and the box was gone, I figured we were stuck.Fortunately, the people at the skate rink took one off of one of their old skates and gave it to us. They also gave us a tool, since the one that came with it only fits one of the bolts. Now that we have fixed that problem, he loves them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are deceiving","review":"I ordered this as a birthday gift for my husband because he specifically asked for the Chicago Roller Skates 805 series.

I was highly disappointed especially since the picture shows a Chicago 805 skate. Use discretion when ordering unless you do not care what your getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good pair of skates, a great deal","review":"The vinyl exterior of the boot resists dirt and scratches, while the leather internal lining is soft and feels like you are wearing a fully leather boot. The wheels are indoor/outdoor, but the size is more for outdoor use. These skates are very good. They only thing is that the ABEC 3 bearings aren't very smooth, but at this price, replacing them with better bearings is quite affordable. I ended up buying two pairs, one for indoor use and one for outdoor use, then replacing the bearings/wheels for the indoor pair. The Bones Red bearings work great. Skating is fun and great exercise, and these skates are great way to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Skates for Someone Getting Back in the Groove","review":"Length:: 2:10 MinsThese are great skates for the beginning skater like me (I haven't been skating in 8 years and am just now getting started again). Out the box, the wheels will be a bit stiff. I've read online that these can e loosened, but I'm not a pro, so I have no idea how to do it. If you are a more advanced skater, I would recommend purchasing different wheels for the skates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Ankle Support","review":"As the title suggests, these skates are very uncomfortable around the ankle.

Therefore, any bad review which I give must be due to the performance of his work. Hungarian Rhapsody no 2 is one of the most beautiful pieces of music in existance. It is originally a piano piece, but the piece on this CD has been orchestrated - with an absolutely disastrous effect. One not only does one not get the wonderful strong rhythm that the hungarian rhapsody should provide, but the choice of instruments of whoever orchestrated this piece actually makes this work sound bad.

Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Terrible!","review":"This book is terrible! It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters. Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers. Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.

I liked it so much because it had a great plot. The ideas in the book were very clever. If you read the three previous books you probably had an idea of how Lemony Snicket writes and how he writes his books. In this book the outcome of events were completely different then expected. The book kept you on the edge of your seat and made you want to keep on reading. Another thing I liked about this book was the creativity and originality. Lemony Snicket used some ideas that people would never be in a book like this. I will not mention any because it will give away some important parts of the story. The one thing about the story that I did not like was how Lemony Snicket gave away some of the parts of the story before those things happened. That is what made my rating a four instead of a five.

This time, they are sent to live in a lumber mill. There they encounter the vile foreman Flacutono who insists on banging pots together to get everyone's attention. They also meet a shady ophthamologist...and, of course, Count Olaf in disguise. The children's ostensible guardian in this installment is the rather gruff, heartless \\"Sir\\", the owner of the mill, whose face you never actually get to see because it is always in a cloud of cigar smoke.This volume, like the last, has some pretty scary moments and probably should not be read alone by young children. This volume seems to be about par for the course, continuing in the same style where the others have left off, the Baudelaires continue to use their wits and brains to outwit those who wish to make life miserable for them. This story is recommended for 10 and up...or younger, with an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mill of Misery","review":"The Miserable Mill is a book that's funny, thrilling, and twisted big time. It was a confusing book that was complicated to understand the volcabulary. I think all of the Baudelaire Orphans have really good special talents that are hard to master. Sunny likes to bite things only as her special talent. Klaus like to read books and has a good volcabulary library as a brain. Violet is the eldest Baudelaire and is a great inventor at mind. All Baudelaires have great special talents of there own. We are students from Doyle Elementary school and we have listened to the tape from Lemony Snickett and his ridiculous and cool stories about his career.

It just talked about the cloud of smoke, helping them by giving them fruit and by tripping after tripping. It was really boring also because Count Olaf really wasn't in it so it didn't have action.

I may have not liked this book as much as the first three because I didn't know the story to start with, but overall I didn't enjoy this story as much. I found the story somewhat frustrating.The kids go to live at a lumbermill in this book. Their guardian says that his name is so hard to pronounce that he tells them to just call him \\"Sir\\". Sir tells them to work in the lumbermill. The workers don't get breakfast and they only get gum for lunch. The only \\"real meal\\" they get is for dinner.

Indeed, the witty narrative and humor are (for the most part) just as plentiful in this book as in the previous three.But in terms of plot and characters, Lemony seems to be running out of steam. The plot twists and happenings in the previous books were always far-fetched but still believable to some degree or another. However, in this book they are simply far-fetched. Also, Count Olaf (this time in drag) came across as far less menacing than in the three previous books.I will soon be reading the fifth book and expect it to far exceed the quality of this one. I realize that with thirteen books in a series, there's going to be a bad apple or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yt? hal","review":"Run on the second half a million dollars to the kindle is an important part in the second half a screenshot on the second half and dumb enough of unfortunate that the kindle and a screenshot advertisements for t"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam","review":"I am reading a series of books called, A Series Of Unfortunate Events. I am on the fourth book, called The Miserable Mill. These books are great! I really got into them! I just can't stop reading them.There are two things I really like about these books: the character names and the exciting plot. All of these books are really cool because the author puts in really cool character names, like the three main characters, which are Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. I also like how the three children look out for each other. And my favorite parts are their really cool adventures.These three children lost their mom and dad in a fire, and have been sent to their relative Count Olaf. But some bad things happened to the children when Count Olaf was taking care of them.

They had to work in the mill while they live there and many strange things were happening. A teen reader could relate to Violet because she is oldest and has to take care of her youngest sibilings.

The part that I thought was funny was that Count Olaf had to dress up like a woman. I can't even imagine what he would look like because I bet it would be too much of an ugly site to see. I rated it a two and not a one because Count Olaf's disguise was really goo and that there was about one or two exciting and mysterious parts in it. That is all I have to say about this boring book.

The other problem is the thinly drawn sterotypical cast of characters. Come on...a smart, sexy woman con artist (who learned the trade from her Dad) on a mission to avenge her mother's murder? Sure. A dopey absent professor type, meek as a mouse who somehow manages to help bring down a spy ring? Uh huh. An over the top '60s style casino owner with a ruthless reputation? Yup. How about a former deep cover secret agent who now is a confirmed sociopath who collects personal items from the people he kills to add to his \\"collection of souls\\"? And the dialogue! Well put it this way. It's as original and thought provoking as the characters who deliver it. If it's the only book in english at the Malpensa airport and you are facing a 10 hour flight maybe it'll do. Otherwise avoid this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that keeps you turning the pages","review":"I found The Collectors to be a very good novel.This being my first Baldacci book, I was impressed with his characters and plot development.I found myself looking forward to turning the page to find the next plot twist.The final paragraph was a bit of a letdown, as I was hoping for all the loose ends to be tied up, but it does leave an open path for a follow-up book.I will be reading more of Baldacci's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"No con here.","review":"I listen to a lot of unabridged books on CD, not that I am an expert, but like most of you I know what I like. Mr. Baldacci is one of my favorites, I have listened to or read six of his novels. As much as I enjoyed The Camel Club, I liked this one even more. A number of interesting characters, a couple of which are not cardboard, and a good plot well written. The production quality is also first rate, a good reader/actor can make a huge difference.One of the things I like best about Mr. Baldacci is that he does not get tied in to a serial character, though you can see the sequal coming on this one, I like my variety. I look forward to his next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Camel Club series!","review":"My favorite of the Camel Club novels. Really loved this one. John Carr and Annabelle at their best. The characters get fully developed and the the mysteries that can't be combined or related are. Wish I had read all the Camel Club series in order instead of 3rd, 4th, 5th, 1st, and then 2nd. The 2nd, The Collectors, was the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly! Was this story contracted out to high school kids?","review":"Read the other 1 star reviews as they describe the silliness of this amateur production better than I can. Besides, I've already wasted too many hours on this book. I just felt a duty to warn my fellow man before they waste time on it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, clever, and a bit ridiculous","review":"The Collectors lives up to traditional Camel Club Baldacci fun. Credit Baldacci for two creative plots that eventually work their way together mid-book, each fully loaded with Baldacci-esque twists, action, and glimpse into the world of cons & spies. I found the link between the two plots to be a bit weak, but given the entertaining character interaction of the opposing key players, I'm fine overlooking the minor shortfall.Readers should not expect a profound thought provoking story in The Collectors, but as with other Camel Club stories from Baldacci, a fun ride, entertaining lead characters, an okay supporting cast, and a string of borderline ridiculous scenarios & challenges facing this odd grouping of characters. Baldacci certainly pushed the \\"cheesy\\" level on multiple occasions, but one could argue that this served to keep the story light and fun... which it did.4 stars for entertainment value and fun characters. You get exactly what you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camel Club Gang + 1","review":"I grow a little weary of reviews that are so \\"nit-picky\\" as to think that a \\"book\\", a \\"story\\" is supposed to be a documentary. They state - \\"couldn't happen that way, not real, too hoky\\". I say - get over yourselves. A book is \\"entertainment\\". Something to take you into another realm and out of your little life. Baldacci, Berry and Rollins all do that in a respectible way. This is the Camel Club plus one and is fast paced, interesting, part true of our hypocritical government and thoroughly entertaining. A good read, as always. Just enjoy and stop looking for \\"real life\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your pennies","review":"There was a time when Baldacchi could be considered a fair writer, but judging from this turkey, he stayed too long at the fair. The characters, presumably intended to be \\"cute,\\" are merely grating; the plots - two of them - don't come together, and the cliff hanger ending did nothing to make me want to buy another installment.There are lots of good books out there, more deserving of your hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci Does it Again","review":"In his last book, we were introduced to members of a rather unique group which refers to itself as the Camel Club. This group has been resurrected by the writer with a most unique addition in Annabelle Conroy. The plot has many layers to it that the writer is skillfully able to weave together into a novel that is enjoyable. After the time has been spent in the development of the plotlines as well as the numerous characters, the novel takes off rapidly in this excellent effort by the writer. It appears that the Club shall remain alive and well as the author alludes to future adventures that are to come in his future works. It is a good as well as a most enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Ignorance Spoils Good Story","review":"Pretty good story with some credibility problems It is, for me, severely compromised by the appalling scientific ignorance of the writer and editor. The murder weapon is carbon dioxide, 5000 parts per million, which would a)be entirely non-toxic, b)be incapable of suffocation, and c)would not create dry ice snow when expanded. Unfortunately, this silliness plays a central role in the book. Nothing beyond grade school science class should be required to avoid this mistake. There are also frequent grammatical and word usage errors, another editorial problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but didn't finish","review":"This was an engaging book at times. The two plots were a little frustrating, but came together. It seemed like they would fully join in on an explosive ending. However, it left me with an empty feeling that I can only fix by reading another long winded book."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'LL BE COLLECTING DUST!","review":"If you want a well-crafted suspense story, with a credible plot, in-depth characterisation, and authentic dialogue, then this book is not for you. Just to give you two samples of the sort of writing it contains:Description \\"...the luminous black eyes that seemed to pour out of the deep sockets like oil escaping the earth...\\" (p. 114 - yes, I got that far!).Dialogue: \\"De Haven simply did not have that sort of collection. ...... No first-edition Psalm Book was ever a part thereof.\\" (I kid you not)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't reward this author for leaving the reader hanging.","review":"In this book Baldacci introduces two stories. While both stories are \\"OK\\", the second one; (actually the better one) is not concluded. The reader is left hanging and ostensibly forced to buy what will likely be his next book in order to finish this first book.I bought this book expecting to read a complete story. What I got was 1.5 stories neither of which are great or up to Balcacci's norm. I won't be buying another one of his books, however incomplete, in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I love it.I have it in hardback but wanted a second copy to read when at our beach home.Good read and Baldacci is as good as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time to read","review":"If it wasn't for the plot, I'd rate this 1 star. The writing is elementary at best and the style is very generic. Many lines and descriptions are very cheesy and a little bigoted at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Collectors","review":"The book arrived really quick and was in excellent shape - thank you! Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfairly left hanging","review":"Prior to reading this book, I didn't know that it was a sequel of a sort. It was fine as a stand alone book, but at the end he leaves the story line that comprised half the book unfinished. Apparently, it's so you will buy the next book. I'm not really a fan of this type of thing. If you are going to do that, then put something on the front like \\"number two in a series of six\\". I have a limited budget for books and when I get a book I expect it to have and ending, good or bad. I will hesitate before buying any of Baldacci's books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, poor writing","review":"Balducci sometimes comes up with good plot ideas, as he did in The Collectors, but they're weakened by his inability to create believable characters, write believable dialog, or use good English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again?","review":"Once upon a time David Baldacci spent the time to write a couple of pretty entertaing novels. His most recent work, however, has become progressively worse with \\"The Collectors\\" really starting to hit the bottom. On the positive side, the story is interesting and we have some good characters. The problem is the quality of the writing. I have to believe he doesn't believe in editors or if he does, he doesn't allow them to do their jobs. \\"The Collectors\\" reads much more like a weak first of second novel than it does a veteran author who has proven to have a talent to entertain. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"I love this writer and none of his books as disappointed me. This is probably my favorite so far. I look forward to every book he pens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes I Know","review":"I'm going against the grain. Others didn't like this book but I did. I'm not going to write a plot summary since others have already did that way better than I could. Yes, the story does have some plot holes or places where you aren't sure that's really possible. However, I still liked the book. I enjoyed The Camel Club and to really enjoy the characters you should read that book first. I did like the new character of Annabelle Conroy. I liked that Mr. Baldacci wrote a strong smart woman character. This book has some plot twists but there isn't a killer to figure out since that's given to you right off the bat. The mystery is how is everything related and Mr. Baldacci has really did that well. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to someone looking for a political thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collectors collected me!","review":"Once again Balducci keeps you on the edge of your page turning, and twists the plot just enough for you to wonder what the heck is going on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"\\"The Collectors\\" has two story lines - spies and con artists. The action is fast and gripping, but Baldacci only wraps up the spy story. The con artist story, which takes up half the book, is just a setup for some future book. Whatever that book is, I'm off Baldacci; I refuse to take out a Baldacci subscription to see how his plots end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Collectors","review":"I don't watch soap operas,I don't watch episodes marked \\"first of two parts\\", and I hate end-of-season cliff-hangers. I want to see, or read, or listen to a complete story and then move on to something else. I don't like to have an ending held hostage.I was enjoying this book on CD as a way to be entertained while driving, but was really annoyed to find it a cliff-hanger. I'll just assume that things turn out alright, but will avoid this author in the future. Books that play this trick on a reader at the end need to have a disclaimer on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci hits another home run with The Collectors","review":"Oliver Stone and crew are back in an interesting mystery that has murders, espionage, casino cons, and much more that keep the pages turning. The book starts off with the introduction of a new character, Annabelle Conroy, who is organizing a con against an Atlantic City casino that is still run by the mob. Oliver Stone and crew are back in Washington where Caleb Shaw, the librarian at the Library on Congress, is thrust into the meat and potatoes murder mystery of the book.While Caleb and Oliver work to solve a mystery that has international implications, Annabelle crosses paths with Stone, and helps the members of the Camel Club solve a very interesting case.With all of the twists and turns that one expects from Baldacci, The Collectors will keep you turning the pages and even in the end leave you wanting more! A great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time invested reading it!","review":"I can't believe this book has received so many 5 star reviews! To me it was like Baldacci got to a point where he thought \\"nup, can't be bothered with it anymore, I'll just wrap it up\\" - either that or he was past deadline. The \`con/casino' story, which I thought was a more interesting plot than the main story, disappeared somewhere half way through the book only to be given a brief paragraph at the very end. Not to mention the \\"Scooby Do\\" ending that was the old cranky guy fooled them all with a wig and fake beard - laughable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the collectors","review":"possibly one of the most boring books ever -- had to put it down after about page 175, and i rarely ever abandon a bookno point or plot -- it just never went anywherei've never read baldacci before - just going by reviews so i picked it off the shelf - maybe this is one of his earlier efforts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better!","review":"Badacci writes the perfect thriller mystery, whatever you call it.Idon't know if this called pop culture novels or what, but i insist of that this is the kind of book that is an anjoyable ride.

They call themselves \\"The Camel Club.\\"In this case, a high level government official is murdered as is a caretaker at the Library of Congress.The group springs to action to solve the murders, along with Annabelle--a woman who makes her living hustling others out of their money. Sound ridiculous? It is......The end, which I won't give away here, gets even sillier and is reminiscent of a Scooby Doo cartoon. When they catch one of the evil doers, all I could hear is, \\"And I would have gotten away with it too if it hadn't been for you darn old men.....\\"I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept my Interest","review":"A collector of lost chances; a collector of a personal item from each of his murder victims. The Speaker of the House is murdered; the Director of the Library of Congress Rare Books dies suddenly; his neighbor is shot dead; a skilled con artist pulls off a big-time con on an Atlantic City casino owner. The Camel Club guys (yes, this is a sequel of sorts) and others get into big trouble. This skillfully told story comes together neatly and leaves the door wide open for the continuing saga. There's plenty of action, and it's well-written. My review cannot do it justice...buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Baldacci readers","review":"Another well written novel by David Baldacci. Character development is outstanding, a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery, Murder, Romance and political intrigue","review":"I very much enjoyed this one with Oliver Stone and the quick witted, fast thinking Annabelle Conroy. There isn't much suspense but the plot continues to twist and turn with characters that are quirky, intelligent and real.

But someone sent me \\"The Camel Club\\" which I thought was great. SO, I decided to give Mr. Baldacci another chance. Was really disappointed in \\"The Collectors\\". There are just too many elements that Baldacci tried to tie together, in this effort.As a Note; one of the Editorial Reviews (Publishers Weekly?) confused Caleb Shaw with Oliver Stone/John Carr. Oliver/John is the triple six."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Baldacci","review":"This is the first that I've read by this author. I almost stopped reading the book during my reading of the first two chapters. At times his writing was trite and his descriptions just lazy.I think the book did get better; however, I'm not running out to check out his other books. Thank goodness for libraries, as I would have never bought the book myself.Oh, and I thought the Fox News watching reviewer's review was hilarious. Simply had me smiling and LOL. I'm not a Fox watcher nor do I live in the US anymore, but I didn't think the book was too left of center. Ah, the vagaries of our own politics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in My Collection","review":"Every once in a while I give Baldacci another try, hoping he will return to his earlier excellence. Perhaps a more recent book will deliver, however this one needed serious editing. I thought it would never end and then it did, sort of since it will be continued in a future book. I recall when Last Man Standing turned me off on this author. This one was fun enjoying the fantasy of con artists, but over 500 pages just was overkill. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..not to Baldacci's standards","review":"Amateurish writing. Completely unbelievable plot. Author created situations that don't tie together just to fill pages. Worst book by this author that I have read and I am a regular. Very disappointed. Only reason to read this book t is that he introduced characters that will be needed to understand future Camel Club books. Don't waste your time with this one. Laborious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mess","review":"I enjoyed The Camel Club, but this sequel to that novel is a bit of a mess with a number of continuity errors. The material involving the short and long cons perpetrated against the owner of an Atlantic City casino constitutes the more interesting part of the book, but one has to wonder how the Camel Club members manage to survive in their segment, given how utterly incompetent they are. Time and again, they are kidnapped or blackjacked from behind. And I hardly know what to say about the convenient placement of a box cutter that allows for the improbable escape from deadly peril by two of the characters. If one can read this book with an entirely uncritical eye, there is some entertainment value here, but there is a nearly unlimited number of thrillers out there that would be more worth someone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Baldacci of The Winner????","review":"This book, \\"The Collectors\\" is an example of formula writing if I ever saw it. I loved everything Baldacci wrote up to and including \\"Wish You Well\\". After that... milk toast. David Baldacci has suddenly become the new V.C. Andrews!!! The Collector's bland characters and disappointingly weak plot are unbelievable. Sorry David... I won't bother with \\"Stone Cold\\". \\"Camel Club\\" was weak enough but what's the deal with \\"Oliver Stone\\"? Some subliminal anti-Bush message there?

The writing is about on par with a 1940's cliff-hanger serial, and the characters as believable.

Beidermeir furniture, plantation shutters, Le Corbusier furniture and parquet flooring all feature in this stylish expose of classicism.

Selections include a portion of his Second Piano Concerto, and his Third Violin Concerto, two of his best works. Also featured on this disc are two other works that feature the solo violin: Havanaise, and the Intro and Rondo Capriccioso. Enjoyable works these! A fine variety of other works round out this very nice tour of the great 19th-century French composer's music. This label, Naxos, is widely acclaimed as the absolute best BUDGET classical label. However, don't let the nice price fool you. Naxos delivers fine QUALITY recordings, time after time. The major critics concur.

This was a delightful saga of Penelope Keeling, and the painting her father painted, titled \\"The Shell Seekers\\". The story goes back and forth between the past(Penelope's childhood, through WWII, her unsatisfactory marriage, and the one true love of her life, Richard), leading back to the present,tells you about her children, and how one of her daughters, Olivia, is much like Penelope, while her other daughter and her son, are just greedy and selfish, always wanting more. This a wonderful saga depicting Penelope's life, and I found myself feeling like I was there, with her, and was reading the book with an English accent in my head!!

The writing was excellent and the charcters real.I always admire writers who came create three dimensional charcters, and Pilcher does just that. Penlope's has three children, and she does not get along well with two of them, Nacy and Noel. These children are money hungry and think their mother owes them more than she has already given them. However Pilcher makes it clear that Penlope loves all her children and the reader winds up having some sympathy for them.The novel manges to come full circle and charm the reader. It is clear that Oliva, the daughter Penlope gets along with best, will become like her mother. The manner in which their lives parelle each other is the central focus of the novel and charms the reader. A great summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite story of all time...","review":"This story is amazing and well-written and just such a wonderful read!

Currently there is a major problem with instability with the servers used to play that Origin blames on not enough server memory. They state no more memory can be added to the current servers so now we have a major problem. Constant server crashes and more often than not, major lag becomes a huge factor making the game nearly unplayable at the current time. The features and gameplay are fantastic WHEN you can get on and play for a while. My suggestion would be to wait until summer before spending your money on this game. Maybe then they'll have there end working. A quick comment on in game support, I'm writing this review while waiting on it (6 hours and counting)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No housing left","review":"very frustrating to get connected and find out that there is no land left to build a house... not to mention what land is available can't be built on.

But the servers are getting worse and worse, and now it's just not worth paying 10 bucks a month for a game that is laggier than Diablo 2. Don't get me wrong this is a good game with good gameplay and great fun but the lag is destroying it. If they decide to fix the servers I will bring my review up to a 5. If they make the game free but keep the laggy servers then I will only change it to a 3 because that would prove that Electronic Arts are just too lazy and don't care enough about the players enjoyment of the game to fix anything and they would have basically just give up on the game.If you want a free online RPG with less lag then get Diablo 2.If you want an MMORPG with little lag then get Asheerons Call, Asherons Call 2, or Dark Age of Camelot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultima Offline","review":"Up until this upgrade of the UO, things have been great. Since this update on 2/11, logging onto the server has been very slow if at all. If you are lucky enough to get logged on, then you have to put up with all the lag, either because of all the custom houses on the server now, or because UO was not ready for an influx of people, either way, it makes for a lousy time. The new world Malas is too small, and does not really add to the game at all. I hope they can fix these problems, but if not, then I will be looking for a new online game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.....","review":"well for one thing it gets quite boring, there arent many jobs to select from, the graphics ..., theres bugs, not for dial - up users well its a waste of time its terrible trust me there are a lot better mmorpgs out there like everquest and please dont buy this and stay away from it if you see it on the shelves trust me this ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving Backwards","review":"I'm not sure what they were thinking. The changes that went into this game should have been saved for a different game entirely. I've been playing Ultima Online since September of 1997 and after upgrading to this new release its possible that the game is at its worst. For new players I suppose they wouldn't know the difference. For older players? I've got a mage who can't leave the house without dying anymore because they thought it would be clever to change the magic resisance rules. As far as the advertisment of building your own house? I've been in the game for over five years and the friend that I have that does have a house bought his on Ebay. I upgraded figuring I'd be able to buy a house in the new lands. ..... I've found Dark Age Of Camelot to be not nearly as deep a game but the people are FAR more polite and the game has infinitely superior graphics.Thanks and good luck to you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customizable houses were the best part of this expansion","review":"What can you say about Ultima Online? This game has broken more ground in the MMO genre than any other game. Other MMOs are to this day copying aspects of Ultima Online.

The customizable houses are probably the main thing that has now extended the life of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had been playing Ultima Online for 3 years prior to the release of this expansion. The bugs surpassed anything I've previously seen Electronic Arts let out the door. They really outdid themselves with this one.And that doesn't even get started on the fact they turned the entire game upside down and inside out, completely changing everything. I thought I'd logged into Diablo Online accidently.The roll out was so awful, Electronic Art's subsidary, Origin Systems has offered a reward to compensate players for their trouble.This expansion ruin a once great game. I stopped playing within 1 week of this expansion and moved on to Dark Age of Camelot. If you're looking for something like UO used to be, check out Shadowbane. Even for free, Age of Shadows is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated gameplay","review":"You would think that a mmorpg game ,backed by a large gaming company like EA, would revamp this game to keep up with modern game play. In it's time, UO was an awesome game. But now games like Neverwinter Nights have left this game behind in the past where it belongs. I quit playing UO in disgust waiting for phase 3 of the Housing to kick in over six months ago. Checking the UO website I have found to date they still have not started phase 3 . The quest,(yes singular)were drawn out and you had to wait for the next part of the quest to be activated, what a joke. The expansion pack will be more of the same.

I played for 13 months, and the only reason I hung on for so long was the promise of a new version with more land and better game play. Instead what we got was the same old thing. The players with the cheats got all the new land, and the rest of us got left out in the cold. The lag became unbearable even with my dsl connection. Connections kept getting dropped. It is a mess. After 13 months of nightly play to try to build up my character, putting up with all the rude people and trying to earn enough money to buy a house when age of shadows came out and to find out that 1 day after it did come out all the land was gone, I decided to cancel.

Their new \\"item insurance\\" feature ensures that if you have the gold, you will never lose an item, taking away the risk factor for almost every encounter, whether it be fighting monsters, or fighting other players.If you want a game that is a race to see who has the best items, by all means buy it.

So it seems like it would be challenging to get lost and swept away in the game. Au contraire, mon frere! I am sucked in and even when UXO comes out, I am sure I am going to stay subscribed to UO.

This newest version is perhaps the worst debacle to visit the virtual world that is Ultima Online, and to anyone who has witnessed the mayhem inherent to Age of Shadows will understand of what I speak. If you are knew to this gameplay experience then I tell you you have already missed the best of what was to offer and furthermore it will never return. This version of Ultima Online was a debacle from the point when I \\"preordered\\" it. With a slew of daily bugs and client crashes, I'm sure everyone who purchases this game will be quite disappointed.

I was so put off by the psychobabble that pervades nearly every sentence of the biography of this man that I found it impossible to go on. It felt like being in a high school class just introduced to Freud, Jung et al. The author actually talks about Napoleon's short stature as an impetus to his need to succeed...the first sentence of the book I thought was tongue in cheek (to the effect of Napoleon was not a real person but a creation of the French nation's need for blood after the age of reason ---paraphrasing). But no...its all like that. His mother is powerful and controlling, his father is weak and emasculated...he hates his older brother and repressed it, therefore, the rest of Europe will suffer because he holds in what he would like to do to his older brother but cannot.

Correct writing strategy requires that your drive firmware recognize the disc media ID code. This means that you have to visit the Pioneer website and update your firmware in order to write to new media. If there is no newer firmware you have to stick to older media. Also, both the 104 and the 106 are limited to writing -RW media at a speed of 2X regardless of the rated speed on the media.That being said, the quality of the burn with these discs is just fair. If you want a better disc go to the much better Ritek +RWs at the same price (assuming that your drive will work with +RW)."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT INTRODUCTION TO NORWAY'S GREATEST COMPOSER","review":"When i first picked up this cd, i must say that i was somewhat dubious in doing so.

For some reason (coincidental?), I found myself listening to this a lot in June. I like this Best of series from Naxos because, almost invariably, I'll come across a piece that I hadn't heard before, but that I love (the movement from Glazunov's violin Concerto - from the Best of Glazunov CD - being the last example).

Justin, so far, is doing pretty well in his solo career. But I don't think that JC should be doing this type of music because he can do so much better with his voice and talent. I can personally see him doing jazz music, that's my opinion. He has great dance songs, you put one on, I'm immediately dancing. But he needs to do more with his voice. He has an awesome voice and he shouldn't withold it from his music or his fans. He should experiment with other types of music, but not rock, that would be bad.

Who allowed this to be broadcast on the radio? I am not a pop hater, I like most music, and I even respect Justin Timberlake as a talented singer-- but come on! All JC does in this song is yell and make a lot of unpleasant noise! The trumpets in the background, combined with his yelling, make this sound like a freak circus."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Dissapointing","review":"As the often hailed most talented member of NSYNC begins his journey into solo music, I can't help but feel like this is but a song that falls extremely short. The song has no heart and is discombobulated like he was torn in fifteen directions without any real direction. Hopefully future efforts will have better results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blowin Me Away!","review":"Extremely catchy and lots of fun, \\"Blowin Me Up\\" blew me away with its driving rhythms, unusual musical structure and its undeniably playful yet dirty...appeal. The song is both original and yet reminiscent of Prince and Queen in the harmonies.It's unlike anything else on the radio and certainly different from any thing that JC Chasez has done with Nsync which will surprise Nsync fans and non Nsync fans alike and certainly surprised me, but displays the artist's evolving songwriting talents.A great song and I am certainly looking forward to his solo debut album out next year which is sure to be as unique as the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"When hearing the song the first time, i wasn't too impressed by the shouting and moaning. The song, however, was well-written and I soon found it on repeat. This is probably one of the better songs the singer has written, showing that he has matured from the innocent pop sound of NSYNC. I expect to hear more and better things JC. From what I have already heard, including this song, it is better than his bandmate's CD: Justified. I look forward to the release of Schizophrenic and expect it should do well in sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated gem","review":"First, let me preface this by saying that I wasn't a Nsync fan and I had no idea who JC Chasez was when I heard the vastly underrated \\"Blowin Me Up\\", but I've become an unabashed fan since.JC is an adventurous songwriter with an intriguing way of putting his songs together, making them going go directions that I wouldn't necessarily expect and yet making it work. It's an admirable trait especially in today's often calculating music industry.From his stellar collaborations with BT and the Basement Jaxx and the first single (\\"Some Girls\\") from his upcoming album, it's obvious that he isn't afraid to explore and take risks with his music. It's also clear that he possesses a talent that is both versatile and undeniable.I'd never thought I'd say this with my former boyband prejudices, but I can't wait for his solo album to see what he's got up his sleeve. It's certain to be something unexpected, but something very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific collaboration","review":"Boo Hewerdine and Darden Smith combine to create an outstanding pop/folk/country stew. This one has it all -- catchy hooks, quirky lyrics and lasting images. \\"All I want (Is Everything\\" and \\"Reminds Me (A Little of You)\\", in a just world would both have been huge radio hits. If you're a fan of Paul Kelly, John Hiatt, Jackson Browne or other similar singer-songwriters, you should buy this album. Though both have gone on to create some wonderful music separately, the only sad thing is that this is their only collaboration. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious music","review":"This is a wonderful selection of songs by two (relatively new at the time) artists who were put together by the record companies and came through marvelously with catchy tunes and enthusiastic vocals.

They were wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antique Woman","review":"This is not a bad album but there is really only one GREAT track (#3). The rest is a quiet electronic breeze with some noise thrown in now and again to wake you up.

I was excited to have a \\"pretty\\" Taxi Wallet this time around but, upon receiving it, was unimpressed with the quality of the leather. It seemed much thinner than my old wallet. But I transferred all my stuff to the new model and tossed it in my purse. After just a few months of use, the snap that holds the coin flap down broke off, rendering the pocket useless.

I've had my original Taxi Wallet for over 6 years, but have purchased 3 others over the last couple years - they have so many great styles, I can't resist! It may be a compact wallet, but there's a spot for everything you need to carry in a wallet, and since it's small - I can carry it in any size handbag I want. My husband also owns one - that he has carried everyday for 4 years in his front pocket, and it has held up beautifully.

Miss Piggy, formerly a strong, positive female character (much-needed in these times), comes off as a throwback to the days when ambitious women were portrayed as man-hating, greedy barracudas.

Additionally, death and decay are the result of sin, prior to Adam and Eve sinning, there would not have been death and decay.

This was a last ditch effort,we couldn't find a tree co. that would touch them for less than $2,500 a tree!! So we bought the saw, and after experimenting with how to get the rope 50 feet in the air (we used a fishing weight,heavy gauge fishing line and a sling shot and shot the weight over the branch,then tied the rope to the fihing line and pulled the rope over the limb to be cut) we took those trees down piece by piece.

It works best on branches that are (more) parallel with the ground because it has a metal plate that acts as a weight to align the blade to be right side up.

Since it is inevitable that the saw will be pinched by the limb, the rope connection to the blade should be strong enough to sustain enough force so that the blade can be moved again. Unfortunately the metal piece was easily broken off and the rope came off the blade, wasting me 2 hrs to remove it and made hand tie to reattach the blade to the rope. Then the same metal piece on the sand bag end broke off the rope after the sand bag was stuck in tree branches.

It's not like I never trimmed a tree before--I spend a summer working as a tree trimmer while in college. However, this tool doomed the operation from the start.First the bean bag used to throw the rope over the limb got stuck. When I pulled it back, it ripped open, losing the sand and ruining the bag. The two of us used a padlock for a substitute weight and got the rope and chain over the first limb. During the early stages of sawing one of the red handles broke. Then the chain refused to saw further, wedging itself in the saw cut.I now have two pretty yellow ropes hanging from my tree, with a stuck chain, and no prospects in ever getting it down without calling the pros and their boom truck.Although the chain itself seemed to be of reasonable quality, the rest of this product was made with poor quality materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Limb Chain Saw","review":"The product does exactly what it is designed to do and does it well. There are two items that a purchaser might want to be aware of. First of all, using the saw does give the operator a good bit of exercise, but at least it is the kind of exercise that actually accomplishes something practical. The second issue is that a bit of skill (luck) is required to get the rope over the correct limb without getting it wrapped completely around the intended or another branch. That happened to me, and I spent at least an hour and a good bit of energy and ingenuity getting it loose so I could use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy product","review":"I broke my neighbor's version of this saw which had a 2 foot length of chain when the chain got bound in the cut I was making.

The throw bag works well (though the clip has to be reshaped every time as it bends). The hand straps work very well for working the rope. However, the whole idea falls down due to the chain. Despite design attempts to keep the cutting edge of the chain pointed to the tree (there is a metal piece that you are supposed hold between the ropes to prevent this) the chain always rolls and the teeth only fan air. Since the metal piece is at best 6 inches long any limb exceeding 4 inches and you can't effectively engage the guide.

( works great )I used it to cut down a large ear tree in a small back yard so I had to cut one branch at a timeI am happy with this product . It saved me from climbing a tall ladder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but a few flaws","review":"There are two things that I would change w/ this product. First the clip used to attach the weighted bag is a joke. It is a very cheap metal clip that bent the first time I tried wrangling a branch and soon fell off and was lost. I would suggest getting rid of the clip and using an inexpensive caribiner. I also found that I had better luck getting the blade side down by connecting the bag to the opposite rope of where the factory clip was. Also the rope would work much better in getting the bag down if it was a smooth nylon rope and not a braided rope. My rope is getting frayed and I'm going to replace it w/ some smooth nylon rope soon. I found that a light touch when the blade first bites works best. If you reef on it too hard it gets jammed and it takes some doing to get it moving again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised + broke on first use","review":"The product information states that the chain is 48\\". In fact the chain is only 24\\". On the first use the weight bag used to loft the rope over the limb pulled free from the metal clasp. The clasp deformed and is now unusable. Trying to saw a 2\\" maple limb was disappointing. Right now the saw is wedged in a partial saw kerf, the limb is hanging but won't come down and I'm angry that I wasted the money.

My high limb was about 55' high. It does take some practice throwing that bag over the limb. I ended up using a ladder and my \\"roof rake\\" with 4 extensions. Besides this little setback, once the rope and chain were up there... it only took a few minutes to cut through an 8\\" limb. I had to use extensions on their yellow rope and I had the 48\\" chain (highly recommended - bigger cuts with your pull each time because you have a longer cutting surface than the 24\\") Make sure you keep that 45 degree angle away from the tree... with the rope extensions this was no problem.

It doesn't always stay cutting edge down so you have to throw the saw back up to change which side is down(Only one side of the blade cuts). It binds frequently and sometimes gets stuck.

It took a lot of attempts. There's got to be a better way to get it up there - like attaching the end of the string to a remote control toy helicopter? Why not? :) But maybe it's just us. Once the saw was in place, the rest was relatively easy - just pull it back and forth. A piece of advice - once you get it going - don't stop to catch a breath or readjust untill the branch is cut off completely. We stopped, and the saw immediately got stuck. And it's really hard to get it moving again.Overall, we got the job done just fine. Maybe the next time we have to use the saw it will be easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"worked right on a few 4-5 inch limbs that i had to remove, though it did pinch really bad on one of them as the limb bent down. wasn't the saw's fault tho. as this is likly to happen again, i will keep a couple long pieces of pvc pipe around to lift the limb and unstick the saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"High limb saw","review":"Well I was a little reluctant to try this saw but once we recieved it we were amazed.

I bought it because of the buyer comments, and they were great comments. The comments explained how to use it. I used it with my daughter. I was careful to make sure the blade was teeth down. I had to right the teeth to the down position, but the comments explained how to do that by flipping the saw a bit. The saw worked very, very well.

We even had two people doing the sawing (which helps the angle) but the chain still got stuck. We had to get a ladder to get the chain down. If you have a tall ladder it is easier just to use that and it really can reach just as high as the rope saw. So when the rope saw works it's nice to have but I've found it frequently hard to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This product does not work. It is a total Waste of money.

At best, it is sharp, with beautiful bokeh, etc, etc. Typical quality we expect from Leica-like optics (this isn't really a leica lens, but as close as you can get from Panaasonic's factories.) The bad thing is that it is not nearly as well built as Olympus. No moisture protection, so with an E-3 not a great fit. Also, it suffered from the all-too-typical \\"Zoom Lock\\" problem. A screw gets loose and it won't zoom past 25mm or so. It was a fairly easy fix, but not for everyone. A little irritating for a lens costing this much. If you suffer from this problem, please search out on the internet for the repair instructions. The fix is available for the brave ones out there. That having been said, I do like this lens.

I am an avid bassist of over 10 years and I bought this album thinking that I would hear some great jazz with some eccentric bass to it. I was wrong. There is no percussion on this CD, and half of the tracks are 30 second studio outtakes of Vic mumbling about things before he starts playing. He's a great bassist if you like hearing appregios, pops and slaps, muted strings, and finger tapping. I would just love to hear what Vic can do in a band with drums, keyboards, etc. I was disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"Ok here's the deal. Victor Wooten is without a doubt one of the world's top bassists today. But simply put, I find this album little more than a novelty. Sure, Victor showcases some amazing chops and great tone throughout the album. However I find I tire of this album easily. His compositions are distinctly \\"bass\\" compositions, which is not a compliment, even coming from me, a bass player. I could never see a band playing any of them. The best track here is the medley of standards. Another problem with this cd are the annoying radio interludes, leaving you with barely half of the \\"real\\" tracks you expected. Granted, this is a very interesting album to listen to, but I don't like interesting music. I like passionate music, and I find little of it here.

If you are a biologist or biology student and would like a firm grounding in the historical development of the science, its philosophical underpinnings, and our current evolutionary paradigm, then this book is for you. Ernst Mayr is a very proficient, clear writer. Some of the thinking about certain subfields and some concepts have changed somewhat in the 30 years since this book was published, but for the most part the book holds up incredibly well. Mayr is both a scientist and a historian of science, so familiarity with important ideas in the study of the history of science is helpful (Kuhn, Popper, etc...), but not essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Globemaster","review":"The book was apparently written by a flight engineer assigned to the Hamilton AFB 336 MAS in the aircraft's later years.

The typical mission from Travis to Vietnam was not typical of anywhere else in the world. As a former navigator, the book was simply wrong regarding flying over Africa, S.

The plot, although slightly unbelievable, was interesting. I cared about some of the characters and their situations. The writing was surprisingly good, at times. But I did feel it was unrealistic. How many problems can one girl go through in 23 years of life? She had some BAD luck meeting the WRONG people... Some of the writing was bad, just as some of the writing was good. I could sense when she was hurrying through a particular passage or scene. All in all, I'll probably read another...but I wasn't terribly impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Read Home","review":"Oh, my God! I have never read Danielle Steel before, and I certainly expected more than what I got from this bestselling author. The story was full of pathos and grabbed my attention all right, but much of the horror came from the poor quality of her writing and research. Such stories of abuse do exist, but I don't think Steel has a clue about the real impact that the (unrealistic) conditions she set up would have on a young girl like Gabriela. The dialogue was pedestrian and she continually \\"told\\" us what emotions her characters were having, rather than \\"showing\\" us through skillful storytelling. I will run rather than walk if I see another book by this author coming my way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tissues, anyone?","review":"I found, as a person with physical abuse in my past, this novel was very touching and difficult to read. However, it reinforced very sharply to me several important points. Steel advocated through her writing that a person cannot blame themself for life occurrences beyong their control and among other things, it is important to face your past. I instantly felt connected with Gabbie. She captured childhood thoughts I still clearly remember verbatim out of my mind. This is my new favorite book. A must-read! Trust me, it's worth your time!!

Then I turned to wanting revenge - hoping that the parents would suffer ill fates equal to that which that had bestowed upon their child, however, that story line was not developed either. Once again I had to change course and hoped that something concrete about the parents' past would be revealed so that you didn't finish the book in despair, but that wasn't in the writing either.Several times I thought, seriously, this is the path Ms. Steele chose to to take this story and each time my interest in the characters diminished even more. I had to force myself to finish the book because I had invested so much time in it.Not the author's best work.

I read it as fast as I could to see what happened to get it over with. It's a shame Steel took such an important subject matter, child abuse, and created a book that is pure misery to read, not because of the subject matter, but her poor craftsmanship. Gabreilla's innocent years in the convent and the beginning of her romance with Joe were classic Steel, but the horror of the end of that romance and the subsequent plot line will make you cringe if you've read some of her best such as Jewels or Crossings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danielle Steel at her finest!","review":"I have loved reading Danielle's books for many years now and The Long Road home I would say is my favorite.

I found that the romance between Gabbie and the priest to be awful and the fact that he killed himself over it to be worse. The priest and Gabbie were both weak and that would not happen like that in real life I do not believe. Their whole romance was one of the worst things I have ever read. Then the ending of the book was horrible also how can she fall in love with someone whom she hardly knows and has never seen outside of a hospital talk about a violation of the doctor patient relationship! The ending of the book left a lot to be desired I would not recommend this book to anyone after reading the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"This was the very first Danielle Steele book I ever read, and I decided to buy it to find out why she is constantly on the best seller lists. My, was I disappointed. Her English is childish and the some of the chapters were crying out for proper editing! For an author so popular I had expected a highly skilled and eloquent form of writing. That is definitely not what I got. Although I was in suspense for most of the book, and some of it did bring out feelings of anger and sadness, the story was too dramatic and unrealistic. I mean really, how could one person go through so many tragedies in their life? I brought the book on holidays with me and every time something bad happened to the main character (every 5 minutes!) I told my friends who were with me and we just laughed and laughed and laughed. It was so stupid! If you want a trashy novel, go ahead and buy it. But otherwise, stay away, stay well away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...blah ending","review":"This book was a definate page turner, I had a very hard time putting it down.

Kind of underminded the whole triumph over tragedy plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and unrealistic","review":"No one is all bad or all good. I wish someone had told Ms. Steel that before she began writing this book. The characters throughout the book are exceedingly unbelievable, with the main character's mother being the Devil Incarnate.

The worst book I have ever read.","review":"I am surprised how many people wrote positive reviews to this book. It was the worst book I have ever read. Danielle Steel does not want her readers to think or use their imagination even for a second. All emotions and actions of people are spelled out for the reader. The story is very primitive. Everybody in it is either a pure devil or an angel. Is the book supposed to be a fairy tale or a real life story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got to Be Kidding Me","review":"I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews for this book.

I tell you this, if you want a book that you will never forget, then this is the book for you.

Wilson is the true testament of what class and grace under fire is. She has raw energy in her live performances and can belt out a ballad as strong as any diva today.She is a woman of beauty,grace, and courage. To anyone familiar with the life history of Wilson, her strength to persevere is an inspiration to all. So congratulations to a woman who deserves nothing but the best, May God Bless You, always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary steps out of Diana's shadow with \\"U\\".","review":"The forthcoming CD release \\"U\\" by original Supreme Mary Wilson is just what Mary needs to break into the mainstream and have that elusive hit record. It's quite danceable, familiar tale of relationship gone bad but girl's still in love. Teens will love its infectious dance groove. Should appeal not only to urban dance markets, but the pop market as well. This new single showcases Mary at her best: Eclective and Exciting. . Club programmers will jump on this right away if RADIO gives it half a chance. In years passed, Mary has suffered from lack or airplay. Hopefully this single will not fare the same fate. As a friend of Mary's for nearly 15 years, this single has the potential to finish what \\"Walk The Line\\" in 1992 started: put Mary Wilson back in the Top 10 as a single solo recording artist. Mary--U go girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Product","review":"Mary Wilson can't sing. She never could. If she could - why didn't she step in for Diana Ross in 1970? Because she can't sing.She can't hold a candle to any of the other Supremes singers - Jean Terrell, Lynda Laurence or Scherrie Payne - that's why she tried to stop them from using the Supremes name - but lost because she didn't own the name!Every once in a while an unknown producer will come along and offer her a recording deal - usually the company will go out of business like her last release - and that's the end of that. This is one of those examples. The song is awful, the voice is awful, and you can tell it was recording using a one-man computer generated program instead of real instruments.Low budget. Look elsewhere. There are many great vocalists out there - like her former partners - the Former Ladies of The Supremes who can sing circles around Mary Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"True talent and the next big things","review":"The CD is amazing, this is true talent in most of the cases. Sandra Lan with Besame Mucho is probably the best of all, her voice is sexy and the vocals are truly amazing. Marger Sealey is true talent. Some of them are a little weak like Viviana Arana, and Tania Solis. This is amazing, go and buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Addition to the Literature","review":"This book may be the most elementary introduction to algebraic geometry. Still it is roughly senior level and unlike the review above I am not sure that it is suitable for students in secondary education. Nonetheless, it fills a niche that has been largely vacant in the undergraduate literature and I recommend it to serious students and undergraduates alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you remmeber","review":"This is one of those films that misses the \\"classic\\" category by a fair bit, and really is for Pal completists only. The science and humor has dated pretty badly, and the FX are pretty funny. The blue-screening on the space wheel makes it somewhat transparent along its bottom circumference. I can't believe no one noticed this, therefore I have to conclude that they let it go hoping no one would notice. Well, that hope is in vain. I can't say much for the acting, either. Still, it's a relatively painless way to spend an hour or so, and has undeniable historical significance in the ranks of sf film. I had remembered this film as being better than it actually is. Of course, the last time I saw it I was about 13 years old, and that was more than 40 years ago. Other films of the era have dated, as well, but they're lots more fun to watch. THEM, for example, or FORBIDDEN PLANET, or even INVADERS FROM MARS. Those still pack a punch. CONQUEST OF SPACE is more of a bitch-slap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Movie","review":"I enjoy older classic sci fi movies, but this misses the mark, and does so badly. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sci-fi \\"realism\\".","review":"This 1955 epic was a commendable effort by producer George Pal to give the public a more-or-less realistic look at what space travel might be like a few decades ahead, with no monsters and aliens and all that. But the result is a film that is MORE dated, and less enjoyable, than SF films made even earlier which DID have monsters and aliens and all that. Almost every character is a corny stereotype, including the inevitable crude -but-basically-smart funny guy from Brooklyn. The film includes two memorably ridiculous plot contrivances."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarassment of Astronomical Proportion","review":"Stupid characters, an idiot plot and excruciatingly bad dialogue kill this turkey long before the rotten set design and bad special effects have a chance.

She gets a kick out hiding in it with her toys as well as attacking the tie strings that hang down off of the edges. The exterior material seems durable and has a slight crackling sound. The interior is lined with a soft materiel (it reminds me of a very soft quilt batting) that might last if you don't have a cat that likes to chew on things; mine does and has already bitten a small amount out of it. It would also be a problem with a cat that wants to use its claws on it. I am not sure how durable any soft lining could be for a destructive cat, though. Overall all I consider it a very good deal for the price and my cat incorporates it in her frequent play frenzies through the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Shy Cats, Too","review":"This is the one toy my cats have never tired of. I put it in a place where two cats passing each other sometimes have disagreements. And I have one shy cat who always runs through it on the way to dinner and hides there when she gets nervous. It's not a small toy, but then my cats aren't small, either. For variety, I'll move it to a new place and they act like they have a whole new toy. I added on to it and took it around a corner, too. It's become more than a toy; it's standard furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it","review":"My two 2 year old cats love this tunnel. They like to sleep inside as it is spacious and comfortable because of the quilt-like material on the interior. They hide their toys inside. When they are feeling playful, they run through the tunnel and launch sneak attacks which sometimes causes the tunnel to slide all over the carpet. I never know where the tunnel will wind up by the end of the day. My cats prefer this over the previous crinkly tunnel they had that only one of them would use, and only to sleep or hide but not to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best darn toy yet","review":"My 3 Ragdolls play with this day in and day out.

I've watched them play alone or 2 or more at a time using the tunnels. All 6 join in when a family member also plays along. Several of my cats are large (18 lbs.) and the 13\\" diameter accommodates them very nicely. They run through the tunnels with no problem. They withstand a lot of roughhousing from the cats, and the nylon is easy to keep clean. I've ordered two more tunnels and saw the kitty tee connector on Amazon which is unavailable. I found out through Pet Supply Imports that the factory is no longer making them. I'm disappointed because that piece looked like it would have added to the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Kitties","review":"Thanks to Kathleen's review of thePETCO Blue and White Kitty Crinkle Tunnel, I found this wider, cushier, expandable kitty play tunnel. My cat Tiger played in it constantly when I first bought it (April 2010) and can still be found sleeping in the felt-lined interior at times. I have two tunnels and oneconnector teeso he also likes to play with the ties that connect each part. My cat Turvy is not as excited about it but his form of play seems to involve me chasing him. So now I chase him through the tunnel where, upon exit, he attacks the scratching post on the kitty condo and waits for me to come pet/scratch/snorgle him. Tiger doesn't play in it as much these days so I'm not sure if he tires of new toys easily or if the hotter weather has something to do with it since the tunnel is lined. All in all, I am really glad I made the purchase. So much so, in fact, I am contemplating getting another connector tee and one or two more tunnels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Since my cats *love* tunnels, I ordered this one, my second, because it was a lot longer than the first.

This is because there is a little thing now I like to call \\"child abuse laws\\" and nobody could pull anything like Count Olaf and his troup. The situation is so bleak it is not even believable for a novel.

Sunny dresses up as a wolf baby and Violet and Klaus dress as a two headed person. throughout the story the kids end up finding out something they really want to know but dont find out if it is 100% true. the end of this story is the most sad of them all. so i think that yu should read the book to find out what turns out to happen in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was a lot better than the others because the plot changed and the suspense increased a lot.","review":"The plot definitely changed a lot because instead of Count Olaf going to find the Baudelaires, the Baudelaires were where Olaf was. We finally get to find out how Olaf always knew where the Baudelaires were, and where one of the Baudelaire parents or Lemony Snicket might be. There was a nice build of suspense in the end because you had no idea who was going to be thrown in the pit, and you did not know that this book would end with such a cliffhanger.I liked that the book ended with such suspense because it has gotten me to want to read the next book to see what happens. This book is definitely not as boring as some of the others were.

Snicket is almost to the point of ranging out of children's territory here. That said, the quality of the writing is about as good as it ever was, and if you like the humor in the series, it doesn't let up here; it just has a much, much blacker twist to it.

For starters, they are a profoundly ugly, charcoal gray eyesore in most any space but a coal mine. The ridges on the back side did not match the pipes on the radiator and the hangers did not fit without force, making them very difficult to install and remove. We were worried about applying too much pressure because the hangers are held in place by a plastic tab which did not seem strong enough. We filled them as directed, anticipating humidity to increase warmth. Two weeks later, very little water had evaporated, and green scum had developed. I used filtered water to prevent mold. I place the humidifiers in 5 separate rooms and the net result was the same.The cost of the humidifiers was a waste and the house is still an old house heated by expensive-to-fill and circulate radiators. the $50 dollars would have been better spent on the heating bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great putting humidity into air","review":"The product works great, except it was a tight fit for our radiators.

The hooks would only have been able to grab on a round metal edge running left to right while most radiators aren't built that way, including mine and I could not use these at all.

This band of mostly Texas-based performers don't bring much but a little southern twang and Elvis's songs are too complicated for the level of musicianship displayed here.

I think the last 3 books in the Wingman series has dwindled to little more than a tired effort of the writer. He has clearly tried to go in directions that would lead to more sales rather than continuing a believable quality. He is reaching to find a connection to his earlier books and falling way, way short. I do hope he is not \\"farming out\\" the books to other writers. If he is, he needs to re-evaluate his decision and get back on track. I simply want the type of books he began with. The line of fiction he is currently trying is more like fantasy than fiction. Only one good spot in this book. If you start in the middle and quit about 30 pages later you will like this book. If you read more than that it is no doubt the worst book this author has written. I look forward to the author getting his feet back to reality. I will continue to buy his books but I sure hope they improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"An amazing book.

It's the year 7200 AD and Hunter still has his F-16 yet he flies against ultra-futuristic spacefighters belonging to a far-flung galactic empire controlled by Earth. He is looking for his true identity (still) and his only clue in this book is the American flag that he always carried in his pocket. Hunter fears that he is the last American left in the universe -- but somehow I don't think that's the case.

It could haven been the fact that most of the things talked in the book just didnt interest me. I'm sure if you would have liked the topic you would like the book.

Gilbert has done better though I credit the honesty she put forth her writing slipped from great to nearly unreadable as she dragged on for pages about 60's utopian visions or skimmed names of numerous of Conway's women. Gilbert made broad sweeping assumptions on things she seems to have no authority and wrote her voice, not just her character so deeply into the story that it was invasive.

The writing is sharp and witty and sensitive. I read pages aloud to my family on a recent vacation (the mule story) and they roared with laughter vowing to read the book.Anyone interested in Thoreau or John Muir or Everett Ruess...if you care about the planet, living simply, really following your heart--You MUST read this wonderful book.

Eldgredge professes that American males need this adventure as a rite of passage. The heart of Eldridge's book is the heart of Gilbert's books. Conway was \\"wounded\\" by his father and was told he would not - could not succeed as a man.With a degree in counseling and an love for outdoors adventure, I find the Conway story both interesting and sad. If his father had offered an ounce of compassion and nurturing, this story would never have been written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last but not the Least","review":"This story is captivating in it's subject and the style inwhich it is told. Eustace Conway is a genuine unique person worthy of our attempts to understand his perspective on our world. However, Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style that often times seemed to abandon any attempt to be objective is what really made this work so engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging read about a complicated man","review":"I enjoyed this book and its mix of personal story, historical background, and insight into a complicated man who comes off to me as earnest, if nothing else (although many aspects of his lifestyle are upsetting). Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is very readable, even when she's giving historical information rather than describing Eustace Conway's lifestyle and philosophy. Other reviews say Gilbert puts Eustace on a pedestal and doesn't convey enough of his dark side, but her friendship and admiration of his ideals is true to her, and I don't feel like she completely romanticizes him. I found his methods of \\"living off the land\\" and his difficulty with personal relationships to be disturbing, but it feels true to the nature of Eustace Conway and his life. I do wish the story had been told more chronologically, as I often got a little lost and wasn't sure what phase of his life Gilbert was describing. But overall, a good, well-written read that keeps me thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of biography","review":"This is the biography of a man who has spent his whole life in the woods, living off the land. The difference between him and the many others who live off the land? He has flourished. Plus, he does it partially to convince others to give up the trap of luxury and return to a simple nature-centric lifestyle. The author gives us a solid background then weaves interesting tales about the \\"last american man\\" and how hardworking and different he is compared to an average man. A well-written book that drags a little in the end reiterating the same dogma that keeping up with the joneses is futile. However Elizabeth Gilbert hadn't quite polished off her writing style as she does in Eat, Pray, Love. A worthy read for anyone disinterested in suburban sprawl along with Into The Wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are not self-glorifying tales","review":"This is in response to a reviewer from California (8-Jul-03).The author does not glorify or become an apologist for Mr. Conway - on the contrary she's the first one to point out all his human weaknesses - most of all, his desire to dominate everybody around him. This is a man torn between the idea of teaching (almost) everybody who asks for it and claiming exclusivity through pain and suffering.But the whole idea of getting \\"apprentices\\" to become his half-slaves for 2 years is not new to this world. It comes from both European guilds and Asian clans. Just watch any bad kung-fu movie! :-)What is so amazing about Eustace Conway is his obsession with self-sufficient lifestyle that he carries on while living inside the modern society. He does not want to be a recluse monk - and this is where his challenges become really interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"The story of Eustace Conway is fascinating from both a society and psychological perspective. Anyone who might be interested in gender studies or controlling types of behavior, or anyone interested in wilderness study would most likely find it a compelling read. I found myself riveted personally through the whole thing, from the very first power-punched sentence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eustace","review":"I have purchased approx. 10 copies of this book-- I find it entertaining, amusing and cannot decide if I liked this man at the end or not. As I live in North Carolina; not far from the subject- guests often think it would be fun to meet him and see how he as aged. Great gift book for -mostly the men in ones life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and Bad Writing","review":"I can't believe how many people gave this book five stars. The writer repeats Conway's self-glorifying tales without any attempt to establish their accuracy. She is not a writer, she is a publicist, for Conway's grandiose vision of himself. She doesn't see that he: 1)exploits naive young people to work like dogs improving HIS land, then complains that they don't have the 'guts' to stick around when they wake up and see what he is up to 2)exploits women to be the mirror of his conceit 3)blames his Dad for all his problems, which is the the acme of self pity 4) uses his own brother and the writer to further his ambition of land ownership and celebritythis is a badly written book about a sick man."},{"rating":"1","title":"just terrible","review":"This book is written as if it were for a women's magazine.The text is full of cuteness. The subjectis presented as a true wilderness dweller, but in reality he is nothing of the sort. Last American Man ? There are thousands of people who live far closer to nature than Conway in the hills of West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and even in NY's Adirondacks. This guy goes in and out all the time. He is far from authentic. There is almost nothing in the book that gives the reader a feel for lonely wilderness living. Gilbert has either been hookwinked or she's in love with Conway. The book is disjointed, poorly written and, worst of all, burdened with Gilbert, Gilbert, Gilbert, and her observations are trite. The book is a perfect example of why it is best to read a chapter before buying. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom city","review":"I do not recommend this book to anyone unless they really like nature. The book was very bland. The character Eustace wasn't that interesting. What I least liked about the book was the character Eustace and how he was portrayed. He was a mean guy that no one could get along with so most in most of the book it was just Eustace by himself and that was very dry. I didn't like the writer's voice because it seemed like she was writing this to make him look good because it was obvious by her writing that she was very attracted to him. The first couple of chapters were pretty good, and then it got really bad around chapter 3. I wouldn't have read it if it wasn't required."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a creep!","review":"I'm not sure how being able to \\"nail a chipmunk to a tree\\" qualifies anybody as \\"the last American man\\" or anything else other than pretty creepy. I think the author has watched \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" movie a few too many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating read.","review":"I just want to reiterate the reader review titled \\"So much potential, so poorly realized\\". This could have been a good book, but the author does get out of her own way.Frustrating and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biography of a man on a pedestal","review":"For our class we had to read this book. At first it looked interesting but the book went down hill quickly. You will often find the writer rambling about one thing or another and when she is not you usually hear about him arguing with someone or being abusive to someone; and after that Elizabeth Gilbert seems to defend his abusive behavior. This is not just my opinion; everyone in the class agreed that this man is as abusive as his father and how Elizabeth Gilbert seems to try to put him in a better light. It was highly speculated in our group that Elizabeth Gilbert overly idealized Eustace Conway or was in love with him which is not a professional stance to take when writing a biography of someone.The best thing of this book was when I found out my views of this man and the writer are the same views as everyone else in the class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes and No","review":"I would strongly recommend this book to others. It is a compelling tale of the trials and tribulations of the modern day \\"Frontier Man\\". I liked studying Eustace Conway's relationships with women. I found it ironic that he treats women in the same manner that his father treats him. The writer's approach was excellent because she actually knows Eustace Conway. Yet, she doesn't tell the story with any bias; we see Eustace at his worst through most of the story. I learned that it is almost impossible to totally live off of the land. Eustace Conway is pretty much a hypocrite, but in some ways I think he knows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last American Man","review":"I thought the book was very interesting. Being a outdoor enthusiast it locked me in from the being. Stories of the Appalachian trail were bizare and entertaining. I wish he would not have turned out to be such a perfectionist like his Dad. It seemed at times that he was more interested in making money than living in the wild. Maybe the book would have been better if it did not go into the boring details of buying land and his search for a dream girl. At the end I did feel the same on some of his points on getting back into the wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"Read within these pages the effects of extreme mental and emotional abuse upon a child and the way it plays out as an adult. Eustace is a broken human. His unfortunate treatment at the hands of his father seriously crippled him. People who have suffered like Eustace are often over-achieving, perfectionists; unable to maintain relations with others; either oblivious to the needs of others or slavishly catering to the whims of others and they almost always come to closley resemble the abuser.Big Eustace was a denizen of the office and the classroom- liked to write out long equations and ramble on to hear the sound of his own voice, so little Eustace subcociously chose a path 180 degrees away from father and becomes a creature of the forest but ended up rambling in his classroom just the same, just a different subject.To me this was an eminently sad tale of a boy going to any length for father's notice and approval. Neither of which came at least by the conclusion of this book.Eutace-walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book, great writer","review":"The good: Gilbert is a truly fantastic writer - her vocabulary, grammar, style and tone are truly wonderful and a joy to read. She has an exceptional ability to vary the tempo of her prose and her literary voice is unique and brilliant.The bad: As good a writer as she is, this is a poor book for one reason. Instead of a taking a character (in Eustace) and simply telling his story, Gilbert has taken her idealogy of what Eustace represents and built his character around that. In short, the writing is biased. I had never heard of Eustace Conway until I read the book but even I can tell that she is attempting to push some kind of agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I loved this fragrance at the store, but I would have to agree with one of my colleagues that it smells better on the blotter. Scent disappears almost as soon as you walk out the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Legend has STILL GOT IT!!!","review":"After releasing a Christmas Album in late 1971 that's become a traditional classic which most families still pull out this time of year, following that track record 30+ years later might seem like an unreasonable feat for some, but she's gone and done it! This CD is a much more mature sounding Lynn Anderson, but still a voice that leaves no doubt in the listener's mind -- this lady can still give the newer-younger artists of country music (any genre, actually) a run for their $$$. I love her rendition of 'Santa Baby' -- move over Eartha! This is a must have for any music lover, as this is definitely a classic CD in the making, by an already classic artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mottly space opera, but good hard SF","review":"On the plus side, this book is definitely hard SF with few fantasy elements. The technology is pretty well presented and basically plausible. Some of the technology seems to be based on the Kim Stanley Robinson series about Mars. The warstriders of the title are basically improved tanks that appear in many hard SF stories. However, though well described, they are not particularly central to the story.There are various minor negatives. Characterization is so-so, and it's hard to feel much involvement with any of the characters. Lots of the plot involves pretty peripheral stuff, and though it is well told, those parts could pretty much have been cut out without harming the main plotline of the story. The big negative is the ending, which is a real wimp out. Happy ending, but totally unlinked to the rest of the story, just an easy out.All in all, basically a book to painlessly kill a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was The 70s","review":"The time was the early 70s. The place was the United States. The people who bought this book were the counter culture, \\"lets all feel good\\" crowd.Those days are gone but this book lives on in resale shops. A good book for people just beginning to crawl out from under the self-hatred of doing drugs and other destructive behavior. Yeah, it was pop psychology but back then the ideas in this little easy-to-read book had hardly ever been mentioned before at least not by everyday people. The ideas still ring true today even though most people take this stuff for granted and we read the same things in a more sophisticated way. If you would like to see what prompted the politically correct ideas that are all over todays culture The TA Primer is one of the books you'll want to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great laugh","review":"Some of the worst 70's pop-psych to ever see the light of day. Shame on Harper & Row for ever considering it.BUT, if you want something to giggle at, this might be the book for you. I bet you can't read the whole thing with a straight face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and meaningful Jewish traveling","review":"This is an unusual kind of 'guide-book'. It provides a personal set of reflections on Jewish historical journeying. It makes use of a wide variety of sources and documents to explain the meaning of the journeys, culturally and religiously. It in a sense looks upon the whole process of Jewish history as a series of journeys. It is written in a clear and often moving way. It also includes a great deal of worldly background knowledge and is so richly informative about the places themselves. Reading it provides a kind of mind- traveling which may at times be difficult and painful as Jewish history has often been, but is too at times celebratory and joyous. It is always interesting.This book should be in the library of all those who take interest in the Jewish historical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"smashing","review":"great compilation by the warp brothers, i liked crystal lake alot, and 2 players it a great track aswell, (dont know why dimitry didnt like it).braintwinz is smashing!!anyway buy that cd its worth the price! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have two pictured, only one is included in this price!","review":"Yes it is a good handle, I was just upset when I orderd two, thinking I would get four handles and only recieved two.

I remember seeing this record all over the place in 1977 (when it was first released) and NEVER BOUGHT IT. But then Townes never played the Rio Grande Valley in deep south Texas where I grew up, nor did the radio stations play him. A real shame. 20 years later and you couldn't FIND A COPY!If you can find an original on Tomato Records (with the paper brown inner sleeves) GO FOR IT!Otherwise, this reissue will do just fine.4 sides of classic Townes, singing folk, blues, country and soul piercing poetry.And always with the jokes, several here, but that was Townes......Recorded in hot Houston, Texas during the summer of 1973, you can hear the bottles on the tables as the waitress picks them up....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Townes live in Houston","review":"A great cd for those of us who were not blessed to see and hear Townes Van Zandt live during his lifetime.

Not just Townes records but records ever. It captures Townes playing a small venue many years ago. His stories pull me in as if I were there. Not just in the old quarter but there in the song. Not many people do this anymore. Not many get up and play and take your breath away. Greatness is hard to come by."},{"rating":"2","title":"As honest as music will ever be.","review":"When you posess the talent that Townes Van Zandt obvioulsy does there is no need to add anything to it. This is about as bare as music gets. One microphone, one guitar and one great songwriter. This album offers music that is as pure and honest as anything commited to vinyl or tape or laser ever has been. Many of the Van Zandt standards are here and a few covers as well. This was recorded live in 1973 in a small club in Houston. All the atmosphere is there and the listener is drawn right into the middle of the evening. An excellant album from one of history's truly great songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Townes's best album -- a true work of genius.","review":"This album really stands our among TvZ's oeuvre. Too often his work is overproduced and therefore loses some of Townes's raw quality that very effectively conveys the essence of \\"American music\\" -- ie, blues, country, and rock and roll. He is also at the height of his artistic powers here, and his hard living life style had not yet taken its toll on his voice. His guitar playing is clearly heard on this album, and although his playing is not on the same level as a Clapton or Kottke, his arrangements are beautiful and are suffused with licks from the country blues that inspired his playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, distasteful, noise not music","review":"How can anyone listen to country music wung by a guy named \\"Van Zandt\\".

While the jacket cover suggested great humor and funny books, it was anything but. I kept waiting and waiting for the funny parts to come, but they never did. Obviously I missed the humor that other reviewers enjoyed. All I felt after reading book one was depressed.I hate to be a party pooper, and usually, I'm the first one to enjoy silly kids books, but I returned this series of books the next day. The first book wasn't silly, even in an over-the-top way. It just missed the mark for me.

The book left me with a stomachache for all the children that will have to endure being introduced to this book and being drawn in by the author's craft, and in response have to live with new inner turmoil."},{"rating":"1","title":"only ok","review":"So, I decided not to buy this for my classroom. The horrible and awful things that happen in the story are genuinely awful (sexual and physical abuse, for example) and are never resolved or portrayed as as bad as they are. If the reader were from a background where these things had never happened to them the book could be read from a position of privelege and ignorance and could be enjoyed more than if read by a survivor who might just sit there struck by the protagonists' inaction. So, it was kind of fun, but I had this constant feeling as I was reading it that these kids should have gone out and done something about what was happening to them.

It thrives on conflicts that are mandatory anyway in any fictional work, and pretends that this banality is what makes it unique. Finally, when things seem to have been resolved towards the end, the villain escapes. Did anybody say, \\"Scam\\"? It reads to me like the starting paragraph of the next book in the series. True enough, there have been at least ten books released.I would recommend you wait for the movie. This concept may be more successful in the cinematic form, and it would be a chance to see Jim Carrey monkey up again.

I found the books in the \\"unfortunate events\\" series to be, for the most part, like a day-old cookie or pre-opened soda. Looks promising, but ends up tasting stale and flat. There's just something missing that greats like Gorey and Dahl never lacked - let's call it warmth. What made Edward Gorey a classic author was not merely his use of the gothic or the grotesque, but the understated humor, the heart, with which he described his characters' pitfalls. One feels no such warmth within these books. Cynicism and sarcasm alone are fun, but they ultimately make for a thin read; the classics, the truly great books, have more substance than evidenced by this series so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"cookie101 booksbooks","review":"I think these books are fascinating and I think that kids will like to read like I do . this book is about 3 kids miserable life and living with relatives that die because an awful guy kills them well murders them . he just wants the fortunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very terrible--but in this case that is very good.","review":"I read this book in two days.

The characters may not be the most well-developed or unique that have ever been created, but I found the story just plain funny. One thing I must say I did not like about it was how the author kept defining words in their context in the story. That was unneccessary, and it got very annoying when words that most kids know were defined over and over again. If you have heard that this is as good as Harry Potter, well, it's not.

Sprinkled throughout the book are opportunities for children to not only witness an interesting story, but also opportunities to add new words to their vocabularies.

Unfortunately he has not zeroed in the humorous aspects to said books. The Lemony books feature children who are destined to have terrible things happen to them, with no chance of rising above their fate. It is obvious that HarperCollins has sunk a ton of money in promotion for Mr. Snicket, who apparently has no respect for his fans. Too bad. My three children hated his didactic drivel. Come one, Harpers, wise up!! Get an author who has respect for his fans. When an author shows up saying he is not the author at all but a friend, and signs his books, \\"To a future orphan,\\" we know the author is trying desperately to be a *star*, but not necessarily a lover of his children-fans!! If only Mr. Snicket would understand that parents are shelling out money based on their kids's suggestions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbing down children again.","review":"Harry Potter this is not. There is nothing but a sad attempt to be original or dark in the plot. Defining the mediocre vocabulary is condescending to the reader, especially since most children over 8 years old would be familiar with the words. Even if they weren't, I think it would be a more effective learning tool if they were taught such critical reading skills as learning the meaning of the words from the context of the sentence. I really think the author spent more time thinking up marketing ploys for his books than actually spending quality time in the writing of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Horrible","review":"I'm an adult who really enjoyed the Harry Potter Series, and Dahl's numerous books as well. I bought this book thinking it would be a book of the same quality as these. It's not, and I can't believe people actually compare this trash to these great books. This book is about blatant child abuse and have several not so veiled references to sexual abuse. Kids these days are exposed to enough trash in pop culture don't give them more to read. The only reason people like these books is because of the artificial hype surrounding them and the upcoming movie. In my opinion don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Book for Today's Children","review":"My ... son received this book as a gift for Christmas. We read the book together in about a week.

Specifically, it tells them that their parents and other adults are entitled to do \\"whatever they want\\" to kids, including life-threatening physical abuse and sexual abuse, and that no one can or will intervene. Even a judge is shown as powerless to intervene and help the kids. If a child is being abused, especially sexually abused, it is very difficult for the child to confide that to an adult and get help. Why in the world, then, would a children's book author give kids the message that if they do confide in an adult, they will not be helped -- and will, in fact, be told that the abusing adult has the right to do so? For the first time in my life, I am thinking about physically destroying a book, so that my copy at least will not be read by any children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even waste your time...","review":"This book is horrible, but it's title says it all. This book makes you very scared, not in a fun way. I hate the whole \\"forbidden\\" thing. If Leminy Stikrit, or what ever the authors name is does not want readers to read his book, why publish this series? It's one horrible thing after another, why read a book like this at these times? I had bad dreams about it, my theory is to stay happy and don't let any thing get in the way of it. This book does that. Plus it has a horrible ending, I mean at least pull it all together at the end of the book so readers finish happy. Where does this even take place? The author describes it as a dirty city, but what city? Is Lippicy Snubbit making fun of where I live? Anyway, I suggest you don't crash yourself by reading this.

I think the category of the book is a mystery/ adventure. The book is about 3 kids, there parents die and they have to live with someone in there family that they have never met before . One of the strengths of this book is that the author has lot of momentum in the story. One of the weakens of the book is that the author has a lot of hard words to pronounce.

Violet had a knack for inventing. Klaus was the intelligent one. And Sunny liked to bite. They get caught in an awful disaster. They have to stay with an evil relative and work and help him. In the story they learn how to cook, clean, drive, and live in horrible conditions. They learn that they can never be to prepared.To me this story was very well written.

The books look gorgeous, the illustrations are lovely, the children have the potential to be interesting -- but I can't bring myself to care that much about the main characters. The character of the baby, Sunny, is especially unconvincing. The writing style teeters between funny and pretentious, but mostly ends up on the pretentious side. I found the explanations of word meanings annoying and patronising, although I'm an adult so maybe my opinion shouldn't count. Perhaps a child would find the definitions useful, but most unfamiliar words can be worked out from the context, and those that can't can be looked up in a dictionary.

His gimmacks and tricks quickly became tiresome as I found myself bothered by his silly interuptions with definitions and all the insights he imparts. It's obvious his gimmacks were a smoke-screen to cover up the fact that he had little story.I did find the orphans sympathetic, but the other characters were one-dimensional at best. I suppose that the children collectively were the protagonist, but I never really felt connected to any of them.What disturbed me the most were some of the implications of a child bride and an infant being in danger.

Although I would not recommend this book for kids under the age of five, because the book is kind of gory, I do think that the book would be good for kids with adventure on their brains.

It, unlike Lemony Snicket's, has three dimensional characters and a reason to cry at the end.\\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" is everything good writing is not.

Then they go to a terrible man's house who makes them do horrible things. Count Olaf doesn't treat them nicely. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so mean.In the middle the teribble, Count Olaf wants the orphans fortune. So he tries to put on a play that involves marrying one of the orphans. Then he would get the fortune. Read to find out who keeps the fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok book","review":"When I saw the movie I thought it would have been a good series of books. But after I read the book I thought it was a horrible book.The beginning of the book was really boring, so I skipped on to the 2nd chapter and it became some what interesting. There was some action and fantasy at that point of the book.The most interesting part was when Sonny, Violet and Claude got left on the train tracks by Count Olaf. They had to make a slingshot out of some odd objects. They used a toy, a spring from the car seat, and a string from Sonny's shoe. The they shoot it at the levee so that the train would switch tracks and it would not hit them.They were able to call the officer, get away from the crazy Count Olaf and go live with their grandma.The ending was ok. They could of done a little better job if they would have keep the action going strong to convince people to read the series.If I was to rate it from 1 to 10, I would have to give it 4.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"if you don't like this, give the others a chance","review":"I have read all the books and although they are children's book, (I started reading them b/c of my younger sister,)they are funny and I like Snicket's voice. They are an easy read but I would have to say it truley is a \\"bad beginning,\\" the others later in the series are much better. I did not like Olaf's relationship with Violet in this one either. See the movie, the costumes are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only good book in the Series","review":"This book is the beginning of what has become a very successful series of books for children and young adults. I have read several of the books in the series and this is as good as it gets. The story starts out with the three siblings being orphaned after their parents are killed in an ugly house fire. The story continues with the siblings finding a new home and evading a villainous man who is after their fortune left to them by their late parents.The book is interesting and the fast moving plot leaves you on the edge of your seat. I would suggest that you read this book, but then not read any of the other books in the series since the quality of the books content greatly declines after the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Series","review":"The Baudelaire kids are suddenly orphaned when their parents are killed in a fire. The kids must be sent to live with a relative and the vile Count Olaf seems to be the most handy one. But the Count hardly has the kids' best interests in mind and he cooks up a terrible scheme to get his hands on the kids' inheritance.This is a pretty enjoyable book. With every horrible event that happened to the kids I found myself wondering how far the author would go. The kids themselves had cute little personalities and it was great to see them find ingenious ways to overcome their problems. I plan on reading the rest of the series if I can get them from the library. Ten bucks is a bit expensive for a book I can read in about an hour. Parents may want to consider buying them because kids will most likely want to read them many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the illustrations, but not the story","review":"This book was compared to the Harry Potter books in a famous entertainment magazine and I decided to purchase it since I loved the Harry Potter books. I am not sure if the targetted age group for this book is the same as H.P., but it feels much more juvenile. The author keeps interrupting the story to define words, which is highly annoying. Also the characters are not very well developed and everything is very predictable. It does not live up to the hype. Check it out in a library before you spend your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paramount (here meaning \\"superior\\") story...","review":"Don't be misled by reviewers who insist on either comparing this series to Harry Potter or dismissing it as \\"too scary\\" or politically incorrect for children. Adult readers who find the author's periodic definitions of big words annoying or insulting are forgetting that they're not the target audience. The premise here--that bad things keep happening to good children--is dealt with fairly tongue-in-cheek, and though it would seem that there's no one in the world to save the Baudelaire children from their presumed fate, it's they themselves who will come to their own rescue (and they do)! Funny, witty, and charmingly different from much of what's being published for kids now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Series of Unfortunate Events","review":"I absolutely adore these books.. After I start reading them, I don't want to stop! Once I am done with the book, I am on a search for the next one!I recommend these books to any reader that loves the suspense! *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Perfect","review":"In this dreadful story, the Baudelaire's are sent to live with the Squalors at the penthouse on 667 Dark Avenue. While living there, they come across some dreadful things like a dark shaft, a red herring, three mysterious initials, aqueous martinis, pinstripe suits, and some parsley soda. Also in this book, the Baudelaires search for their kid-knapped friends, the Quagmires. This is one of the best book out of the first eleven. My personal favorite book is the one I will review next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most surprising of all \\"Series\\" books","review":"I do believe this is one of the best \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" books. When I read it I found it very interesting how another guardian is forming a plot to steal the Baudelaire fortune. The bad thing about it is this guardian is working with the Count Olaf, the first guardian that wants to steal the fortune. When you read this in the book, you are not expecting this to happen. And when it finally does happen, it clearly catches you by surprise. This is one of the best aspects of this book, and if you like surprises, you will enjoy this book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ersatz Elevator","review":"I would recommend the book: The Ersatz Elevator. It is a great book. This book was puzzling when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny were trying to find out what V.F.D. stood for. It was mysterious when the Baudelaire orphans went inside the elevator and found the Quagmire Triplets. It was mysterious because why would Count Olaf have them there and not already shipped them off to another island to take their fortune? I also liked that Lemony Snicket used big words, and then gives the definitions to tell what they are. It was good that the Baudelaires took action by themselves, instead of asking or having help from an adult. Last, I liked that this book is a series and you just have to keep reading all of them to find out what happens to the children in the next book. This was a really good book. and I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series but...","review":"I was on a cultural exchange trip to China with a bunch of teenagers and twenty somethings. I bought three of these books in case \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" couldn't hold my attention on the long plane rides. (Which it could, thankfully)But something magical happened with the SUE books. Every night before bedtime, I had a handful of young adults gather around as I read aloud 2 chapters a night. How unfortunate that I ran out of books before I ran out of trip. It became such an important winding down time for us, I promised my biggest fans that I'd make an audio tape of the next book for them and send it to them when I got home for those tough to sleep nights.I think Snicket keeps the characters somewhat flat so that you don't feel as devastated about their great losses. And yet, I really wouldn't read these to children because they'd be too dark. But in our situation it was wonderful.Next trip, I'm taking SUE along for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude, Disguisting and poorly written!","review":"As a reader of this book and not a parent, I would like to warn all prospective readers of this book. Several friends reccomened it to me, and I had nightmeres for nights after I finished it. The story follows three orphans who don't get anything good in life, no hapiness, nothing, which is rather unbelivable. All the adults are either horribly mean or too dumb to help the kids.I might have at least giving it 2 stars if it wasn't so poorly written. It tells you what a word means far too often, which gets annoying and distracting. There is no humor or real tear jerking moments, just horror.Overall, the book is a horror. Don't waste your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Stupid","review":"My aunt asked me to read this book and tell her what it was like. She's a teacher, so she was planning on giving this book to her kids. Big mistake. This book was bland. I would say meaner things about it, but I might be kicked off this website. Not only was the plot a clich��, it was a pointless book altogether. A bunch of orphans who have bad things happen to them, is not nearly a plot. it is the basis for a plot... but where is the rest of it? It is a definite waste of time. I urge all of you readers not to read this. Please. Spare the world of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I really don't understand why people say this is a depressing book. The only thing depressing is that I wasted a couple hours reading it. The characters are shallow and the author is insulting by defining small words. Plotline? What plotline? And how am I supposed to care enough about these 1-dimensional characters to actually feel bad for them? Blah. And please don't insult J. K. Rowling by even mentioning Harry Potter in the same paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I would not recommend giving this book to a child. The message it sends is one of hopelessness. Its plot centers around the abuse and blackmail of newly-orphaned children, and it smacks of pedophilia. (The villian blackmails a fourteen year-old girl into marrying him by dangling her baby sister from a tower, then speaks of his bride going home with him for their \\"wedding night\\".)Don't waste your money. There are many wonderfully written children's books out there that are in much better taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible, never seen a truer title","review":"The book is terrible. It is boring and predictable, and seems like something someone with no writing skills would write for a middle school project. I read it in thirty minutes, and was thoroughly disappointed. I cannot believe that anyone would ever compare these books to the Harry Potter series. Defining words in every other sentence is annoying and does not help a young readers context reading skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First of a Saga of Hilarious Events","review":"Though the mood of the books is dark and dreary, Snicket's witty, clever style brings light upon the subject. While the sett and cast of characters seem unreal at times, it just adds to the laugh-out-loud air of the book and it successors in the series. In this tale, orphans Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to live with their cruel uncle who is after their fortune and attempts to get it by marring the preteen Violet. Snicket will keep you laughing until you get your hands on the next book in the series...an excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but Sad","review":"this book was relly well writen and soo funny, although when you think about it you shouldent be laughing. i recommend theas books for children and adults alike!!!!! The only reason I gave the book 4 *stars was becaus I've read the whole series so far and after a while the storie is a little predictibul."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Beginning","review":"It was dark, haunting, mysterious and witty. Lemony Snicket has a talent. It had all the element of a great book and it was a book that was easy to read in one sitting.There some aspects of the book that were a bit disturbing, but I held on to every word until I was finished.The characters were very different and all unique. Count Olaf truly did have a streak of evil in him, The Baudelaire were ingenious.The plot wasn't lacking at all. It was extremely thorough and interesting. There wasn't just one conflict, but many. This book definitely kept your mind busy, easily distracting you from the core problem at hand.This is an incredible beginning and you will not want to miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"For all you other reviewers raving about how great this book is, did we read the same book? I am 14 and my sister is 8 and we both tried to get through this book. I did after forcing myself to since I had bought it. I didn't really like it at all. The story is passable, but the ending is stupid. I don't want to say too much about it for fear of giving it away in case you actually want to read this book, but its a pretty bad ending. Its the kind of ending somebody would write when they are totally out of ideas. I do not recommend this book, but other people obviously liked it. So instead of buying it, I suggest finding it at a library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Beginning just got Better","review":"The Bad BeginningI liked this book it might have been sad and unpleasant sometimes, but there was a lot of action with the Baubelair children like tring to trick people, and to use inventions the way they did ( Violet, Sunny, and Klaus).I think every one would like this book if they got interested in it. Boys and girls would like it. People that like action and evilvillans would like really it.The characters Voilet, Klaus, and Sunny all have things they are good at. Voilet the oldest likes to invent things uesing just about anything. Klaus who is the 2nd oldest likes to read about sertain things. Sunny who is the youngest likes to bit hard things.What happens is the Baudelaires parents die and the childeren have to live with Count Olaf.I would rate this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The entertaining tale of three very unlucky children","review":"Violet, Sunny, and Klause are three very unlucky children. They are clever, have \\"pleasent facial features,\\" and are all very talented in there own thing (inventing, reading, chewing) but there life is struck by disaster when there parents die. Sent to live with the evil Cout Olaf, they find that all he really wants out of them is the forture Violet has inherited for when she comes of age. He cooks up a devious plan and will do anything to get it out of them, anything.I think that this was a very clevery written book. Though it is impossible to figure out what time period it is of what country it takes place I found it to be very entertaining. It's not the happiest book in the world (filled with dark humor) but it's something I would reccomend to all fans (past and present) of Roald Dahl. I hope you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest depressing read I've ever had","review":"These beautifully bound and illustrated books are marvelous fun! The Baudelaire children are the saddest, smartest characters I've seen in a while. True, the bad guys are stock-in-trade but who cares? This book and the one after it are enormous fun. Followers of Roald Dahl in particular should gobble them up! Hooray for children's fiction that is intelligently written, witty, funny and not saccharine sweet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a librarian and can't recommend this to anyone.","review":"I wanted to like this book, since I am a fan of Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling, and other authors in that vein, however this book is VERY poorly written. Besides the forced humor and self-conscious attempt to be clever, the plot is cumbersome and trite, the characters generally unappealing, and the premise (while an interesting one)is not well developed. Also, the idea of a 14 year old girl marrying a much older man who is her legal guardian and her relation is disturbing PLUS the author felt the need to describe her thoughts of sleeping with this man after their married! Tacky, at best. If you e-mail any comments to the address on the dustjacket of this book, you will receive an auto-reply which does not address specific questions. Save your money and buy a Dahl or Rowling or another worthy author other than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Beginning....Good Book","review":"I read Lemony Snickett's \\"The Bad Beginning\\" for a school book report. There were so many \\"unfortunate events\\" in the book that it was sometimes hard to tell what the main problem was, but the resourceful Baudelaire orphans always managed to overcome whatever troubles they encountered.This book was an easy and interesting read, but it might be a bit too scary for younger readers. I am looking forward to reading the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunate","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read even though I havn't read that many books.A reason is beause I personally like storys with murders in them.Pretty voilent huh.This one was interesting because the main charecters where always in the worst situation possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series of unfortunate events #1","review":"I found this book really exciting and I really enjoyed it.

I am currently 15 years old, and I've been reading these since I was 10. I am a girl. It is honestly overall a great read.

Can't wait to read Grim Gotto!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Well, here's another installment from the \\"doesn't matter what's in it, as long as it gets kids to read!\\" club. The abuse in the book and suggestive nature of Count Olaf's plan for Violet are very disturbing. And it's another \\"adults are either nasty or bumbling and confused, while kids are sharp as tacks\\" theme, which is getting so common in kids' books and television (especially Disney). Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and Inappropriate","review":"I find it inconceivable that people will slam Harry Potter for its lack of Christian values, but recommend the Lemony Snickett series. That anyone could enjoy a book whose sole plot is a sick old man trying to marry his 14-year-old niece to get her fortune is disturbing to me. The strange warning to the hook man that Violet is \\"his\\" and a reference to the \\"wedding night\\" are beyond disgusting. The poor writing, demeaning definitions and lack of any real literary value add up to a cheap piece of trash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Dubya, \\"Lemony Snicket\\" Happens","review":"\\"Lemony Snicket\\" (surely a pseudonym) has written a book that I would not want my children to read. Not because of (...) or violence, but because it is a lousy book, poorly written with a poorly contrived plot that is an insult to the reader. The author further insults the reader by talking down to him or her, with frequent interruptions to explain the meaning of words used. Perhaps the intended audience consists of children with no access to a dictionary; but if so, why not be consistent and define ALL polysyllabic words used?I was looking for a book to give it to my nephew for Christmas, and he has already read all five of the delightfulHarry Potter Box set Books 1-7(5 stars each), but I wouldn't offer this junk to any intelligent child.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing!!!!","review":"I'm surprised that this is a children's book. I mean it's filled with scenes of extreme child neglect, and manipulation. The issues in this book are very serious, death, grief, child abuse, etc. I would read this before, allowing my child to read it. Reading this is more like a sick punishment than for pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and twisted. No youth (or adult) should read it.","review":"Things like a guardian trying to force a 14 year old girl to marry and tying up an infant and hanging her in a cage 30 feet in the air are REVOLTING. Why would anyone think this is appropriate reading material for teens or children?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Bad","review":"Most reviews start with a brief summary of the story, and I, for the most part, follow suite. But alas, for this book I cannot give a brief synopsis, for the story it's self, also seemed incapable of doing so. During the three chapters I've read of this book, I saw no indication of a possible story, just a mediocre attempt at trying to be macabre.The Characters are flat. No emotion, no nothing. I didn't care what \\"unfortunate events\\" came there way.Most likely the worst of all, Mister. Snicket feels the need to stop the book every three sentences to define a word. He defines Rickety. Now I know todays children are somewhat stupid, but come one! Rickety? About 47% of this book is stopping to define words, taking atleast a paragraph to do so.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever!","review":"Ugg! This was the most awful book I've ever read in my entire life! NOT!!!!!!!!!! This book is a very very great book. None of the endings are happy ones.

I won't even let my little sister read that book until I cross out those nasty words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand why...","review":"It amazes me, and I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY anyone could describe this book as a\\" delightful, funny, linguistically playful book\\". I am always on the lookout for books for my 7 year old grandson who is a gifted reader. Had I handed him this book without reading it first, I would have been horrified to find out the story line. It was an over-all depressing book. Even I had nightmares! Perhaps it would make a good reading / writing assignment at the high school level, but even then, I would hesitate to actually recommend it. If I could say something nice about this book, I would. However, I can't. It's back to Harry Potter, The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, and Dealing With Dragons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a bad book!","review":"This is proboably the worst book I've ever read. It seems that most of it was written by an eight year old, or even younger then that. Sometimes it seems like it's some sort of kids TV show. The writing is highly unprofessional, especially when the author keeps saying things simular to, \\" The rest of this story is so very sad. Do not read past this page.\\" Also, the clulessness of the kids' older friend (forgot his name) drives you crazy!And as for the ending, wow. It's like an ending to any old cartoon, tricky, but not any good. This whole book can be made into a 30 minute cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK","review":"This is a really good read. Contrary to what most people say, I don't think the humor is too dark at all. It might not be good for children under the age of eight or nine, but you can tell by the way it is written that it is definitely aimed at ten or eleven year olds. If you people think that kids don't already read about children getting orphaned and terrible things like that, then you're in for a big suprise. Anywayz, its really, really funny. Most writers concentrate on developing the characters and the plot, but \\"Mr. Snicket\\" has a very interesting voice and technique of writing, so you often find yourself laughing at some very serious parts of the story. Okay, I'm done. Don't hate me because I speak my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"a serise of unfortnate events","review":"This book is very suspensful.

I decided to read it first though and am so glad I did! Now, there is no way known I will give it to her. This is an INCREDIBLY sinister and disturbing book. It may be very well-written but it is about child abuse and the threat [harm]. The supposedly \\"good\\" grown-ups are stupid and/or powerless, and the bad grown-ups are truly nasty without being even the slightest bit amusing. The children survive the horrible events by using their wits. While this sounds like it might be a good thing, the situations are entirely possible and real children would have wound up [harmed], dead or both.

Anyway I love this author's type of writing, the book has a great plot not one book in the series is boring either!!! It has plenty of plot twists, mysteries, and some intense suspensful parts. It has kind of a twisted humor to it but that is what makes it so great. Stop reading this and go buy this book it is so cool!!!!!Other recommendations:Harry Potter, Dealing with dragons,the giver.

The style, the pacing, the cliff-hanger chapter endings...all contribute to the fun we're having. When the action gets intense, I shut the book and ask questions. What should Violet do next? What would you do? We even talk about the law, and how people should have a will drawn up. We talk about how brave the children are. But we also talk about how today they could call 911, and how they should not feel helpless.

It is a great read, and I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I loved the Harry Potter books, and I thought this would be similar. In some ways it is. It's imaginative and clever, but too dark -- almost morbid.If you're looking for something good for kids, try Terry Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"How aptly titled","review":"A bad beginning to a dreary series. Can't believe that anyone would like the way these are written. The story could actually be better without all the sidelines giving definitions to the reader. But then I suppose the author was working under a deadline and word count. No, this is not Harry Potter and should not even be considered in the same class. Drivel, in this I mean it is badly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most horrible books!!","review":"I checked this book out of the library because I'd read a lot of good reviews on it but still didn't want to spend nine bucks to buy it. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made! Though the Baudelaire children do not display any charisma (they are slow and dim-witted), Snicket nevertheless pulls readers in by making us care for them because they are poor orphans. This is a clever ploy by Snicket, because I wanted to finish the book to see if the Baudelaires ever do become happy. But true to form, they do not. Even more slow and dim-witted than the Baudelaire children are the adults around them, who realize too late that the menacing Count Olaf is evil. This book is frustrating to read because all of the characters are so bumbling and stupid. Unless you like to read books about children who are in an endless circle of misery and are too dumb to get themselves out of it for longer than five minutes, do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

I like this book and I reccomend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book, The Bad Beginning, A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket was a great book. I rated it five stars. It's about three miserable orphans whose parents perish in a fire. All of their belongings burn to ashes.

He tries to pull stunts on the children and almost gets away with them. Which at the end of the story he gets cought when he does something. But Violet and Klaus figure it out and his plan is ruined.I believe the children were to smart for Olaf and in which they always got out of doing things because they always found reasons or just didn't really care waht he said.

Don't get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing, poor plot, poor characters - don't bother!","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Not only is the plot dull and uninspired, but the writing is horrible. One of the most annoying aspects is the authors irritating way of taking time out of the story to define words! An example would be \\"in a rickety cart - rickety here meaning...\\" I prefer when writers allow me to decide which words I know or don't know and decide when to use a dictionary.I like the idea of a \\"gothic\\" children's series with dark and dangerous mysteries, but this is certainly not it. Save your money. This book is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable little book","review":"The author oh so cleverly warns you this a dark, dreary book where bad things happen. Believe that. It's not cute and it's not clever. It's a depressing book. The whole selling point of this book is that it's short and fun. It's short, yet too long, because it is not fun.

The whole time I was reading it I looked for the book to start getting better and it never did. Sure the age level is 9-12 and I am 15, but I have read reviews that said older children and adults would love it too. Lies. Maybe if you were my age and had a reading level of a 10 year old. Then it may have been ok. The overall idea of the story was good I thought, no happy endings. But the way the author wrote the book. I just really disliked the way the it was written and it was a waste of the 1/2 hour it took for me to read it all. I will not be reading any more of these books. And about some people comparing \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" to Harry Potter! Please. Don't waste your time on this book if you are older than 12. Read Harry Potter of LOTR. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book for your child!!!","review":"I am a teacher. I loved allof the Harry Potter books and was told that this was a similar series. Wrong. This book is awful. It is about three orphans who are physically & psychologically abused by their caretaker. It also dumbs-down the vocabulary, by explaining what each word means in the text of the story (as if you are reading a dictionary.)

My children read these books when they were younger and I wanted to read them so I would have the same frame of reference and I enjoyed this first book so much that I can't wait to read the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quick Read","review":"Good Quick Read for the early reader with a very sneaky emphasis on vocabulary building. The entire series seems to capture children's attention with mildly dark undertones and rye humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morbidly Funny --- Just the Thing for an 8-10 year old","review":"As soon as I finished this book, I immediately ordered the next 4 in the series. I have read many children's books in which a horrible mess or bad event takes place and through an impossible, over-the-top, unbelievable, sugar-sweet course of events (Holes by Louis Sachar, for example), everything turns out hunky-dorey, right-as-rain, golly-gee-great in the end. The Bad Beginning turns that sap around 100% and offers an hysterical Series of Unfortunate Events, in which Murphy's Law prevails at every turn. The characters are delightful, the story-telling is fantastic, and the tone, especially the running vocabulary lessons, is light-hearted and personal. Now I have to stop writing this review so I can go start the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ersatz Elevator","review":"The Ersatz Elevaator is a great book in all. It shows how hard orphans' life can be and Esme is what the heck kind of a person. I learned that life can be hard while searching for Count Olaf.

Rip out the pages and toss it in the recycling bin. Yes, you'll be out some money, but there will be one less copy of this book (here meaning random words thrown together without meaning, character, plot, theme, or purpose printed onto paper, bound together, and sold at an enormous effort to profit ratio) polluting the planet. I don't think I've ever read a book more clearly meant solely to line the author's and publisher's pocket. No redeeming value whatsoever. Horribly written, dull, depressing, and not even interesting enough to be called one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the author's advice on the back of the book.","review":"I can't imagine what other reviewers found in this book to grant it more than a single star. They must have severely low expectations for their children's literature. The only thing going for this book is the running gag from the author about how terrible the books are and how depressed he is at having to write them. Some might argue that this book is morbidly funny, even slightly camp - and that they enjoy being in on the author's inside joke. However, I found the characters unrelentingly stupid or cruel, and the story unimaginative. Even the children, the alleged heroes of the story, are dunderheads. And the \\"joke\\" of the author's morbidity wears thin all too quickly.Do yourself a favor and follow the author's advice (humorous as it is) and truly avoid this book. There are many imaginative, well written books for children that handle dark themes well, and are a joy to read. This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, creepy, not for young kids/teens!","review":"This book is horrible and creepy - from the children losing their parents in a fire, to being shipped off to their spooky uncle, Count Olaf. The Count threatens and mistreats the kids, and then plots to marry the eldest daughter Violet (who is like 12) in order to take over the family fortune. I would not want a young person/teenager to read this book. It was billed as Harry-Potter-like, but it totally lacked the sweetness and humor of Harry. I was creeped out and disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?!","review":"When I read this book, along with my two boys, we kept reading in hopes of finding something to catch our attention. This book was boring and morbidly sad. It is truly a bad story in every sense of the word. The author was indeed correct in the Introduction. I won't be reading any more of the series, it's not good reading. Perhaps there should be a warning attached to alert parents of the depressing qualities of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat funny, but mostly a disappointment","review":"I bought this book because the jacket sounded hilarious. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Written for a younger audience, even youngsters with a good vocabulary would probably find this book dull and condescending, with its vocabulary lessons every page or two (if you haven't read the book, trust me, every other page there is a word that is given, along with is definition...this gets really old after the second chapter).While I thought that the unfortunate events that kept happening throughout the book were funny, the book couldn't hold my interest. I kept waiting for something more to happen. Also, the whole notion of one's legal guardian trying to marry them really turned me off. I thought that was quite repulsive.For Dahl fans who liked the book Matilda, maybe this one will be sufficient. However, I cannot give this book more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book About Bad Things","review":"The Bad Beginning is a scary book. A lot of bad things happen. Count Olaf does a lot of terrible things.You should read this book if you like to see people rescue others. I liked the Baudelaire children because they had good ideas and they never gave up.

I would suggest you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone before you read it so you can see as I have, that this is a total copy of it. Harry Potter is much more original.

New York Times Bestseller List published it as age 10 and up. I wasn't going to purchase it for our library and then Booklist reviewed it and also had the age limit as age 10 and up. I purchased it and got a complaint right off quick. I read the book and find it to be very dark humor. In this day of violence and terrorisim, I find this book to be horrendous. The villain is out to kill three children. The mention of him marrying a 14 yr. old child to get her fortune is very suggestive and there is no mention of the care of the infant child, only torture. I had purchased three books before I realized the content. Needless to say they have been moved to our young adult section which is for ages 13 and up. I just feel it is not appropriate for the age level it is being suggested for. I hate to think I have to read every book before I put it on the shelf. That is what I am relying on my reviewers for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care what they say, THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK!!!","review":"This book creeped me out, and not the good kind of creeped out. It was disturbing. The book was nothing but kids being abused in horrible ways. There were more than blatant sexual overtones to the story, and it's being marketed to the 9-12 age group. Count Olef, the children's creepy old adopted father, tries to force the 14 year old girl, Violet, to marry him, and threatens to kill her baby sister if she doesn't. There is a reference made to the \\"wedding night.\\" The whole thing was just sick. I'm 17, and I don't know if i'm gonna be able to get to sleep tonight, after reading this story.

Perhaps you can find a way to make lemonade with them.I'm on a new low-acid diet myself.

However, I was glad in the end I had only purchased the first one because it scared me a great deal. Maybe it is the new-mom syndrome, but part of the story that dealt with a perilous situation for the baby horrified and terrified me. Plus, there seemed to be some underlying sexual undertones between some of the adults and children. As an educator, I did like how the author explained more complex vocabulary terms, but it did get a little old to an adult reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie!","review":"AMAZING!!!!!!

The idea is ok and starts off kinda cute, but it lacks any real substance. I kept waiting for some great twist or turn and nothing happened. Then I thought, well maybe there will be some huge climax, and again I was wrong. The part where he explains what certain words mean seems like we are idiots. If he wants kids to understand it, then use different words. I also didn't like talk of marriage to his niece. Thats not something I would want my son to read. I'm not sure if I'll read book 2 or not. Hopefully the movie is better. Jim Carey is such a goofball, he can make anything good. This author however, I'm not to sure about.

That is why I average this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is as sad as getting clothes for Christmas","review":"It is considered rude to laugh at other people's misfortunes, but I am afraid that is exactly what you're going to do when you meet the Baudelaire orphans Violet (who loves mechanics and inventing), Klaus (who loves to read), and Sunny (who loves biting things.) Right from the start, they have all kinds of bad luck, from losing their house in a fire, which would seem terrible to an adult, to getting ugly, itchy clothing, which would seem terrible to a kid. However, there is is also darkly funny humor stirred in, so it's like honey mixed with arsenic, which is a poisonous substance used to kill people. If you don't at least break out into a smile while reading this book, I swear you have no sense of humor whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"beat out Harry Potter by a trip to the moon and back.","review":"-It starts with Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. They are all very creative. I have no idea how everything got so terrible for them.

The author has an enjoyable style of using words and then defining them. I found the interjected definitions witty and humorous. The style, or should I say situation, of the poor Baudelaire children is very much like that of Dahl's subjects. They are orphaned and thrust into terrible circumstances. You hope throughout the book that Violet, Klaus, and infant Sunny will have a happy ending. As we all know from the book's description, this is not to be for the Baudelaire orphans. I can only wonder what desperately unfortunate circumstances arise for these poor children later in the series. These are truly enjoyable quick reads that are full of wit, humor, and angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark for children, but not written for adults.","review":"As a fan of the likes of Invader Zim and Edward Gorey, I thought I should give this series a try. However, the books are written at such a low reading level that I could not recommend them to anyone out of middle school. The author has an annoying habit of explaining every little term that I'm already familiar with (I hate it when authors question my intelligence). I finished reading the book because it was quite short, and I was somewhat amused at the outrageous schemes of Count Olaf and his crew. However, in reality, if the kids would have just called the police, the authorities would have gone beserk and intervened in America anyway. The book lacks any subtlety or complexity. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"When I first heard of this series, I was mildly intrigued. Then I heard the series being likened to Roald Dahl's books, and, having worn my childhood copy of *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* to bits, I had to check them out. Mr. Snicket is no Roald Dahl. Sure, both writers understand that a lot of kids like to read about pretty gruesome stuff. But, where Dahl's stories are inventive and charming, *The Bad Beginning* is pretty simplistic and derivative. Things seemed to resolve themselves a bit too quickly. It's not a bad book, just not worthy of its hype. If I happened to find the next book in the series lying in the street, I'd probably read it, but otherwise, probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and repetitive...","review":"My brother bought me the whole series to fill in my void of Harry Potter. I have to say say that I am horribly dissatisfied with the WHOLE series. The storyline is the SAME in every single book...the kids go somewhere new, Olaf finds them, the they escape Olaf again...although that isn't what makes the book horrible. I have read up to book 11, and I have been dissatisfied after every book. There is nothing, no information to leave you satisfied. If you want to know answers to the plot...then you won't find out, not even at the end of book 11...and book 13 is supposed to be the last of the series.

A child might like this book ... quite frankly I don't know. This book received some attention when it was written as a book that was encouraging children to read, along with the more clever and entertaining Harry Potter series. Unfortunately this book, unlike Harry Potter, was written exclusively for young readers and has very little to offer to anyone older than 12. The plot is implausible (and rather disturbing with the pedophilic overtones) and the author's didactic (and pedantic) writing style is distracting and, quite frankly, annoying. You will be disappointed in this title if you have any expectations that it might rival Harry Potter. If you are a child who doesn't know any better and need to choose between reading and watching television, this might be a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Lemony Snicket book","review":"I like The Bad Beginning (A Series of Unfortunate Events #1) by Lemony Snicket.

Then Sunny, Violet and Klaus finds the Quagmires in an elevator shaft in the penthouse. Then by the time they had the things to get them out they were gone.

I've read a LOT of children's books and this is far, far down on my list. The main problems with this book (and the whole series) is that the plot is dull, it's poorly written, there's no character development, you can't connect with any of the characters, it's depressing, and it's a teacher's worst nightmare if you value SHOW not TELL since the entire book reads like a plot summary. The appeal for these books is that they introduce vocabulary words, however what a waste of paper to do so in such an unimaginative way. There are so many books in this series, and it's probably because they only take about an hour each to churn out. The ONLY good thing about this book was that it was returnable.

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Bad Beginning","review":"This book was purchased as a gift for my 8 and 10 year olds who loved the Harry Potter series. After reading the cover, I decided to read the book before they did. I found the book to be very dark and brooding. It was billed to be for those who enjoyed \\"Harry Potter\\"... I did not find that it had any of the positive adult-child relationships found in the Potter books. \\"A Bad Beginning\\" is quite a depressing read.

Rowling and Enid Blyton. They constantly use words which are dificult for kids to understand, and then feel that they need to explain it. (not very well.) The plot and characters aren't bad, but the author is patronising to younger childeren in the way he structures and writes the book. I do not recommend it too anybody of any age.

Now I know why - he wanted to discuss everything that is wrong with this book and try to figure out why people would like it.

If you don't like sad books don't read this one. It tells an unhappy story about some unlucky children. These children have an encounter with a very greedy relative. Since the children are very rich, their relative tries to steal their fortune.

Amusing if you are under 10 years of age & looking for some light (ULTRA light) reading, but completely unsatisfying if you crack the cover expecting something more along the lines of 'Harry Potter'.The plot is very thin, and I can only assume it's due to this being one of a series, and thus the overall tale of the Baudelaire orphans is spread over the 10+ novels that have since been released. But this left the first book with very little substance, and left me feeling like I didn't care enough to give it another go with the second installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it but...","review":"I started reading this book fully expecting to like it. The back cover was wonderfully grim with it's Poe-ish tone and it's Edward Gorey-like illustrations. However, I found the book to be simply grim with little or no tongue-in-cheek humor. The general tone of the book is so depressing that it just wasn't worth it to me to keep reading. I would not particularly recommend this book, although others obviously favor it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"This was an interesting book, although I thought it had a stronger beginning than ending. The three children are good characters, smart and unique. It is an interesting idea that they have such bad luck, similar to say, an Edward Gorey book.The villain, Count Olaf, is truly repulsive, and treats the children horribly. Some of my points of contention arise in the segment involving the Count. First of all, it is very hard for me to believe that the children, having many opportunities to do so, would not tell their kind neighbor Justice Strauss how horribly they were being treated by the Count. Intelligent children such as these, I'm sure would know when the help of an outside adult is needed, and it is hard for me to believe that Mr. Poe, the dead parents' friend would not believe them when they tried to tell him. Also I feel this book failed to build up a sufficient amount of suspense.However, it was interesting, and I am curious to read book two of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Not-So-Bad Beginning","review":"In \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" we are introduced to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, who suddenly become heirs to a very large fortune when their parents die in a fire. The encounter all sorts of misery when their guardian attempts to steal their inheritance.This book does contain many depressing things, but it documented in a way that lets the reader percieve the humor in each situation. Also, the Baudelaire children have a camaraderie that helps them (and the reader) survive each event more or less intact.The Bad Beginning is a quick, lighthearted read that is an excellent introduction to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Beginning","review":"This is a great book, it tells the life of three very unlucky children: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire.

This man made the children do very hard things. Like one day he had his friends over and the children had to make dinner for 10 people.But the olny reason that the mean man was keeping the children was so that he could take the fortune that the kid's parents left.

The kids are pretty one-dimensional but their actions (or rather reactions) are things that kids their age might think up if they were smarter than average. And I do love Lemony Snicket's explanations of the harder vocabulary words. They're perfectly in line with the way the whole book is written - as if the author had just turned his head away to hide his smile. I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars instead of 3 or 4 but I'm happier bumping it up to 4 rather than down to 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE YOU LEMONY SNICKET!","review":"This book is the wonderful beginning to a fabulous series of books. everyone should read it. that's all i have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beginning to a great series","review":"This book starts of the Series of Unfortunate Events with wicked good fun. The books are perfect for adults who have already read all of the Harry Potter books and want some light, imaginative reading.

Unlike the other reviewers I think that the chracters are quite well done in these noveels.Lemony Sniket ( the pen name of Daniel Handler) does a great job as a writer in the stories, and it is written in my favorite form, third person.

Catchy. And not just for children. Using the negative to get one's attention works for adults as well. \\"Don't read this. This is bad. You're not going to enjoy it. Nothing good happens.\\" Unfortunately, not only does nothing good happen, but all the one-star reviews I've read are accurate. This is a bad children's book. This is a destructive book, with dark themes that have no redeeming value, not even the author's inclusion of vocabulary words. It's a sign of our culture, which has become mesmerized by what's ugly and demoralizing, something much easier to strive for and achieve than that which is beautiful and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too creepy for young ones & too unrealistic for older ones","review":"I found the writing style interesting and enjoyable, but found the characters to be so stupid that I could not enjoy reading the story aloud to my 6 and 9-year-old children. I caught myself thinking again and again \\"no one would do that\\" Yet; the book was filled with seemingly real meanness and danger.

This is the most stupid story line I have ever read. I personally believe that all real life is boring, but if fantasy isn't your cup of tea (for me it's a big gulp) then read something more real lifish at least. You have to be pretty low if you are reuced to reading a story about the awful tortured lives of children. I am writing this review to tell people that even though these books are so poplar not to read them. Also heed the warning on the back cover which literally says if you like a book with any happiness in it at all then don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Ordinary, but not Great","review":"When I picked up this book I was full of great expectations. The children were talented, and I especially liked the biting part. THe book gradually dropped off, however, due in part to the authors obsession to share the meanings of everyday words. I found the plot to be lackluster, and predictable. I've read books 1,2, and 3 in the series, and each one shares pretty much the same plot. I would suggest that if you have an urge to read these books you should check them out at the library. The author points out in his letter on the back of the book that his novels are not ordinary novels, but contain only awful mishaps and no happy times. His words are true, but the unhappy quality in his books is the only thing that sets them apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a general fan of teen fantasy literature (I love Harry Potter, mostly), I had high hopes for this series. I should not have wasted my time, and instead should have heeded the warning at the beginning of the book: it's just not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning experience","review":"This book is so good that I couldn't put it down. Thank you for your wonderful book Lemony Snicket I appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, disappointing person","review":"I purchased 2 Lemony Snicket books for my son and we went to an author appearance at a local bookstore. My son and the other kids fully expected to have an intelligent dialog with the author and come away with a signed book or two.I can forgive the author's eccentric style, even though I suspect he is trying to achieve a place in show business, not children's literature. Not one serious word was exchanged with the kids who were anxious to learn about writing. It was all ego and performance.I cannot, however, forgive him for not signing the books our kids presented. He stamped them like a common notary public and didn't actually sign them.Forgive me if I am naive, but I am used to authors signing the books we purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Huge \\"Unfortunate\\" Event","review":"Take the book's warnings very seriously - there is nothing happy or pleasant about this book. My 7 year old was extremely upset after the first two chapters, in which the main characters are orphaned. I then \\"read ahead\\" to check on the children's adventures, reassuring my son that, of course, interesting things would follow. I read the whole, miserable story trying to find a spark of something that would interest a child. We love the Harry Potter books which, while sometimes dark, are full of fantastic adventures. This book has little of that adventure. While some adults may appreciate the book's tongue in cheek tone, I did not, and would certainly not continue reading this book to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written Bad Concept","review":"Sorry, Lemony Snicket, but this book is a depressing read, (as it suggests on the back), and that is not covered up by the poor attempts at humor. The book has constant interruptions by the author defining words, and it is a quick read. I have 2 other books in the series, and I have to say that while they were a small improvenment, this is not the series to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Well, I brought this book because after reading the blurb on the back cover it sounded like it had a Roald Dahl ring to it. However, because you now KNOW that nothing will go right for the main characters in the book, the book is very predictable, predictable here meaning YOU KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN!!! I'm agreeing with the reader from Edinburgh here, (I'm from Sussex by the way, hello!). All of that explaining of words got really annoying, I still have no idea what all that was about. Also the characters were a bit dim...why on earth didn't they just run away from their evil uncle? I probably didn't enjoy the book because I was 14 when I read it, it is definately for younger children, even though I think the book would even leave them unsatisfied because it has a rubbish ending. Nice try Lemony Snicket, but better luck next time. What sort of a made-up name is that anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So dreadful I can hardly believe it was published","review":"When this novel was given to my son as a birthday present, the family proceeded to read it aloud, as is our custom. We're fiction lovers in this family; I'm a writer myself. My husband and I kept waiting for it to get better. No such luck. The ending was awful.If you're looking for a one-dimensional story, with no subplot, no character development, unbelievable sketches built around gimmicks rather than in-depth characters anyway, an ending we pretty much guessed long before the semi-melodramatic finale, loads of flaws in the plot, etc., you're really gonna enjoy this book.Others may wonder, as I do, what on earth is going on with HarperCollins these days. This is yet one more book from my earstwhile favorite publisher where the jacket copy is far more interesting than the book itself. Beneath the hype, a real stinker, sad to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, yes, but very odd","review":"I agree with previous reviewers that these books, while engaging enough to read in one sitting, are quite off-putting. I find the author's tendency to define words annoying. I will, however, admit that I get a certain amusement from the tongue-in-cheek, understated, British humor. Granted, I am an adult with a child of my own, but I don't think I would have enjoyed this series as a kid. The books have references that are way over the heads of the recommended reading level and very disconcerting for us adults. Klaus and Sunny (von Bulow, perhaps?), I mean really! Sure, Harry Potter has a dark side, but the dark side makes sense. These books seem to be misery for misery's sake. We have enough of that in this world, without promoting it in our pre-teen children.

The colour has somehow got lost on the DVD transfer, the sound is scratchy in places and murdered by bad dubbing (particularly with the little boy) and an intrusive musical score drowns out the dialogue. Having said that, although the plot is very thin, Bardot is a true professional and squeezes evrything she can out of her character. Its silly and not terribly funny either and probably not worth playing again for a very long time , but even with so much against it, the Star DOES shine through. She is a megastar and her screen presence can not be denied. If you're a fan buy it anyway.

It's in Black and White - full frame - dubbed terribly, and is rather grainy and unclear as well.

The writing started weak and ended weak, the voice acting was mediocre at best, and I could swear watching this movie gave me temporary cancer. Don't waste your money or your time on this travesty.

That was quickly stripped away by this total waste of time and money.I would say that the animation looks like a couple of 9 year old kids found a program, but I know 9 year old kids that could do a much better job at both animation and character development. In reality it looks like Crest Animation was a startup that pulled folks off the street to work the buttons. I really can't express how truly horrible the animation is. For the technical minded, the animators knew nothing about slow-in/slow-out, overlapping, or idle movement.Character design and development are mostly non-existant, and given only cursory swipes here and there by the producers. Lionsgate, you should be ashamed of yourselves.If you still think that you should see this, that the trailer wasn't bad. Find the trailer online and watch it 30-40 times. You'll enjoy it more than attempting to sit through this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Derivative Dross","review":"An insult to the intelligence and imagination of children everywhere.Hard to imagine grown men and women actually working on this er \\"movie experience\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STAR AT ALL DON'T ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!!","review":"First of all I ordered this Alpha and Omega Dvd/Blueray set for my kids Birthday thinking I would actually receive it!

There were 5 kids between 6 and 12, a late teen, and 6 adults. I think the only ones who enjoyed this movie in any way were the two youngest. The incredible number of previews generated multiple laughs compared to the turkey of a feature that followed. There is little story, no sense of danger, and very few laughs. There is a cool scene at the beginning with a roller coaster cam shot of wolves sledding downhill on a tree (yes, you read that correctly), but they do the same shot two more times in the movie and it loses its power. And the wolves \\"howl\\"/sing in a way that is unpleasant/weird, which jars you out of scenes that would tolerable otherwise. I gave it more than 1 star because it is not offensive (a few butts, but that's it), some of the afore mentioned \\"roller coaster cam\\" shots are cool, and my 6 year old liked it OK.

Unfortunately this program has neither feature. It lists all the topics with no associated grade level. It does not ask the child to select or enter a name, therefore there is no way to track progress. A child would not know what topic to pick when using this unattended. The math section has bugs. We could not go through all the multiplication lessons. About the only good thing is the narrated science topics. My kids find that interesting.

With their irreverent style of humor, nothing is sacred! Being DJs, they have the obligation to go against that institution known as Howard Stern. They successfully topple Stern with their cutting edge comedy which he has lacked for several years now.

We also know that Jacques and Lemony knew the Baudelaire parents due to the page 13 photograph. I thought it was a good ending with the Baudelaire's in the trunk of Olaf's van or car because Olaf is looking for the Baudelaires and their just in the trunk, and the Baudelaires are trying to stay away from Olaf, but need to be close to him in order to find out what the file says.Hopefully the series will get more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for older readers!","review":"i am 10 years old and really like this book!!!!!!!!It is a bit scarey for younger people because it sounds like someones going to have their head cut off!!!I think ages 9 1\\\\2 to 18"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Lemony Snicket has done it again, the eighth time!

But through all eight of the books, he is trying to steal their forchan.I LOVED this book and recomend it to people 10 and up.

They get a ride from the V.F.D to the hospital. Klaus, Sunny, and Violet get jobs as file cabinet organizers. They find out that one of their parents is still alive.

When we opened the package we were shocked to discover the poor quality of the product. The \\"mat\\" that it comes with is a very flimsy sheet that is creased & nearly-perforated along the seams. After playing with it only three times, the mat is now in four pieces. The car also barely follows the track my son draws - often shooting straight off the mat for no apparent reason. And the props? They're large & flimsy printed cutouts which attach to small clips and can be set on the scene - but when set on the scene they block most of the mat.The car can't even be pushed around because the wheels only spin when it's turned on!My son has gotten moderate enjoyment out of the toy, but it takes more time to set up than he spends playing with it so we usually don't bother..

With \\"The Book of True Desires\\" (and even her last book, \\"The Book of Seven Delights\\") she is venturing too far into the Raiders of the Lost Ark territory. Are these screenplays for adventure movies? That's not what I want when I pick up a romance novel. There is certainly action here, but I feel cheated. Her heroine is gorgeous, confident, and accomplished, right from the get-go. Sadly, I didn't relate to her at all. Krahn's earlier heroines were so much more appealing. They all felt lacking in some way, all searching for \\"home\\", none feeling too terribly beautiful. I hope that in the future Krahn creates more of those endearing characters. These just turned me off. Crazy, twist-and-turn-type plots can only carry a writer so far. I want my romance novels to center around the romance.

Not exactly effective in preventing my germs from getting out in the open when I cough. I should have thought harder about what a \\"valve\\" meant, but I was just going off the comfortablility claims rather than what that actually meant.

After I entered the house I'd filled with ammonia and cyanide gas, by the time I'd finished zipping closed the seal to the house I was already gagging. After I woke back up, I crawled to the exit and had to leave, without getting any work done. Also, this gas mask caused me headache, nausea and vomiting.Pros: Cheap.

The Rapture actually drew me back into the Left Behind series--I literally couldn't put it down--and I found it moving in a way the aforementioned installments completely lacked.I definitely suggest that even if you disliked the first two prequels, you read this one.

The book went no where, it was dry and boring and i didnt even watn to finish it but forced myself to. It picked up towards the last 30-50 pages but thats about it. If anyone is to read the prequels, the first book was the best and half of the second book was alright. But sorry to say the third was a huge dissappointment.

That the playwright is Tennessee Williams, ( A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof ), one could second guess the worth of this psychologically strange play-within-a-play-within-a-play concerning thespian siblings acting out a play from the confines of their self-imprisoned home to an audience of no one. It's as if the character driven pathos of Williams' earlier work have gone full blown psychotic with no chance of returning to normalcy. Certainly a cross between \\"Waiting For Godot\\" and Shirley Jackson's novel. \\"We Have Always Lived In The Castle\\". \\"Out Cry\\" is frustranting, challenging, stimulating, and manipulative. Possibly all the characteristics of a great play.

If you are passionate about anything in your life and especially if you are young, facing opposition, reading this book may inspire you to follow your heart and what you believe.I can relate to this book a lot because my father and Rodney's were of the same batch.

A lot of the training aids are wrong with multiple spelling and translational errors that give the reader cause to second guess themselves as well as the book and it's authors.

Combine his wonderful poetic lyrics with Maria Muldaur's beautiful and unique voice and you have a winner. My only complaint is that I think it leans a bit close to country. For many, that is probably not a problem. It is for my wife, so I listen to it primarily solo within my car. By the way, I don't sound nearly as good singing along with Muldaur as I did with Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Never Sounded So Good","review":"My late husband was Bob Dylan's biggest fan, so much of our 38 years of marriage had Dylan's gravelly voice as background music.

I've been listening to some of these songs for decades, but Muldaur's interpretation makes many of them really beautiful love songs, something I didn't hear or appreciate in Bob's originals.

In this book, three orphans are sent to a very stange town, where thay are made to do chores all day.

These fit very well and I was able to remove the old brake lines and torque the new ones (11 ft lbs) with no damage to the flare nuts using the 10 mm. Some areas were very difficult to torque, I was able to use the 12 MM with my 3/8 inch torque wrench and torque with the 10 mm. The wrenches are worth the price, I am totally satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality!","review":"I use the wrenches all the time at work.

I came to care about these characters and was sorry the book had to end. Truly a sign of a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little lacking","review":"I ordered this via Amazon. It was delivered in a regular Amazon box, very discreet. The package was in a white plastic bag inside of the box. It is made up of a soft material that gives when you squeeze it. It is about 4 1/2 inches long. It has three ridges of graduating sizes. The top ridge is 4 1/2 inches in circumference, the second ridge is about 4 3/4 inches in circumference and at the base it is 5 1/2 inches in circumference. It is very quiet. I think is is shaped kinda weird and too short. The vibrations are not earth shaking. It didn't do much for external stimulation either. I thought is was just kinda okay, nothing special. I used it and kept waiting & waiting & waiting. I think I would burn up the batteries before I got any satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"like the look, but not the quality.","review":"this looks wonderful to use, but was a dud upon arrival. the batteries used were fresh from the package, but just in case, i used almost two whole packages before concluding it was the product. and since it came with other things that all worked, i know it wasn't how the package was handled on the way to me. very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat entertaining","review":"Maybe this is a good movie, but just not my style. I did like Armegedon. The plot of the movie was that the US found out that in 2 years and asteroid will strike Earth. The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't focus on the asteroid as much as it should. I would bet more that half of this movie had nothing to do with the asteroid. During this time, the movie focusses on the personal lives of the characters of the movie which really isn't that interesting. When the method of destroying the asteroid is discussed, it seems that it was thought up and planned by a 6th grade class. Also, I didn't find the way everyone reacted mostly acurate. So overall, if you have nothing better to do, you could rent this movie. But if you want to see a great movie about an asteroid, see Armegedon."},{"rating":"1","title":"*snore*","review":"Why can't people make entertaining asteroid movies for once? This movie is very boring, and the only good part is a 2 minute disaster at the end. Armageddon was a stupid romance movie, Deep Impact was a boring drama and Asteroid was a boring romance movie! Spend more time on the disaster seens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Ishtar\\" of the 90s","review":"This movie is awful! Take a bunch of really good actors, mix them with a bunch of so-so actors from bad NBC sitcoms (Men Behaving Badly and that goofy tabloid sitcom that Tea Leoni was in), and you have a horrible story. Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall must have done this for the money. The movie introduces too many characters. Tea Leoni plays an awful MSNBC journalist. Additionally, MSNBC is advertised all over the place in this movie. Robert Duvall is not a convincing older astronaut. Neither are any of the other actors portraying astronauts. I've seen B movies with a better script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trading Star Power For Crappy Effects","review":"If you like the premise of Armageddon but can't stand Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck, then Deep Impact is for you! Full of twists, like when the asteroid breaks into two seperate parts and the smaller one crashes into the Earth and destroys the entire east coast of the United States and they successfully destroy the other one buy having the astronauts drive a space shuttle bomb into it. Wait, did I just ruin the movie? The only bright spots are when Morgan Freeman are on camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. . .","review":"Don't even plan on seeing this movie. I went to go see it in the theater basicly because I wanted to see it so bad and I did. You know what I didn't like this movie at all. I thought it was boring and depressing. The acting was pretty good except the movie was terrible. If I were you don't even plan on renting it or buying it on video you might not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last WORD","review":"OK...If you haven't seen Deep Impact or Armageddon, here's the criteria for deciding between the two (more than likely, you will like one and hate the other). Armageddon: buy this if you have no concept of science or current space technologies. On top of that, if you like action but not acting....this is your flick. Deep Impact: buy this if you want a thought provoking experience. Sure, it has some faults but the movie works at many levels for many different viewers. It shows women in positions of power in the media...it preaches the merit, wisdom, and resolve of older people (Duvall), it addresses family relations, alcoholism, young love, and foremost, they portray an African-American as president of the United States (bravo). However, as a devout follower of world unity and consciousness....I don't know what to make about all the religious references. Steven Spielberg and his consortium at DreamWorks are very clever and smart...is there an agenda at work here? Pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent don't buy","review":"It is worth seeing but not worth buying. They tried to do too much in a short movie. It needed to be a three part mini series. The first day would have shown the discovery of the comet, the second showing the attempts to stop it and the third showing the destruction and aftermath.Well that is my two cents worth...."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS SO-SO STORYLINE","review":"I found DEEP IMPACT somewhat dissappointing although the special effects are great the acting is not and here's why. I found the whole storylines involving TEA LEONI'S character as well as ELIJAH WOOD'S soap opera style and boring although I do think MORGAN FREEMAN and ROBERT DUVALL do a great job in thier roles it's not enough to compensate for the above metiond. Anyway in my opinion the special effects are the only thing besides FREEMAN and DUVALL that save this movie so all in all I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! Unlike other disaster movies this one makes you cry","review":"Great! Wonderful! Superb! I loved this movie. It not only had a wonderful cast including Tea Leoni, Ron Elderd, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, and Elijah Wood. It also had a hrad solid plot and definate goal. The special effect are great, and they are not too extreme. Hardly any violence at all. And the last half hour of the movie makes you cry. It's a great film. I loved it. And the other up thing about it is it's not too long, no sex or nudity and it's just all around a wonderful, spectacular, brilliant, moving film. This is a must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film.","review":"Watched this because it was free with Amazon Prime. Glad I did.

I recommend you take the time for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Moving","review":"I forgot this movie. I watched it again this evening and it brough tears to my eyes. Wonderfully done and personally moving. I am surprised this director hasn't done more big movies, if she can do this. I'm not a big crier, but this moving had me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just special effects. A very good film!","review":"I strongly disagree with the Amazon Editorial review written by David Chute.For a film that is now a decade old, Deep Impact still proves to be a powerful, topical film driven by emotion rather than special effects. Granted, it's not perfect. In fact, some viewers will guess several of the plot twists long before they arrive. Predictability and flaws aside, it's still an emotional journey worth taking. Deep Impact is one of the better films of its genre, and is certainly far more enjoyable than \\"Armageddon\\", the film it is most often compared to.If you enjoy your disaster pictures with an emphasis on character depth, I highly recommend Deep Impact. If all your looking for is a special effects driven action flick, then look elsewhere.JM"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is like Armageddon, minus the entertainment.","review":"I'm sorry, but this is supposed to be a disaster movie? Since when does a disaster movie have the \\"disaster\\" in the sub-plot??? This movie is actually a love story between the (then) 18 year old Elijah WOod and 15 year old LeeLee Sobeiski. Nothing more, nothing less. You'll be eager to see the astronauts on their heroic mission, instead you'll be tormented by Elijah staring at LeeLee. This movie also disguisted me, for instance, the point of attack (when the actual movie's meat started) comes during a hyper-close up of a fat guy's cheek blubber shaking as he sloppily eats pizza. The camera is pretty much sitting on the guy's top lip for about six minutes before the guy looks at at screen and realizes an asteroid is about to hit. I give it two stars only because of a moving scene on a beach between a daughter and father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, so it's not Armageddon...","review":"I liked this film. It was not your average disaster movie in that it tries to have a more human slant than its predecessors. Okay, so it fell down a few times, being a bit sugar sweet with the teenage marriage and the daughter who reconciles with her father just before the killer tidal wave hits. However the special effects were good, the acting was not too bad either, and there were one or two toughing moments that were fairly realistic and not overly sugary. I agree it is no Armageddon, but then did it ever want to be like Armageddon? I doubt it. Both are distinct and enjoyable films that just as watchable as each other for different reasons. So if you want a fairly intelligent disaster movie, that tries its best to be interesting and entertaining in the same breath, then watch Deep Impact. It's not bad and it does have its moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like cinema, get \\"Armageddon\\", please.","review":"I will only give you three lines to describe the flick: a negro american president - people being warned of the ominous danger several months before the impact and a national lottery to choose the ones who will go to the \\"Noah's Ark\\" (instead of preparing the whole thing secretly and putting aside the normal citizen as it is and as it must be) - Would any person with a minimum sense of reality believe that? - Finally, an unnecessary dawdling of a tedious plot threaded with unsubstantial clich��ed characters following the most banal and predictable unpredictability. Make yourself a favor and get Armaggedon, a western-in-space that will make you think of a post-modern version of \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" or \\"The Magnificent Seven\\". More fun, more epics, and --being a scifi-opera--, more credible by far than this \\"Flat Impact\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too depressing!!","review":"I understand that this is a disaster movie, but I expected some \\"up\\" moments. There were none. In my opinion, disaster movies are popular because they emphasize heroism and goodness in spite of circumstances.

This is the first egg ever laid by Morgan Freeman to my knowledge, whose movies are generally outstanding. While his performance is good, there's not much else to see - every cool special effect in the entire movie was shown in the pre-release commercials! If this movie had featured ten more minutes of special effects (that's what saved Armageddon) and ten less minutes of mindless character development of lame characters I didn't care about, it might have worked. Instead, I left the theater thinking \\"That's it?\\" and wanting a refund. Because I disliked this movie so much, I did not go see Armageddon in the theater, which I regret. I definitely made the wrong call. Watching Deep Impact is like watching ice melt.

By the time it was mercifully over, I was embarrassed to think I had actually watched the whole thing, let alone spent money to rent it. The only redeeming factor was my hopeful anticipation that just maybe, something bad might happen to Tea Leoni's obnoxious mouth-breathing character.

I had the privilege of working on the movie as a science advisor and can attest that the producers, director, and writers had a strong commitment to making the movie as realistic as possible within the framework of the human drama they were telling. The effects of the impact are realistically portrayed, as is the surface of the comet and the overall premise that such an impact could occur. I believe the realism of this movie makes it much more exciting and dramatic.

First off they break the movie up into WAY too many substories to solve in 2 hours. The scenes where people act nobly become so cheesey that by the end of the movie you want the world destroyed. Not only was it too sappy and mushy but they make an issue of launching hundreds of missles at the comets and then don't even include a scene showing it. As unbelievable as I thought Armageddon was it was still a hundred times more enjoyable than this movie. It makes me wonder why they bothered with last minute lovey dovey additions to Armageddon so it wouldn't be only an action movie. Deep Impact has enough mushy fluff for every hollywood movie for about the next 5 years.

The only good thing was LeeLee Sobieski as Elijah Woods' girlfriend. But she couldn't even make this worth watching. Save you money. Want a good disaster movie?

Deep Impact sends you on a rollercoaster ride of emotion. You can care for the characters in this one, unlike Armegeddon. Morgan Freeman and Elijah Wood give wonderful performances. For a young one, Elijah Wood is probably THE most talented actor his age out there right now. To anyone who believes they were cheated expecting something good to come of it, well if this was to happen in real life, what good would there have been in this situation, therefore this movie is more realistic. GRADE: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I ever saw...","review":"This film made me happy to have a fast forward button! I felt somewhat uncomfortable that Robert Duval could be in a film like this. I had like him since Apocalypse Now. Flying a ship on the tail of a comet is even worse than shooting down alien ships with a computer virus or piloting alien ships stored in Hangar 50 something in Independence Day.

But the similiarity ends there. Armageddon is an action film that throws reality out the window and virtually ignores the tragedy of the situation. This is where Deep Impact prevails. With a comet screaming toward Earth and humanity fighting for its life, there is a realistic attitude toward the struggle that bypasses any last minute, against all odds, miracles and instead relies upon the human spirit to save the day. Deep Impact manages moments of both hope and despair in ways that nearly brought me to tears. This film is not about a comet. Nor is it about the heroes who save the planet. It is about the people on that planet and how such an event alters the course of their lives forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Impact","review":"I love this movie, I know its very cliche that America always has to come up the hero and saviour of the planet, but you have to admit, we would be the only ones that would care, and possibly the only ones that have the knowledge.

The writing and characterizations have unusual depth for a big studio, big budget disaster movie, and the acting is uniformly excellent, with several performances -- Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvaal, Vanessa Redgrave, Tea Leoni, and Maximilian Schell -- being especially memorable.Yes, it has some of the elements of soap opera and melodrama and yet manages, somewhat miraculously, to transcend them in its overall effect.This is, truly, a refreshingly real-feeling disaster epic with a surprisingly \\"deep impact\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is a nice film from really good special f/x, the acting great,a good addition to your collection.....Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most realistic 'earth disaster' movies ever!","review":"This was the 'closes to the real thing' story I've ever seen.It was very spooky in that respect.

The writers should have taken some clues from people's behavior during the Cuban Missile Crisis to determine what would happen in this situation. At least Armageddon knew it was stupid. The people who made this movie should have ripped off more from On The Beach and less from When Worlds Collide. Funniest bit from the movie: The Statue of Liberty getting knocked over by a giant tidal wave, causing several members in the audience at the theater where I saw it to shout out Charlton Heston's famous last line from Planet of the Apes.

The story line is very weak. The directore attempts to build tension by showing how the blow the comet. What took armageddon over an hour to do they compressed into six minutes tops.

The same branch of entertainment as \\"Raging Bull\\" and \\"Taxi Driver\\". It is NOT a film. It is one hour of my life I want back. Script, direction, production and cinematography aparently mean NOTHING to the \\"director\\". May he hang his head in shame at this mockery of culture. Morgan Freeman, I salute you for carrying on a successful career after unfortunately starring in this [stuff]. Take a guess at the end. Which one is more likely in this film: (a)The meteor(s) hit earth (b)They miss Earth (c)The makers of this abomnation ... themselves.although (c) is more preferable to any movie-goer, it would be patronizing to tell people which one.

It will probably be a damn sight better than this [stuff]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre disaster film","review":"Deep Impact is nothing you haven't seen before. It's the typical lousy disaster film ( excluding Poseidon Adventure and Towering Inferno ). The relationships of the characters are typical stories of love found, love lost, and love found again. The performances are average, the script is dull, and the direction is subdued. What can you say about a film that tries to tell the audience that the coast of Virginia looks like the mountains of California? People were about a half an hour away from Virginia Beach when the asteroid hit, and they were able to run to the tops of mountains more than an hour away in ten minutes!

And then when we really want to see courage, etc, it ends as suddenly as it starts.These filmmakers need to go back to the Irwin Allen classics like the Towering Inferno.

I found it so bad and boring that I quit watching it in the middle after the anti-meteorite mission fails. BTW I wonder if there isn't (maybe unintended) some anti-African racism in it as an America depicted here with all top-leaders (president, etc.) being African fails to protect the planet whereas other movies of this kind show European national leaders succeed? I would not expect this from Hollywood though, so I guess it is unintended.Go and get instead a good comedy like Bulworth.

Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-have Movie!","review":"This movie is thought-provoking, realistic, and moving. One attack from some people is that it is not great in actions or super effects. Well, they are correct, because this movie was not made to be an action movie itself. Rather, it presents a realistic situation which people on the earth have to face in the future sooner or later, and it describes the different reactions from different people. The movie did a great job in making people think about some profound questions, which people often ignore in their daily lives.

Actually, I was expecting more drama than action while I was watching this film and that's what I got. The reviewer below me who says that's lots of people have been watching this movie for the wrong reasons is pretty much right. But even as a drama, Deep Impact crashes. Hard. Instead of focusing on one or possibly just two main characters, this movie features a bunch of subplots that don't even connect. I understand that director Mimi Leder and the writer must have been trying to show the audience the different reactions of normal people in a time of crisis, but it just doesn't work. The fact that most of the lead roles don't even meet each other hurts the movie even more, not to mention most of each character's stories are pretty boring. And I'm still wondering how the ship could land on a comet. I'm more than positive that's impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazon Editorial Review Is WRONG! 5 STARS.","review":"I read what David Chute had to say and he is almost completely wrong. The movie was great with remarkably developed characters, superb dialogue, and terrific acting. Robert Duvall gives a 5 star performance and the movie is certain to be one of your top 20 favorites.Its not just some big rock hitting earth and killing a lot of people. That sort of comment should be beneath anyone who represents amazon. The truth is, the meteor is discovered about a year's travel from earth. At first, a coverup while the government decides what to do about it. The press find out (as they always do) and the world as a whole is forced to deal with the situation. The movie goes from executing three plans for survival each heart wrenchingly realistic. This isn't a silly bunch of oil diggers being sent up by NASA-- as was the case in the ridiculously far-fetched Armageddon-- this is a movie steeped in fact! Entertaining from start to finish, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre disaster film","review":"Tea Leoni gets the Ben Affleck award for acting malpractice. The woman cannot act, and why anyone would give her the starring role in any film is a complete mystery. This woman not only cannot act, at least in this film she appears to be stoned on some powerful drug. And I am being kind. (Very kind.) Granted that she is an ectomorphic blonde, but come on. There are others out there with true acting ability. Leoni has none.Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall save this film from being an utter turkey, but only by a slight margin. Freeman as the President of the United States is very, very good, and he is really the savior of this otherwise awful film. This one is a stinker, but the special effects just barely make it watchable to the end. I never tire of watching New York City get destroyed. This saves the film, just as the destruction of New York has saved several other otherwise horrible films. Only barely though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very heart rending tale","review":"This movie is about how different people react to learning that a comet is headed toward Earth. Mayhem ensues when the citizens find that a computer will preselect 80,000 of them. The people this story focuses on are true heros and heroines, even though some may get unsung. For example: Leo, the boy who discovered the comet, marries his girlfriend in an attempt to allow her and her family to live. When he finds that he must live, while she must die, he goes back to find and try to rescue her. This story is an excellent choice, one that I recommend full heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband loves it.","review":"It's just another one of those unrealistic, action laden, breathtaking movie.

It is a very realistic depictation of what could happen if a meteor was discovered heading our way. This movie looks at the human implications, the human drama, the human effect such a disaster would cause. More than the physical damage and upheaval, it is the human damage and upheaval that counts. You may not like every character, but realistically, do we like everyone we meet? This movie is a fantastic combination of action, romance, and sci-fi FX. It's both a guy film and a girl film, which is why some don't like it. If you want your films to be only \\"all guy\\" or only \\"all gal\\" you may not like this one.

Anyone like me who has daughters is more than likely to feel more than a bit gut-wrenched after this. But aside from the extreme content, this film was actually well made. The aunt's slow almost unnoticeable descent into madness was expertly done and the film was not watered down, but rather captured the theme of the loss of innocence and the horrors of a mass hysteria of sorts.It truly is mind boggling and depressing to dwell on the fact that this is based on a true event, and this is probably not the best date film or family night motion picture event. Get ready for some serious disturbia.

However I find the execution of the film to be very academic and has thus somewhat of a made for TV feel. The cinematography, editing and soundtrack don't offer any suprises. Production and sound design are acceptable. Unfortunately I have to admit that I wasn't sold on some of the kid performances.It seems to me that nobody - despite the heavy subject matter - tried to push the limits. Which is certainly possible without having to show additional violence as the most talented directors have proven us. Was the main objective to produce a film that is in the end an easy sell?

I saw this movie on Netflix so I'm glad I did not buy it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child porn snuff - disgusting","review":"The book was disturbing, but this is plain disgusting. I read the book years ago. It was truly disturbing. It was kind of like Lord Of The Flies - children behaving badly. In it the kids kidnap a teenager, if I recall correctly. They proceed to rape, torture, and eventually kill her. And then they all just go back to their normal lives. That was the creepiest part for me. The book has some literary value because it poses more questions than it answers. It's told in flashback by one of the neighbor boys. He didn't participate, but he witnessed the whole thing and did nothing to stop it. It is, in effect, a morality play.In this version (spoiler alert) the girl is barely pubescent, the boys are all children. Mom and the boys humiliate, torture, rape, torture some more, and in the penultimate scene they burn off her genitals with a propane torch. Of course, she dies.While the book may have some literary value, adapted for the screen it's just pure trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Watch Unless You want to get sick.......","review":"This movie is so disturbing, sick, nasty, I couldn't finish it, i do NOT recommend this movie to anyone who cares about people, you will never get this out of your head..."},{"rating":"1","title":"david is one of them","review":"david is one of the bad one. otherwise he could stop ruth and save young girl. david is resposible for this tregedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Most of the reveiws for this film were a little misleading. The film could have been absolutely shocking if not produced for sixteen year olds. Having said that, the film was disturbing because it was based on real events. The violence was all off screen or left to your imagination. If you want to be upset without seeing what your upset about, go for it. A good film waisted on age restrictions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific","review":"This movie is very graphic. The hard part is that it is based on a true story. This movie does not really depict actual events, but it paints the horror that Sylvia Lykens felt. As far as rating this I would have to say....this movie puts this young girls pain front and center like no other movie. Some are critical because they feel that it's hard to watch, seeing through a sociopath's eyes is always hard. Gertrude was just that.

It has a promising beginning, but then tumbles and keeps on tumbling. The entire movie is solely focused on drawing out strong emotions with shock after shock after shock of the abuse a young girl goes through at the hands of her aunt and cousins. The entire movie is an exercise of pain. It exists solely to convey the pain this young girl goes through. The abuse continues right until the end, when the main character, a neighbor boy infatuated with the girl, turns into MacGyver to rescue her. He then kills the abuser so quickly and painlessly that it leaves the viewers with a complete sense of injustice. The ending happened so quickly that there was no reward for the viewer to see all the pain that happened. The entire experience leaves you feeling completely horrified and with no outlet for those emotions. There was no justice, no ramification, no nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary/made me made","review":"this movie is hard to see but this sometimehapens i can,t see enenyone doing this to there on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell by daylight","review":"I read the book and my imagination went wild. I imagined everything so much uglier and darker as it is in the movie.The movie is very colourful and has lots of light. There is tension, but not enough, also the mother who gave birth to 3 children still looks like a beauty and not touched by the hard life, which makes it not so believable.My advice buy the book, it is well written and gives you the terror you want. A Disturbing Masterpiece! Even my brother was reading it and he hates reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pure trash","review":"This is the most offensive movie I've seen in my life.

At the very least, the filmmaker could have shown what happened to the accomplices, who I wish could have gotten double what this defenseless girl got."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is two movies with the title","review":"I watched the movie and read the book. The other movie with the same title shows the real reason why this sadistic mother (not of Sylvia) did what she did. Supposedly Sylvia was gossiping about her pregant 16 year old daughter that was a prositute as well. But as I read other stories on the web this woman was sexually obsessed with Sylvia and her handicap sister who was tortured and molested as well. There both good stories, the best I can say is watch them both and you will get a feel of what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distrubing - Do not watch this movie.","review":"This movie is very distrubing I could not watch the rest of it.

DO NOT WATCH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful, moving Movie...Weak Blu-Ray Release","review":"I won't go into the specifics of the movie itself since most people know what it's about by now. My review will focus solely on the Blu-Ray release. While the disc shows a stunning picture, that's all there is. No extras, no subtitles, not even a menu! I thought something was wrong when I put it in and the movie started right up. Subs wouldn't be a bad thing for this movie since most of the dialogue between the two main children is either whispered or spoken while crying/in pain. Sometimes, it's just hard to understand what they're saying.The DVD version is loaded with extras: 2 Audio Commentaries, Interview with Cast & Crew, The Making-of featurette, Trailer and Screenplay (DVD-ROM). This is one of those few instances where alot more thought and work went into the standard-definition DVD than the High-definition Blu-Ray. Just buy the DVD and use the upscale part of your Blu-Ray player. You'll be alot happier in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smutty and a snuff film","review":"This movie is the sickest piece of garbage I have ever seen. People on here say that \\"we should see what child abuse is like to understand it.\\" No, you don't. You don't need to see simulated video of Holocaust victims being thrown into ovens to know that the Holocaust was bad. You don't need to see a woman being raped to know it's bad. It's common sense that this is bad. If you don't know that child abuse is bad and you need to see video confirming it's bad, then you have no business being in any society in general.This is a piece of smut, no more. It has no redeeming qualities. To sum it up in a few words, it is a horrible montage of torture, rape, and mutilation. I think watching Faces of Death has more redeeming value and is easier to watch than this. It doesn't even have a good ending, which makes it even worse.Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy seeing filth like this. Maybe this would be enjoyable for pedophiles and sadists, but not for normal people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching this movie may have scarred me for life.","review":"This movie contains graphic, realistic depictions of sadistic torture and rape of children. This movie would make a collection of Taliban torture and execution videos look heartwarming in comparison. If you have children under the age of 50, don't let them watch this movie. Watching this movie may have scarred me for life. The fact that this movie was well-produced makes it all the more worse and disturbing.

Other than that, you do get the idea of what Sylvia Marie Likens had to go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl Next Door Horror","review":"After viewing this movie I vomitted. Depression took over for several days. This is an account of one of the most horrific TRUE stories in our lifetime. The story of Sylvia Likens in the 1950's in Indiana. She was tortured, raped, humiliated, and starved. Her battered body was used like a punching bag until she died. She died in the basement of a house where she was chained and tied up. Sylvia suffered every horror you can imagine one person committing against another. Shockingly, the group of young boys who violated her were allowed to continue until her death if they promised not to tell anyone else. Could your teenage son, brother, nephew, grandson, etc., be capable of these unspeakable violations of poor Sylvia? Or are you the one adult who encouraged this behavior?

This is a fairly sanitized version of what happened. The sad thing is that children will be so very cruel to each other and especially toward someone who becomes marked as an outsider or target. This is called scapegoating. Children will know about dead bodies and bring friends and other back to see it.Finally, someone breaks and makes a phone call. Or perhaps a stranger wanders upon the body also. Yet this person makes a phone call.I would not buy a movie like this. I saw it at a friends house. I got up and left. It will be a cold day in a Christian Hell before I ever enter that Pastors house again.Instead of spending money on this movie, I would reccomend donating it toward a childrens shelter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"Disturbing but amazing. Not cheap thrills. Not exploitation.

This is NOT a horror movie, nor is Ketchum's novel a horror story. No zombies, slashers, or vampires. Both are merely shameful treatments of one of what has been referred to as \\"the single worst crime perpetrated against an individual in Indiana's history,\\" and do not induce the creepy thrills typical of a horror tale. They only sicken and enrage the viewer. Included are fictionalized methods of torture which even the evil Baniszewski did not use. Nice, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl Next Door Movie.","review":"No Point in making a film like this?

I saw it,I hated it. I didn't read the \\"NOVEL\\" nor Do I Plan to.The Movie was intentional I believe in not to bring awareness but as some sort of Beef against the 1950's. When The Film Stars the Narrator says something to that effect,and then on to the story, the fact that the narrator was such a COWARD and DID nothing, He Tried on a Small level BUT NOT ENOUGH,The Person deserves to live with Guilt for the rest of his life.

I was wrong. If anything, I am now more confused and angry at having blown forty dollars on this manga. This series definately raises more questions than it answers and will leave you extremely frustrated. If you have only bought the first one, conserve your money.

She would come in and help once in a while when she seen progress. The directions can be a bit complicated, but once you figure them out it's easy. This looks really neat when finished.

I would like to have gotten more info on troubleshooting, such as what to do when it's thin in spots, laying out the wool, etc. Also, there are NO photos of how to actually lay out the roving or what it should look like before you start wetting it down. There are only hand drawn illustrations. I was hoping for a little more than that from a book that labels itself for beginners.Overall, though, it's a good book, and well done.

I am, however, very glad I bought this. The book is descriptive, slightly experiemental, and a lot of fun to read. Mocking Desire chronicles the life of Gregor Gradnik, a Slovene student getting his masters in New Orleans. It tells us of his friends, coleagues, and the people he meets, each of which has some different quirkyness that sets them apart from everyone else. The book is humourus at parts, and very serious at others. It is really a good way to read about how foreign students view Americans, and is a real eye opener both literarily and realistically speaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expressions, The Heart of the Tuba","review":"I think that this is an excellent recording of some music that is rarely heard for tuba and piano. Kyle Turner plays with excellent tone, and the level of collaborative musical virtuosity that he and his accompanist attain is very commendable. I am particularly drawn into the movement of the Sonatine based on Amazing Grace, because almost each time that I listen to it I hear or see something new. I am very pleased that I chose to purchase this album.The one criticism that I have is that this album does not really contain any staples of tuba literature, so I would not place it on a list of essential recordings for a tuba student to possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE FROM SWEET BASIL","review":"Recoerded Dec 1985 at Sweet Basil in N.Y.C.

While it did entertain me for an hour or so, I didn't think it was a keeper. The story should have been divided into two distinct parts, rather than the abrupt change at chapter 9. The first part is from the point of view of Howard Carter. The second part is a third person view of King Tut and his family. There for a while I wondered why they had placed Tut's story after Carter, but then some of the nuts fell into place. But the characters have no depth. You don't get to know the Carter gang well enough to care, and they are very shallow. Tut is shown as a spoiled, whiny little brat with his shallow wife. The ONE thing I did find interesting was the theory behind Tut's death.Go ahead and read this book, but don't expect to be overwhelmed.

Look at the average rating on these reviews, and you'll see about half of them are a 1 star rating. This means the charger FAILED for half the people that used it, and probably a lot of those rendered the ipod (or whatever device)useless. Don't risk your new iPhone on a cheap charger, because there's absolutely 0 chance that the supplier will refund you, and you're probably invalidating the warranty when you do this too. There's a reason this product is marked down to TWO cents, and that's because it obviously doesn't work.Mine froze up my new iPod touch, I had to restart it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, not the worst","review":"Well , i gave this 4/5 stars for many reasons. First of all, it to longer than I expected for shiping, and when I tried to change to shipping speed, I couldn't! Next, It could have been in a more attractive package! Again, the first time I plugged it w/ my iPod nano, my iPod started going\\"loco\\". It was a little hard to figure out at first, but at least I can charge it up in my room w/out having to use the computer. Also, it was a great price, but w/ shipping and handling and tax, the total was $6.11 .That is still not too bad compared to how much stores and other online shopping website sell them for, I just hope this was not a rip-off.

However, I didn't like the time it took (almost 1 week and a half) and it wasn't worth it.Now the product itself: at first, the product was working just fine, which is you plugged to your Ipod, connect it and it activates the charge mode. It did actually. The real problem was that when I left it the entire day charging, IT DID NOT CHARGE THE IPOD ENTIRELY. It is a major fail to the product itself and that's a bad thing for me. I rated this 2 starts because of the delivery time and because its still works. if you are looking for a charger that can hold the battery life as long as you have it connected to the wall, I would recommend this, but if you want your Ipod charged entirely, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Cheap","review":"I received the item as depicted in the first picture--it is NOT foldable. It is made of cheap plastic and is not very professional looking.Crucially, it does not stay connected to my outlet (well, extension cord) because the plug is on a narrow platform. It keeps coming unplugged and thus does not perform it's function.On the other hand, it does have a little LED light that indicates whether it is plugged in (or not, as the case may be). However, the light is quite bright, so it isn't appropriate for the bedroom.Ultimately, it did charge my smartphone (not fry it). And, at $3, that is all I expected.

While there were mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance for only $2. The red indicator light came on when plugged in but it would not charge her iphone at all. I decided to try it on my HTC EVO 4G. It did charge but did so VERY slowly. I guess it just depends on your device. Personally, I would recommend dishing out a few dollars more for a quality item but if you'd like to take a chance with such a small price point, you may have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and Portable","review":"Packaging:It came in a white plastic package and then stored in clear bubble wrap. The packing slip was also included.Pros:It was exactly as shown in the image. I tried to plug it into the wall and extension socket but it was a bit loose. The led red light lit when it was plugged in and then went out when it was removed from the socket. I tested it on my Sansa Express and it charged it fine. It is convenient to use if I'm not around my computer and is small and easily portable.Cons:My only complaint is that it should fit the socket properly.Rating:It did a great job of charging my MP3 player but got 4 stars because it did not fit into the wall or extension socket properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I bought this item and have tried with several different cords and it will not charge my ipod.

Sadly, this charger does not appear to work for my Nano (tried it both in the United States and Europe). It makes my Nano screen flicker and changes the tone of colors on the screen. It didn't destroy the iPod by just trying it, but I was too afraid to leave it charging for an extended period of time since the iPod started getting too warm and the screen was still flickering.The charger I received is slightly different from the one pictured.

I wrote to the company,and they told me to send it back for an exchange w/me paying the shipping.. although the shipping to send the charger back was more than the charger itself, so after many back & forth e-mails they sent me a new charger, free of charge. The new one STILL doesn't charge my shuffle. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the speediest charger, but good for the money","review":"Took almost twice as long to charge my 4G ipod.

But after several uses, the contact prongs pulled out and got stuck in the electrical outlet. So, I purchased a replacement. Guess what? Same result.

I will never understand how Apple can make such great products and then flake on chargers, earbuds, etc. When I received the shuffle as a gift I was thrilled with the size and the product in general; however, having to use a USB charger all the time quickly became irritating. I have two USB ports on my computer and between printers, speakers and external hard drives, the last thing I needed was one more product that not only used a USB port to charge, but REQUIRED it! This adapter is perfect! Again, people claimed they had problems with their shuffle frying after using this, but I have had no problems. This adapter came in a bundle package I purchased and I must say, I use this adapter the most! The price was also a huge factor in purchase.

It charges my 2nd gen iPod touch, but the prongs don't hold the unit in the socket. I attempted to bend them closer together to see if they'd grip a little tighter, but that hasn't helped. Wall outlets seem to hold on better than power strips or extension cords, but if you live in an old space with few outlets, this wall wart will cause quite an inconvenience. Most importantly, I wouldn't want to leave one of these chargers unattended while plugged in for fear they could come loose enough to start a fire.This product will get the job done, but you might consider going up a price point to find a product with better quality components. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as described, but first unit was DOA","review":"This USB charger is exactly as described. It's just a plug with a USB port for charging. Unfortunately, my first unit was dead on arrival, but one email to SF Planet to the address on the packing slip, and they resolved the matter with minimal inconvenience and no added expense on my part. They say you don't know the quality of a business until you have to resolve a problem, and they passed that test with flying colors, so I'm very happy with the seller.As to the device, the red LED is bright and always on, so I'll probably cover it with tape. I connected it to my Kill-A-Watt, and it reported zero watts when nothing was plugged in, which is good. The sticker on the plug says that the input is 100-240V 50-60Hz AC, so with a simple plug adapter, it should work for foreign travel pretty much anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I bought this and the first one I received did not work.

No, they're not incredibly well made - they DO feel a little cheap - but for $2, what would you expect? This \\"cheapness\\" is the ONLY reason I gave these 4 out of 5 stars. However, they work perfectly with both my little MP3 player and its separate speakers (which I use to listen to audio books while I knit), freeing me from dealing with batteries. I just leave the battery compartments empty.As an extra bonus, both devices work with the usb charger just as they would with batteries, with none of the problems of lessened usability that crop up with wall blobs.

I think anyone who would consider buying this book already knows that. You should be interested in how the book looks, how it reads, its physical presence, and so forth. As far as that goes, the book is sub-par.Each comic is presented on its own separate page. Since it was sent to the publisher a while ago, this also means that there isnt very much material... only a few weeks worth. So about half of the current online content is missing from the book. Since there are so many pages and so little content, it doesnt develop the same flow as the multi-strip pages on the web site. You'd probably be better off printing out the strips yourself, and putting it together. Now, part of the cost of the book does benefit the Afghan landmine removal campaign, but if you feel bad aboout it, you could always donate money directly to them.Hilarious comics, but not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny if you're a Democrat, I guess","review":"I laughed at some of these, but alot of them just came across as bitching disguised as humor.

Addleton does a wonderful job of telling the story of how his parents came to be missionaries in Pakistan, and what it was like being a MK (missionary kid). This book is not hagiography, but full of insight, humor, and complexity.

There were several characters with potential, but they weren't developed well enough to make you care about them.4: Bad voice acting. The characters didn't have any emotions visible in their speech.Adding all these flaws together I was very disappointed by this series. If you're still curious try watching it on youtube.

I recommended Syn-flex to a friend whose daughter had hurt her knee playing soccer. A month later, she said her daughter said \\"Thank you!\\" It helped so much.When my sister had arthritis in her hands so bad that she couldn't even unclench her fist at night, I bought her a bottle of Syn flex.

There are many more entertaining and better written books in this anti-romantic western genre (if it is a genre). I am not a big reader of westerns but BLOOD MERIDIAN by Cormac McCarthy is high on my list of all-time favorites. I got this book because the author had just came out with a new historical novel (MARCH about Sherman in the Civil War) that has received good reviews. I have read some other books by this author and never knew he'd written a western.The first chapter grabs you with good writing and fast action of the sex&violence; variety. Then the rest of the book drags on and on about the suffering of a fairly whiney, uninteresting lot of folks who try to make a go of the little town of \\"Hard Times\\". I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Westerns, you'll enjoy this book","review":"If you've read Doctorow's recent novels, you may want to go back and read his first novel Welcome to Hard Times. If you like Westerns, you'll enjoy this book. The story is set in a Dakota mining town and recounts the lives of people going west to find their fortunes. The hard times of western towns is portrayed though the characters' personalities and past experiences. The plot is suspenseful and the ending completes the circle from the beginning of the story. You'll especially enjoy Doctorow's wonderful words describing the scenes and people throughout the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"how it really was","review":"A book about the Wild West as it probably really was, very violent and desperate but written in a talky familiar voice so it's entertaining without too much shock appeal and it also creates empathy from the reader. I enjoyed it. I really like this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Villeroy & Boch New Wave Caffe Mugs","review":"I love my Caffe Mugs.

This album contains all their released tracks, and as Sundazed usually does, features unreleased photos and songs. What I had a problem with was the lack of any ear grabbin or even finger snapping music. \\"Smell of Incense\\" might have been a good enough single then, but now, it sounds a lot like rehashed wanna-be psychedelia. The vocals are not to the forefront enough for such a talented vocal combo being present. To make matters worse, \\"Downtown Woman\\" is not remastered in stereo like it's medley counterpart, \\"Nadine\\", the only song on this album that stands alone. If only the whole album were composed of remixes it mightv'e got a higher rating. Get their seventies stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Disappointing Compilation Underdelivers","review":"I really was looking forward to this book. On the positive side, the author did do a lot of research into the pre-1950 glamour pin-ups of which most of us today are not familiar. On the negative side, the artwork is entirely disappointing - small black & white images do not capture glamour very well. In addition, he puts too many models in the book with insufficient detail to each. Rather than doing a sad overview of the top 1,000 - he should have done a nice portrayal of the top 500. As it was, he was getting pretty desperate to get to 1,000. Elvira (the horror film commedienne), Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek's Lt. Uhuru)and Lily Munster are all fine actresses/characters - but glamourous - not at all. Finally, amazingly, he left out some modern superstars like Emme. Save your money and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just want to correct something","review":"Someone mentioned Caroline and Janet Munro.

If you can take the time to plough through Grant's blathering about how hard he parties and how good he is in bed, you may well find yourself enticed towards the city he describes, although you'd probably rather not have him in person there as your guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious rambling","review":"The author seems to be overly impressed by his own skills. The few good moments in the book are lost in over-wrought spasms of ego thumping. While the protagonist is well conceived, the plot is horrible. Barely worth a library rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grant is ahead of his time...","review":"...either that or he is an unmitigated fathead. I have read better prose on bathroom walls. His insecurities bleed forth like, not like a wound honorably received, but like a menstrual flow that won't stop - he just keeps dribbling on and on.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing quality and content","review":"The quality of the video production is very marginal. There is a warning at the beginning that it was recorded in EP mode, and to adjust tracking if there is a problem with picture quality. No amount of adjustment could compensate for the overall poor quality of the picture.There wouldn't seem to be many age groups that this video would appeal to. There isn't a lot of big rig action and sounds that seems to captivate childrens interest. The content is weak at best, and there isn't enough action or sound to make up for it.Even at the low price I don't think it is much of a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"I found this movie very uninteresting. It never piqued my interested and I only continued watching because of this obligation. I was hard to follow, I didn't feel attached to any of the characters and I honestly could not wait until it was over. I can't recommend this movie to anyone at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Movie","review":"The reviewer who said this movie has an identity conflict was correct. But this should not stop you from watching it. The film starts very slowly as a dark character study. It has very awkward scenes involving Nathan and the only two people with whom he interacts (Amber and his boss). I kept constantly questioning why they would even hang out with him.Once Nathan started talking in complete sentences, the film became more interesting. It really explores the relationship between two very opposite individuals.The ending, however, made it a thriller. The action picks up. There is no blood or gore in this movie, however.So - I would watch this if you can survive a slow to develop film. It does satisfy in the end.Finally, The jazz score was great. And the moral of the story: Acts like a psycho, talks like a psycho = psycho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been more engaging","review":"A story about a troubled, jazz lover, artistic young man should be more interesting, especially with Amber Tamblyn involved. But it just wasn't. The story plods along and there are too many things left out. I can understand some mystery and uncertainty, but there just isn't enough of substance here to keep most folks interested for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending Earned This One Another Star","review":"This film was going to get a three star review from me. The office environment where the main characters work was totally unrealistic. The boss drinks on the job and flirts with his female co-workers to such an extent he would have been fired for sexual harrassment. Mason, the main character, is so strange and unattractive it is hard to believe that the woman he becomes involved with would give him the time of day. This film was very different from \\"Hatchet\\". It was slow, moody, and very restrained whereas \\"Hatchet\\" was all about excess. I have to say that I was never really bored but I was checking the clock a few times. Then, the last ten minutes of the film hit me and earned this film an extra star. The double-twist ending did pack a punch. I think that it saved this film from mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throught-provoking view into the mind of a troubled artist","review":"Spiral is an interesting independent film. Moore is totally believable in his role as a mentally disturbed artist. His neurosis seems to be amplified with the presence of Amber (played by Amber Tamblyn). Without giving away any spoilers, I would recommend you watch the film without thinking too deeply into the scenes. They initially appear to contain hidden meanings and messages (perhaps the power outages do fulfill this role) but the twist at the end will reveal them to be false and it is a straightforward plot. Albeit, there is an almost Freudian perspective on Mason's behavior and relationship with his parents.Tricia Helfer was in a scene for only a few minutes and sported a shorter haircut. Her dress does make her resemble one of the final 12 cylons from Battlestar Galactica."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Like This At All","review":"I didn't like this movie at all. Mason was very obviously a strange and tormented man. He made me nervous with his total inability to fit in. At the same time I felt sorry for him. Joel David Moore did a very believable job of portraying a man who seemed to be on the brink of a breakdown. After Amber entered his life he seemed to improve, though I had trouble understanding why she sought him out and wanted to be with him. I also found it very unbelievable that his boss wanted to look after him. His boss was a very shallow person (in my opinion) who was not the type of person who would care for a very weird man. I kept hoping the movie would explain a common background for the two men that would explain this.I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because of the acting. It was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring movie but good sleep aid","review":"The first time I tried to watch this movie I kept falling asleep. The second time I attempted a viewing of this movie I had to drink two venti coffees to keep awake. The movie is very slow and not much happens till the end and even that was rather uneventfull. So Mason is a emotional wreck with issues and a crummy job. When he paints he comes alive! Anyhoo...it is pretty boring. So the geeky Mason ends up hanging out with the perky girl at work. He paints her and things get out of hand....they fight...the end. It would have been nice if the movie would have given some reason why Mason was such a wreck or at least explained about the mysterious room which viewers are not previed to. I get this is suppose to be a psychological thriller but it wasn't very thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon, is that you???","review":"Pure and simply \\"Napoloeon Dynamite: The Dark Side\\".Really.An \\"OK\\" watch ... but, you knew he did it.He drew her."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I just finished watching this movie and I must say...GREAT story and GREAT twists and mystery.

Incomplete, insufficient and inaccurate research is the name of the game here. I too could write a story about my experiences on various psychopharmacological drugs and their impact on me, however what is important here is that these drugs when taken properly and under the care of a physician rarely produce the kinds of side effects she describes. Perhaps she needs to understand that Serzone, a popular medication for depression is in fact NOT an SSRI. Interesting idea, no support. Try again.While blaming school shootings on meds is convenient, why not look at the fact that 1. the children had access to guns in the first place and 2. the children managed to breech the campus with them. Furthermore should there not be some analysis in which we ask ourselves why children would bring loaded weapons to school in the first place. Show and tell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"Do not buy this product. The first time I used it to work out it broke. The plastic piece that adds the strap in securing it on your arm broke. I use to have one of these about 4 years ago and it worked well. But again this one broke the first I used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"The only reason it gets negative comments about the strap is because most users strap on the armband incorrectly. I purchased one and so did by brother and unfortunetly his broke because he put the strap incorrectly and consequently broke it when he tightened it; make sure you observe how you put it on but overall very good product.

I'll post how my replacement fares once I receive it and use it for a little while..."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I bought this because it was able to hold the mp3 player (has a slip in pocket) without it being clipped onto a band but the product was very disappointing because after one use of about 30 minutes the plastic piece that the band thread through broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read","review":"I have owned many (3-4) of these same exact armbands over the past few years, never with a problem. They usually just wear out and lose their elasticity. No big deal, wear and tear. But the last two I ordered broke within 11 minutes of using them!!! The plastic D ring that holds the strap to the body of the band cracked rendering the product useless. I bought two because I love this product and I do wear them out. Also, it's for an outdated MP3 player that is not going to be supported forever. Very upsetting. Such a great product gone wrong. Bad batch? Bad lot???? Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will break!!!","review":"There is a piece of plastic that holds the 2 ends of the armband together...this is made out of cheap plastic and will break!!!

First, of all it is too big, i am a fit guy (but not skinny) and it doesn't fit my arm, it routinely slips down to my elbow during a workout. Second, it is oriented upside down, so that you have to turn your head downward to see your selections. If you want to wear the band inverted instead, you might risk the sansa falling out of the armband's socket.Through and through this is a cheap and useless product. I simply started wearing workout clothes with pockets so i can place my player inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armband is too small","review":"I see some people saying the armband is too big.

Would do business again with seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality","review":"I purchased this along with the other arm band sold here. This is by far the better quality one, but I use the other more cheaper one. The reason is the other has a clip. This product is strictly meant as an arm band, but I found after use that I don't like something on my arm. I'd prefer to clip the MP3 on my short's pocket or band. This doesn't reflect badly on the product because it's my personal preference. It's too good of a product to give away, so I'll save it as a back-up, in case the other one breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"A little pricey but you get what you pay for. Its heavy duty and holds my E280 in place whenever I go running or play basketball. It gets uncomfortable after an hour but that might just be me because I have skinny arms. Of course if you just wiggle it around once and a while, it feels better to have on for longer periods of time.Good product for a Great MP3 Player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good armband","review":"This armband has turned out to be pretty good. I searched the internet for about an hour, because I wanted to make sure I picked an armband that would be compatible with my mp3 player.

My particular video was distributed by Diamond Entertainment Corp. and says \\"Mastered from the Original Studio Print\\" on the box. Baloney!! Until this gets a proper release from Universal, which owns all these pre-1948 Paramount films, pass on \\"Swing High, Swing Low\\".

This movie, however, is not one of his best. The picture and sound quality are rather poor for starters. Although MacMurray and Lombard have been in other Leisen movies, they don't generate many sparks here. MacMurray plays the troubled brilliant trumpeter part as a kind of physically and morally lazy cipher. There's not much about him for us to get excited about and therefore not much to make us believe that Lombard would go for him and rescue him from the skids. I mainly got the DVD because I wanted something by Leisen, but the joke's on me because now (or very soon) two of his best - Midnight and Easy Living - are out on DVD. Get those and No Man of Her Own (if you can find it)to see how adroitly Leisen mixed comedy, drama, romance, and the darker aspects of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus tracks are nothing new","review":"This review is addressed to potential collectors who wonder how collectable the bonus tracks are. The 15-track album is essentially a European pirate version. The first eight tracks are from the title album. Tracks 9-13 are from 'Sound Sun Pleasure.' Track 14 is from 'The Singles.' Track 15 is from 'Sun Ra Visits planet Earth.' All tracks are from 1958/59.I give it four stars because the music is wonderful. Alternatives are the CDs from Evidence, well produced and featuring great essays in their inserts. If you are interested, any of these two-for-one CDs is a good choice:Visits Planet Earth / Intersteller Low Ways;Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy / Art Forms of;Angels & Demons / Nubians of Plutonia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must","review":"I am a Sun Ra rookie.

It's not quite as startling, colorful, or brilliant as \\"SuperSonic Jazz\\", which he released in 1956; the edges seem to have been filed down a bit on the music.

But seriously - this guy is a true master - his compositions are imagineative - he is a master leader- the solos are all inspired - and everything is together. In Jazz there are 4 composers who really were ingenious - Monk, Mingus, Ellington, and Ra - there are some other great ones to - but these are the ones that really stand out to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More straight forward/traditional jazz","review":"This one is alot more of a straight forward type of jazz with elements of the \\"far out\\" style present.

It was good to see Phil back considering with a miserable story like this you need someone to cheer you up a bit. Unfortunately, he doesn't last too long.Why I say that this book was a little slow is because of the annoying constant times when the author gives the readers a flashback to things that have already happened to the Baudelaires in case you had forgot or if you didn't read the others. But when he keeps on doing flshbacks to different times instead of continuing with the story for about the 20th time it can be a little frusurating.

Different writing styles are seen throught the book and cliff hangers in every chapter, the gripping suspense makes the book very hard to put down. Cpt. Widdershins' form of speech was sometimes annoing with all the \\"Aye's\\" about once or twice in every sentance.

I hope we'll be seeing more return visits from characters left behind in the earlier books of the series. The ending of this book is the best. I was cheering for the Baudelaires!This series is a refreshing antidote to our society's coddling of our kids. The Baudelaires get hit with every possible disaster, yet they keep using their heads and forging on. When we devote our efforts to making things easy for children, we do them no favor. In the real world endings are not always happy; hard work and good intentions do not always bring rewards. Yet we need to keep trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grim Grotto is Great","review":"I recently got into this series, i cannot believe how good this series is.

It is a great read for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One step closer ot the end.","review":"Lemony Snicket, The Grim Grotto (Scholastic, 2004)The Baudelaire orphans continue their adventures in this eleventh book of the celebrated series. A Series of Unfortunate Events has gone through ups and downs over the years, and it's recently been in something of a down phase; this looks as if it's the beginning of an upward swing, and thus I'm cautiously optimistic about book twelve (due out, as I write this, a few months from now).If you've liked the series so far, you're not going to find much different here, and it should do right by you. If you've not liked them, or not experienced them, you should probably either go back and start at the beginning (with the aptly-named The Bad Beginning) or, as Snicket cautions many times, just put the whole thing down and walk away."},{"rating":"2","title":"the question mark...","review":"in lemony snickets\\"who could that be at this hour\\" it says that the bombanating beast is in the shape of a question mark when swimng. it is huge"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"I personally loved this book. I am a huge fan of Lemony Snicket's writing, and this book brought hidden mysteries into my veiw that were hidden in the rest of his series, disguised as a simple comment from a charecter or something as simple as a sugar bowl. If you love mystery, excitement, and the feeling to read on, then I recommend this book, and the rest of the Unfortunate Events series, for that matter. This book is appealing to all ages, whether you be 13 or 35."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"If you value your happiness, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. It details the horrible plight of the saddest trio of orphans I've ever seen. In reading this book, I was alternately in tears and dispondent. Here, \\"alternately\\" means both unhappy and upset. You would be better off reading a book about the effects of greenhouse gasses on the water cycle. Here, \\"greenhouse gasses\\" refers to the byproduct of a dull chemical reaction which effects the environment. This effect, while unfortunate, is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the depressing plight of the sad, sad Baudelaires. We can only hope that the tables will be turned with this new installment, and no one will have to read about the shocking misfortunes of the Baudelaires ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPIDEST BOOK EVER","review":"It is a really dumb book.

I loved Klaus' ill-fated connection with the mysterious Fiona, the crisis with the mushrooms, Captain Widdershins, and above all the last couple of chapters, when the bigger mysteries of VFD finally begin coming together. The ending is probably the single best ending to a SOUE book yet -- and has me wanting to go back through all the books to find every past reference Lemony Snicket has made to his family, or to marmosets. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I thought the repeated jokes about the water cycle being dull were repeated often enough to stop being jokes and start being dull.

To find it they must exit the sub and search alone. Unfortunately a poisonous mushroom lurks in the grotto they must explore to find the sugar bowl. When they return from the grotto, they find even more unpleasant surprises!This book is quite suspenseful -- after the book takes some unexpected turns I couldn't tell what was coming next. It's very exciting -- there isn't much action but it's always keeping me on my toes. It's also slightly funny because in a couple of parts in the story the author jumps in and adds funny commentary. Of course it's depressing because it's not like your average every-thing's-gonna-be-all-right story -- actually it's the opposite, everything goes incorrectly.

The battery in the projection unit took almost 48 hours to fully charge, but did make it. The source for the projection is weak, and in a light room is hard to see.

In Yoshe Kalb, you run into the kind of corrupt Chasidim that you're sadly more likely to run into today. It's a brilliant portrayal of the often corrupt world of Chasidic dynasties where the leader knows little to nothing, the gabbai fights with the community and the women are stuck gossipping.Nahum marries into an Hasidic dynasty due to the dynastic leader's eagerness to get married. A sensitive soul, he withdraws from the community except for an overwhelming lust that he feels for the chief rabbi's wife. Inadvertantly he sets in motion a chain of events that will destroy two dynasties and ends in one of the strangest trials in literature.If you have only read Isaac Bashevis Singer, I urge you to seek out Israel Singer whereever you can find him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Pooch Sweater!","review":"It's really pretty.

At first listen it may sound like big-band jazz, but then you start noticing the oddities; the dual baritone saxophones, the way the Orchestra jumps out of standard jazz structures and into pure modality, Ra's odd chord choices...but you'll hear them for yourself. Gradually you realize that this is not ordinary jazz. On other excursions (i.e., albums) Sun Ra can snatch you rather abruptly from Planet Earth, but here he does magic to tempt you into boarding. And then before you know it, you're cruising the spaceways. If you are a Sun Ra fan you know how delightful this is; if you are not, this may change your mind; and if you don't know who he is, why, step up and meet the Man from Saturn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to OEM specs","review":"The manufacturing is not within the tolerances of the OEM unit.

Occasionally the toast jumps out of the toaster when it pops up due to the force of the release mechanism. It is VERY hard to manually force the toast up once lowered into the toaster, if you decide you have it on too dark of a setting. It takes two hands and a lot of force and the toast ALWAYS jumps out of the toaster when this is done. The toast darkness dial is usually stuck on our unit and it takes some force to move it. After approximately two years, the toast heater on the back side (one long horizontal bar) has a short in it and we can see a very bright, flame-like spot on it.

It could be classified as a warm or cool scent - it blends especially well with my vanilla scented lotions.

The first two \\"Starhawk\\" books have established all the legs needed for an inspired series...I look forward to many more.Maloney's imagination is stuck on wide open...his story telling concise and so filled with ironic wit that I happily suspend disbelief and hang on for the ride. This newest book, \\"Planet America\\" puts me in mind of \\"the Hitchhikers Guide\\" with perfectly rational discussions and wry conversations going on in the most irrational circumstances and locations. Sort of like M*A*S*H (the movie), which brings up an idea!Nah...special effects couldn't do this kind of stuff, could they ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good second book in the series.","review":"I was really drawn into the characters and plotline of the first novel in this series, and was left wanting to learn more about Hunter Hawk and his mysterious origins. This second novel did not disappoint in providing more adventure and intigue--and leaves you with a real surprise at the end, waiting for the next in the series. You really have to have a strong stomach for some of the wholesale slaughter in this book, and the 'suspension of disbelief' one must take in science fiction is tuly pushed to it's limits, but it is a fun and quick read. I look forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can never go home .....","review":"This second in the new series of Star Hawk defines the Sci-Fi element the author has taken the Hawk Hunter of Wingman fame. This opus drives us with the same sense of good versus evil, excellent combat action, and a new vein of mind bending concepts from the Sci-Fi kit bag. It is a fast read, leaves the dedicated fan and first timer wanting a little more. The best part of this emerging series is continued from the other book collections: faith in your comrades, country, and cause. It is an underlining theme that makes this reader continue to look forward to each new book. For the new reader I would like to point out the earlier work's of Mack Maloney. In each you will find interlooping characters, events, and themes like wormholes in time travel theories. This is a very strong element to this writers ability. He has put a series of inter related works that can be read in any order and remain highly enjoyable. Where is the next Star Hawk book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Evidence reissues!","review":"Normally I hate when critics say \\"it's worth the price for \\"[fill in the song title]\\" alone.

But as an archeological collection, this is not without interest.\\"We Travel the Spaceways\\" - the tracks here were nearly all recorded on other (available) recordings - and generally the versions on other albums are preferable. Hence, this becomes the equivalent of listening to an early rehearsal tape, and in places the sound is so low-fi that it bolsters this effect. But - \\"Tapestry From An Asteriod\\" - amazing. The variations on the other tracks are interesting to hear, also, it should be said.\\"Bad and Beautiful\\" is pretty abstract - I can't get into much of it. I just don't hear a lot in it. My favorite track on there is probably \\"Exotic Two\\" where the chattering percussion anticipates the \\"world music\\" trend and approaches some kind of aggressive trance - but it's far from Ra's best music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled","review":"I've spent the afternoon reading reviews of Suzanne Robinson's books around the net and Just Before Midnight is averaging a 'D' or 3/5 or 61/100.

It looks more like a bootleg copy than an official DVD release. Having seen the complete serial several times in 35mm format, I can only add that there are certainly complete prints out there that would have provided better transfer quality. To add insult to injury, Chapter Two is incomplete; the end \\"take-out\\" (or cliffhanger ending) is missing. One of the poorest, if not THE poorest, transfers I have ever seen from a major studio. I'm returning this DVD to Amazon for a refund; I advise those who have not ordered it to stay away. Better yet, Columbia/SONY should pull the DVD, remaster it, and apologize to us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great serial, very bad transfer.","review":"Jonathan Drake has it right in his review.Aside from the poor picture quality, the originalsoundtrack has been so filtered that the backgroundmusic drops out when dialogue stops.I have seen this serial in 35mm and it was superbon all counts. Too bad it has been ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below avg. serial but view with caution","review":"This serial is in my opinion below avg.in production values/acting for this genre.Fans will probably still enjoy it but the caution involved is that this picture was made during WW2 when anger and outrage against the Japanese was the rule and not the exception.Racism may have made it easier,the Germans (read Nazis)got their share of it but it didnt seem as vehement.I have had an argument,a civil one,about many of these WW2 films with people who believe they should be burned or at least locked away somewhere (to what end they dont seem to know).My view is that they should be viewed as products of their time and do present the prevalent opinion during the war.They also served the propaganda/morale need as well.If a buyer cant watch this picture objectivly,and others like it they will probably be better off not ordering it. Again,the serial itself is below average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Another thanks to Sony for getting this one out! I agree with the previous poster that this 1943 serial is much better than the 1949 BATMAN & ROBIN. As with BATMAN & ROBIN, Columbia licensed this one out to Goodtimes (on VHS) years ago. The print used wasn't as clean as the one used for BATMAN & ROBIN, and I suspect the same will be true here. Given that, it is still leagues above BATMAN & ROBIN. There are some unfortunate overtones of racism, in that the villains are the Japanese (this WAS made in 1943!). J. Carroll Naish is great as the chief villain. If you are a serial fan, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"Personally, I like any comic book hero made into a movie serial. But this is one of the best!

Lewis Wilson was the first to don the cowl for this exciting serial. Douglas Croft equates himself well as the junior partner Robin. The serial 15 chapters of sheer fun.The director was Lambert Hillyer a well known b movie director. This was his only serial. WWII was still happenning and the slang and jibes at the enemy of the times is prevalent. This is to be expected as that was what was said back then. the story is simple and fun. Dr Daka played with relish by J Carrol Naish is the bad guy leading a team of thugs to help him thwart the war effort.I will not bore you with a plot synopsis. but this film is a blast exciting fights. zombie hench men, and a pit of crocidiles just some of the thrills.Alfred is the butler as we know but he showed up here first before the comic books would use him.

Evertyhing they do is a matter of fact with very little real immagination. You don't have to figure anything out.

You?d have to be as familiar with the Honververse as the author to follow this silly mess. Another draft of two seems in order.Once again, where is the editor, or the proofreader for that matter?

This book was actually a collection of articles of a column \\"What Practitioners Need to Know\\" on Financial Analysts Journal. It has covered many important concepts in Financial area and tried to elaborate those ideas completely yet comfortably.As the author said, \\"My presumed audience was .... who dabbles in quantitative methods. I have thus made an effort to avoid unnecessary technical jargon and to substitue numerical examples for mathematical symbolism.\\" I think the author has achieved this point.

His style makes the book a wonderful philosophical enterprise. But in fact, Nozick is still where social science was 10 years ago. He makes an impressive effort of combining different paradigms, evidentialism, causal theory, cognitive psychology, in one overall approach; he then applies this monstruous creature to old problems and paradoxes. The true reasons of these paradoxes, as was shown, for instance, by Bach (1984), are violations of applicability of classical rationality and decision-making theory. Not surprisingly, Nozick arrives to the same result with quite a different methodology. So, in brief, the book remains a brilliant study of ideas brought into social science years before; Nozick succeeds in beautifully arranging various paradigms. He still fails to be innovative in what concerns foundations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the reason an atavistic human attachment or a device from divine inspiration?","review":"According the Greek mythology, the rationality was represented by Apollo, which meant the supreme perfection and the astonishing symmetry.

You will learn nothing new. The author does little more than take widely known, common sense, ideas and regurgitates them into endlessly redundant topics. He covers everything from basic savings to real estate investment but provides no real usable details or strategies to accomplish them. Telling you that a friend of his made $5.1 million on a real estate deal--that his friend admits was \\"really lucky\\"--isn't very useful if the only lesson learned is \\"if he can do it, so can you\\".On the other hand, if you have been living in a financial cave all of your life or have yet to figure out that saving money is better running up credit card debt, perhaps this is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are a few nuggets here, but read it with a grain of salt.","review":"There are a few nuggets here, but read it with a grain of salt.

Yes, there were some of the older school (and yet relevant!) tactics of saving coffee money for savings options, but overall it truly did assuage many of the fears we have about such issues. I think my BIGGEST take away was the 'The earlier you start, the bigger your nest egg' chart on page 39...It help one grasp how daily investments over time using compound interest can make all the difference over a life.

His time spent ruminating endlessly on the meaning of life (and death) would've been so much better spent living it - as the brilliant man he undoubtedly was, he could've accomplished so much. I haven't been this exasperated with introspection since Eat, Pray, Love. At least SHE enjoyed life.Even when stunned from his endless reveries, Henry Stuart still manages to contemplate the joy out of everything.Some nice descriptions of the Mobile area in here, and some interesting quotations to ponder if you're inclined.

He mentions a sump many times in the book, yet never explains what it is, how to use one, or even shows a picture of one...not the best move to skip this extremely important information when talking to beginners. I bought this book thinking it would have a basic 'intro to sumps', one of the most important pieces of reef keeping equipment and I get no information whatsoever. This book is completely worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little book.","review":"Everything I needed to know was in it.

Right from the get go you can feel Anabolic Frolic has created something special for us and it doesn't let up till the end. I've had the pleasure of making it up to Canada a couple of times (12 hours and well worth it!) to see him perform in person and this CD is the closest yet to my memories of his sets which will remain with me and my crew for a lifetime.Despite his critics, Anabolic continues to give his fans what they want, and it's no wonder these CDs have defined the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one yet","review":"Being someone who owns all of the chapters, I can say that this is the best one yet. Not only are the songs great, but the cd has a great vibe about it. As the series grows, it matures and evolves. When you listen to older chapters, you realize how far the genre has come. When I bought Chapter 6 I thought that I had bought the best of the series. I was upset to see that it was THE FINAL CHAPTER but when I found that it was to be continued, my emotions subsided. This is the best cd of them all. If you don't own it already, you need to. Buy this cd... NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Face -- Good Movie","review":"The story line is quite clever. Instead of focusing solely on the lesbian aspect of love, it provides a well rounded look on how everybody wants and needs love. It shows how forbidden love occurs in many societies gay or straight. It touches upon settling in order to please your family and heritage. It balances well with humor and some drama. I quite enjoyed it, it was a good buy for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"Entertaining, funny, smart, great story and great actors/actresses.

As an asian (cantonese) american I could relate to the older generation's disapproval. This ranges from the clothes we wear to the person we date. It was not exaggerated - the gossip ladies - they are real!Joan Chen was of course a star. The two young ladies - very good actresses and should be in more movies. Its funny though - most chinese woman who are considered \\"beautiful\\" by the media and public are the ones who look more caucasian - high cheek bones and a bridged nose. Same goes for Asian American men."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever lesbian movie i have seen","review":"congratulations to the makers of this movie. I must say that this is indeed the best lesbian movie I have seen so far. Maybe because somehow I can relate to it but the story itself and the dialogue fits perfectly all together and the ACTORS PORTRAYED THEIR PARTS FLAWLESSLY. Kudos to all of you. JOB WELL DONE!I think I will never get tired of watching this movie over and over again. This film will be a classic lesbian movie many years from now. I wish they would be interested to make a sequel. That would be awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"This movie is one of my favourite movies, and my number one favourite gay/lesbian movie. The story is cute, the emotions real, and the acting excellent. The ending was a bit of a surprise, too. I thought it was going to go off in a different (rather predictable) direction, but it didn't, and I liked that. Definately something to give a look to if you enjoy romance films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gay Person's Gay Movie- As well as everyone else","review":"This is one of my favorite romantic comedy movies. Saving Face is a great film to watch for anyone who enjoys the toils of balancing love and everything else in life. This would be a terrific gift for your closest LGBT youth, or hopeless romantic LGBT friends. Why? Because the characters aren't 'straight until gay' or 'gay until straight'. There are plenty of transformations and revelations in the movie, but not regarding the characters' homosexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. For some odd reason everytime i watch it i get very hungry though. Great on screen chemistry. Alice Wu did a great job with her director's commentary.

It's full of laughs yet pulls in some serious moments as well...a great balance. The lesbian story line is primary, but does not dominate the movie as other issues are addressed. I am very picky about movies, especially those of the lesbian genre...thankfully this movie made it to the top of my shelf with \\"Loving Annabelle,\\" \\"DEBS,\\" \\"Imagine Me and You,\\" and the other hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This is a great movie, with amazing acting and wide appeal. You don't have to be gay to love this movie, nor do you have to be Chinese/Chinese-American to enjoy this movie. It's just a great movie with a wonderful story to it. It doesn't resort to cliches or formulaic plot lines. Everyone I've shown this movie to loves it. Sometimes I have a hard time getting it back when I let people borrow it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to see it","review":"I was unable to see the movie On my TV show Unable to show this movie on this region The TV system in Spain or Europe is different from the US.

A definite good movie for a first date. Good insight into that other cultures experience with the gay lifestyle. Shame does not target any one culture unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"This goes in the top of my movie list","review":"I love this movie because it doesn't revolve around the typical lesbian love sex. It has a broader topic; family, mother relationship, being true to yourself and others, and love. The director showed the chinese tradition living in America realistically, and I can relate to those gatherings so well that I laughed loudly. The chemistry between Michelle Krusiec and Lyn Chen was great! I could picture this happenning in real life! Also, the music is great.If you want to watch a nice romance comedy that's not too cliche, watch this. It will leave a smile on your face"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This is a light romantic comedy which is best described as cute - not shallow, but not deep either. It depicts the lives of several first- and second-generation Chinese-Americans in NYC. Many stereotypes are humorously portrayed, but the movie stands out by also busting many stereotypes in a surprising way - I can't judge how plausible that is, but I enjoyed it. Overall, the movie offers an interesting story, solid acting, and liberating exposure to another subculture, so I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Real","review":"I loved this film. I loved the effort put into the plot to mix real life situations with the culture. I cannot imagine that Wil and her mom's life stories in their culture would be easy. I felt that these characters were very real and very brave. Their stories have made an impact on me by teaching me that the quest for 'true' happiness should be the only path in life. I felt I could somewhat relate growing up as a mormon who is also a lesbian. I found the film touching on a personal struggle for happiness basis. Thank you for making this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Is Safe","review":"I remember watching the preview of Saving Face a week before I got it and for some reason I was expecting it to be more comedy than love story. It slipped my mind what this film was really about but after the first fifteen minutes you see how the two girls look at each other and it becomes loud and clear. If you ask me Saving Face isn't really a love story but more like a story showing that even if it's a girl dating a girl relationships are all the same. That's clear when Vivian (Lynn Chin) gets mad at Wil because her hectic life of being a surgeon leaves her no time to spend with her new love. The love wasn't strong enough to pull you in but the comedy definitely is. You also have the mystery of who is the man that Wil's (Michelle Krusiec) Mom is secretly seeing and got her pregnant. Although Saving Face can get a little long at times it's still worth a watch. You may get a different vibe from it than I did but it's a good film no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hon Task Chair","review":"I owned a Hon task chair for over 30 years. The only reason I needed to replace it was that the seat padding had deteriorated. EVERYTHING else about the chair was in excellent condition. So I didn't hesitate to buy another Hon. It's the last one I'll ever buy. Although it looks identical, and the description says it's identical to my previous chair, those are the only things remotely similar. This chair is cheap, poorly made, with inferior materials. The seat padding is so close to non-existent, it's like sitting on a rock. The movements work so poorly, I won't be the least bit surprised if they stop working altogether. The best thing I can say about this chair is that it looks good. Caveat emptor definitely applies here."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing else like it","review":"free jazz with form...or something like that. The composer in question is, Sun Ra, one of the most forward looking musical talents of the 20th century. This is one of his first truly 'out there' albums. In the 50's he was an innovator in a sort of big band style that incorporated some of the most strange and beautiful compositions with truly futuristic solos from the likes of John Gilmore (who pioneered the 'sheets of sound' style that John Coltrane would become famous for). 'Cosmic Tones/Art Forms' is something else completely. As other reviewers have said - you cannot define it. It is free - yet so different from what artists like Ornette Coleman were doing at the time. It has an organic almost folk like quality - it sounds almost ancient. It is closer to classical chamber music than to most jazz records. You can't even really compare it to Mingus - this is something else... Just listen and meditate on this one - so strange and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rosetta Stone Of Avante Garde Jazz","review":"Why you should buy this album: 1.It sounds like a transmission from the hippest radio station in outer space. 2.It contains fully successful examples of futurist and minimalist compositions, written by a man who most likely had never before encountered either term. 3.It will make you more intelligent and hip. 4.It makes the psychedelic music of the hippie era sound tame. It was also recorded four years before the first acid test. 5.It's damned funky. Find out what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Space","review":"I have been making my way through the various CD reissues of Sun Ra recordings over the last 2 years, always with respect, and usually with genuine enjoyment, but this one has rocketed to the top of the list. Everything I read about Sun Ra in John F. Szwed's wonderful \\"Space is the Place\\" biography is finally revealed in this tremendously inspired recording. There is a joyfulness about the improvisation in these performances that is totally seductive, and the musical textures are wonderfully balanced and uncluttered. None of the musicians get in each other's way, and the music is never mushy and confused. The group really does sound like it is exploring the unknown together and wants to take the listener along. Although you can hear influences of all sorts of music (swing, \\"classical\\" avant-garde, bop, etc.), it defies categorization. A totally uplifting musical experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I looked at the reviews for this movie, thought it'd be worth a shot. Terrible--I just didn't find much of anything funny. Maybe some of the themes in this movie are played out and has become dull. Only a small number of parts were funny. The chicks were hot though.

This is the most transparent, horribly-written movie I've ever seen. It's so bad that it's close to being a parody without actually getting there.Only thing that saves it is the 2 lead actors; they did a good job (within the restraint of the material). But I have never before seen a more pathetic excuse for a script. Any teenager who's seen the American Pie series could have turned out this crappy copy. Watching it, the movie just screams \\"you liked the other teen movies (the ones that were actually original), any room for me?\\"The football players become cheerleaders. The loser boyfriend gets dumped. They try the Fountain of Troy and fail.

My favorite cuts are, of course, Soledad, Kazuka (a duet for Sanders and a japanese Koto, a harp that has, to my ears, an almost banjo-ish tone), and \\"You Gotta Have Freedom\\", a straingtahead jazz tune, that makes you feel really happy without sounding too...happy. In an age where jazz is dominated by post-fusion electronics, it's great to hear some truly soulful acoustic Jazz (yes, there are electric keyboards on a few cuts...). Bottom line, Pharaoh is an extremely underrated figure in modern jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price but shipping doubles it","review":"There isn't a lot to these things so I don't think to get too fancy about it.

Questions abound: should the new country have more governmental power or less? Lucy thinks the solution is to have a queen! Benjamin Franklin stops by Charlie Brown's house to borrow one of his kites for his latest experiment! Snoopy and Woodstock clown around with colonial wigs and try rowing a sinking boat (with Snoopy posing as General George Washington!).

I was, however, somewhat dismayed with the invasion of adults in this film. The ground crew are all grown-ups; parts which could easily have been filled by the remaining peanuts characters. The events are monitored by some Walter Cronkite wannabe newscaster in a role tailor made for Marcie(much like her part as reporter in 'You're a Good Sport, C.B.).

The first story, Amelia's Innocence by Julia Welles, was a nice sexy shipboard story. The second, The Woman of His Dreams by Jade Lawless was a great read, where the emotions matched the steamy sex, and with a really unique flavor from the paranormal and native American elements. I didn't care for Kathryn Ann Dubois' Surrender. It was sexy but I didn't feel the love, and couldn't figure out the time period either, which was distracting because I love historical settings. The last story, Angela Knight's Kissing the Hunter, was a dark, kinky vampire story. It was the first story like it that I have ever read, and a bit shocking, but so well written that it had me turning the pages. Overall, I really enjoyed the anthology.

I could barely contain myself when it showed up in the mail. What a let down. Whoever did the sound mixing for this disc should be fired. On some songs you can barely hear Santana's guitar work and if I didn't know better,I would say the disk was featuring the three percussionists as most of the time the video is focused on them, and they are the predominant sound.

Takes place at the Inquisition. The grand inquisitor (Henriksen) is very serious, but his co-inquisitors are the more unserious. In the end we get to see the great pendulum, but it doesn't play a big part in the movie. Some allusions to the real \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" too, but that cannot save this sad mix of odd ideas.The best thing is the choir music that is played at the beginning. But then again, one can listen to a CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pits. The end.","review":"Not sure which movie the positive reviews saw. Surely it wasn't this one. I have to wonder how many are confused with the original '61 version. The acting is above average with a minor star-studded cast- no complaints there. That's the end of the positives. It's a laughable that they have the nerve to call it Poe. It has promising moments of dark violence, torture and insanity, all to be completely overshadowed and undone by the ridiculous ending. It wouldn't have been more pathetic if they had a screen that read \\"And they all lived happily ever after...\\" It's even complete with fairy tale like soundtracking. Anyone who knows anything about Poe stories knows they don't come with happy endings. It's part of their horror.On the whole, it's Disney's Sleeping Beauty meets snuff film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must confess...","review":"...this is a very good movie. See what I did there?Let me start with the down side. I found the comic-relief a bit off-putting. Luckily it was limited and associated with only a few characters. There was a pit and a pendulum but their presence was the only connection that could be made to the short story by Edgar Allen Poe. Saying this movie was an adaptation of the story was an overstatement and should have not been stated. Lastly, some of the fake blood looked like paint.With that said, what remains is a very good movie. The actors, acting, directing, photography, costumes, lighting and even the choreography of the fight scenes were all very good. The result is a very watchable and enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was probably supposed to be campy","review":"This was supposed to be a film noir version with camp. Didn't work.

Lance Henriksen shines as the villain and is propped up by a superb supporting cast including genre fave Jeffrey Combs. However, it is the late Oliver Reed in an ironic cameo as an alcoholic cardinal of the church who steals the spotlight. Rona de Ricci holds her own against the veterans, and everything falls in place under the watchful eye of director Gordon. The DVD itself, has some neat extras including a brief behind the scenes documentary which gives you some insight as to how much clout Lance Henriksen really wields as a veteran B-movie star. I strongly recommend this film, and I'm glad to see the company is mining it's best efforts for DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckville","review":"this movie sucks! the whole thing about it is awful. i dont know who would want to watch this movie. it has lots of nudity and lots of violence. good thing that it is discontinued. and i hope it stays that way. ill be glad if they dont start making it again. if you havent saw this movie yet please do your self a favor save your money do not rent this film trust me it is not worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionable","review":"The King Cobra is the best interconnect I've ever come across.It's like water flowing down a stream connected to my Cambridge Audio Azur 640c and then to my Creek 21se headphone amp.If you go further up in the Audioquest line up your getting into DBS territory.The purpose of DBS is to leave a constant electrical charge on the cable at all times meaning no warm up period is necessary.I'm content with the King Cobra as it needs just about 10 or 15 minutes to reach it's full potentail and about that long for my whole system to shine.Also pay the extra few bucks over the AQ Dimondback as the King Cobra is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for any young child!","review":"This book has become my 2 and 4 year olds favorite story.

I haven't heard of another KB series that does this. This DVD alone helped me so much improving my form.The next DVD has the 2 workouts. They're set into levels, time and whether you want music or not as well as whether you want less talk from Anthony. As you do this more, you will notice improvement in your form and endurance.

I understand that it's the 10th edition, but just from my cursory glance at the book, the studies remain unchanged...and dated.

The biggest thing is that how a grown adult would want to have anything to do with a child, especially have an affair. Almost sounds like she's trying to down play John at the same time trying not to discredit him. There are a few books out there about John that claim the same stuff this book does. Did she have a crush on John Lennon when she was young. Later on in life picked up a book, and the book became her new fantasy. Some time later the fantasy became her life.

Neither I nor any of those authors have ever said they were anything but fiction, though! It seems to me that Ms. Waters has a very active imagination and a huge problem separating fact from fantasy.

He later falls in love with her (despite the age difference and the true loves in his life, which he brings to meet her as well.) But the devoted teen cannot really come through for him when he needs her the most. Loosely based on Lennon's life through the years, until his murder in 1980, the author attests to this fictional account at the end of the forward, as a therapeutic means of grieving his death.

THIS DVD was the perfect introduction to practicing yoga and I have already lost 13 pounds! The DVD is simple, easy to follow and Naader Shagagi is extremely encouraging in his instruction. There is a simple set and if one is consistent in practicing this beginner's DVD, you will have amazing results! Look at me. I am finally gaining flexibility and my entire perspective of life is beginning to shift... JUST from practicing this series with Naader Shagagi.

It could change your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yoga DVD out there","review":"There are a lot of yoga DVD's out there with frills, fancy settings and too much talking and chanting. Naader Shagagi's The Power of Hatha Yoga is simple yet challenging, to the point and perfect for beginners new to hatha yoga. It's set in a very simple studio setting, not on a beach or in a fancy Hawaiian landscape. There is so excessive chanting or new age hoopla in this one. He describes the poses, teaches you when and how to breath correctly and has, in my opinion, a very calming and soothing voice. I urge anyone interested in true Hatha yoga to check out Naader Shagagi and his series."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"I am pretty new to yoga but I already have a pretty good library of dvds. I thought this one offered a good variety of poses, it was a complete workout working on a mix of flexibility and strength. Some of it was a little difficult for a beginner cause he does not offer any modifications. He doesn't seem to practice yoga like anyone I have seen before either. When he moves into postures he bounces. He also over extends his knee on poses like proud warrior. I thought you were never suppose to do that. Most of my cd's are performed in beautiful locations, this one is in a studio. I personally feel the location adds a lot to the practice. Its very relaxing to be looking out at the beautiful beaches of Hawaii or the sands of Death Valley. He is not pleasant to look at or listen to.

I bought it 6 years ago when I worked at a salon during college, and its still going strong. I like this one better than the 2 1/4 inch ones because it doesn't fatigue your hands and allows for better control. It has teeth on one end, which I find to be very helpful, since it helps to 'prep' your hair for the flat iron part. My hair is thick and wavy, and as a kid it would frizz up like nothing. Now my hair is smooth and stays that way all day - and I don't even use any styling products! Let make it clear though, this is not a pansy flat-iron, this is professional grade and will make curly hair stick straight if you really wanted. If it can tame my wild hair, it can do the same to yours. Everyone I've met who has used it ended up buying one, and if I lent you mine, you would buy it too. TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!

It starts out strong, gets a little weak in the middle (\\"Nudge Nudge\\" used to be a favorite, but now seems tired), and, fortunately, ends strongly with \\"Upper Class Twit of the Year.\\"One can tell from just looking at the film that the quality is better than television allowed--that they had a higher budget. Another difference is that, in order to help the flow, some editing has been done (\\"Self-Defense Against Fresh Fruit\\" is notably truncated) with sketches being presented in different manners (\\"The Lumberjack Song\\" being sung by the Parrot Shopkeeper instead of the barber, for example).Overall, this is a fine representation of the Pythons' work, and works well as an introduction to their style of comedy. It also works for those simply wanting to revisit their favorite skits."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"sorry, but the feeling of immediacy of the original TV sketches really is the key for me when it comes to this material - hearing the audience reaction (not canned laughter, thank God!) is an important part of the performance for me. I'll be the first to admit that, had I never seen the TV show, I'd probably be just fine with the film versions of these skits. For a Python \\"dabbler\\" (i.e. greatest-hits-buyers) this disc is just fine - but I'm going to invest in the entire collection of TV originals instead . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY","review":"I am a big fan of Monty Python. I have enjoyed all their movies and love the Flying Circus show. All anyone one of them has to do is come on screen and I feel myself ready to laugh. That's what And Now for... lacks. Hilarious skits are recreated but something is missing.... The Pythons did not have total creative control of this movie and it shows. When I rewatch the same skits from the original show for the umpteenth time I still laugh. It just shows how brilliant they were and the fine line there is between truly hilarious comedy and irritation.The lines are the same and so are the performers but the recreations are just not funny. It's as if they were pod people from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Their brilliant comic souls are missing in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This parrot is no more... it has ceased to be!","review":"My dad loved Holy grail so much he actually bought the vhs, in around 1995.

But this movie was so great and hilarious he caved and bought it. Well now we are in this Dvd era and soon to be something else, so i decided to buy this movie on Dvd. And i saw this great deal with the tv show and a sort-of random add in movie. The ANFSCD is classic, but most of my friends do not find Monty Python funny. Yet they also did not like Clerks I, so do not take their judgment too seriously (or rationally). WEll to the point, MP & the HG + ANFSCD are great and worth the price.

I think this movie is a perfect jump on point for new fans who have seen the \\"Holy Grail\\" and want to see what the Television Show is like but are too timid to buy the new box sets. The movie is primarily a retooling of their best sketches from their first two seasons of the \\"Flying Circus\\". Some of the highlights of this movie are \\"The Dirty Fork Sketch\\", \\"The Mountaineering Sketch/Double Vision\\", \\"The Worlds Funniest Joke\\", \\"People Falling out of Buildings\\", \\"The Upperclass Twit of the Year\\" and of course their two most famous sketches \\"The Dead Parrot\\" and \\"The Ministry of Silly Walks\\" which I still love.

In fact, 'Baron Munchausen' is the fist time that I have seen a wide screen film presented on DVD that was culled from a pan and scan video edition, re-framed as letterbox and then mastered to anamorphic.

Nobody reads Kinky's books for the plots, since they don't have one. They read them for the one liners and the very funny Village Irregulars. Unfortunately, he seems to have run out of new material and is just rehashing the same old lines. Maybe he's been away from Vandam St too long. I don't know what his problem is, but my problem is I shelled out for the hardback, when I would have had the same reading experience if I had just pulled one of my old Kinky's off the shelf and reread it.Kinky once said something like: my readers get much more out of my books than I put into them.

Kinky is laying on the slang and puns too much, has nothing really new to say and the result is quite inane.Apart from the improbababilities(sp?) and inconsistencies with earlier books (he had a few of those earlier, but those were minor), this one reeks of a forced work, something he did not have his heart in. It might even have been done by a ghost writer who skimmed the earlier books and overdid the personality part.A must-read for all Kinky fans, but only to keep up and satisfy the curiosity, ths one is not a treasure.I'm anxious to find out whether this was a one-time laspe.

Mr. Friedman's writing brings to mind some of the bands of the 60's in which members were so stoned they thought they were reaching new heights with their music. But since their audiences didn't share the same euphoria, the bands would be rapidly out of the clubs, arenas, and public eye. I think one would have to be under chemical influence to find anything but sophomoric,pun filled, low slapstick humor in these pages.

When I got the book the first thing I looked up was disk quota's. I went to the index and I found one key for disk quota's. (Pg 430-432). So I turned to it and I began to read. I was shocked to see what was written. It says \\"A stock Red Hat Linux system lacks true disk quotas,\\" This was a surprise because I am using quota's on my Red Hat system. I have used them for a long time. I don't remember if I had to load an rpm or not, but even if I did the the book should point that out and tell you how to install and set up quota's. Instead the book gives you a script that will email your users if they use more than a pre determined amount of disk space. While nice it does not stop runaway processes or users from eating up the disk. Red Hat does have quota's and they are easy to use and maintain. I don't like books that don't get basic information correct.

Given the option, I strongly recommend renting the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prime of your life is elusive","review":"I enjoyed this book - as I do all of Muriel Spark's books. Her writing is unique and intriguing and always thought provoking. Miss Jean Brodie is in the prime of her life but it slips away as she is removed from her vocation as a teacher. This book asks an important question of each of our lives: do we have *A* prime? do we really recognize it when it comes? are we bitter when we realize it has passed? or is it the bitterness of betrayal that tragically steals our prime from beneath us. This book is present on many \\"classic\\" fiction lists and it is for good reason. A seemingly simple story, but very far reaching. Just as Miss Jean Brodie's efforts as an unorthodox teacher reach her students in profound ways, this book can ask simple questions of the reader and reach into their souls as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Prime of Ms. Narcissist","review":"Our Ms. Jean Brodie believes she has been betrayed but lacks even the tiniest bit of self-awareness needed to see that she was the betrayer.She has betrayed the trust her students have in her.

Are we supposed to think she is enlightened because she rebels at traditional education?

There are SO MANY better yoga workouts out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fails expectations","review":"This video was ultimately dissapointing. The name fat-blasting yoga had me under the impression that it would be some kind of power/vinyasa yoga. I worked as hard as I could, and I didn't even break a sweat. I admit that I am quite fit, being a dancer and regular exerciser anyway, but I often sweat with other yoga videos (like the Total Yoga Fire). The asanas aren't hard, and her instructions (or lack thereof) are not helpful. Apart from that, i found her voice to be so annoying that it distracted me from my form and breathing, which is something that's hard to make me do. She sounded like she was trying to be \\"mystical\\" with her tone. Overall, you'd be better off with the total yoga series or using Yoga Journals guidelines to make your own set for your yoga practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crikey!","review":"I've never written a review before, but I feel very strongly about this workout video and think everyone should know about it. Why? 'Cause it sucks. I'm not joking. Denise Austin is like a mad woman in this video... she's all over the damned place and her voice is constantly grating. Yap-Yap-Yap...

I'll probably give it another shot... the workout itself looks cool, but it's just too damned fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austin Videos","review":"Her exercises, especially the Yoga workouts, are MUCH too fast paced.

This is a good one to add to the collection because Denise puts a unique spin on regular poses, but she does them effectively and you get a good workout. It also doesn't ruin the purpose of yoga. Her voice is still annoying, but if you are truly into your workout, it is minimized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Direction","review":"Denise Austin is a fantastic aerobic instructor but her yoga workouts are not something I recommend. This workout is a yogaerobics workout - that's fine if that's what you're looking for. I'm pretty advanced at yoga but her lack of guidance and jarring movements can cause serious injury to a non beginner. Her voice is distracting because of the constant upbeat chatter and the music is just as distracting. No focus on mindfulness - very important factor here! There is no real seamless movement into asanas as there should be. After her workout I was more annoyed than relaxed - as you should be after serious yoga practice. She doesn't explain what the poses are for beginners - she jumps right in as if you should know them already. Grant it - it will make you sweat and give you a good workout but you have to be careful because if you can't keep up - you run the risk of injury. She should stick to aerobic workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel great without killing yourself!!","review":"I have the Denise Austin Power Yoga Plus, which is two twenty minute excercises, based on Pilates and Yoga. They are fairly easy, and give you a nice stretched feeling. I also have Denise's Blast Away 10 Pounds, which is a bit harder, and includes lots of high intesity aerobics. This video fell right in the middle - lots of good stretches and movements, but a little fat burning aerobic activity thrown in. It is not traditional yoga, but that is not what you usually look for in a workout video - you look for that extra twist. And Denise provides that. She's also way bubbly, but in a sweet, supportive way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yoga","review":"I enjoy Denise Austin's Morning Stretch program on Lifetime, which has a little yoga at the beginning and end.

The moves are fun, and yes, the cueing by Denise is not great, but like any other workout video you have to do it a couple of times before you feel into the groove with it. I find her chatty style charming and motivating at first - but when I know the moves and can push and concetrate even harder by myself, I can block it out.BELIEVE ME, if you really do it right, you WILL see a difference in your backside and your legs..

GOOD LUCK AND SEE FOR YOURSELF."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! This is not real yoga","review":"This was one of my least favorite workouts of all time. If you are expecting yoga you will not get it from this DVD. She turns the basic yoga workout into an aerobic sequence with little to no instruction, no relaxation, time to move into poses or instructions on breathing. I worked up a sweat, but I could have easily injured myself if I hadn't modified the poses on my own. Also, the final workout is not possible without a stability ball so if you want to work your abs and you don't own a ball than you will get no help from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really yoga","review":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. Denise Austin is an aerobics guru, not a yogi. A friend recommended this to me, so I thought I would try it. I hated every minute of it. She runs through the yoga poses so fast that you don't have a chance to hold them. Once you get your body into a pose, she's on to the next one before you finish. There is no time to really figure out what yoga is and what it really feels like.I also got a good laugh out of the fact that she is following the camera at ALL times. She has to grin and stare at the camera the entire time. This is not a beauty contest; this is about the workout. And she never shuts up. There is a way to make yoga fun and still be truly yoga. This is not it.Thanks, Denise, but focus on aerobics and let the yoga experts handle the yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average woman","review":"I have a number of Denise's videos and while I find her voice and comments annoying ( I turn down the sound and put music on), I usually like her workouts. I have done yoga for 2 years and have run, biked and done strength-training all my life, so I'm in better shape than the average 40+ woman. I would NOT recommend these workouts for the average person. It moves too fast in places and too slow in others. If your balance isn't that of a gymnast, you will be falling over numerous times and struggling to figure out what the heck she's doing. I like to workout hard, but this is just not a well-designed workout. Crunch's Perfect Yoga Workout is much better, especially the Fat Burning Workout.Don't waste your money, if you can do this workout - you don't need it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to \\"Yog-aerobics\\"","review":"This is not \\"yoga\\" in the classical sense.

Third, if you are not in any kind of shape, it is HARD--too hard, and you can hurt yourself bad. If you must have it, WATCH this video while working with your Thighmaster set (or something) FIRST before actually working out with it.

She rushes through the movements (yes, it's supposed to be a \\"workout\\", but it's definitely hard to keep up the first few times). She is not nice to look at. But most importantly, I have never watched the whole DVD with the volume on - I just can't stand that raspy, over-enthused voice. Beginners should start elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPOSSIBLE","review":"I bought this without reading any reviews on it, which was a big mistake. I really hate this DVD. I am flexible, and I think that I am at least decent at yoga and balancing, but this video made me feel like a fool. I read another review that called this work out \\"an exercise in frusteration\\" and I couldn't agree more. The balancing stick series and warrior twisting/lunging made me want to commit suicide. Kidding. But honestly I have never been more annoyed by a work out DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yoga, and She's Irritating!","review":"This is not yoga. This is an aerobics routine with some yoga poses thrown in. There is zero attention paid to the importance of the breath, to getting in tune with your body, to the calming and focusing effects of yoga-- and thus, to everything that yoga is actually about. Instead, Ms. Austin has tailored some of her cardio routines so that she could slip in some yoga poses and market it as a yoga DVD. Worse yet, she provides no instruction on the poses and there is thus a high risk of injury. And, on top of the ridiculously un-yogic practice itself, the tape is backed with high-energy music and her constant, mindless yammering. There's not a moment of silence in this entire routine. The woman obviously has no idea of what yoga is about in the least, immediately evidenced by the cover which, appropriately, shows her in a yoga-like pose, not an actual one. Try Shiva Rea or Rodney Yee if you'd like to try a genuine yoga teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really yoga in the traditional definition","review":"Yoga ... quiet, relaxed, union of the mind and body - right?? Well, not this program. This is yoga on speed. Yes, the postures resemble yoga, but the pace and repetitions are enough to qualify as a hard aerobic workout. Maybe I should have tuned into the word \\"blasting\\" because blasted is what my body felt like after a couple of minutes trying to keep up with Ms Austin. If you are looking for a traditional yoga class, pass on this one. You'll find little peace in this workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to fast for yaoga","review":"I am NOT impressed with this workout at all! I have taken yoga classes before and I have a basic idea of what I am doing.. but this tape moves way to fast. I couldn't keep up. She jumps from one pose to the next so quickly.

She may talk a little much but this DVD is great!! I am in between beginner and intermediate level and this dvd is challenging and effective. It is split up into three sections which is nice so if you dont have time to do the whole thing, doing one or two sections will still give you a good workout. The first segment is my favorite because I love sun salutations and the moves she demonstrates really warms up the body and tones your legs and butt!! I have been doing this for about two and a half weeks and notice my legs and arms are tighter.

My arms are toned, my legs are toned and I finally have a well defined back side! I would whole heartedly recommend this workout.

If there were 0 stars I would have selected that","review":"I suppose Denise Austin is tying to exploit the popularity of yoga. But, even the picture on the box is not a yoga pose (but it looks simmilar to one and maybe the uninitiated might not know the difference). If you are just starting out there are lots of good beginner level tapes out there (but this is not one of them).

Instead she keeps telling you \\"You can do it, you can get fit through yoga.\\" And, \\"I'm so proud of you, you're getting fit through yoga.\\" And if that's not enough, she keeps flaring her eyes at the camera. Ugh.If you can put up with this though, I'm sure the \\"fat blasting\\" part will pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga with Denise","review":"I think this is one of her better videos.

It is one of my favorite videos but you already have to be in pretty good shape to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stretches AND works you out","review":"I am new to yoga but do aerobics nearly everyday. Denise has found a way to really combine yoga with a cardio workout. It is not a jarring workout like aerobics can be, but gets your heart rate up with fluid quick paced yoga moves. I am not able to do all of the yoga moves \\"fully\\", being new to yoga and not a very flexible person. After this workout I am SO stretched out, it feels wonderful!I looked at other yoga tapes and most have workouts that are 30-60 minutes. What I really like about Denise's program is that there is a 30 minute routine and two 15 minute routines, plus you can do as much or as little of the program as you want by selecting the chapters you want to do. This allows me to add on 15-30 minutes of yoga to my aerobics, great combination!I definitely recommend this tape. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rushed workout, but good nonetheless","review":"Unlike some of Denise Austin's other yoga dvds, this one moves rather quickly. At some points it feels more like rushing that working out, but it still gets your heart moving. If you're looking for a calming yoga workout this is not the dvd for you. This is a good mix of cardio and stretching, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a second try","review":"I didn't like the DVD the first time that I tried it, plus I was a Yoga beginner and got a little lost. However, I gave it a 2nd chance and now do it more than any of my other workout DVD's. I've been doing it for about 2 weeks, and feel results in my arms, back, and legs. Some of the poses are too advanced for me, but at least it's something for me to work up to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to reshape your body!","review":"My muscles look long and lean and I have taken on the physique of a dancer. My favorite part of this tape is that there are three different sections that can be done continuously or in different orders. Sometimes I do just the first section, sometimes all of the sections, and sometimes the last section. I would recommend this workout to people who are looking for an alternative to the traditional cardio workout or traditional yoga workout. Denise may be annoying to some but she sure motivates me! \\"So when you wave good bye, nothing jiggles!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I read the reviews here prior to buying!","review":"I am a dance teacher and have been dancing many years. I can follow routines easily, but similar to Denise's Pilates, it really doesn't give much instruction. You're forced to \\"follow the leader\\" and hopefully you know enough about body alignment not to hurt yourself.The routine in the first segment, while fun, moved too quickly to really ascertain where you are with placement, and very little instruction is given concerning placement, which is sad. You don't know if you're really doing these poses correctly or not, and with Pilates and Yoga, there is reason for good alignment, placement, so on. Otherwise you're not able to maximize what's really there.Denise should consider a preview/reference segment where things are better explained and positions could be practised prior to engaging in the full workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Truly Great 20th Century Music: Too Good To Ignore","review":"I'm not going to compare \\"Magic City\\" to other jazz albums of the 60's, because it deserves a wider audience than only Sun Ra fans or free jazz afficionados. This album is distinct and amazing even in Sun Ra's eccentric ouevre, and it is without peer. If you appreciate the myriad attempts of 20th Century composers to reach the musical outer limits, such as those of Webern, Berg, Stravinsky, Varese, Bartok, Messiaen, Boulez, Zappa, etc., this is an album you will want to hear. Its textures, sonorities, and extremes of mood, from humor to terror and dread, put it in the august company of every musician who has put a soundtrack to consciousness and creation, to science and synthesis, to form generating itself in pure music.

I realize that anyone would have a difficult time filling Jonathan Frid's shoes but when I watched this revival I found myself praying that he'd get staked! As for Barbara Steele, she's a good actress in her own right but her portrayal of Julia Hoffman didn't impress me. And I much prefer Lara Parker's Angelique to Lysette Anthony's.

When \\"Dark Shadows\\" producer and creator, Dan Curtis, revised the gothic horror classic in 1990 / 1991, he employed first class production standards and a bevy of wonderful and diverse actors,such as Ben Cross and Joanna Going, to play the parts of the tragic Collins family of Collinsport, Maine. The result is that the 13 episodes were wonderful, but couldn't survive the Friday night time slot opposite the 1991 Gulf War. Thus, the series ends abruptly, but it doesn't take away from this dark, brooding and sexy tale of 200 year old vampire, Barnabas Collins. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the gothic horrow genre or who is a DS fan. Also check out Dan Curtis's 1976 version of \\"Dracula\\" staring Jack Palance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the show, but not this DVD set...","review":"I was delighted to hear that this \\"remake\\" of Dark shadows was coming to DVD, though irritated to discover that it is a \\"cropped\\" version for 16:9 widescreen TVs.

Narrated in a droning monotone voice by a playwrite/director the movie is about her attempts to direct and also re-write a boring and amateurish play which is in rehearsals. The dialogue between the actors is slow and seemingly meaningless in this clunker and I wonder why as fine an actor as James Russo would take a role in it. I read that \\"The Letter\\" cost ten million to make and if so it makes the Obama bailout of Solyndra seem like the deal of the decade!

The second section is a repeat of the first. It also contains a break where Sam's young daughter takes over the narrative, babbling in her two-year way. Sam has abandoned the camera, which is allowed to run unattended, to answer someone's off-screen questions. If you wish to learn Shogi, seek out Hidetchi's videos on YouTube---they are wonderfully instructive."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the cusp of transition","review":"I love albums by performers who are in the midst of transitions. Think about the Beatles albums: Rubber Soul and Revolver. They were in the midst of the transiton that freed up their playing, yet they were still remained connected to their roots. That is what Angels and Nubians is like in the Sun Ra catalogue. It is suspended in the middle of a big change of direction from a tighter big band sound to free jazz. It is very complex in mood and is really groovy to boot. A great intro to Sun Ra."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic RA RA RA!","review":"This is one of my favorite Sun Ra releases. It covers so much ground, from swingin' big band nuggets to stretched-out, esoteric sketches, with all sorts of mummy-walking delights in between. Very recommended, even as a starting point for those curious about this Saturnian genius/trickster..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"Chin Deep In Bubbles is a fun read. The illustrations are terrific. Melissa's books make me want to brew a cup of tea and curl up next to a fire to read them. Highly recommend this book and all of Melissa's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood favorite","review":"This truly is a wonderful book. Although my son is only 19 months old, I am trying to locate a copy to someday share with him. He might not love it the way I have, but I will enjoy re-reading it with him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"White House Pantry Murder","review":"I enjoy all of Elliot Roosevelt's stories. The view into the personalities and workings of theRoosevelt White House and the history of the time is always a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible ending","review":"Its an honest look at lennon from this time- I dont think a non Yoko approved Biopic would be any better- its not like John is protrayed as some kind of saint. About the only odd thing is the complete absence of material from the making of Imagine. never the less if your interested in what was happening to this person at that time this is a good referance. 1 star because Im not into the whole star system but you Have to choose a number of stars to write a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-See Movie for Lennon Fans","review":"This is one of the most engaging and interesting documentaries of John Lennon I've seen. This A&E documentary explores Lennon and his wife Yoko's life in New York and his \\"lost weekend\\" in L.A. This is a great watch for anyone who loves Lennon, or even the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"LENNONYC","review":"I saw this doc on French TV and believed that I knew all about John.... but this film is amazing because it shows a more intimately vision of John and his life maintly before the Beatles. A very good item for Beatles' and John's fans..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her style is amazing...","review":"Being someone who doesn't understand any French other than au'revoir, my attraction to Arkana's work is purely based upon her music and voice quality. Both of which as whole are excellent. You can feel the passion and anger in the music through her unique rap style. I have however looked up a couple of her lyrics and a lot of it is really political. And as much as I love her single \\"La Rage,\\" I completely disagree with many of her views. But I guess thats the beauty of not knowing French, I can enjoy Arkana's music and can at the same time disregard her lyrics. (I have to say though, Arkana's lyrics completely break free of stereotypical \\"rap lyrics\\". They are thoughtful and well written-I just disagree with some tho.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Movie as SWEET VIOLENCE - This is DUBBED VERSION","review":"Kooky fun - I'm sure considered scandalous and decadent upon first release but now a kooky time capsule glimpse at what was considered shocking and depraved 40+ years ago. It is a much more realistic look at teens on break than the \\"beach\\" movies from the US starring Frankie Avalon. Keep in mind this is the EXACT SAME movie as SWEET VIOLENCE. Difference is SWEET ECSTASY is dubbed with a soft, 4:3 and haggard print while SWEET VIOLENCE is subtitled, widescreen and a pristine print. So, most film fanatics will prefer the SWEET VIOLENCE's transfer to DVD even though it's in French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more Elke","review":"If this movie was a recipe, I would say, add more Elke. Elke Sommer was arguably the most beautiful German woman ever, the most breathtaking for her time, when there were Sophia Loren, Bridgette Bardot, Inger Stevens, etc. That was heady company. If only the same standards pertained today.The movie is actually pedestrian. To be blunt, I got it because Elke was in it. The producers 'know the score', as the cover to the DVD features our favorite actress prominently. They know that you buy the disk for a glimpse of her or you don't buy the disk.If you are an ELke fan, you see her better in the film with Dean Martin--the Matt Helm series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"Sweet Ecstasy is the very same movie as named Sweet Violence.I wonder how same movie have different name."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],N={key:0},x={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=m("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-9f3b3913"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/47.md","filePath":"quotes/47.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/47.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
