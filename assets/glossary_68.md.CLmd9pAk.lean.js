I really enjoyed it (although some parts moved too slow). Anthony Hopkins is as on top as ever and he really delivered a great performance. Ryan Gosling also did a fantastic job and was very believable as a district attorney out to prove Hopkins guilty of shooting his wife.I found this gripping and engrossing and there were enough surprises in it to keep me guessing. While there was one or two predictable parts, the ending was great and I like the fact that we were left to do a little bit of wondering. I don't know that it's the kind of movie to go out and buy to watch over and over, but as a first time viewing and maybe once more after you've pieced it all together, I really recommend you at least see this once. Very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fracture","review":"I think Ryan Gossling has got such a talent, that any movie he is in is great, and to act with Anthony Hopkins, it is a must see movie. Your not wasting you time watching it, Especially if you are a Ryan Gossling fan, or Anthony Hopkins.It is a different kind of movie, and Anthony Hopkins always plays creepy very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELD MY ATTENTION","review":"Movie was very well done. You won't be bored. Gosling and Hopkins were surpurb, as usual. Nice twist in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never sure what will happen","review":"There's a few things that make this film one of the best of 2007:1. It is not predictable. You believe the film will end one way and then the twist gets you.2. Hopkins and Gosling do some great acting, especially together.3. The plot idea is fairly unique: A man kills his wife and is playing a chess game with the prosecuting attorney with confessions and evidence.I also liked the director's previous film \\"Frequency\\" so if you liked that, you may well like this, it is similar in genre.The only possible draw back is that it does seem to drag on a bit two-thirds the way into the movie. They could have cut out a few scenes there.All in all, great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Kind of Murder/Suspense Movie!","review":"I enjoyed watching this movie a lot as it had some twists and turns in it that I haven't seen in other movies.... this way you won't have figured out the ending before it happens!!In \\"Fracture\\", Anthony Hopkin's character attempts to kill his wife for having an affair with another man. It is no secret that he has attempted to kill his wife as he admits to shooting her to the police. He gets rid of nearly all the evidence, including the murder weapon.So, now the movie in turn, focuses on how the police and district attorney's office go about making a case for attempted murder. The case seems to be straight forward ENOUGH and SHOULD PROVE TO BE AN EASY TO PROVE..... BUT PROVES TO BE OTHERWISE! Watch Anthony Hopkin's character play cat and mouse with a young, hot shot attorney from the district attorney's office!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry","review":"This movie rolls along like molasses in January until it comes to one of the most ridiculous endings I have ever seen. The acting is simply terrible. Anthony Hopkins seems to be completely uninterested in his character. Although it would be difficult for any actor to give this walking piece of cardboard any real-life emotions. Ryan Gosling is a walking cliche. He has chosen to portray his character's inner turmoil with gestures, and funny facial expressions. The actual dialog he mutters is laughable both in content and delivery. Again, there is no depth.If you are looking for an interesting thriller which will keep you engaged and guessing until the end, this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Suspenseful, did not like the ending","review":"This movie was suspenseful and seemed to keep my attention on it but the ending just did not seem to fit well. Since in my opinion an ending can make or break a movie, it in my opinion it really broke this movie. I believe the extra features contain an alternative ending but it did not differ much from the original. I am not a big Anthony Hopkins fan but really played his role well here. Maybe a more appropriate ending could have made this movie really good. If you like movies with suspense then check-it out since some people might find the ending ok.Peter J. Miller"},{"rating":"1","title":"subtitles, please","review":"The script for this film was average, the photography was intrusive, and the lighting was at times absurd. The biggest drawback, however, was actor Ryan Gosling. He's either eating, rubbing his nose, or twitching and turning as he mumbles his lines. His leading lady was only slightly more articulate. Subtitles would have been helpful. Perhaps this shoddy acting could be called \\"post Brando.\\"Still, this movie has Anthony Hopkins and is (barely) worth watching. That it lacks a solid ending might contribute to the negative reviews so many have expressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fracture DVD","review":"I am completely happy with the price along with the condition of this like new DVD.

Enter Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), an assistant district attorney who is about to sign on with a major law firm and has agreed to prosecute this slam-dunk case on his way out the door. Obviously, things turn out to be less cut and dried than he thought.This mystery holds interest for a while, but the resolution reveals how contrived it all is. The success of the murder plot depends on something that couldn't be anticipated. Gosling is annoying in this role, doing most of his acting with his hands. Most of the attempts at humor fall flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"It's hard to know where to begin in describing this cliche-fest. Is the star Anthony Hopkins or the L.A. skyline? Is Ryan Gosling's agent the producer? The only high points were when Anthony Hopkins is on screen. The rest of the time we seem to be looking at Mr. Gosling's not very distinguished profile. Plot? Yes, there were a few highlights, but for the most part it was a snoozer. I was actually angry at this overhyped ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you like thrillers that keep you in suspense for the entire movie then you must see this movie.

Gosling plays a tough Deputy District Attorney assigned to prosecute a pathological killer (Hopkins) who has murdered his philandering wife. Gosling hopes to escape the DA's office to a high-salary position with a big law firm, when he is assigned this one last case. The film becomes a battle of two brilliant minds as Hopkins' well-laid scheme appears to thwart the DA's office and leave the prosecutor in disgrace. But events keep twisting, and more would be telling. This is one of the finest legal crime dramas that I have seen in many years, and it is extraordinarily excellent entertainment. By the way, the musical theme in this film is superb, and adds to the atmosphere and drama. I was rivetted at every turn, and I would recommend this film to anyone.

Dark Knight is the best of the three in my (and most people's) opinion. If you only have 3 hours to burn, just watch Dark Knight- you don't really NEED to know anything in this film, although it may clear up little details for you. If you have time to watch the whole series, I do recommend you watch this but I will say it is the least action packed of the three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it come in black?","review":"I purchased this in 2013, long after its release date.

Certain tracks have brilliant patterns of programming, they just stretch out to the point where it sickens you to hear it any more. You want it to go somewhere, but it just doesnt.

The turtle can't compare to the 7 sided Apothecary pill organizers for quality, convenience & ease of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little on the cheap side","review":"I like this pill planner mainly for it's shape. It's small enough that I can just stick it in my purse. Unfortunately, it's kind of cheaply made. When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you. You can't force it open any further because the tab will just break off, which is what happened to me. The plastic \\"hinge\\" of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic. It is not very pliable. So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off. I would have otherwise been happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I bought this for the compact shape, and my pills do fit, but not all of the compartments close snugly.

His nose is stuck onto his face, like a bird poo that splatted onto a dry pavement. His face is expressionless, as is his voice, his arms, and his legs. He is such a bad actor. Hilary is a good actress in this film, as is her step sisters, one of which was Gracie in the Nanny in the series. The step mother is so funny, especially when she ate the cookie and said 'so moist' hehehehehehe. I think that the movie was good, but chad really brought it down.

This film is neither. A number of reviewers on this site complained about the choice of Hilary Duff as Cinderella, but I would argue that none of the actors are at fault for this mess. The notion of Cinderella based in California has potential. The idea of searching for Cinderella with a cellphone instead of a glass slipper sounds hip. But this screenplay sadly goes from cliche to cliche. I would rather recommend Drew Barrymore's \\"Ever After\\" as the most recent remake of the Cinderella story well-worth watching.

Some others will say....why see it when you know the ending? Valid point, but you know the ending to the movie Miracle....everyone seemed to like that (I didnt), so that means nothing. Throughout the movie you find yourself getting closer and closer to Hillary Duff's character and by the end you are just engullfed in the plot.

They meet in person for the first time at their high school halloween costume party, with Cinderella wearing a mask. While making her midnight exit, Sam loses her cell phone. Of course Prince Charming doesn't realize that Cinderella is 'Diner girl' and sets out to find her.

Just a big disappointment.","review":"When I bought this I thought that it was STARRING Fantasia and Faith Evans. I was sooo wrong. Faith only shows up a few times, and Fantasia only twice. At the beginning and at the end. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The storyline was too confusing because there was just too much going on. Was this about good vs. evil, a good girl gone bad, a gangsta trying to influence the girls at the caberet club, a gay owner??? Everything was too hodge podged together with no clear meaning. On top of that, the girls who were supposed to be the caberet employees never did anything but catfight and sing half of a little tune. The backdrop could have been a beauty shop or just someone's backyard because there was no point of why they were at a caberet anyways. Just plain crazy and poorly put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"The cover of the video will get your attention.

I was pissed because I spent $2.39 to rent this mess. I wouldn't spend 25cents on this. Please ma'am or sir don't waste your time or money. You only see Fantasia and Faith two times maybe. The storyline was all over the place. The kittens weren't kittens they were more like bears. They were dressed poorly and some of the women in this was too big to be dresses like that. I was embrassed. I will give Nicci Gilbert credit she tried but just because you were an actor in a Tyler Perry play doesn't mean you are a playwright.

Being a playwright myself, this brings urban theater to shame. I bet after they were done with this they had to hide their faces because I'm sure friends and family bashed on them. The writer should take some more writing classes or just stick with Brownstone because as a playwright, they are considered a complete novice. Tata was a mess and whoever played Brandy never needs to act again.

You would think because there are at four excellent R&B singers (Fantasia, Faith Evans, Terrell Carter, Nicci Gilbert) are in the cast, it should have been at least entertained. This was a waste. There was no concept, plot, moral of the story, nothing. It was just a bunch of watered down drama that did not connect to anything. All the way to the end of the film, I was still trying to see the point! Whom ever has watched this film already feels like they got played, by being attracted to the cover thinking we was in for a treat, Instead u got a cheesy stage with some bad acting, pointless songs, and a miscellaneous plot. This was one film that should have been shelved. Do NOT play this movie to entertain any guests. They wont be your guests anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This DVD was a HUGE disappointment. They only used Faith Evans and Fantasia's names so people would buy it. Fantasia was only seen twice while Faith was seen about 3 times. They sang at the VERY beginning and at the VERY end. The acting was below average for the whole cast, the only memorable actress was the girl who played in Players Club. She wasn't good in Players club or in here. The person who wrote/directed/produced it is Nicki Gilbert from the 90's group Browstone. She has an excellent singing voice....but you wont hear it here.

The acting was terrible (all of the actors), the songs were too long, there were too many lags where nothing was going on.

Bert and his college chums sign on to a cargo ship for an around-the-world cruise.Bert is the radio operator...who does little radio operating. That disappointed me as I wanted to get a larger picture, in a fictional sense, of an operators duties in 1913. If you are looking for that sort of information, search for the memoirs of a real \\"sparks\\". They can be found on the web.However, there are thrills galore encountered around the 1913 globe by Bert and his buddies. And, some interesting observations and comments by a couple adults of the ship company, including the ship's surgeon. All from a 1913 point-of-view but still interesting and, some, still valid.My 5 rating stands in spite of the lack of radio adventure that the title would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting healthy","review":"I SEEM TO HAVE MORE ENERGY AND FEEL BETTERTHE PRODUCT HAS A GREAT TASTE EVEN THOUGHIT LOOKS AWFUL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel great now, but not at first....","review":"Love this product.

A wonderful diversity resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chunky tiles fit small hands perfectly","review":"Our other memory games look like a regular deck of standard playing cards printed on exceptionally thin paper. My 3 and 5 year old kids have a hard time grabbing the cards off of a tabletop to flip them, so after a dozen or so games, the cards are creased and frayed at the edges. Not a major concern, but an annoyance that slows down game play.The eeBoo game solves this problem using tiles of a completely different design: the faces are printed on pressed cardboard squares roughly 2 inches wide and an eighth of an inch thick. The difference is striking: by shrinking the size and increasing the depth, the tiles are easily gripped by small hands. Games moves faster and the tiles hold their shape over time.And I can confirm what most of the other reviews have made clear: the faces are cute and encourage curious minds to expand their geographic horizons. Guaranteed smiles the first time a new face is flipped over. Great family fun for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multicultural joy for a changing face of the US","review":"I bought two. One for my son (2 1/2) and one for his friend's 3rd birthday party. So much better than the original memory game.

It also has just enough pieces to it, and they're very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"My view","review":"Our family loves all types of memory games, and this is the most attractive. The colorful stripes on the back are great, the pictures are good, the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying, and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box. My only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents.

Got it for my boyfriend who is a huge Terry Pratchett fan, and he enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesser Discworld, but still great fun, and better than most of what's out there.","review":"Another Discworld novel, this one a takeoff of (what else?) Faust, here depicted as a teenaged demon summoner who summons none other than Rincewind, the magician. As with The Colour of Magic, the Rincewind set is largely an excuse to jump to new and different places in Discworld; the explorations here are loosely tied to the three wishes made by Eric, but only tightly enough to allow Pratchett's usual gleeful anarchy and fun. The weakness of the Rincewind books (at least, the two I've read) is that they're missing the intricate plotting of Pratchett's best work, but while that makes them lesser achievements, I found it no less funny and entertaining than any of his work. Even if I didn't like anything else, the modern version of Hell was absolute hilarity to me. In other words: even lesser Discworld is still really fun stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, funny, clever","review":"This is the story of Eric Thursley, a young man with three small ambitions--he wants to rule the world, live forever, and secure the love of the most beautiful woman who ever lived. To achieve his goals, Eric attempts to summon a demon. Through a cosmic fluke, he gets Rincewind, Discworld's most incompetent wizard. Bound by the rules of the netherworld, Rincewind grants Eric's wishes, but not in the manner Eric expects. Over the course of the novel, Eric learns that there is only one thing worse than wanting something--actually getting it.Pratchett does some funny riffs here, putting a humorous spin on such classics as The Iliad and The Odyssey. Especially funny is the Tezuman tribe, who, like Mark Twain, have concluded that God is a malign thug. This pessimistic, sour bunch has a score to settle with their creator, and when Eric shows up claiming to be the big kahuna, chaos ensues. If you're looking for a quick read, that's funny, fast and clever, this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't worry-- the whole series isn't like this.","review":"Let's be frank. <i>Eric</i> is easily the least of the Discworld novels, both in length and in quality.Perhaps it's because Pratchett was trying to mimick the pessimistic style of his friend Douglas Adams (this is especially apparent when Rincewind and Eric meet the Creator of the universe). Perhaps it's because the \\"plot\\" is an incoherent series of wacky, madcap adventures. Perhaps it's because the main character is Rincewind, who despite his status as a fan favorite is less likeable than any other Discworld protagonist. Perhaps it's the lack of a strong villain to tie it all together. In any event, <i>Eric</i> manages to belittle Pratchett's powerful vision, turning what might have been a glimpse into the history of the Discworld into a cut-rate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.If you're a budding Pratchett fan, you'll have to read this sooner or later. Just don't expect it to approach the quality of <i>Feet of Clay</i> or <i>Soul Music</i>."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment....","review":"I picked up Eric, utterly delighted to be able to find a Pratchett (any Pratchett would have done, I thought) and 45 minutes later put it down with the heaviness of utter discouragement. Yeah, the jokes are there; the humor is there; but the plot (whups, didn't see one of those in there, sorry) was pitiful and so much more could have been done with Eric!!!! A lustful 13-yr old demonologist that happens to get successful? sheesh!C'mon, Terry--we all know you can do better than this.

Maybe magician:apprentice should be there too :"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dregs of Discworld","review":"I have enjoyed most of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books, so the very poor quality of this one came as quite a shock. _Eric_ has no real depth and includes no substantial development of Discworld or any of its inhabitants. Yes, there are occasional humorous elements, but they all feel like cheap rehashing of material from earlier in the series.I wouldn't exactly say that I disliked the book; it was more of a \\"null\\" experience that didn't make any noticable impression on me at all. That's far below par for Pratchett, and it makes reading the book a waste of time (even though it is mercifully short).In all honesty, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Even if you want to read the whole Discworld series, don't bother with _Eric_. Rincewind is back in the primary world, and the rest of the story is just filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adds nothing to the Faust story","review":"ERIC is one of the few total misfires in the Discworld series. In taking on the Faust story, Pratchett adds nothing to it, creating a forgettable, Faust-lite character in a teen aged Eric who thinks Rincewind (For reasons that stem fromSourcery) is the demon who will grant his wishes. Using the Faust template seems to be a natural for Pratchett but doesn't work in this book. The plot is wafer thin and the humor seems forced, often the problem when Rincewind is present in any capacity. When a series runs for awhile the quality can ebb and flow, this is definitely an ebb tide book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Whether you're interested in 2D or 3D, Preston Blair is an excellent source for animation principles.

Two tracks that are aight are Can I Live and Close Your Eyes, but in order to really feel them you gots to play it loud.

It's a total disappointment, he rambles and screams to the point where it's not longer music but just chaotic noise!!He recently said on the video show \\" 106 & park\\" that he would \\"beat\\" any R & B male singer that crossed his path.Sisqo, sit down and shut up because you are no match for the likes of Gerald Levert, D'Angelo, Dave Hollister, or even new-comer Jaheim for that matter, and the list goes on and on.Personally, I think we gave him too much credit with the first CD.

If you don't believe me, turn on the radio and see how many times they play Jagged Edge's \\"Where's The Party At\\" and 112 \\"Peaches and Cream\\".These dance R&B songs are ok every now and then, but Dru Hill, and Sisqo as a solo artist, have potential to be such great soulful artist, and now it seems as he's bought into the hype of all this new stuff, and he's lost his roots.

To my surprise, only one tray showed up to my door.

At least the company worked with me though. Good customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have changed something...","review":"I have had my ScoopFree litter box for several years and have used these trays almost the entire time. My local pet store carried an aftermarket brand for a while, but has since switched back to this brand. The company has obviously changed something recently. I have two cats, and one tray used to last me around two weeks. Now, the smell is unbearable after just a couple of days. The cardboard trays gets soaked through with urine so you'll have to make sure you put a plastic bag underneath. Even with that, the bag gets covered in urine and it seeps under the bottom of the litter box and just makes the entire thing disgusting.In the past I would have given them 4 or 5 stars, but there is no justifying the price given such a huge decrease in quality. Honestly, it is so bad now I wouldn't use this if they were free. I live with a roommate and have to keep the litter box in the closet in my bedroom. The smell is just... horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"way better than the refills avail. in stores.","review":"Over the past year or so, the local pet store (PET Smart) stopped carrying the true ScoopFree Refill Trays, and started carrying a compatible tray.

Or maybe it was just never meant for 2 large maincoons.6 months later, we bought a large $20 litterbox that we just shovel manually.to summarize, when it worked, it was great, but when it stopped working, it was just money down the toilet so t speak.

Now I need to change it every week. If I wait two weeks, the entire box is soaked through.The cardboard is thinner now that it used to be.

By the end of 7 days, the cardboard liner is soaked, and the box smells VERY bad.After my local pet store ran out of refills (they said there was a production issue and were out for 2 MONTHS!!!), I switched to the Forever Litter Tray.I would suggest buying the Forever Litter Tray that is sold here on Amazon. It is pretty much the same thing, but much cheaper in the long run. It is made of plastic, so you can empty it, hose it off, and refill it.

Today I received an email stating that I am being charged for the product I supposedly did not return (I did, and it's listed as such on my account).

The ScoopFree Trays are great, but the fulfillment process could not get the order straight even after two attempts.I have used the trays for over 5 years now and like the convenience and way the system works. I ordered the ScoopFree Litter Tray Refills with Premium Blue Crystals, Pack of 6 and the order came with only one tray. I thought this was a simple mistake, so I went through the inconvenient process of returning the original order and submitted a second order. The second order came again with only one of the pack of six trays that I ordered. To compound the frustration, there is no efficient way to return an order that was messed up, no chat or phone number or other way to communicate the problem to a human. A single tray costs only $15, not $89."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Part of Scoop Free System / A Bit Pricey","review":"While these are quite expensive, I felt that Amazon had the best price on the 6 Pack. With one cat I was getting about a months worth of use from each tray. Now with two cats, I get two to two and a half weeks per tray. I fell that they are just a little stingy with the crystals. I keep a bag of extra crystal litter handy to top off, especially as the cats walk off a bit of the litter.The whole Scoop Free System is great. Using the Trays is easy and quick. The only awkward part of use is getting top of the tray, which is stored under it while in use, off the bottom of the full used tray to put it on the top for disposal. I suppose one could keep the top stored instead of putting it under the tray. But, then the user would not have that added security layer of cardboard under the tray during use. I give 4 stars, instead of 5, due to the expense of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than conventional litter!","review":"Finally, someone has revolutionized cat litter! We use this in conjunction with the electronic litter box. Results are far less messy, minimal odor (I have 2 cats, so maybe there would be zero odor if I only had 1), and it lasts for a solid week. Really so much easier and much friendlier to the cats! Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ScoopFree Litter Tray refills","review":"ScoopFree has been a great product. The cats took to it immediately and even when I have had to relocate the ScoopFree Litter Box there was no problem. Initially I got a good price on the refills from the pet store, but when a new manager came the refill price went up about 30%. Buying thru Amazon.com saves me about 25% on the refill price.

Absolutely no odor until it's time to change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"System not too bad","review":"Not a bad product. It works better than standard litter boxes. True, the unit and the cartridges are somewhat pricey, but it does the job. I have three cats and have had some trouble with one of the cats not wanting to use it at all. Also, I did have my entire unit fail but the company was prompt in replacing it via snail mail after I call the 1-800 number. Be careful cleaning the unit and don't get water inside the electronic components because its NOT sealed. The cartridges are very convenient"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for one or two cats","review":"It is a bit of a process to get your cat used to using the new litter. And because this type of litter is unpleasantly scented, I don't use it. I use the generic litter from Target. The crystal litter is much, much better at not tracking then the scoopable or clay litter. It is very convienent, but when I took in a cat to foster (bringing my count up to 3), I had to change it every 5 days. And that's with a second litter box upstairs. It was just too expensive with 3 cats. I still have all the stuff, when I find a home for the foster cat (wish me luck!), I'll start using it again. It would be nice if they just sold the pan without the litter at a lower cost. I did find a reusable one online, but that really defeats the purpose of just being able to dump the whole thing. You do need a larger than normal trashbag that is pretty strong, it tears through the regular ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best litter for killing that urine smell","review":"This litter will solve your urine smell issues, it works great. It works just as good with the number 2. I was amazed. I wish they made these crystals for normal litter boxes. The only things that aren't so great are the cost and they way the blue turns to yellow after about 10 days. But I will say it fights the odors for 30 days (recommended replacement time) with 1 cat and about 20 days with 2, regardless of the color.If you buy an auto-box buy the box that uses this litter. 100x's better than boxes that use normal litter."},{"rating":"2","title":"scoop free litter tray refills 6","review":"Very easy to change.

I have begun buying a large jug of Tidy cat crystals and when I notice the crystals yellowing I change out 1/2. It helps with the smell (almost none) and it only took the cats about a day to acclimate to it. If you realize it WILL be more costly; that you need to clean out the droppings from under the trap about every 7-10 days (for 2 cats); and cycle in more crystals in lieu of throwing out the box then it will be a wonderful present for you and your cat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.

Fast opening and solid locking. Inexpensive. Very light weight. Can be adjusted with regular allen wrenches.Cons: locking mechanism slides around when knife is closed (doesn't affect actual operation). Safety may be unnecessary.A little disappointed at first by the sort of cheap feel of the knife. Knife arrived with a bit of side-to-side play in the blade--which an allen wrench easily solved. Once I tightened everything up I felt better about it. The safety leaves some oil on the blade when engaged--but I have since removed the safety with no problems.Given it's low cost, light weight, sturdiness, and unobtrusive appearance/feel in the pocket this knife has replaced the kershaw leek and delica 4 as my every day carrying knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"EDC done right!","review":"As noted in other reviews, this knife is a superb EDC (every day carry) contender.With the deep carry pocket clip and featherweight 1.3 oz. you'll never feel it in your pocket but you'll always know you have capable and reliable knife on hand.Sharp enough to shave with out of the box, the Flash 1 blade is AUS 8 steel.

That's not its purpose. It is a small, sharp and lightweight blade that comes in handy for mundane everyday tasks. I've used mine to open mail, packages, cut cords, prep food, eliminate stray threads and sharpen pencils. Not exactly Rambo knife stuff, but I like the SOG knife because its very light and unobtrusive. It's not some obnoxious and heavy \\"tacticool\\" monster blade that will scare everyone and draw the attention of the constabulary, (Big knives have their place, but for the average urban warrior, they're not needed and probably violate workplace rules and local laws!) And the SOG is so light that you forget it's in your pocket. Be careful you don't lose it. (I did.) Don't use the pocket clip.

I say small because it is...small in feel and very light. I will probably not carry this as my EDC knife, but will carry it more when dressing up, such as business or more formal attire. It is very light in your pocket and conceals very well because of the pocket clip design. It is a little difficult to get out of your pocket because of this.It is very sharp out of the box.I find it a little difficult to open, not because of the design of the assisted opening but because the knife is so small in your hand. The lock release is also a little difficult to operate so to close the knife is a little difficult also, again due only to the small overall size of the knife.I wanted a small, easy to carry and conceal knife and that is exactly what this is. I may not consider this the best in a EDC knife, but it is an excellent knife for some occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great EDC","review":"Light enough for you to forget it is there, and holds an edge long enough to only need to sharpen it maybe every other week to every 3 weeks with extensive use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes everywhere with me","review":"I've had this knife for probably 3 or 4 years now.

I'm not rough with my knife, but it does get used.I really like the low-profile clip. It essentially looks like a pen when you have it in your pocket.

There is a lot of hype around this knife from SOG and many reviewers. Pros: lightweight, great clip, great deployment of blade. Cons: blade steel is shoddy for the price, lock up is terrible with lots of play up and down and side to side, questionable locking mechanism(this never failed but the unlock slider button feels flimsy), terrible ergonomics due to over complicated choil area. Bottom line is that this knife is an ok ultralight edc blade with a LOT of limitations for the price. Spyderco, kershaw have blades of similar size and price or cheaper and in my opinion are a lot better value and quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little EDC knife.","review":"I read lots of knife reviews before choosing this one. I will probably still get a Benchmade Mini-Griptillian for a heavier duty knife, but this SOG is great for having a light-duty knife that is hardly noticeable in the pocket. It took a while to get the right grip down for quick deployment of the blade with one hand, since it is small, but after a little practice, it feels natural. The clip allows the knife to ride low in the pocket, which was an important factor for me. After a month of use, I can say it is the perfect size for the small cutting jobs I carry a knife for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a fan","review":"I've been collecting blades for a bit, but do not write many reviews.

It is a historically significant EDC knife.Pros - blade design and lightweight Great pocket clip.Cons - feels cheap like a pack of tic tacs or a pez dispenser. I hate the safety. That can be glued. The locking mechanism is loose and clicks back and forth. The click drives me crazy. The unlock is also uncomfortable and feels cheap.I have no noticeable blade play out of box.For a value knife at THIS PRICE point- I like a Kershaw skyline - volt 2 - or OSO sweet.

Yes the blade is good quality. But the internal mechanism is very weak and possibly unreliable. Lots of play side to side AND up and down. Side too side play can be tightened with pivot screw, but loosens again requiring fairly frequent re-tightening. Some Youtubers who are blade experts say too apply Loc-tite blah blah blah. All well-and-good for experienced knife guys, but us every-day folk just want the knife to work properly. Particularly concerning is the up & down play which can not be adjusted, and speaks to the reliability of the lock-up. I have both Flash 1 and its bigger brother the Flash 2. The Flash 2 lock-up is much better. Considering its price, it should have a better lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great letter opener.","review":"My wife is a poet. She said it was a small knife.

I must say, this is the best knife I've ever owned. The assisted opening is a lot of fun to play with and always opens smoothly. The steel is high quality and is fixed firmly when opened. The edge comes razor sharp and goes through paper, packages, and those annoying plastic bubble packages with ease.Best of all, it's extremely light and clips firmly and discretely in place. I love showing this knife off to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Flash 2 now has a little brother.","review":"I was so pleased with the Flash 2 in camo (just to be different from the normal black), I picked up the Flash 1 so it would have a little brother.It is just as well made as the Flash 2, but much smaller and lighter. Really a near perfect little utility knife. The price is probably a tad high for what you get, but you could do far worse.Watch Nutnfancy's video and you will see what you need to know to decide if this little guy is for you. Note: Nutnfancy has a number of informative knife reviews on YouTube if you want to check out other options. Just search for \\"Nutnfancy\\" or \\"Nutnfancy Project\\".I agree with others that the safety is more annoyance than a plus option. But the 1 and 2 are really utility knives vs. defense knives, so if it does happen to slip ON, it really is not a huge problem. You can still work the safety and open the knife with one hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice little knife but some quality issues","review":"I purchased this knife for a small EDC role. I like the size and the fact it is so lightweight. It also has a great pocket clip that allows the knife to ride deep in your pocket. That said, I returned it because the arc lock (main lock) was so loose it rattled a ridiculous amount. It also rattled when the blade was deployed although not nearly as much. I have read where other people have had this issue as well. I will probably buy a Buck Vantage Select Small or Ka-Bar Mini Dozier instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small and Awkward","review":"I found using the thumb stud on this knife too awkward and too difficult to use. For me, this knife is too small to have a thumb stud. I prefer the Kershaw OD2. The OD2 is similar in size, but is much easier to deploy the blade, and actually fun. A knife this small needs some sort of flipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose!","review":"A nice knife. The pocket clip is on the wrong end for the knife to come out of the pocket \\"at the ready\\". It comes out of the pocket, then has to be flipped end for end before it is ready to be used. The blade launch type makes the \\"safety\\"a redundant feature. I've never felt the need to use it and it has never opened in my pocket. It is also a bit long to fit in the watch or coin pocket of some jeans. The blade has a dull finish, so when used to open taped cartons, the tape residue doesn't obviously smear all over the blade. I've had some knives with shiny blades that hold every bit of glue that they cut through. It is a good knife for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"So small","review":"I purchased this for work and there is no possible way I could use it for my job. Way too small!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp, but not well put together.","review":"I quickly found that the blade lock rattles around completely loose if the knife is closed. I also immediately noticed how 'cheap' the knife felt. After a couple weeks of carrying, the pocked clip became loose in an unusual manner, because the handle began to break. The blade is sharp, I've had no issues there. But this is not the knife that was recommended to me by Nutnfancy, and I'm going to call \\"counterfeit\\" on the product I received..."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a feather, Wootz Steel it isn't","review":"I have owned this knife for three weeks now. A great knife. The problems as pronounced by other reviewers herein might be considered numerous or major. I say, neither.The knife is well crafted--having a lifetime warranty to boot!--sharp, balanced, and rugged.For $12.00 SOG will sharpen the knife if returned to their factory.For the money any perceived problems are miniscule.The only problem I forsee is forgetting I have it in my pocket (due to the glass nylon handle constuction making it a light weight piece), and TSA will confiscate it depriving me of future enjoyment.A clip is provided for hasty access."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIDEO: GREAT LIGHTWEIGHT Daily Carry Knife!","review":"Length:: 9:18 MinsIn the field of daily carry knives, the SOG FLASH 1 is a fast, lightweight, well-built, and securely carried companion. I have many of these knives and have used them extensively for both duty and personal use. As my VIDEO shows, the FLASH 1's size is perfect as is the deep carry clip. Add its good quality AUS8 steel and most importantly it's feathery 1.2 oz weight (not 1.4 oz ike I said in video) and you have the near-perfect daily carry knife. For a knife you'll have on your person at ALL times to open packages, cut food, etc. it's my top recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little pocket knife!","review":"I bought both the Flash I and the Flash II. My reason for buying the knives was for a pocket knife to carry around day to day. With this goal in mind i sent back the Flash II.Size wise the Flash I is ideal. It's big enough to get the job done and with SOG's low profile clip it absolutely disappears in your pocket while remaining very accessible. The Flash II is still a great knife, but along with the added length it has added width as well. Flash II's added girth makes it a little too big for day to day carry.One last note: I found for a day to day knife the serrated edge versions of these knives is NOT the way to got. For hunting and other more extreme uses these serrations may come in handy but for cutting tape on packages and other such \\"office related\\" tasks they tend to get in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pocket Knife","review":"I've been using this SOG several months now and it's turned into my everyday knife. I love the assisted open on it. It's very durable, stays sharp (I think I've only sharpened it once - and that's after using it almost every day), and attaches perfectly to a pocket. It stays so well in a pocket, in fact, I forgot it was there and put my pants through a wash. The knife came out perfectly fine. :)I do agree with a couple other reviews about the safety being annoying (sometimes I try to open it, forgetting there's a lock) - but a drop of Guerrilla Glue keeps it open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting but no real story","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I was not impressed with this movie. I have wanted to see it since it's release as my sister say it and told me about it at that time. But somehow, I never got around to it, until now.I am a big Brad Dourif fan and I thought he did well with the material he was given. As did Beatty, Wright, etc.If you take this as a travelogue traveling thru the old south and just meeting different characters you would see then, then I guess you would enjoy this film. But if you're looking for a credible, interesting storyline, it's not here. Haven't read the book, so can't compare.Worth seeing for curiosity's sake, but don't think you'll find this too entertaining. And I hated the strange fellow following Hazel Motes around and just acting either strange or of very low intelligence. The music implied he was comic relief but I found his every appearance rather jolting and distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the greatest film adaptation of a literary work I've ever seen","review":"Arguably the greatest literary work I've ever seen adapted into a film. I love Flannery O'Connor's writing so much. I think about lines from her stories and walk around with a smile on my face. Nobody is better than Flannery O'Connor and John Houston is slavishly faithful (to his credit) to her vision. Watching this film is an excellent supplement to reading her novel. Another thing that totally rules about this Critereon re-issue: we get Flannery herself reading her great story \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" Love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flamboyant tale of hell and salvation!","review":"John Huston came back on track with this disturbing and cynical portrait of a man who wants to fund a Church without Christ.It wouldn't be the first attempt of Huston in this field because in the recent past -1972- he made \\"The life and times of Judge Roy Bean\\" where introduces the figure of a seriously ill minded preacher starred by Anthony Perkins.In fact, Huston joined two other great filmmakers like Luis Buñuel and Alejandro Jodorowski as hte most irreverent directors in this subject during the decade of the seventies.Flawless cast and agile work directoorial Huston makes this film a pleasant discovery in his opulent cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with HP Color Laserjet CP2025","review":"Despite reviewer/company info stating this memory should work with my new HP Color LaserJet CP2025, I had no success.

And they failed miserably. What they ultimately ended up doing instead was make a satire of the 1953 movie War of The Worlds. Of course this was not their intention. Their intention was to make a serious sci-fi movie.I know that there are a lot of people out there who hate this movie just as much as I do. My advice? Watch the 1953 War of the Worlds. My prediction is that the more you hate Independence Day, the more you will like War of the Worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"17 year old review","review":"17 years after the original release, I watched this film with my family again.

The music lives at the heightened level of emotion and the sound reflects a true opera-house balance. I consider Caballé, along with Callas, the best in records in the Elvira's role. Alfredo Kraus is simply perfect in the role of Arturo: there are better voices, like Pavarotti's for instance, but it's impossible to imagine a most perfect phrasing, line, and good taste in a bel canto singing. His \\"A te, o cara\\" is sublime. Manuguerra, in great voice and bel canto singing. Muti conducts the superb Philharmonia Orchestra with intelligence and passion. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great amount of interesting and helpful material.","review":"Found this book to be very helpful in preparing lectues for and introductory sociology course.

I especially enjoyed reading chaptes 6-8. My intention is to read as many of Mr. Sowell's books as possible. His writings are enhancing my understanding of not only economics; I am gaining advantageously an appreciable understanding on several socialistic topics too. I recommend this book for those interested in culture, race, history, and the causal factors, which brought about numerous conceptions ill-advisedly advancing and prompting numerous barriers, biases, and inequality world-wide. Additionally, this book awakens those of us who have been systematically acculturated or enculturated into believing or accepting conventional wisdom.

I though I would read race and culture after I read Thomas Sowell's Ethinic America which is another great book. Race and culture is good because it really deals a lot with how things like geographic conditions influence culture and econmic development. There are also things such a good history of slavery, broader then the history taught in our schools. The book goes into great depth about how immigrants have changed and been changed by moving to different parts of the world. The book also deals with how certain professions and cultural qualities stick with a group through time and how different ethnic/religous minorities have been treated through time. It really helps with understanding race on more of a global scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a RED poison frog.

Granted a body being dug up and a gravestone being vandalized is a bit of drama, but not a reason to fly home from Italy or halt everyone's life. It was slow reading and the character development was lacking, probably because there were too many characters. The relationship between Ginger and JJ wasn't realistic and even inappropriate at times. I kept waiting for everything to come together and for it all to make sense.

Contemplate the effect this would have on word processing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most frustrating keyboard ever","review":"I've had this keyboard / mouse combo for a couple of years and it has provided nothing but frustration. As so many others have pointed out, the bluetooth connection drops regularly, leaving you without a keyboard. For some reason the mouse seems a bit more reliable, but there are still times (~once every two weeks) where I have to plug in my usb mouse and use the onscreen keyboard to fiddle with the bluetooth connection wizard until it starts working again. Total waste of time. Stay away unless you enjoy screaming at your poor PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech MX 5000 and Laser Mouse","review":"NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!Have had excellent experience with Logitech in the past however, with this setup the keyboard has difficulty being recognized by the poorly written software program (Setpoint). Version 3.xx was shipped with the keyboard and when I upgraded to the latest version of Setpoint from the Logitech site, the mouse and keyboard could not be detected. Uninstall new version and reinstall old. Mouse and keyboard recognized. Reboot, only mouse recognized. Attempts to connect in vain. Uninstall and reinstall Setpoint(old version)keyboard and mouse recognized. Either the hardware is a problem or the software not well written.

Currently the keyboard will not reconnect after the computer restarts after going in standby. This has not always been the case, but there has always been some connection issue and it can be 10 minutes and numerous power cycles of the keyboard until it gets resolved. The hardware reliability has been poor too. The keyboard had a sticky key and they sent me a new keyboard and mouse. I was thrilled with the second mouse until it failed within a few weeks. I dislike having to recharge it every couple days, I preferred replacing batteries a couple times a year. The mouse does work great though and the keyboard has a neat calculator feature. The shortcut keys on the keyboard are nice too, although the volume and zoom control are not useful to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked like crap for me","review":"I hated this product.

This keyboard deserves a \\"0\\" star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for nothing Logitech","review":"Unlike many other reviewers I've actually been able to get the mouse and keyboard to work (probably because there's no more then 3 feet between the BT dongle and my desk) but I just can't get the SetPoint software to recognize that anything is there. And without SetPoint none of the extra keys work. In fact, without SetPoint functioning properly you can't even so much as adjust the mouse speed.Since Logitech's BT implementation can't even recognize it's own compontents it goes without saying it won't recognize anything else e.g. a bluetooth cell phone.Now, there may in fact be a simple solution to this problem. If you haunt Logitech's forums there's certainly many, many people with similar problems.... but nowhere on Logitech's site is there any recognition that a problem of this nature exists, let alone a solution.I'll give this another day or so before I return this... but there's no compensation for the hours of frustration spent struggling with Logitech's mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Connection Issues","review":"This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse. When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluetooth? Should be \\"White Fang\\"","review":"I concur with many other reviewers that this is a piece of garbage. The keyboard is the problem. I couldn't keep mine connected and the poor thing ended up in pieces on the floor of my office. I've gone back to a wired Keyboard and Laser Mouse from Microsoft. Plus Logitech loads utilities and tools that are always popping up on screen asking you if you want to upgrade. Nonsense. It's a keyboard for crying out loud. I want to type on it, not solve World Hunger. These manufacturers need to stay away from the volume controls and hot keys and make a keyboard that types like it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a lot more from Logitech - this Bluetooth is a complete joke.","review":"This keyboard is a joke. Constantly dropping its signal, taking too much time to recognize the signal and having to press the button after every boot up that is on the USB plugin stick, just to get started. A complete joke.

One of the main reasons I was looking for a new wireless set was because my old set had no wireless range. I have a media center computer that is attached to my HDTV in the living room. With the Logitech MX5000 Laser I can sit all the way across the 15' living room space and still use the mouse and keyboard without a problem. I've had other wireless keyboards and mice that have to be within 3 to 5 feet in order to work and that was useless to me. The fact that you can turn the mouse and keyboard off with a switch is very handy too. I went on a week's vacation recently and before I left I just flipped the switch on the back of the mouse and on the back of the keyboard and when I got back a week later and switched them back on they were still fully charged and ready to go. I would recommend this set to anyone who asks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unstable!!","review":"Its Bluetooth connection loses very often, once every half hour or so.

Installation instructions were overly simplistic and incomplete for today's environment of firewalls and realtime ad-ware detection software. Replacement shipment arrived promptly. Installation occurred without incident and both the mouse and keyboard connected without incident. The MX1000 laser mouse is terrific, but the keyboard has some issues. After the keyboard is idle for a period, it's like it has to \\"wake-up\\" when you begin typing. Not only is the display of the first key entered delayed, but most of the time this first keystroke is duplicated - enter 'A' as the first keystroke and frequently 'AA' is the input displayed. Hopefully, Logitech will issue a patch for this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Promise but too flakey","review":"I have been waiting for a bluetooth Logitech combo to use with my laptop/docking station.

The MX5000 does not work with my laptop Windows 2000, which I ultimately found on the box. So, I used it on my home XP system. It performed o.k., for a while. Within a couple of hours, it lost connection and was only recoverable by removing and replacing the USB dongle (transceiver) that came with it. This is unacceptable to me, so I am returning it.

The mouse displays an occasional \\"lock\\" where it will not move at all - which might be driver related as well.b) the mouse has a build-in battery pack, so if you forget to charge it, you're toast and will not be able to use the mouse until the battery is recharged (this will take a while).

With very little chord-playing, Green's string work sounds like doodling at first, but then slowly he draws you in, and you realize that Green was capable of deep and utterly unique interpretations. The three-piece band (guitar, bass, drums) is remarkably solid and retains a tight, intelligent groove throughout.

Gently lift the edges and the dried fruit pops right off into a container. One definitely needs more than 4 trays though. When there is a good sale on accessories, I will purchase at least 10 more trays and screens. Also, I found cleaning to be easy. The motor is in the lid, so there is no mess and it is easily cleaned.

I had a nesco dehydrator before, but is was smaller and less powerful, so I was happy to be able to upgrade to this model. I love the motor housing and fan at the top. My old one was at the bottom and was pretty hard to clean as you couldn't submerge it in water. With the power stuff at the top there is nothing dripping into it. That is a real advantage. I love that you can set the amount of time if you want to. No more getting up in the middle of the night because your fruit leather wasn't quite done when you went to bed. I ordered more trays and the fruit roll and screen accessories. I use this mostly for drying fruit, but am looking forward to trying some other things now that I have this nifty machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"just some comments","review":"This dehydrator is very easy to use and do. With the timer, you can sleep worry-free. It shuts the power off, but the digital light is still on for you to check or turne off. It dries food evenly. I like it as it really is a good machine. But when the fan is on, it's still very noisy. You need to leave it at a corner away from you.Oh, and in the package itself contains enough parts for you to work with. The addtional layers and filters, whatsoever is not worthy buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"I was SO looking forward to using this.

What a disappointment! When we dried prune plums from our trees, at a medium temperature, it melted the top two trays. The melted trays had to be tossed, and as I sit here and look at it, five of 12 trays warped enough to let air flow out the sides instead of all the way through the trays and out the bottom. I just dried some pie cherries from the freezer and due to the air flow, they came out very unevenly dried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super dehydrator","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas but before he took it home we tried to dehydrate just about everything. We did two batches of beef jerky. I am not of fan of beef jerky but this stuff turned out great and very very tasty. I will only eat the stuff that he makes!! We tried many fruits and veggies. Pretty much everything turned out great. We put whole garlic cloves in there they took forever to dry and they weren't worth it. We tried jalapenos, they dried nicely but the flavor and hotness intensified. Wasn't ready for that!!Highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gardenmaster 1000-watt","review":"I added this dehydrator to my approximately 12-year-old Nesco. The new one is digital and has a timer, visibly counting down the number of hours I've set. That's a very handy feature for me - taking the place of leaving myself a note for start and estimated finish times and then checking the time repeatedly so I'm sure to shut off the machine. I will continue to use the older model for low temperature herb drying.The only problem I have with this, as with the older model, is where to store it. But as my jars of dried vegetables and fruit build up on the shelves - food I will use this winter and beyond and won't have to purchase later at higher prices - I figure that's a small inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"recall","review":"I did not purchase this unit but feel obligated to post the information for the buyers.============================Food Dehydrator Recalled by NESCO American Harvest Due to Fire HazardDescription: The recalled product includes a base with stackable trays to place food.

His Perry Mason is not much like the TV/Hollywood version, and I think you'll enjoy the difference. This one is definitely rough around the edges and has more than a casual disregard for the letter of the law. He's more of a 'spirit of the law' type. I think Della Street was the character that I found most interesting. There was no doubt she was the glue to hold his rather shady practice together. They were an awesome team. The story line itself is kind of predictable, especially if you've enjoyed Perry in the past. But who cares? It's not 'literature'. Just a fun and velvety grabber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teeny earrings are teeny","review":"I purchased these earrings a few days ago, and when they say tiny, they are tiny !

They fit well, and I am not allergic to them. The only thing I would have liked is multiple purchases from Sabrina Silver would combine shipping, as she put both pairs I ordered into one tiny silver box. Hence the four stars versus five.

I got it out, and that product went back too, which is really unfortunate because I've listened to Betty's songs on Youtube, and I really wanted to own my own CD of her music - a clear, unscrambled version.

This is the best treatment for a wide audience since David Kahn's The Codebreakers, and contains much new material from documents declassified in the last decade. Budiansky is particularly good at explaining how the cryptanalysts actually worked, with excellent diagrams. He also explains how the early data-processing machines they used functioned--at the dawn of the computer era. As for the war itself, he sticks to the high points, such as Midway and the Battle of the Atlantic, but the military history is accurate.

Sonny's uncluttered, elegantly swinging style is always a pleasure, but the lack of competing solo instruments here (saxophones, trumpets, trombones, vibes, etc.) lets it stand out in all it's austere glory.

I also had no idea what was going to happen--the plot is entirely unpredictable. At one point a character shows up who I thought would be a major character for the rest of novel--and almost immediately gets his head cut off and eaten by zombies.

Hikaru Takabayashi seems determined to pursue wallflower status but fails miserably when her roommate at her new school turns out to be TV idol Izumi Kido. Hikaru was a nice change from the overly spunky heroines I've seen in manga lately. Izumi was a little more difficult to like (blackmail and intimidation seem to come so naturally to him)but by the end of the book you can understand him better. They don't really explain WHY he's dressing up as a female pop idol when he seems hot enough as a guy but maybe they'll get into that eventually. The plot is more light-hearted and less emotionally gripping than 'W Juliet' but it was a pleasurable read and I've already ordered the next book in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent performance, Unreliable","review":"The controller unit is unable to turn on/off the lamps consistently - sometimes it turns on, but not off, usually doesn't work at all.

Ultimately they will affect each and every one of us.David Lewis provides a thorough, comprehensive and incisive analysis of this very issue. His easy to read and in-depth analysis of the media reports and the political & religious background to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict is absorbing.Lewis supports his analysis through a range of thought-provoking interviews with a number of political figures who possess a vast knowledge of the historical and political core issues of the present unrest.Having read this book, one will forever examine our TV News and International Media reports with a fresh outlook. This book is of great assistance in achieving just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"7th of Never","review":"This book is absolutely correct. It is an accurate account of the Last War. Dr. Lewis is a fine Bible teacher. His books are Biblically accurate. He doesn't speculate or put his views into it. The Bible is the final authority.

That disc was produced and compiled by Alan Douglas, the true caretaker of the Hendrix recorded legacy. \\"Voodoo Soup\\" is as close to what Jimi would likely have released as we'll ever get again.

These songs really show the heart and soul of Jimi Hendrix as a thoughtful songwriter. As always, the guitar is wonderful and amazing; but there's something peaceful in even the most scorching of solos on this disc. Enjoy this wonderful collection of songs that illustrates Jimi's command of the blues and how he was able to stay true to it's roots or help it blossom into a rock 'n' roll explosion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Ok, so Jimi had a grand musical vision of a new style and direction. Nothing wrong with that. This can be a good sign, but not always. In my opinion, First Rays is unimpressive and over-hyped. Anyway, what stood out upon first listen was a sort of funkier and more homogenous quality to the songs, compared to much of his earlier material. Unfortunately, the music sounds UNINSPIRED AND EXTREMELY RUSHED. Out of the seventeen tracks, only two really stand out to any degree; the melodic ballad \\"Angel\\" and the powerful \\"Hey Baby(New Rising Sun)\\". Yet something is missing from even these two songs that I can't quite put my finger on. I don't really think the \\"unfinished\\" aspect of First Rays is the main problem with it. Perhaps something else was dominating Hendrix's mind during the sessions other than his music.(Not necessarily drugs either)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a total mess","review":"This is an incohesive mess. The songs hardly flow together at all. It is saved only by the strength of many of the songs. The best being - In From the Storm, Freedom, Angel, Ezy Ryder, Drifting, Hey baby(new rising sun), and Stepping Stone. Most of which appeared on Voodoo Soup which was a more cohesive collection and is now unfortunatly out of print. i gave this 4 stars because it's jimi freakin' hendrix and subtracting 1 star for occasional poor song choice and order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headed to a new, exciting path (unfortunately did not live long enough).","review":"The tracks display a vibrant Jimmi & band combining Rock, R & B in an exciting new direction.

His earlier work more than hinted at it; as did the man's essential nature.These songs are not new, although they remain \\"new\\" every time one listens to them. But apart from the well spoken of acomplishments Hendrix made by the time these were recorded, they remain an intregal part of our lives. These were the songs that helped define and lay the foundation for a uniquely American spirituality through musical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compiliation of Hendrix' last studio recordings","review":"Jimi was heading into a funkier direction to widen his audience and was very successful in this venture. It makes you think what type of music Jimi Hendrix would make if he were still alive.

On paper it looked to be better than the Canon kit lens.The image quality is nice although not outstanding. The real gripe I have is that the auto focus is nearly useless. Most of the time, the focus is off just enough that the photo is too soft to be usable. (By \\"soft\\", I mean \\"out of focus\\". I know the difference between soft and short DOF.)Occasionally (maybe 10% of the time) the AF will go into what I call \\"thrashing.\\" It will get near the correct focus and then it will jitter back and forth focusing just a bit close then too far, never settling on anything.

He does not combine them very smoothly. The book lurches as it goes from cosmology to religion. Wilkinson does a good job at describing physics in a readable way, but left me without any new ways of looking at things. I found the book Finding Darwin's God to be more personal and touching in describing that author's struggle to make sense of religious conflicts over biology instead of physics. That is a better book unless one is interested strictly in physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic cover art, isn't it?","review":"Don't buy this cheaped down version, the only thing that is the same is the visual, the music, voices and character names are completely different.

I'd give it zero stars if this form would let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally someone to read between King books...","review":"Mr. X was my first Straub book sans Stephen King. I didn't know what to expect of his 'solo' work. I have been fairly glued to a handful of authors (King, Rice, Lumley and Steven Baxter), and was hoping that, at the very least, Straub could be a distraction during the lull between releases from my favorites. Wow! I'm glad I gave him a chance! Creative,thought provoking, frightening,surprising...I look forward to reading his entire body of work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"X-pletive Horrible!","review":"This book truly is scary. Frighteningly dull characters and horrifyingly bland dialogue had me cowering under the covers. The author's juvenile pretensions are painfully evident in silly character names and quasi-elitist references. This isn't a problem if your name's Pynchon, but Straub? Sorry Peter, better luck next time. I hate not finishing books, but after this ordeal I must reconsider. The only thing that kept me going was the prospect of tearing the thing in half when I was done. I implore fellow readers to do the same for the greater good of the country. One star is one too many for this fetid mess, put it in the trash before it attracts flies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. X is disappointing","review":"I've read Mr. Straub's work over the years, & Mr. X is uneventful and not in the least bit suspensful. I gave the story a chance, as I was sitting in a hospital for a while. When I finished, I offered it to the trash bin. Koko, Throat, Ghost Story, & co-written Talisman were SO much better! I am a fan, and I do hope he will resume writing in the 'can't take your eyes away' style I have been accustomed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"A very disapointing book. It needs editing. The story line drags along to the point you want to skip pages just to get on with it. Some characters are interesting, such as Ned's aunts, but it's too little. If you want a page turner, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"One of Straub's major strengths as a writer is the quality of his characters and he continues to provide satisfaction in that regard with _Mr. X_. Unfortunately, this is where the satisfaction ends. The plot (as noted in the editorial reviews, based on an 'evil other' theme) is confused-- I don't need a no-brainer book, but in a horror book I shouldn't have to constantly jump back and forth to figure out what I just read either. The relationship between Ned and his (not) twin is unclear as is the nature of his powers. I agree with the reviewer who suggested Straub return to the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Start - Confusion - Unanswered Questions","review":"I am an avid reader - once engaged in a book, I follow through to the end.To start, the writer got my attention by unvieling a number of different paths the storyline could take by introducing many interesting characters. However, the author failed to round out their full story and place of significance in the book. Untimately, the writer leaves the reader hanging on the demnise of a few characters..void of closure.Mousie...alien, deformed child...what?? Does anyone really know what happened to Ned's brother? What was the significance of Ned recalling Star's moment in the auditorium throughout the book? Are the powers inherited or are they part of some alien personification?If you read this book, prepare for alot of unanswered questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just could not keep interested!","review":"Mr. X has been a disappointment. I was looking forward to spending some time engrossed in a multi plotted, richly characterized book, but found it boring and hard to keep track of characters. Most of the time I was a bit lost and as a result never had the drive to pick up the book to continue reading. I did get through it but just because I am anxious to move to another book. This book had unrealized potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!!!","review":"I was determined to finish this book. Eventhough, it was the most hard to follow, confusing and BORING book that I have ever read! It is definitely not a page turner. I was not thrilled, horrified or left in suspense. I kept on reading in the hope it would all come together and make sense. That never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started slow then fizzled out altogether","review":"This book was so dreadfully slow I could not finish it. Horror fiction should grab you. This story never did.A lot of family history with no substance or relevance. I also found the fact that every woman who meets whatshisface falls head over heels for him to be ridiculous. The H.P Lovecraft connection was stretching it. Readers would be better advised to try Lovecraft. Or for new horror fiction, try Douglas Clegg-he will grab you from the start and never let go, especially You Come When I Call You, or The Nightmare Chronicles. Lets face it, if we want superb writing technique(with no interesting story attached)we'll look elsewhere. When I buy a book like this I just want to be entertained. I liked other Straub books however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Straub misses the mark with this one.","review":"I have enjoyed Peter Straub's books for years, especially The Throat and Mystery. Mr.X is not in their league. It is too slowly paced and way too long. The conclusion concerning Ned and Robert is not well crafted. The Lovecraftian themes miss the mark and the horror aspects just aren't there. Every author has a stinker of book now and then, and Peter Straub has his."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-crement!","review":"I thought 'Mr. X' had promise, but it quickly degenerated into another dry, slow-moving, exercise in tedium. The sheer number of supporting characters, along with their cliched 'midwestern hick' behavior, their 'Waltons-esque' names, and the pointlessnes of the whole story, sapped all the excitement out of it. It's an unoriginal premise, done much better by King, Koontz, and nearly everyone else who has ever written about 'opposite sides' of our personalities. Read 'The Dark Half' or 'Mr. Murder' instead, and leave the 'schmaltzy scary small town' dramatics to TV soap operas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't wasted the money.","review":"Overlong, overloaded with extraneous subplots, utterly lacking in fantasy, magic OR horror, redundant and repetitious, I dragged myself through this one. Don't tell me it's subtle, either; it's not, it's just not very good. A good author on a bad outing. Reread KOKO instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A STRUGGLE TO READ - MR. X","review":"Although the section about the fathers boarding school did keep me attentive, the rest of the book dragged horribly. I expected so much better and kept forcing myself to pick it up and read on. The initial concept is excellent, however, bringing it to fruition seems to have been out of reach for Mr. Straub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent & Boring","review":"This book was a painful read. As another reader correctly observed, Straub tries too hard to show how clever he is and forgets to tell a compelling story. I quickly stopped caring about his quirky characters and their absurd lives. I used to enjoy Straub's work, particularly his very creepy \\"Shadowlands\\". However, \\"Mr. X\\" and \\"Koko\\" have annoyed me to such an extent that I sincerely doubt that I will ever read another Straub novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-important & pretentious","review":"It pains me to say anything bad about a Peter Straub book. I have been a fan for nearly 20 years. Koko still rates as one of my all time favorite reads, bar none. Mystery & The Throat were sorely disappointing, but Hellfire Club promised a return to form. A return to the horror genre by my favorite author...well, what more could I ask for? Much, in retrospect. Mr X contains more ponderous, pretentious prose than any Straub novel to date. Descriptions of places, persons, and situations drag on ad nauseum. Even the names of characters are distractingly silly. Do yourself a favor, skip this palid, self- important attempt at a modern addition to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and read the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring....","review":"I've read King and Barker for the last 15 years and enjoyed both a lot. I bought Mr. X based on King's \\"recommendation\\" on the front cover.....bad move. Unfortunately, Straub seems to like long, dragged out stories and incredibly short, small climaxes. I found the main, and sub-, storylines tedious, the climax (after 3/4 of the book) a major anti-climax and the context superficial. I would not recommend this book to anybody. Want to give thriller/horror a try? Go to Misery by King."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-crutiating !","review":"I have never not finished a book in my life until i had the misfortune of attemtpting to reach the end of MR X.

I went to the bookstore like most other Straub fans every week to see if Mr. X arrived. Told everyone I came across about it. The first day it came out I called people to read to them a little of the first couple of Chapters. But that was the only thing I liked about this book was the first one third. After that it was to long, to many names to keep track of, and just boring. Peter is a great writer but sometimes I think he tries to impress us with it to much. It's like you have to be an English professor to understand his true meaning of what he is writing. Well I don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Hardcore Straub fans should avoid this hackneyed drivel like the plague, lest they end up holding a grudge. Transparent plot and characters are balanced out by painfully insipid dialogue. The only reason I bothered finishing this bomb was because by the time I realized things weren't going to get any better I had invested too much time to quit. Get out while you can!

Ignore any reviews that praise this, they have been put there by the publisher or friends of Straub. This is the first book in my life I could not finish.

I have read other Peter Straub books and I can't imagine that this is the same writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off not read","review":"This is one of the worst outings Peter Straub has ever had as an author. An avid horror fan, I couldn't even get beyond the mid way point of the book. No plot development, slow to move and unsympathetic characters made me long for the turn of the page when I would discover what Mr. X was seeking. I was so bored with the book I didn't even bother to go to the end to find out what happened before putting the book on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franks and Beans","review":"Sometimes you can get tired of eating fine, rich foods. Sometimes you want to go slumming at the local greasy spoon and get back to the raw basics of middle American dining. With books it doesn't quite work that way. You never get tired of reading fine books which is why this franks and beans offering from Straub should be avoided at all costs. Disregard this warning at the risk of causing irreperable damage to your finer sensibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite a return to form","review":"About 100 pages too long and with a \\"Clive Barker ending\\" (which is not a true ending at all but a cheat) Mr. X disappoints. The start is truly interesting but by the time we get involved with a combination of Lovecraft and unexplained special powers you no longer care. I made it to the end because I found the beginning so gripping but I did not feel it was worth the effort. Straub has written much better books and they are well worth reading, but this and The Hellfire Club are misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again!","review":"This book confirms my earlier opinion that Peter Straub is a one-hit wonder. \\"Ghost Story\\" was the only book he ever wrote that I really liked. \\"Mr. X\\" had so much promise in the beginning, but Straub failed to deliver the goods. The Lovecraft connection was obvious right away to anyone who is familiar with that great author of his time. All in all, I felt too many loose ends were left dangling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I was disappointed with Mr. X. I thought Mr. X was going to be more of a thriller rather than an expose on a supernatural family. It was Lovecraftian, I'll give it that.

I actually listened to this as an audio book during my commute to work for a few days. As interesting as it seemed- I really had a hard time following - and I thought maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention listening. Thanks to the other reviews- I won't be buying the book to see what I missed out on.Don't get me wrong- all the characters are interesting and the small town very well depicted- it just got too convoluted in some parts for me and I love Peter Straub!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Padded, ponderous, pretentious, preposterous pulp.","review":"Straub seems to have reached the point where he or his publishers feel that every book MUST be big to be a bestseller. We are treated to lengthy descriptions of the frying of bacon and okra, serving no other point in the plot than to demonstrate that the protagonist's aunts are healthy eaters. You can almost sense him thinking, \\"Well, at least I'm filling pages!\\" The best scenes seem borrowed from MYSTERY, and nothing has the eerie resonance of his best work. A huge disappointment that never convinces for an instant. When I idly glanced at the next book in my stack (Graham Joyce's THE TOOTH FAIRY) and encountered economical, witty, sinewy prose, I knew I was never going to finish MR. X."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time","review":"Although I've been a fan of Straub's this book is NOT worth it. The storyline moves in too many directions.

My 8 year old daughter loves this set. It took her 15 minutes to put together. She really had to think of where to place the supports or the train tracks would fall down. A real thinking train set. I do not recommend this for young children since my 4 year old played with it for about 15 minutes and then it fell apart. She could not figure out how to fix it and walked away.

We gave this item to our 4 year-old son for Christmas, and he frequently includes it in his Thomas layouts. He spends many hours playing with his Thomas & Brio trains, including this roller coaster set. He loves both trains and roller coasters, so it is a great fit. My husband set it up for our son initially, but he can do it himself now and does not usually knock it over (although sometimes the cats do!). If it gets bumped and a portion of the track is no longer connected, he can easily fit it back together. Our son, who will be 5 soon, designs very elaborate layouts, sketching them on paper, and then he & his Dad go to work making his vision a reality!

It looks and sounds like a digital copy of a very old and worn out VHS bootleg! The soundtrack is unbelievably bad which, other than the spoken voices, has each sound being an echo of itself. And when the camera zooms, it's far too much, and it even jumps around, which makes certain scenes even more difficult to watch.As for the movie itself, it's a standard revenge story, but with a female revenge-seeker. The female actor does a decent job, given the sub-par choreography. But this version of it, likely a bootleg, is utterly horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement Cover for StreetPilot 2720","review":"I lost my StreetPilot cover (in a rental car, I think) and was surprised to find a reasonably priced replacement on Amazon.

While I was listening to it I actually thought it might be the result of 808 State getting stuck in a bad record contract (which is quite common) - that kind of thing results in a very good album (Exel), in which the songs were created in an atmosphere of creative freedom, being followed up by an incredibly bad album because of the bitterness of realizing you've gotten screwed.Surely you, like I, have noticed what I now call \\"The Amazon Effect.\\" This is where things get overly high reviews because fans are the only ones who bother to rate it.

Some of the practices the author describes are exciting to think about adopting. I am especially grateful to note that these practices are rooted in Christian tradition rather than church-marketing strategies. The greatest danger to mainline denominations today is striving to increase membership at the cost of faithfulness to the Gospel. The things that bring crowds into churches are not necessarily of God. Jesus wasn't popular in First Century Palestine, and faithfulness to the Gospel today can make Christians unpopular with those whose definition of Christianity has more to do with personal success and achievement than with compassion and sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachmaninoff is the best for relaxation","review":"Excellent selections.

The following is an excerpt from a report on Snopes: While Xylitol is safe for humans, it can be harmful to dogs. The compound doesn't affect glucose levels in people, but when ingested by dogs it can cause a dangerous surge of insulin. (In as little as 15 minutes, the blood sugar of a dog that has eaten gum containing Xylitol may register a marked drop in blood sugar.) At higher doses, Xylitol is believed toxic to the canine liver.If you think your dog has consumed sugarless gum or any other product containing Xylitol, call your veterinarian immediately.

The 1895 incident in rural Tipperary seems to distill all of the fin-de-siecle British Empire's obsession with darkness and horror at the margins of its own civilization, and the story in and of itself should make a rattling good read. Angela Bourke, however, seems utterly incapable of telling a good story: there is little narrative logic to her recounting of events and background historical materials, and she repeatedly refuses to make transitions between the micro-history of Cleary's death and the surrounding wider issues of the day. As a result, the fascinating implications of the murder and its aftermath (with respect to gender, nationality, sex and even race) are often ineptly presented, and the story itself becomes dull and uninvolving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost too boring to finish","review":"Unless you have a passion for Irish history, pass on this book. The review and jacket are enticing- a whole family arrested and tried for the murder of a young women whom they believe to be a fairy holds a lot of potential, but the book is a major disappointment. Not only is it more focused on Irish history than on the characters, even that is presented in a dull clinical manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is basically a school paper","review":"The story is 239 pages long. Upon turning page 239, to see what the rest of the book is about, you see Acknowledgments and Sources.

It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Unreadable","review":"This should have been a compelling story. Instead the reader has to piece the details of the crime together as the author goes off on endless tangents. These tangents are supposed to illustrate historical and folklorical Ireland. The crime surely could have been a very fascinating read if it weren't for the abundance of nonsense that overhwelms it. Some of the history and folklore is certainly relevant but there is much too much. I found myself skipping through stories of Oscar Wilde (?!) just to get to the next portion of the murder tale. This book is unclear and verbose at the same time. A decent true crime writer could very easily have made this incredible story into a readable account..even while including history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book With the Wrong Title","review":"\\"The Burning of Bridget Cleary\\" would more appropriately be titled \\"What Was Happening in Ireland when Bridget Cleary was Burned.\\" Don't the book expecting to read specifically about the injustice done to Bridget Cleary and the events that led up to it; this book talks more about Irish history and laws than it does about the actual burning. The story itself is just as hard to understand; the author will tell a small part of the story, then launch into 5 pages of history. By the time you reach the next part of the story, you've forgotten where you left off.This is a fantastic book to read if you want a look at late nineteenth century culture and government. If you're looking for the story of Bridget Cleary, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling...well told...very sad","review":"I heard about this book on National Public Radio and was instantly drawn into the story of a bright, talented young woman dying miserably at the hands of her distraught husband.The Irish have always been storytellers, and Angela Bourke lives up to her heritage.

Dr. Ferguson was one of the few physicians who followed up on his patients and discovered that the lobotomies were not correcting the situation.He became an alcoholic. Through the recovery process of his alcoholism, he decided to return to the area of psychophysiology, and learn ways around performing lobotomies.He was one of the first to discover that several of his patients were having mental problems because of vitamin deficiencies. He was also one of the first to use a new product called Ritalin (by Ciba) to correct catatonia...and it worked.It's because of pioneering men like Dr. Ferguson, that we have gone beyond the ice pick age of lobotomies, into the century of curing the mind through curing the body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven album","review":"Chico and Coolwadda - the album - is an uneven release.

The rest of the album is a mediocre affair with average production and beats. None of the other tracks stand out. Chico and Coolwadda should have stayed truer to their West Coast roots and had more g-funk tracks on their album since their flow fits best with the Warren G sounding production that is featured on Godzilla and High Cum Down.

They are very accurate and seem to be pretty tough. Black & Decker also created a convenient case to store them in -- a simple idea that goes a long way when you have to cart all the bits around with you. The case closes up tightly so no dust gets in, it's easy to open when you need bits, and it's organized so you can easily see each of the sizes. Black & Decker also did a good job covering the important sizes, going from 1/16\\" to 1/2\\".However, if you need to plunge into metal, you will probably want to get a different set. I have tried to use these bits for metal drilling, and I had a hell of a time keeping them straight to get started. Other than that, for regular, hobbyist drilling work, these are fine bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product....","review":"...probably one of the worst tool investments I've ever made.

The package promises great accuracy, but if you need to measure a room which is, say, 9'-4 3/8\\" wide, this laser tape will give adjust the measurement up or down (to 9'-4\\" in this case).

It seems to only be able to measure the distance to a very smooth surface that is at the right angle to bounce the light back to you. And the surface's color seems to disrupt the measurement as well. If all these conditions aren't met, you don't just get a false reading, you get nothing at all. The packaging says nothing about this. Not only did the device fail to work in the yard, it often failed indoors as well. I wanted this to work -- it seems like a great timesaver and kinda fun -- but I finally returned it.

It only measures up to the inch and cannot be used for exact measurement.

I bought this product thinking it would replace measuring tape. I was very wrong.

Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable. Not ready for prime time product.","review":"It seems amazing to me that this product was released for public consumption being as unreliable as it is, without proper testing/debugging. I tried using this device many times and the readings produced are consistently unreliable. Even at short or known distances (say 10 ft) the device produced readings that were unquestionably off. For instance, measuring a wall that is 10 feet away could give you a reading of 36 ft, and so on. Not only that, it's not just a matter a taking several reading and see which one comes up more frequently (to eliminate incorrect readings). Unfortunately, after taking 4 or 5 readings, you can get 4 or 5 measurements that are all significantly different! Don't waste your time (and sanity) on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"I understand that this tool is only for estimating, but even for that purpose it's unacceptable. Lots, maybe most of the time I simply get an \\"error\\" result; other times, on a distance I can visualize to be 10 or 12 feet, this device says \\"3 foot\\" or \\"3 foot 2 inch\\" (this seems to be a favorite false result, happens A LOT). Device won't work if you're close to a corner, won't work well on any irregular surface, and rounds to the nearest inch; no eighths, no quarters, nothing less than a full inch. All in all, I have no confidence in the results, and have switched back to a tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$","review":"I got this tool because I LOVE the laser level and it works so well - NOT so with the laser tape! I guess we need a little bit more technology before something like this can be very useful as a household tool. When its low on battery especially, it gives wacky numbers that are nothing close to the actual distance! It also doesn't work well if you have patterned wallpaper - it needs a solid surface! When it does work, it only measures to the closest inch - anyone who has done home repairs knows that isn't nearly close enough! An inch might as well be a mile! I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just Not Worth It!","review":"I had great expectations for this product but when I received it I realized it had major short falls. First of all it only displays in whole numbers. What about all those 1/8th, 1/4's etc. that are crucial to measurements. Secondly it only works when directed at very solid objects. Anything that can absorb sound waves will result in an inaccurate reading. I cannot think of any application where these shortfalls are acceptible. Don't buy this product. I in fact tried to return it and was told that since it was opened it was unreturnable. The suggestion was to try to sell it used. WHO WOULD BUY THIS JUNK?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's CRAP!","review":"Would give it 0 stars if I could. Yes it does measure but only to within an inch. i'm sorry but that isn't even close for making accurate cuts and if you cut short your really messed. Also it doesn't have a level bubble so if your not shooting real straight your length will be biased by the laser being out of level. Unless your only requirement is a \\"best guess\\" as to the length forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Inaccurate","review":"Never mind that the measurement readout only reads down to the nearest inch, the accuracy of this tape is simply mind-bogglingly bad.Examples: Several readings taken against a far wall varied from 14' to 22'. I repeatedly got an \\"exact\\" reading of 14' 8\\" on a wall over 20 feet away, even while varying the distance to the target by several feet! Closer in, I get a 2' 9\\" measurement on a target over 4 feet away.These are not occasional errors, they are continuous and render this 'tool' unusable.If the price were cheaper, this would make a great cat exerciser. Other than that, this product is completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T KNOW","review":"I have this item on order and have only used it in the store. Found it to be accurate enough for my purposes - sq footage for paint, wallpaper, flooring etc. I am having the most problem with Amazon's list price of $59.02.

They make it seem that you are getting a very good buy when in fact you are paying exactly what it sells for at any store."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising!","review":"The commercial shows a man measuring to a mesh trash can before chucking his old measuring tape! Wrong! There is no way the sonar would get an accurate reading to an object like that.This device is NOT a laser tape. It is a sonic tape measure (which have been around for years) with a laser pointer to highlight your target. This function is pointless because the \\"laser\\" tape must be aimed at a fairly large and solid object to get a reliable reading. It would be just as easy to aim without the laser.I guess Strait-Line thought they would cash in on the sales being made by adding lasers to products that don't need them (saws, drill press, etc.). A true laser tape with decent accuracy could have potentially been a great product at this price point."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF GARBAGE","review":"Excuse me, but calling this a piece of garbage gives garbage a bad name. When performing at its best, this tool is only accurate down to 1 inch. This renders it useless for anything other than estimating. And the tool is rarely at its best. Amazon should be ashamed to be carrying this tool and should reimburse anyone who bought one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a laser measure, it's sonic!","review":"The reason everyone is having such problems getting accurate results is that this isn't a laser measure at all. The laser is only a pointer to show where you're aiming, and as you know, you can get one of those at the dollar store. The measuring happens with the sonic clicker, essentially a sonar, which is extremely inaccurate. I keep mine around for difficult measurements that don't need to be perfect, like ceiling height. However, if you want a laser tape, you have to buy a REAL one. Leica's Distro is absolutely wonderful (I've done 600' measurements to within 1/4\\"), plus you can add a scope or put it on a tripod. They cost $300 and up, but they are well worth it to professionals. I hope to see consumer level units soon for under $100. I also hope someone stops Strait-Line from calling itself a laser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.

I have a 4ft 8in square window, which this \\"laser\\" tape repeatedly tells me is 2ft 10in x 4ft 10in. I measured it about 100 times to test th unit and it never gave me the horizontal reading correctly once, yet never made a mistake on the vertical one. Impossible to fathom how it could do that.

I use a measuring tape almost every day. I must conclude that anyone who found the performance of this product acceptable never checked to see if their measurements were correct or they are affiliated with the manufacturer. The only use this thing has is as a laser pointer. Upon checking the laser tape results I found it completely inaccurate most of the time. It was off by feet not inches, sometimes 4' sometimes 18'. I confirmed my experience with a colleague who got one for christmas like myself. These things are total garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive advertising","review":"This is not a \\"Laser Tape\\". It's an ultrasound distance estimator (based on the same wildly inaccurate echo technology used in those old Polaroid cameras) with a laser sight attached to it. And just like any ultrasound distance estimator, it's inaccurate to the point of being worthless. The laser is essentially a laser pointer slapped onto this contraption, apparently for no other purpose than to be able to print \\"LASER TAPE\\" on the packaging, misleading the unsuspecting customer into believing they were buying a laser tape. Not quite: it's an ultrasound \\"tape\\" with a laser attached to it. In other words, it's twenty bucks flushed down the toilet.Spend the money and get a proper tool such as the Stanley TLM11 FatMax. It's amazingly accurate and will really save you time and effort. Or, if you can't justify the expense, just stick to your old tape. You will get nothing but frustration from this \\"Strait-Line\\" piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"I am giving it two stars because it may be useful for rough estimates.

It is very wide in your hand and has sharp edges. The most frequently used buttons start to wear on you fingers as well.What I find is that the signal is fairly weak. So, you have to press each button multiple times and for a long time to get most devices to react well (and I have all Sony gear).The software did have a learning curve, but does work okay. The wizard that it takes you through is worthless. It needs you to fully define every button you may use in your lifetime upfront or it errors out and can not proceed. I finally added a bunch of fake information just to get around the stupid thing.

Unlike the Sony RM-VL900 I was hoping it would replace. It's too wide to fit comfortably in my hand and has sharp features on the edges which can be uncomfortable.Unlike other learning remotes, it REQUIRES the use of a computer to set up he remote and the provided software is a bit cumbersome requiring two clicks and a remote key press for each keycode to be custom learned.

Sometimes it works, but most of the time not. I may be able to spend some more time and tweak it to the point it may sort of work. It just doesn't have enough buttons to control all the features and options of the original remotes. I still have to pick up the original remote way too often. I does do the very basic operations of all the remotes I have programed.

I was expecting to hear some interviews from Louis Delgado and see some well detailed fights. Instead, all the DVD contains are few short clips from his early fights and a lengthy class that is filmed in his studio showing him teaching his black belt students. Not only does the image quality is somehow grainy and not very clear, the class is what the entire DVD is about basically (at least 97% of the DVD focus on that while the remaining 3% are just few clips of his fights).I am somehow disappointed because I did not know who Louis Delgado was before, and I still do not know who he really is and what he has become. It would have been nice to have included in the DVD interviews from the like of Joe Lewis or even Chuck Norris. I give it 2 stars because I think the DVD could have had more information on Louis, more interviews, and more in depth fights."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Dido","review":"Did is my favorite artist.

As for Dido, she seemed to prove it right out of the gate with her first record, and her handful of tracks including Thank You. Now, there is still no doubt about it. She seems to prove it all over again with her charming voice. Her song, White Flag, the first track from second record, Life For Rent, is a very haunting but simple ballad worth listening too. It just took myself by surprise when I heard it, and it just still keeps getting better. The upcoming diva has a lot more to get into, but she still has a good voice that matches her songs like White Flag. Truthfully, there is more in Dido's music than meets the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"Dido is awesome, but I would not pay $45 for a CD that only have 3 songs.

By the time I heard the first two measures, I realized I should not have opened the seal and removed the disk. Yep, too late to send it back now. Not to mention too mush hassle - get permission, repackage it, go to post office. Bummer. I had decided to get the whole set of Jazz Icons, but I wanted to be able to pick and choose at will.

From the mind of Basket Case creator Frank Henenlotter, Frankenhooker revolves around an ex-medical student (James Lorinz) who seeks to bring his fiance (Penthouse pet Patty Mullen) back from the dead after her untimely death via remote control lawnmower. What follows are some disgusting and hilarious moments, which still remain wonderfully enjoyable even all these years later. Synapse has done another fine job with this Blu-Ray release, featuring some great special features and a wonderfully restored picture. While Frankenhooker isn't for everyone, you won't find many films like it, which makes it all the more worthwhile for you to see if you've never experienced what Frankenhooker has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I have always enjoyed Trillin's books but with this one, he has not delivered his usual wit and advice.

I never buy soundtracks, but I loved the song \\"Goodnight Moon\\" in this movie, and bought the CD strictly for that. Overall the CD is very good, and right now it's spending alot of time in my CD player -- but I rated it down to 4 stars primarily for one reason.

I eagerly snapped up Vol. 2, and was very upset to find it paled in comparison to Volume 1. Vol. 2 features more of a Southwestern/Latino sound that seems more down tempo and much more reserved than the first soundtrack. I won't bother going thru the individual songs, because to be honest, they left so little of an impression I doubt I could tell you much. The only reason I gave this album any stars was for the fantastic bits of dialogue which are included and David Carridine's telling the Legend of Pei Mei which were enjoyable. But I wouldn't spend over $5 for this disk unless you are just such a huge fan of the movie you need something to tide you over until the DVD comes out. Or better yet, hopefully they will put out a double CD with both soundtracks as well as bonus cuts?!

However, one of the things I was looking forward to that I didn't find on the soundtrack would be Robert Rodrieguez's original score music.

Has the best of Morricone's Italian music for westerns with Clint Eastwood. Mixes all the cultures in that movie in music; Morricone; La Arena and the best horn, country music, great Mexican guitar music and singing, a bit of Cajun and some oriental along with some dialogue. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few things missing","review":"the kill bill 2 soundtrack is pretty good, but there are a few things missing. Most of the songs are good, but there could have been some more songs. For example, the song that plays during the longer trailer(its not even in the movie, does anyone know what it is) isnt on there, as well as the song during the training sequence. But there are great songs on there, like Malaguena Salerosa from the credits sequence and Urami Bushi from the end credits from volume 1 and 2.

The song when Miramax comes up is Silhouette of Doom and the one while Beatrix and her daughter are watching TV is \\"About Her\\" The One during the credits is Malaguena Salerosa. These are all on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introspective, character driven, like the film","review":"I bought this CD just for the tune \\"About Her\\", which is a smooth, stylish, contemporary nod to a classic track, just like this fantastic movie pays tribute to its inspirations. This tune, played during a pivotal sequence between The Bride and Bill, takes the action down a notch, adding a fresh dimension to the vengeance machine. The Ennio Morricone tracks are a bonus, especially for those raised on spaghetti westerns.True, it does not have all the variances that the Kill Bill Vol. 1 album has, but then they are two different films are they not? In the same way that one can regard Full Metal Jacket as one movie with two distinct halves, one should think the same of these Volumes. As such, the music reflects the unique vision of each piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Dirt","review":"The track where the Bride has escaped the coffin and is trudging along, dirt-covered, through the desert, is--I believe--Bernard Girard Christophe's \\"The Sunny Road to Salina.\\" The track was recognized by fans in some of the earlier trailers and an mp3 was posted at one of the Kill Bill sites I frequent.

Her first album was primarily R&B, but this one has a bit of variety, and it all sounds good. I like almost every track and Ive been listening to it ever since i bought it 2 weeks ago.

I really appreciated the reviews that pointed this deficit out, it's such a great show why would it not be put out intact? It is such a perfect piece of TV I can't see owning something less than what it originally was.One day perhaps this will be remedied in which case it will be well worth waiting for.I guess if you had not watched it at the time you might think you still have something special and indeed the stories and characters are great, but if you bought say a DVD set of the Prisoner series and the music was dubbed with synths instead of it's orchestral score you'd feel cheated, the music was an integral emotional character of NE and any substitution is a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved this show!!! The 1 star is for the DVD release and not for the show itself. I, like so many others, hate it when a much loved television show or movie is released without the original music or concept. The companies that release these shows should know that in this day and time so many customers LOVE the music in shows enough that they have made song lists on their websites for fans to retrieve the names. Music can elevate a scene so much and bring forth so much more emotion from the viewer. Why would the original music not be on the DVDs. Don't release movies or television series unless you can do so in a way to preserve what the fans loved about the show enough to want to purchase it.

Since the music was so much a part of the series and so incredibly descriptive of the story line, to think it could be replaced is insane.Reviewers who give the new versions top marks either have not seen the original series with the original music, or they don't remember how much an integral part it played.Sorry, folks... until they have the original series with the original music, my money's staying in my wallet.I'm lucky to be able to record the series, or at least a good part of it, on my DVR in the original versions AND no commercials!!

How can the people at Universal compromise such a great series by ripping out the original music? I don't care how much the rights would have cost to include the original soundtrack. The person or persons involved in the decision to butcher this series and not include the original music should be blacklisted from this industry. I couldn't be more disappointed if the publishers for one reason or another decided to cut an episode or two from each season. I will never buy this version of the series.

I won't even give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Complete Series Collection?","review":"This appears not to be the same Complete Series Collection that has been marketed in recent years in a faux moosehide bag containing individually sleeved DVDs.Rather, this seems to be simply a collection of the individual season sets, which themselves are available separately.If so, then the two shortened early seasons appear together in the red set, with each subsequent set containing one full season each. Thus six seasons in five individually packaged sets.There should be somewhat more bonus material on these discs than on the discs in the moosehide bag. The substitution of royalty free music tracks for many of the songs from the episodes as broadcast remains an issue (that apparently never will go away).I have ordered this set today and will confirm its composition after I receive delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"I titled this \\"incomprehensible\\" because that's how I feel about this series without the original soundtrack. True fans of Northern Exposure understand that the music was as instrumental (no pun intended) to the success of this smart snappy series as any one of the human characters.

It's been butchered for a quick buck. Only season one has the original music, as is well documented. It's such a shame to ruin what is one of TV's finest and most original shows.Do yourself a favor and skip buying this set. I was able to obtain/bootleg all of the episodes on DVD, which I felt I had no choice in doing (I'd rather buy a factory set), recorded from Canadian TV (which, by the way, even has more footage in some of the episodes than the syndicated U.S. broadcasts). This way it's intact, the way it was intended, with the original soundtrack---not the pusillanimous generic elevator music that the studio hastily replaced it with in the DVDs. It's just not the same show without the original soundtrack.A faux-suede satchel or fake parka case doesn't come close to making up for compromising the artistic integrity of Northern Exposure. Sorry Universal, but you aren't getting one red cent from me until you get this right."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Great show but it needs the original music.

Perhaps with enough negative publicity, the studios may take notice and do a proper release.Purchasing the full series would be a no-brainer if it were fully intact, but many fans I've spoken to are choosing to not buy, or in some cases, purchasing bootlegged DVDs of the show as aired because they are truer to the show than the official DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUBBED MUSIC A RIP OFF","review":"It is absolutely infuriating that this is not released as aired, original music intact. There are MANY fans that have waited years for this complete release, and now to find that they've cheaped out. I don't care about the cost...have a cheap version for those that can't afford it, and the true version for those who are willing to pay the difference. Just nuts. Any fan, not just purists, will tell you that the music in the show was instrumental to every episode.

Since the music was such a central character in the show, this is a real butcher-job, changing the feel and meaning of the show.I understand that it's expensive to get the rights to the music but don't understand why the producers would spend the money on tacky packaging instead of releasing the series in unmangled form.If this complete series DVD set has the original music restored then I will buy it. Otherwise I'll stick to the complete set of Hi-8 tapes that I recorded of the original broadcasts, and I will continue to be saddened that one of my favorite series is treated so shoddily. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the right music","review":"This was the greatest show ever made.

When I asked what they wanted to do, they didn't have any idea, since they hadn't been here previously. I sent them a copy of this DVD and all the work was done for me. Their whole family viewed it together (two parents, a six-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy) and they came to a consensus about what would appeal to all four. They felt less blind and anxious going into this trip, and all the attractions they chose pleased everyone (no hit-and-miss!). \\"Los Angeles: Everywhere All At Once\\" is a boon for out-of-town guests and it relieves the host of a lot of decision-making. This DVD would be an ideal first stop in planning a vacation in LA, even more so if you don't know anyone in the City of Angels.

The title \\"Lightning\\" has nothing to do with storms or electricity, and you don't learn its significance until abo0ut 265 pages in (and my copy is 312 pages long).

Instead hip hop plateau'd and today is not significantly better than it was 10 or even 15 years ago. When compared to hip hop today, Buhloone Mindstate is on another level. Pos puts together rhymes that are unbelievable. Dove and Mace are right there with him and the result is the best rhyme flow I've ever heard. \\"Breakadown\\" and \\"I Am I Be\\" are amazing. \\"3 Days Later\\", \\"En Focus\\", \\"Patti Duke\\", \\"Eye Patch\\", \\"Area\\", etc. are all tight. \\"Long Island Wildin\\" is hilarious. The disc is flat if you just pop it in and don't really pay attention. But when you do listen closely, the tracks keep getting better and better and you hear exactly how amazing De La is.

Though fictionalized, Going Deeper serves as a philosophy, explanation, guide, among many other purposes, relating to the varied idealisms available to thinkers wishing to explore them. The explnations and examples, discussions and information will send you traveling in thought through layers of time and reality as surely as it does Larry and his dog Zeus who seek a new understanding of their world and their place in it. Not a book to be read lightly, Going Deeper by talented author Jean-Claude Koven requires time to study its message. Recommended as an educational read for anyone wishing to explore this world more fully and perhaps finding doors to other realms as well. Guaranteed to make you think and look within yourself. Well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend reading this book","review":"Jean-Claude Kovan, Going DeeperMaybe my anticipation was too great or my expectations too high, but this book really bugged me.

It can't compete with the \\"message novels\\" of James Redfield (Celestine Prophecy series) or Ayn Rand. There are some inspirational concepts, to be sure, but they've already been written about (better) in the non-fiction works of Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, Eckhart Tolle, and others. I actually thought the glossary, odd to have in a work of \\"fiction,\\" was the most interesting part of the book.

This book is a joke. I am shocked others gave it as high of ratings as they did, maybe I am missing something but trust me you will definately want to look through this book before buying it otherwise you will likely be dissapointed as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book, especially for a teen in hard times!","review":"Very recently, two of my grandparents from opposite sides of the family passed away. I was saddened tremendously, and often isolated myself from school friends, sobbing all day long. One day my mom found a few copies of this book in the bookstore (she had been looking for a copy for her friend) and bought two, one to replace the one she had lost, and one to give to her friend. I read her copy and enjoyed it thoroughly; it changed my life forever. I can only give TDwA a solid five stars, as it is one of the greatest books ever written. It sheds light on nearly every aspect of life and death, relationships, and the history of the universe. Buy this book now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flag of our nation","review":"The story, Red, White and Blue: The Story of the American Flag, is a well written and interesting book. It reveiles facts one would never find out. A smart buy for anyone wishing to learn more about our counries past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red, White, and Blue","review":"My third grade class has been adopted by the local Veterans Home. The students presented the history of Flag Day in readings and Patriotic songs to the Veterans on that day. This book inspired the children to write their own history to present. Great piece of literature for little ones. Also,it brought an important piece of history to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo you whores, this sucks...","review":"It would make a great movie on it's own - but the fact its called \\"mean girls 2\\" makes you think it's a crappy remake rather than a proper movie; how on earth can you create a sequel with none of the original actors or plot? It's fab for a girls night in (I thoroughly enjoyed it), but bear in mind it has NOTHING to do with the actual \\"mean girls\\" film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The realistic truth","review":"When everyone heard about the Mean Girls sequel, our minds went to the worst possibilities. We expected it to be a cheesy knock-off of the first movie. Our thoughts were correct. It is unrepresentative of the classic that Mean Girl fans know and love.Unfortunately, that's the biggest issue with the movie: being unrelentlessly compared to the original. If we saw this movie as a completely different movie, it would be much better. But,it's impossible to not compare the Original and sequel. Our preconceived notions of what a Mean Girls movie needs makes us compare the movie to the original. Mean Girls 2 is an average movie that probably could have found its niche with a teenage audience, but it's instead forced into the \\"bad sequel\\" group. Whoever's idea it was to make this movie and add the MG2 title to make more money clearly didn't realize how bad of an idea it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't we seen this already?","review":"It's the same tired and overused plot once again. A mean group of girls in school terrorizes the main character. She wants revenge and, in getting her revenge, becomes just like the mean girls.We have the typical moment where her and her friends part ways, only to be reunited in the end with a happy ending.The story is old and over-used. Nothing new or exciting brought to the table here. Do these things ever happen in high school? I really doubt it.Seems like a Disney TV movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I bought this rather than rent it, as it didn't cost much more. Now I know why. The plot was kind of cute, but that's all that's good about it. The no-name cast didn't prove their mettle. Loved the first Mean Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"If I could give this negative stars I'd give it a negative 100. It doesn't even deserve stars. The lead girl is from stupid Disney channel and threw the whole movie she needed to wash her hair. The 3 \\"mean girls\\" we're awful, they dressed like 8 year olds and it was retarded that the one brought a dog to school. All the girls couldn't act for there lives. I can quote every line from the first movie because the first movie was pure genius, it was made to be funny. The second one was centered around bullying, that ruins the whole concept. At at the end where she's like \\"let's settle this like men, lets play football\\" that was the dumbest thing I've ever herd in my life. This movie sucked so bad and should be erased from history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Sequel","review":"I bought this movie not actually seeing it. BIG MISTAKE!I thought it was going to be a lot like the Lindsay Lohan 'Mean Girls' movie and appeal to people who were over the age of 14.I now see this is a movie for young girls between the ages of 10-14. It's got Jennifer Stone from \\"Wizards of Waverly Place\\", Meaghan Martin from \\"Camp Rock\\", Nicole Anderson from \\"Jonas\\", Claire Holt from \\"H2o: Just Add Water\\", Diego Boneta from \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Pretty Little Liars\\", Mairara Walsh from \\"Cory In The House\\" and \\"Desperate Housewives\\" -- So it has a few actors and actresses that are well known to a younger audience than myself.If you like the movie like \\"Camp Rock\\" then you are probably going to like this movie.If you are looking for a great sequel to the awesome Lindsay Lohan \\"Mean Girls\\" movie, I'm sorry to say but it will just lead to disappointment and regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"joke of a movie","review":"I saw this on tv and i stopped watching after 5 minutes. need i say more? dont waste your money on this"},{"rating":"2","title":"that was the best movie ever","review":"lol i put this a 5 stars its cute at the ending i loved it my favorite part is when jo kisses her boyfriend that i like lol i thought that was cute they make a such a good couple but anyways if anyone watching this movie your going to like it its awesome and kickback revenge girly punk rocker of all time ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrid sequel","review":"Jo is a transfer student who just wants a quiet school year before she's off to study architecture at Carnegie-Mellon University. She befriends rich but klutzy Abby, a target for the cliquy \\"plastics\\" led by chief mean girl Mandi. In a twist Abby's father pays Jo to befriend her, and Jo realizes that her new BFF is worth more than the cash. Soon a war between the plastics and well everyone else at the school breaks out. Will Jo come clean with Abby before her secret is revealed?With a d-list cast, bad writing, lots of overacting (never a good thing), and no real story to tell, this sequel is pretty awful. I still cannot believe that I sat through it, particularly when it was paired with the far superior original. Some sequels should just never get made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Ditto everything reviewer Tracy Vest wrote. My sentiments exactly. I couldn't make it through the entire movie without doing something in addition to watching the movie to distract me from its awfulness. So, though the movie was terrible, my dishes and laundry are now done.And: The only good thing about this movie is that it made me want to watch Mean Girls, the good one, not this poor (even for ABC Family) imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I please get back the time I spent watching this?","review":"This is awful. This doesn't even deserve to be called a film. Maiara Walsh and Jennifer Stone were horrendous in the Disney shows they originally acted in, but MY GOSH! Who knew there was anything worse than Cory in the House?This is horribly corny, unrealistic, and lame. The humor in the original Mean Girls is replaced with the timid use of two curse words and way too much slapstick. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamest Sequel EVER!","review":"I caught a glimpse of this film during its premiere on ABC Family, and I was just P.O.ed at the fact that this garbage that is Mean Girls II exists! Avoid this, buy the original 2004 film. It was awesome, and was Lindsay Lohan's 2nd to last film of her \\"former\\" career (her good career, ranging from 1998 to 2005). The original is also a prime example of how teens (no matter what gender) act."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lousy come back","review":"i didn't like this at all. the original was better. the characters were really lame compared to the first. i found it very boring. i didn't like it also because of the actors. they're new and inexperienced in movie making."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie = epic fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this movie stinks how did this movie get released its horrid pathetic boring lame and boring you want a real movie watch the first mean girls instead of this horrid sequel this movie = epic fail mean girls 2 actors and actresses = epic fail this movie is uber lame and uber boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another vomit review","review":"i liked the movie but the party scene wear maria walsh has big chunks of vomit all over herdress. that was gross. do not see it. seriously whats so funny wen some one gets puked on its gross. i hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg you not to waste your money on this!","review":"This movie is awful, plain and simple. If some fiber of your being urges you to watch this, rent it (it's even undeserving of that), or wait for it to come on ABC Family again. I love the first Mean Girls and I only watched this to see how bad it would be. I was right. Instead of wasting your money on this, go buy the first Mean Girls (again, even if you already have it) or go see that new 3D Justin Bieber movie (just stay away from this). That's how bad this movie is. The most anyone should watch this movie is once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Comprehensive","review":"This book is well worth reading and is truly breed specific,unlike a few of the other books available which are merely generic puppy pamphlets with a few specific breed pictures thrown in. Worse yet,they dedicate much of the space to filler material such as thinly cloaked advertisements for certain dog products. This book keeps clear from all of this and is 100% pure beef!! I wouldn't feed my pup filler material;why should you pay for and read \\"sawdust\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aussies are different and need a different book","review":"I have books on dog training and behavior but it wasn't until I read this book that I reallized I now owned something entirely different from my previous pets.

Couch potatoes get something else or suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Australian Shepherds (Barron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals)","review":"Disappointed, very general book.

I enjoyed Krause's writing of being in the wild and learning techniques to record sounds. He shares significant insights from his experiences. He writes as someone who has truly fallen in love with the wild and its music. He does not write as an unreasonable fanatic who exalts nature above souls, but he sees nature and the souls of humans as part of the God's creation and symbiotic. I appreciated his gentle, respectful tone throughout the book. His passion is conveyed in his writing and so is his sorrow over the destruction of so many of the environments where he recorded. This book really gave me a better understanding of the value and richness of nature, and the cd recordings can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have album for anyone of any music taste.","review":"I am not a ska fan, heck I don't even know what the word means but I love this album. As a musician myself, I was in awe of the talent and polished arrangements of Eastern Standard Time's covers and orignals. I caught myself whistling the melodies. \\"Richard Bruce\\" is my favorite track, but the whole album keeps your toes tappin' and wishin' a CD could hold more than 72 minutes. What you hear on this album more than anything is that this is a band. There are no slackers in this group. You don't hear the prevailing soloing of one lead musician like most groups today, but a confident blend of everyone's talent. Although you could buy the CD here, and I am sure EST would appreciate it, find out where these guys play and see them live. I bet they are even better in person. I know I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful garbage","review":"Another bomb from Lonely Planet. Incoherent, often wrong and poorly written.

However, the problem is the sayings are not parallel. They are not even contextually similar. The translation of the Injil (Bible) was dreadful. The Hadith and Koran require context. This reader was disappointed. A book such as this that is what it purports to be, would be of great value. In this day and age, we need to learn of the similarities between these two great world religions. This wasn't that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pro- muslim bias","review":"I strongly encourage you to read the excerpt pages before buying this book. If you look carefully, you will find many opinions snuck in as fact. These opinions are always slanted toward the Muslim side. For example, it calls the difference between the Koran's account of Jesus' birth and the Bible's, \\"inspired.\\" That is an opinion. This is not an objective comparision of the two religion's viewpoints. It is more positive toward the Muslim religion than the Christian one.

The first song just soothes you with its lightly swingin', but groovin' solos. The next tune, Plaza De Tores, is cool, and so are the rest. One factor I did not like of this album was that Elvin Jones didn't get any drum solos. When I first got this album, I didn't know who Sam Rivers was, and now, I still barely ever hear of him, but his contribution to this album is wonderful. This recording prooved that Young was a good songwriter and improviser. The group pulls it off well without a bass player too. Any jazz fan can't go wrong with this album. It is not free or Avant Garde, just swingin' jazz. I've yet to get Young's Unity album, and from what I've heard, it's different, but If Young plays the same, I'm sure to love it.

Rather, they are written \\"in the Chinese style\\" by an American who never even visited China. The Chinese civilization is both ancient and beautiful, with countless genuinely funny, entertaining, or informative folk tales of its own.

I found a computer program called, \\"My Way\\" which looked like it would work well. It did, but there was no feed-back in the system. So I invested [.....] in this little book by Robert Lichello. God bless you Robert Lichello. You have made my family millionaires, Plus. The plus is that now when the market tanks, we understand how to profit from the confusion. Robert, your writing style is corny, but your thinking is pretty darn close to brilliant. I would strongly encourage anyone serious about investing to read this book and then say a prayer for Robert's soul. He left the world a priceless gift before he left this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Misleading","review":"I had bought this book with the expectation of learning how to achieve high returns on investment, but was quite disappointed when I found out it was simply a book on financial planning!There is no magic strategy: the author just gives a strategy of monthly investing and managing risk. In the end I am sure you'll make a million dollars, but you'll be an old man by that time!The strategy in itself is not flawed, but it won't provide you with mega returns: (...)The writig style was a bit heavy to digest, many stories were not relevant and more importantly: where are the RESULTS?? I'd like to know how AIM performed in the past.Overall, a bit misleading, but the idea in itself is OK(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad strategy in an overly wordy book","review":"The author, who by the way IS NOT A MILLIONAIRE himself, writes that you should sell your holdings as the price rises and increase your holdings as the price declines. This does not make sense in the real world. If the stock is rising, you should hold onto your shares and sell them after the stock has peaked and is started to decline. If the price is going down, you should wait until it has bottomed out and is starting to show signs of a turnaround / recovery, otherwise you should not buy at all. For all you non-investors and beginners who rate this book high, I would suggest you apply his strategy and rate the book again. I will guarantee you will not give it more than 1 star, the lowest possible rating. If this strategy was so good, you would not need overpriced MBA mutual fund managers. Everyone would use AIM to manage their portfolios. But this is NOT happening in the real world. Because the technique does not work. Even the author says it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!!","review":"Not one reviewer ever mentioned the concept of historical back testing under many different economic scenarious. I would think it obvious that the way to find out if the formula AIM works is to test it with historical data. Granted that one would need a spreadsheet and formula to do the back testing. My results? I back tested under many different economic conditions using stocks and mutual funds, and Im not impressed. The Lichello AIM did not always do better than the buy-and-hold system and sometimes did worse and sometimes did better. It all depends on starting with the right stock at the right time, but once you have the right stock other systems will also do better. But don't take my word for it, do the back testing yourself before actually investing your hard earned money. About the writing? I loved it, but that does not mean his system will make money for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Million???","review":"One must ask if the system is so good why has the author not used it to make $1,000,000 then some more. Just beware that Dollar cost averaging can be very dangerous. If one is going to write the talk,, why not walk the talk??? Maybe the author makes more money writing and following other ventures?? Maybe some ideas are valid and worth thinking about, but much simpler and more effective systems are about just for the asking and a little hard work!!!

The AIM system for investment might be a good one, but its usefulness, especially compared to other systems, lies buried underneath too many words. It took a lot of patience to complete it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program, dated discussion","review":"I enjoyed this book. The material on how to handle your CASH reserves is out-of-date, though. You'll have to think about today's financial atmosphere and substitute alternative vehicles. However, the method of investing is still rock-solid. Buy low, sell high...automatically! Besides the dated material, the only other negative comment I'll offer is that the author does not go into details on how to handle purchases in your portofolio if your vehicles do not handle fractional shares. Even more, I missed how one handles purchases or sales that aren't exactly what A.I.M. recommends.I do give this book high marks because it is very readable and in today's world of computers, spreadsheets, and Internet access, A.I.M. can be handled very easily, more so than suggested in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense will tell you THIS DOESN'T WORK!!!!!","review":"The author's basic strategy is to sell stocks as their prices rise and buy as their prices fall. This does not make sense. Think about it. If the stock was rising, wouldn't it make more sense to hold onto it until it stopped rising before you sell???? If the stock was falling, why would you buy? Wouldn't it make more sense to stay out of the stock until it stops falling (you avoid buying bankrupt companies that way), and wait until the stock starts to rise again (to prove that it's not on its way to bankruptcy?). If you think what you just read makes sense, then DON'T BUY THE BOOK, because he tells you the exact opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won't work and I'll tell you why","review":"I quickly glanced at this in the bookstore, and here's what I noticed. All examples which back up the author's claim are for stocks that fluctuate perfectly between two fixed prices (10 down to 4, up to 10, down to 4, etc.) The problem is that if a stock were to actually go up over time (which historically is much more common), you'll get better better returns using a simple dollar cost averaging technique and never selling what you've previously bought. There's no way to know in advance which stocks will exhibit this perfectly cyclical nature over the long term, and the fact that all examples depend on this pattern should be pretty revealing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"95% CRAP/5% SUBSTANCE","review":"I just finished reading (forced myself) this book (04/02/99).

The author compounds the problem by writing in an overdramatic but boring and annoying style. He isn't a financial genius, that's for sure! He isn't much of an author either. The whole thing could have been very well covered in about 10 pages.

What this book does not give credence to is the fact that people are often irrational and emotional. I firmly believe this was a parting gift to the securities industry, as payback to give the average Joe the illusion that there is some fullproof system or method for becoming a millionaire. What usually happens is small investors become obsessed with a stock, say the heck with the system, and go on to lose everything. STICK TO MUTUAL FUNDS FOR STOCK INVESTING. Note:it's investing NOT trading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A.I.M. Algorithm is sound, contrarian logic.","review":"This book should be skimmed on first reading. Then go back and read Chapt. 6 and the Q&A chapters again (ALSO, the chapter on TWINVEST for those that are still in the accumulation mode). If Mr. Lichello had used graphs instead of endless tables of numbers, AIM would have been much easier to grasp. Well, the book was written in the 1970s, so such graphic enhancements probably weren't easy to create. If you take AIM as a rigid \\"one size fits all\\" method, you will be turned off. However, after 10 years of AIM use, I've found that slight modifications make AIM flexible and very appealing for use with high BETA stocks and funds. A quick check of the WEB using a search engine and the name \\"Lichello\\" will bring up hard core AIM users with lots of helpful suggestions.

I guess to make a million you will need to apply it consistently for 20+ years, but it just might perform better than your 401k :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordy but worth the effort.","review":"I will forgive the author for making a salable book out of a relatively simple comcept. While the concept may be simple it seems to be missed by most. Twenty years with the some of biggest and best known brokerage houses, with their MBA's and research departments, failed to come close to the returns achieved in one year with AIM. Bull market aside, fifty percent returns on a stock which has yet to get back to the original purchase price is a result I can live with. Thirty to fourty percent returns with nearly half the value of the portfolios in cash (and not at risk). The concept works. Try it. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disciplined Trading System for Longterm Buy&Hold Investors","review":"This is an excellent disciplined trading system for people who would otherwise be \\"buy and hold\\" investors. The book could have been written in 3 pages. One needs to be able to use the concept from the book (which uses time spaced trading vs event trading) and modify for their use. In my opinion this system turbocharges your investments by an addiditonal 25% on an average."},{"rating":"2","title":"A.I.M. Works!","review":"This book is a masterpiece. Not the writing style, but the stock management system it teaches. A.I.M. works, and it works well. I've used it for years, though I have strayed from it a time or two. Any time I did, I usually regretted it. A.I.M guides you through the ups and downs of the market, protecting your profits and letting you get a good night's sleep no matter what the market is doing. With A.I.M, you'll even welcome market downturns while everyone else is sweating it out. It takes patience to get the most from A.I.M.

It isn't difficult to burn your own disc using the artists songs from other compiliations as a substitute for this 4th volume. I personally have some hard to find Freestyle Universe CD sets that I don't find worth what this one CD is going for.

I was sorely mistaken. \\"Bond Beat & Bass\\" is a compilation of very poor remixes of music from the earlier Bond movies (taken mostly from the Connery and Moore films). A couple of the tracks on this CD are okay (I liked \\"Goldfinger Part 2\\"), but that's about it. I was extremely disappointed. The James Bond films boast such incredible music and all of the original songs could lend themselves very well to new electronic mixes, but none of the artists on this album managed to get it right. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Dependant","review":"I bought this CD to be background music for a 007 party. While the majority of the pieces are adequate, being banal drivel can fade into the background, some are truly frightening. In particular, there is A View To A Kill Part 2, which must use clips from the raw format vocals. Remember the awards performance where Simon Le Bon was either too drunk or too drugged out to carry a tune? This is the same screeching, cracking, off-tune, hysterical (as in \\"hysterics,\\" not as in \\"funny\\") vocal. Interestingly, Part 2 comes before Part 1 on the CD, and part 1 is better. It has been commented before that these are not particularly famous D&B artists, and this certainly is what I would imagine second-rate performers to sound like.

In the style of Spawn and Cryptosy, Nile beats the listener over the head with a crazy assault of blastbeats, amazing solos and a voice that could knock over the Empire State Building. I have to say that the Egyptian thing seems like a sort of sad, typical 21st century nu-metalish gimmick, but the rest of the album makes up for it many times over.

Most bands that yell (like Slipknot and Mudvayne) usually do it so you can at least make out what they are saying. They also have melodic parts to. All this had was AHHHHHH!!!!!! UH!!!!!!!!!!!! UAHHH!!! which brings me to,Reason 2: The Music:After the grunts was a guitar part that sounded like the other 1000 identical guitar parts in each of their songs.

The fact that he reminded me of \\"bubbles\\" from the trailer park boys should have tipped me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steep Decline","review":"Unlike the magnificent Black Seeds of Vengeance this one is a boring album full of cliches and repetitive riffs that border annoyance. I saw the band live in NYC right before the release and it sounded godd except the new songs showed a net decline in inventiveness. The new drummer overplays in all songs it almost sounds as if he was looked in the drum booth soloing for 70 or so minutes and then added to the tracks...horrible. The change of band members has definetly affected the whole sound and writing. There is no new ground here no contiuation of what they started a few albums back just a complete stop and reverse to a an uglier path"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny","review":"I love death metal mainly because of how funny it is. I love the whole mock-metal thing that many death metal bands do. When it's done right (Hate Eternal, for example), the laughs never stop and I roll around on the floor forever. But this album just isn't funny at all. I know they were trying for some good jokes here, but they just don't fly. Maybe they'll get it right next time around. But for now, I just can't recommend these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm................................Crap","review":"OK how can you like a bunch of screaming apes.

One of the top drummer efforts of 2002 right up there with the new hate eternal and origin cds. Also the lead guitars on this one are probably even better than that on their first cd. It is hard for me to see how any one can give this album 1 star because you have to atleast respect the talent of the musicianship.Note: Pay no attention to the reviews by the Nu-metal/limp shitkit fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"THAT SNAKE...","review":"This recording is pivotal. It represents the beginning of Nile's ascent to the extreme metal pantheon. An other-worldly, brutal, and cryptic juggernaut of immense proportions. From the initial kick in the teeth that is \\"The Blessed Dead\\" to the leviathan \\"Unas, Slayer of the Gods\\" to the insurmountable ending title suite, you will be held under a barrel. This obliterates 99 % of other dinosaur death metal morons (Deicide, anyone?) For the uninitiated, start here. For the haters, go pound sand. For the musically adventurous, what have you got to lose? Get your copy today (I should emphasize that you purchase the physical CD, if only for the exstenively researched liner notes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nile are the new Kings!","review":"Nile is the most innovative, unique, brutal band in existance today. I have heard almost all death/black/thrash metal bands and Nile by far are the gods of death. Not only do they not sound the same as all other death metal bands, but they create a sound that is unparalleled by no other. I cannot even come up with the right words to describe the sonic wall of pummelling fury that they create. But while being unrelentingly punishing they still manage to create songs that are not always the same. They have blazing fast songs, and longer epic scores that show their musical talent and range.All in all I have to say that Nile truly is the new Kings of Death Metal. I could not give higher of a recommendation for \\"In their Darkened Shrines\\" or any other album that Nile has written.Dre"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of dark Egyptian metal","review":"Nile is a technically proficient death metal band with very dark tones to their music (not to mention the artwork on their cds). Insane skull shattering double bass drumming, shredding guitar solos, well thought out lyrics, deep growls and Egyptian atmosphere fill their music. Nile is unique in the death metal world, when you listen to them you feel like you just stepped into a darkened tomb deep within an ancient pyramid. Other worldly.Definitely one of the top 5 dm bands. Also check out In Flames, Arch Enemy and Dimmu Borgir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nile gets MIGHTY","review":"With this album Nile is moving away from just plain brutal death metal and they are becoming an epic death metal band. A great example of Nile's new direction would be the song \\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\" this is a 12 minute epic song. Compare this to the 2 minute songs on Amongst the Catacomb of Nephren-Ka and you'll see how much Nile has changed. Not to say, Catacombs is a bad CD, that is actually my favorite Nile CD, just because it is just so all out brutal. This CD really is great almost all the songs are very long and they each tell a story. The only problem is it can get tiring after a while, if you have a short attention span don't even bother with this CD, you will get bored quick. For those of us that can sit down and appreciate a good, long epic death metal CD \\"In Their Darkened Shrines\\" is for you. \\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\" is a song that any death metal fan should hear whether they like Nile or not.

It is, however, a lovely coppery shade, just not what I wanted. The formula is fabulous, though, and I will definitely buy more Zoya in the future. The ordering process was easy, and the polish arrived quickly and well-packaged.

In my opinion it's for a very experienced knitter who is at ease using charts (up to 15 various symbols), doesn't need schematics, or even clear pics of the finished product. If you're at this level there are some lovely designs. But if you're not you'll need quite a large block of time without distractions or interruptions, excellent concentration, and some really good reference resources on hand. Most of the patterns assume you have prior experience in the more intricate techniques like colorwork, entralac, cables, etc...Yes, there are \\"easier\\" patterns but none so terrific that you couldn't find something similar on the net for free or just a few $.BTW, there are only a very few crochet patterns and they're nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crocheters BEWARE!","review":"I can't address the beautiful looking knit patterns in this book - I don't knit.

This book was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading subtitle","review":"The title of this book reads, \\"Scarf Style: Innovative to Traditional, 31 Inspirational Styles to Knit and Crochet\\". I assumed from this that there would be roughly equal numbers of knit and crochet patterns, or possibly a slightly skewed ratio like 20 of one and ten of the other. Imagine my disappointment that only three of the patterns are for crochet; the other 28 are knitted. I am glad I checked it out from the library to try before buying it, because it is not what I expected.The scarves look lovely in the pictures so I'm sure there is plenty here to entertain the knitters, but if you are looking for crocheted scarf patterns this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for beginner knitters","review":"While the pictures, patterns and ideas are wonderful, this is book is for more experienced knitters.

They need to overhaul it and publish a new edition!","review":"Yes, several of the patterns are innovative and inspiring, but the frustration of the photos just overrides any positives in this book.

If the publishers were professional and concerned about the needs of the people fabricating these patterns, you sure can't tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 2 crochet patterns!","review":"When I picked up this book at a local bookstore, I thumbed through it. I don't knit, I only crochet, and was severely disappointed that of the 31 patterns, only two of them were crochet - the other 29 were *all* knit. Perhaps if you knit, this book would be useful to you, the scarves were actually pretty nifty and the patterns seemed (from what I could tell) well written. I decided not to buy this book, especially as one of the crochet patterns was a very simplistic granny-square scarf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice big bottle","review":"I ordered this for our new guinea pigs.

I recommend it for all not just opera fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Opera is a banquet and most folks are starving...","review":"This album of Michael Amante tells me that there is quite a craving for opera but most folks are content with mediocre or poor offerings. While Michael is lovely to look at, his voice is not equiped to sing opera. A nice \\"wedding singer\\" voice, but sorry Michael, I don't think that we will ever see you at the Met unless you buy a ticket! As an opera lover, I am happy to see so many people interested in the art form. A friend of mine in Florida called my attention to this album. As a gesture in kind, might I suggest to her and to all of you...go buy an album of Corelli, Pavarotti, Del Monico, Juan Diego Florez, Ramon Vargas, Domingo, Lacitra, Alvarez or my favorite, Marcello Giordani. So many tenors, so little time! Learn to hear what beauty opera has to offer. There are so many wonderful and distinguished voices in the world of opera...go discover them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Time and Money","review":"Don't be lured in by the cute cover photo. The voice does not match the face!!! As with so many other classical singers out there these days, this guy is all clever marketing.

Do yourself a favor and buy a real tenor....someone like Ian Bostridge or John Mark Ainsley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop butchering great music","review":"Those of us who dismiss albums like this are not opera snobs. We simply know good singing when we hear it and are passionate about the music we love. And it disgusts us when the music we love is given such shabby treatment by singers who should not even be touching such repertoire. If it takes people like Michael Amante to make opera more popular, and here I am going to sound snobby, then maybe it is better if opera remains with those who can recognize and appreciate true technique, interpretation, and sensitive artistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have to give him a star?","review":"It's amazing what you can achieve with a decent publicist and nice bone structure.

Some other posters have likened this guys sound to Bocelli, but the truth is that this guy is even worse than Bocelli (if you can imagine that). I couldn't even make it through one entire sample track without cringing. PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy a Ramon Vargas or Ben Heppner CD if you want quality classical tenor music. This CD is beyond awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bocelli?","review":"My husband says this guy is as bad as Bocelli, but I think he's actually a bit worse. In some ways we are grateful for these singers. I think that they help to introduce this gorgeous music to people who have never heard it before. It's such wonderful music that even in the hands of pop singers it makes an impact on people who think they don't like opera. The sad part is that there are a number of young tenors today who are not being recorded while the crop of thin voiced pop singers make best sellers. Ramon Vargas, Richard Margison, and Marcelo Giordani have such splendid voices and sing this music so beautifully, but do they get to record a La Boheme like Bocelli? If you like the music on this album, then please try a recording by Pavarotti, Bjoerling, or Gedda and hear this music as it is meant to be sung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frequently played and always enjoyed by all listeners","review":"We have a second home about 3 hours from our primary home and frequently play CDs during our weekly round trip rides between the two.My wife and I have found this CD to be one of our favorites and have found it to be a safe choice when we have others in the car as well during this long drive.We have seen Michael Amante perform in person and think of him as the American Tenor or perhaps the Peoples Tenor.This album and his voice presumably cannot equal the power of a Three Tenors recording but it comes quite close and with pride in a native son we enjoy it as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poser!","review":"People, please spare yourselves! Don't believe the hype. This guy sings completely nasal, his technique is worse than Andrea Bocelli's, his talent is far under Michael Bolton's, and he is no where near as passionate as Pavarotti. If this stuff keeps on getting more and more popular, the next thing they'll have to come out with is a concert with Amante, Bocelli, and Watson. It would have to be entitled, \\"The Three Wish-They-Were-Operatic Tenors.\\" That will be a sad day in all the world of opera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He isnt even Italian","review":"Micheal Amante isnt even Italian. He comes from a Polish background, which explains why he cant sing in Italian to save his life. I am not saying he is terrible. His pop stuff isnt bad. But leave the Opera to those who have studied it. Sometimes the words he sings in Italian sound like completely different words than how they were written. So in closing, if you buy this for opera, Dont!!!! If want to hear some decent pop songs go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"My god! Who let this dog sing?","review":"It really hurts your ears. If you want something like this, at least get it from Russell Watson. There are great singers from Brooklyn, Michael Amante is certainly not one of them. Please Mr. Amante don't sing. I wish Amazon had 0 star system."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Handsome and He's the Real Thing!","review":"Tenor Michael Amante displays a homegrown talent for singing operatic and Neapolitan classics. He is a real alternative to the sappy Andrea Bocelli. His voice is much more mature than the young Josh Groban and is stylistically better suited to the more serious material he sings. My favorite track on the recording is the beautiful \\"Ho Bisogno D'Amore\\" which is sung in both Italian and English. It is a sensitive love ballad that Michael brings much emotion and depth to. The production and sound on the disc are glorious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the real Opera singers....?","review":"I must agree with a number of previous reviewers --- this is not Opera at its best.

First of all, Charlotte, having spent a large part of a previous book in France, then separated from Thomas while he worked in Whitechapel, is unceremoniously dispatched on holiday, where she does nothing except be rescued by a colleague of Thomas's. Without her, a dimension of the story is missing, and the fascinating insight into the Victorian class system earlier books provided.Another problem is by the extreme emphasis on the \\"Inner Circle\\" the book becomes fantasy rather than historical fiction. It also seems unfortunate to take Thomas from the world of crime into being an agent for the \\"Special Branch,\\" which is supposed to track Fenians and anarchists, but seems devoted to seeking out the Inner Circle.I wish the author would go back to those things that made the earlier books in the series so fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy-chair read...","review":"\\"Southhampton Row\\" by Anne Perry was a novel that I enjoyed.

The plot is very well written and put together. The suspense builds up slowly and the story ties up very satifactorily.I'm in agreement with Amazon's review that the section with Charlotte was unneccesary. It only distracts from the main story.

This is Linda Lael's Miller's best work to date, as she captures the essence of frontier life in the 1800's with all the sensuality and warmth she is known for. The tales of these four women fail to disappoint as you read through each fast paced novelette of their passionate affairs with the men they love.

Having used the Sunbeam mattress pads for years (7)and never once having them fail to perform, I purchased a new one as a back up in case one of mine quit. I noticed Bed Bath & Beyond sells an upgraded one, same Sunbeam brand, with 20 settings (who needs 20 settings?) for about $109.00 for a queen size. Having only paid around $69 for the ones in the past I stuck with what I knew worked and ordered this one from Amazon. As soon as the pad was set up both electric controls flashed and refused to turn on or off. In addition, although this may seem rather insignificant, the controls were blue, not a color I prefer, especially since they are quite visible on your night tables.

A wonderful complement to poultry and many meats (especially ground chuck), I alone go through several jars a year, combining it most often with chicken. It is sweet, and only mildly hot, allowing its delicious spiced flavors to be thoroughly enjoyed. It has a wonderful aroma and aromatic after-taste on the back of the palate that provides an almost transcendental experience. Yet, used in moderation, it doesn't overpower, but rather enhances the meat dish.This is not a relish that everyone enjoys, however. Its taste is unique, and not the fire-hot peppery blast that many people seem to enjoy and be seeking."},{"rating":"1","title":"'80's Retro","review":"I purchased this book thinking the patterns were recent.

Can't say I mind the song all that much, but it just reminds me of another little girl having to show off her body to be popular. But putting that aside, The original by Tarkan is just wayyyyyy better. Sure, it's in Turkish and you may not understand a word of it, but his voice and musical talent will draw you in anyway. Some reviewers have said that Holly Valance is the reason for Tarkan's success with this song, but that is a bunch of bull...Tarkan is successful without the little blonde bombshell."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended for people looking for original music.","review":"why?because for ur information the song was covered by 2 different female singer under the same title.kiss kiss.one by stella soleil and the other one is of course holy valance.Just like stella soleil holly valance will definately be a one hit wonder.if u like this kinda music,dont waste ur money on this junk.get the original version of simarik(original song by tarkan).Believe me, its worth every penny u spent on his album.well, maybe u buy holly valance for her good looks, then its definately a bonus for u aswell since tarkan looks better than her in every way, music,physical and most importantly originality.Maybe u dont wanna buy his album since its not made in america album, well ur on the rite track since his self title album that has 'simarik' on it was release in the USA by universal music america."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNORIGINAL AND CHEAP!","review":"This song comes nowhere near Tarkan's Simarik. She just cant sing - its all computerized! Tarkan's song has a much better beat and rhythm. Nowadays, we have much more talented female singers, like Britney, Christina etc. Holly Valance is a model! Why doesnt she stick to what she does best?? The video is soooo cheap to start off with! I mean she is basically dancing naked, only there is light shining on her private parts and reflected back, so no one can see anything.... but then all those guys are touching her and etc. I could go on! Plus, it's just incredibly blondie and dumb - especially the \\"mwaah\\" kissing sound. Sorry, it gets one star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holly S to the H to the I to theT.","review":"This is just a copy on the turkish singer Tarkan's 1998 hit \\"Simarik\\" i were in turkey during that time and the song was played everywhere to later become a smash hit in the rest of europe too. Even though it was in turkish it sold well casue it was a good catchy pop song with oriental influences. There is no need for Holly Valance to make a cover of it in english just a few years after. The lyrics are dull and the whole idea of it the song is annoying, Her next song called \\"Down Boy\\" really proves how much talent she got(Not). The mysterious \\"one hit wonder\\" has caused a new victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete [Garbage]","review":"Whoever got the idea of Holly Valance singing a cover of Tarkan's \\"Kiss Kiss\\" was out of their mind. Holly's version is completely inauthenic and very unoriginal. I believe reasons why this song became Number One in UK and Australia was because of the music video where she dances around naked with glowing private parts, and also because Holly is in the popular Australian/British television show, \\"Neighbours\\".Another thing, I don't think she even gives credit to Tarkan. Do people know that the song is Turkish? or that it's even a cover? Well, whatever the matter is, I hope this review helps.I don't even dare thinking of recommending this version of \\"Kiss Kiss\\" to anybody. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A STORY OF HOW THESE TYRANTS ABUSE THEIR POWER!","review":"Seeing The Keeper caused me to retrospect back to the movie''Against the Walls''based on the story of Attica 71'.

This time there is softer plot line with less gross-out shocks and no evil demons but still has a understandable air of truth about the effects of near-death experiences. Nathan Fillion (of Serenity fame) plays the central character convincingly as a man with a burden of knowledge that can save people but for how long before the natural order of things defeats his successful efforts. The growing love of a nurse he has saved puts him in a terrible dilemma. As the realization of his commitment to set things right leads to a very sad and moving ending. The HD sound was very effective in adding to the shocking effects and eery music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"this movie is not even close to the first one, the story line of way off and the idea sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a good movie","review":"I never saw the first movie, and it's not really a sequel so there is no need.

Perhaps it was that I had low expectations, but I think it was that I let the movie be what it was without holding it up to the scrutiny of \\"A sequel.\\"Nathan Fillion makes a totally sympathetic character. You like him and so it's easy to go along on the journey when no one else but the viewer gets exactly what he's going through or buys his story. I like paradoxical endings and this movie, like the first, has one. The theme of this series seems to be that messing with the other side before your time never ends well and it makes an entertaining enough story for me.Like the movie \\"Dragonfly\\" it may not be a blockbuster, but it made for a good evening and I'll watch it many more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMMMMMM........................","review":"Just what I thought. If the first one was terrible, then I should've known that this one would be as well. No more sequels, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice surprise...","review":"Considering the flood of direct-to-DVD horror movie sequels, this one floats to the top. The original theatrical film with Michael Keaton left something to be desired, however, this new flick gives the titular paranormal theme a boost. You just have to keep your EVP's and NDE's in order as you make sense of the plot and all the religious subtext. My guess-- this could have been an unrelated stand-alone screenplay that was adapted to fit the \\"White Noise\\" genre. Katee Sackhoff does a great turn as the love interest, and fans will remember her from her initial foray into horror fromHalloween - Resurrection. In all, this could spawn a third sequel if the present filmmakers sign on for another go round. Since it seems horror fans will devour anything that has competent and creative effort behind it (even if it doesn't hit the theaters), we may be seeing more films like this hit the shelves and not the cineplexes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh new insights","review":"We chose this book on Kaballah to use in my study group and we have had excellent results. The group consists of many levels from a beginner to a person who has written her own interpretations of Kaballah. Greer is able to simplfy enough for the beginner to grasp difficult concepts, yet offers enough new information to keep the expert interested.

Obafunke comes across as too much doodling and studio navel gazing - to my tastes, none of its ideas ever really come off -- it's all kinda dull and aimless. I have now come to expect a certain uneveness in KB's long players -- but this is not worth the fancy import price. Sample it somewhere first before you plunk your hard-earned doolos.

We both liked the excellent and rare blend of piano and classical guitar on this album as well. This album is just one of those rare products that is well done from beginning to end.

As a historical piece, though, it loses a lot of its value due to its British bias. The book would sound a lot more credible if the author didn't use examples of the British army for everything, sometimes fortifying it with an American example as well (which, of course, is British in origin!)Aside from this major flaw, the organization of the book did get a little obnoxious down the road, but other than that I can say I learned something from it.

His early loss left many unfinished projects as to record a whole session with Oscar Peterson (imagine that dream come true);but at least he left the best of his craft for the posterity.Waltz for Debby was arguably, his best referential card, a sublime work loaded of exquisite lyricism and sumptuous refinement.An album to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite jazz records","review":"I would rank this as one of the best jazz records, along with Kind of Blue, Giant Steps, and A Blowing Session.

Except for that one song the album fails on many levels (Even for rap music) with it's anoying lyrics, bad beats, and even bad rapping! Personally I think this guy has got some talent and is just afraid to use it. He proved he's got the skill to be one of the greatest rappers out there with \\"Gangsta's Paradise,\\" and in the \\"Space Jam\\" soundtrack he (With the help of other rappers) helped make the best rap song I've herd! He just needs to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rappers like Eminem out of the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Skull Beneath the SkinWay too much minutiae and not enough written on the plot to keep my interest. Very disappointed but will give P. D. James another try with Cover Her Face featuring Adam Dalglish. You can't beat Agatha Christie for being the queen of description in one short paragraph while James takes pages to show us a setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"Watertight characterization, spectacular scenery vividly described, a smooth uncluttered prose - a much-polished work! A Victorian setting and even the writing hark backs to that era with multiple narrators; I think it reminded me of \\"The Moonstone\\" in that respect. The ending seemed quite realistic to me. James discuses theology, human greed, literature and history seamlessly and succeeds in twining it with the real matter in hand. Never boring and even funny in parts! Her best work, one really is quite thankful of Adam's absence. Classic!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I have always enjoyed the P.D. James books. I have read nearly all the Adam Dogleash series. This book was a huge waste of time. It was a combination of \\"Then There Were None,\\" and a Massie Dobbs book. It was so predictable.A women detective with an agency in London is supposed to protect an actress who will be giving a preformance at a Castle on an island. First there is one murder than two and of course you know where this is going.I am surprised that P.D. James wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Baroness James hate women?","review":"Sad to say, \\"Skull Beneath the Skin\\" is another misogynistic scar on P.D. James's body of work, with a soulless, career-obsessed sex fiend who meets her well-deserved end. What is James's problem? She's a career woman, whether she likes it or not, but she seems to have a pathological hatred for career women who put out, unlike the saintly Emma. Perhaps she's just getting old. \\"Skull\\" has some of James's trademark character development and plotting skill, but even her gift for landscape falls short in this outing -- the island and its inhabitants never seem remotely believable. Try \\"Death in Holy Orders\\" for James without the nasty streak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful and Boring","review":"There is little about this work that recommends itself to mystery fans. The pace is lethargic, the characters are not particularly interesting, and once the murder occurs, there is little about the victim that evokes any sympathy. In all, James has managed to be, on the one hand, boring while, on the other, pretentious. Certainly not her best and one should not judge her work by this effort.For those wanting much more engaging work, check out Peter Robinson or, even better, Ian Rankin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had to read this book for my high school summer reading. It was one of the worst books i have ever read. Everytime I sat down to read it i fell asleep. When the end finally came i was very dissapointed because nothing happened.

I jumped to a chapter in the middle of the book and found the same problem.This book needs more focus, better diagrams and more streamlined approach towards systems architecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice title, shame about the book","review":"Great title, subject and introduction, but the actual book itself is mostly useless, poorly edited and badly written.

Unfortunatly the authors were unable to rise above the technology/process wars. The words \\"In Our Opinion\\" or simalar statements occur on every other page. If you happen to be in disagreement with the opinions reading this book is torture.I am afraid this will hurt WWISA, the goal of creating a viable Software Architecture Profession can only be achieved if we stay independent of the wars. This book, being visable evidence of the organiztions existance will give readers a false impression of the WWISA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"A book on software architecture should discuss a number of approaches to architecting software: layers, business objects, pipelines, frameworks, etc. This book has a few ideas, but mostly it's a tiresome diatribe against Microsoft technologies (2 million professional developers should switch just because this author and Scott McNeally says so!), and a verbose marketing brochure for CORBA, Linux, and the Usual wanna-be-as-succesful-as-Microsoft Suspects!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but badly executed","review":"Software Architect Bootcamp offers a good selection of topics and an interesting organizational metaphor.

Part of the book is outdated as it discusses the state of technology in 2003. In computer years, that's a long time. I'm not taking that section into account in my rating.Part of the book is more general and covers what an architect does with a military analogy. It reads like a schoolbook in that it was more theoretical and few \\"in the trenches stories.\\" There were thought provoking questions at the end of each chapter. The exercise are meant for someone in industry. Presumably someone who is just learning how to be an architect.Overall, I'm rating the book low because it was hard to read and dint' really keep my attention. I also noticed some errors. I did like the exersises, but they are such a small part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective By Design","review":"The DualDisc format was too thick for my notebook drive and would not play in any of my home players (two standalone players and three computers) or my car's 6-disc CD changer. I found a DVD player to listen to the other side of the disc, which was scratched after trying to insert it into my notebook's drive, and the album was unimpressive. I am white, nerdy, and a Wierd Al fan since the very first album, but I found the parodies just OK, most of the original comedy pedestrian, and what's left was simply irritating. I gave up trying to rip it to my iPod, and I am NOT buying the songs AGAIN on iTunes. Why they chose not to put Orange Book audio on the defective DualDisc format is beyond me. Since I can't use what I bought, and I can't return it, I'll swap it for a not-scratched copy... and you can find that one on the auctions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"Weird Al does it again with another hilarious album. The bread and butter of this album are of course the parodies of real songs, but Al's originals are decent. The most hilarious of these parodies in my opinion is Trapped in The Drive-Thru, a parody of R. Kelly's trapped in the closet ,which has Al and his wife heading off to the drivethru for dinner and then hilarity insues. I would definitely advise this to anyone who loves Weird Al or just needs a laugh, definitely check this one out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting times for comedy!","review":"This is a spot on parody album!

My DualDisc works fine on my PC and my DVD player. The songs are spot on .The background vocals are perfect. The parodies are wonderful. A quick note about his rap parodies, those of you who hate rap,should laugh out loud ! You can tell he is going in new directions as an artist , and is improving upon himself .

It's my favourite Weird Al album because it's clever and funny and funny and funny. As someone who bought Brian Wilson's Smile and HATED it for me \\"Pancreas\\" was worth the price of admission along. \\"Trapped in the Drive Thru\\" is fantastic. \\"Close But No Cigar\\" is a new favourite. \\"Canadian Idiot\\" gave me a new appreciation of \\"American Idiot\\". \\"I'll Sue Ya\\" is incredibly clever. Al in Al, a fantastic job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"Almost all of the songs are excellent. \\"Trapped in the Drive-Thru\\" is just too long and obnoxious. White and Nerdy, Pancreas, Canadian dio, and Close but no Cigar are favorites.

A few of the others have humorous lines, but don't hold up all the way through.In spite of Al's song \\"Don't Download This Song\\", that's the best way to get this album because you'll only want to hear it a coupla times, at most, then file it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable due to technical issues","review":"I just got my amazon box!

WTF??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The parodies are comical, but I don't like the style of music. I don't think it's near up to the same level as his past albums.

Unfortunately, the album does not justify the hype. White & Nerdy is an impressive starting song, but pancreas is a bit of a let down, it just feels like he's done a song or two just like it on past albums. Candian Idiot is alright, but I'll Sue Ya is a really boring and poor excuse for a Rage Against The Machine (style) paradoy. Polkarama was alright. Virus Alert was kinda funny. Convessions Part III is about as exciting as the R&B song that it parody's. Weasel Stomping Day is stupid and a little gross. Close But No Cigar is completely forgettable. Do I Creep You Out was pretty good. I liked it. The rest of the songs were decent and I haven't watched the bonus items but I doubt they can make up for so many disappointing songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like people are starting to catch on ...","review":"I did a review of Weird Al's last album (Poodle Hat), where I said that I thought Al was losing his edge. Now it seems that more people are starting to agree with me, as you see multiple reviews here where people are saying \\"it's just not funny anymore.\\" Some people say that Bad Hair Day was Al's last really good album, but it say it goes further back to Off The Deep End.As for this album, I gotta give it 2 stars because of White & Nerdy, which is probably the best thing Al has done since Headline News. Other than that, the rest of the album isn't much to write home about. I think the problem is that many of the songs are more 'clever' than they are funny.I'm sorry to say, but it Al's music just isn't what it used to be. Better luck next time, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointed","review":"I have followed Weird Al from the start. I have enjoyed every single one of his albums ... until now.His comic brilliance didn't show through this time, and this album crossed over from funny to stupid. I only enjoyed two of the twelve songs on this entire album, both of which have been made available for free download. I honestly recommend that you go to his website and download those two tracks. Don't waste money on this CD, because it is overall pretty disappointing.Why am I rating it 2/5 stars? The answer is that it just isn't funny any more. There used to be a suble genius about Weird Al, that made me listen to his albums over and over again. But this CD isn't even good for laughs the first time.Thanks for reading my review.

People who don't think parodying rap music is funny, I guess, are not going to find much to like, but I thought it was hysterical. Definitely worth the purchase, although you might find yourself downloading the CD all over again from the internet because of the whole DualDisc thing...I bought it for the DVD side.

Someone mentioned that the music that he parodied isn't all his fault and I would have to agree. There are no GREAT songs to parody!!!

Have any of you heard Alapalooza or Any of his non-parodie earlier stuff? That was pretty bad. But this is funny. It actually is talented, not just some random rock riff he had in his mid-90's stuff. Trapped in the Drive-Thru is possibly one of the most hilarious things weird Al's ever written. Of course, most R. Kelly parodies are hilarious, but that's beside the point. Weird Al is still hilarious, and he probably always will be.

His puppets seem to come to life, change expressions, and pulls you into the belief that they are real beings. Walter, is hysterical, and I know many will be able to identify him as one of their close relatives. Peanut, always my favorite, is so darn cute, and always keeps you laughing. You must watch the outtakes, which are just as funny as the show. Jeff just keeps on going in character, adlibbing all along. I definitely recommend this DVD.

Dunham is funny, creative and his puppets are so believable you can actually suspend belief and think of them as people.

My wife and I didn't stop laughing through the whole skit and its not that easy to make me laugh out loud.... but Jeff's humor hit that funny spot. Looking forward to another NEW release."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy....","review":"This guy is awesome. His comedy is great and the pupets seem to have a personality on their own.

This man is very talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply: The Best.","review":"This DVD was the first I ever heard of from Jeff Dunham. The first time I saw it was late at night and I was the only one awake in the house, I couldn't stop pounding my fist sharply on the couch as I continually fell over crying of laughter (I couldn't laugh out loud as I would have woken up my room mates) but that didn't stop me from falling on the couch in laughter over and over. One of the funniest comedians to come along in years. The best thing about Jeff Dunham is that unlike comedians like Dane Cook and Ron White and even politically incorrect comedians like Dennise Miller: Jeff Dunham actually makes you LAUGH! His comedy, even when talking about social and political issues is presented in a light-hearted way as not to be \\"We're all F&$#ed\\" but rather \\"This is Funny\\". With Walter and Peanut and the other characters you get conversational comedy which makes it more enjoyable than just a 90 minute monologue. FUNNY AS HELL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff","review":"This was hillarious!

He is so unbelievably talented that its worth getting the DVD just to watch him perform. The added bonus is that he is hilarious. The routines he has with all of his puppets are equally funny and will have you laughing from beginning to end. This is not a comedy routine for the youngsters because of foul language and inappropriate topics.

This DVD is fantastic and I have watched it at least 100 times since purchasing it--I have also dubbed the audio portion onto CD so that I might be able to listen to it in the car and at work!! I have loved watching Jeff Dunham perform for a long time. I recently got to see him in person and was thrilled with his performance!! I would like to be able to see him perform at Kuss Auditorium in Springfield, Ohio if at all possible. One of his newest characters, Sweet Daddy D, is the epitome of my Black brothers!! If anyone who sees this DVD doesn't find themselves laughing their heads off, then you must not have a sense of humor. Also, hearing Jeff do Sweet Daddy D is the first time that I knew what the word \\"PIMP\\" really means!! He is good at what he does and I hope he continues to do it for many years to come.

He is probably the least funny \\"comedian\\" that has ever reached that level of stardom. It makes me physically ill to listen to his thinly-veiled racist jokes. I use the word jokes pretty liberally there, it's really just \\"who's the dummy\\" brand schtick with a bunch of catch phrases thrown in from the racist stereotype characters he has created. The fact that he has achieved such a level of success makes me weep for the American viewing public that swallows this ugliness up and begs for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Comedy Must See!!!!!","review":"If you love comdey, you will love Jeff Dunham's \\"Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself\\".

He is a horrid ventriloquist, and an even worse comedian.

Disappointed greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one talented comedian","review":"I saw Jeff's show once on television then ordered DVD copies for myself and other adult family members, who described it as \\"painfully funny\\". I would describe it as absolutely hilarious. The characters are clever and endearing, and this comedian seems able to move effortlessly between them. The audience involvement is a nice touch, particularly in one sequence about the bathroom. I preferred the unbleeped version, which would not be considered suitable for children. It's irreverent at times but not to the point of gross. This DVD is a lot of laughs for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Performance","review":"This video is hilarious.

It's not for the virgin ears at heart. Althought I thought is was very funny and even a bit side splitting. Which is unsuall for me since I don't laugh at many comdeians. I thought the part on how he makes his puppets was very interesting. I think it would have been nice to know how Mr. Dunham became a vantriloquist but thats just me. If you like this one then you'll like his other one. Over all it was good for laughs after a hard days at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Dunham - Cracks me up","review":"I saw Jeff Dunham on Comdy Central and I had to get the DVD.

His puppets are fabulous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Dunham, Peanut, & Walter Rock","review":"First of all let me just say that this routine is NOT FOR KIDS. Got it? I've seen parents take kids to Dunham's shows and then get insulted that its not Sesame Street or the Kermit Review Hour - even though the posters and all clearly state that this is not for kids.That being said, if you've never seen Dunham you are in for a treat. He's funny and each of his characters has a distinct personality that plays so well off of Dunham's straight man act. Peanut, Walter, and the rest interact with the audience and Dunham is very fast on his feet and with his vocal cords.Obviously I'm a fan. I've followed his work since the 90s when he would appear on the Comic Strip TV show and have seen a number of his Comedy Central specials. The only low point in this routine is the introduction of a new character, Sweet Daddy, as Dunham's manager otherwise it's a great set that will have you laughing for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This guy is hilarious, just about the best 8 bucks I've ever spent.

He's an outstanding comedian AND he's a great ventriloquist. Thanks to the DVD release, I won't have to wait until he travels near town to enjoy him - this DVD is absolutely hilarious! Jeff and all of his characters make you laugh your head off throughout the length of the show. (I could have done without the little intro to the show, but the entire rest of the DVD was fantastic.) The special features are pretty cool too.If you've got a sense of humor, this DVD is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic !

Thanks, Jeff, for bringing ventriloquism back as an art form. The opening scenes showcase Dunham's talent as a pure stand-up comedian, then the puppets join him and they bring the show to a whole new level of insane comedy - and bring the house down in the process. From the cantankerous Walter to the smooth Sweet Daddy D, every character is unique both in sound and \\"personality\\". For me the highlight was the scene where Peanut and Jose talk in Spanish and Jeff protests that he feels left out because he \\"doesn't speak Spanish\\" - the line is great, the comedic timing is exquisite. The other part I loved most was the unscripted Improv-style pieces.I would recommend this for any adult with a love for the zany and witty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism remains unfunny, even when coming from puppets.","review":"Jeff Dunham is a racist. His \\"characters\\" are mostly based on blatant stereotypes that are immediately offensive to anyone with any sort of empathy towards the feelings of others. These are not clever jokes based on the differences of diverse cultures. These are insulting caricatures on the same level as black face or buck toothed \\"ching chong ding dong\\" characters. I was shocked to discover that something this tasteless existed in the new millennium, let alone that a talentless \\"comic\\" could hide his inability to tell jokes behind this disgusting display. Now excuse me while I go try desperately to forget that I saw this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pee your pants funny","review":"Love Jeff, my favorite is walter and peanut.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny Group of Characters and a Nice Young Man","review":"As you probably know, Jeff Dunham is a ventriloquist who appears on Comedy Central a lot. Apparently he has his own show now, but I haven't seen it. His comedy is not politically correct, but he's an equal-opportunity offender. He's topical and he's very, very funny.The characters who worked on this show with him include:Walter, an old curmudgeon with a face like a prune.Sweet Daddy D, introduced as his new manager.Bubba J, a beer swilling NASCAR fan.Peanut, who is something alien, I think.Jose Jalapeno in a stick. Yes, a jalapeno pepper in a Mexican hat. On a stick.So long as you're not easily offended, I think you will love this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I recommend this comedian.

Were we ever surprised.. Jeff Dunham is a fantastic ventriliquist.. and well his \\"little people\\" are so lifelike.. They make you forget that they aren't humanbeings. You have to see it to enjoy the full effect of the puppets that he has.. And I believe him when he says that they are his friends.. Great performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious - worth the watch","review":"With most stand-up routines, things can be hit and miss. You'll get a funny bit, then another not-so-funny bit. This dvd of Jeff Dunham's live performance is consistantly funny, and yet also unique for his use of ventriloquism. With the \\"unbleeped\\" version you will get swearing but coming from a bunch of puppets it's both acceptable and incredibly funny. Likewise, audience members genuinely laugh when they're picked on by these puppets, rather than take offense.My favourite moment - one of the puppets imitating a Japanese Godzilla movie. You know what I mean, when their lips are out of synch with the soundtrack, and their mouth stops moving but they're still speaking.Definitely worth watching - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JEFF DUNHAM - ARGUING WITH MYSELF","review":"I LOVE JEFF DUNHAM'S HUMOR.

Perhaps he's simply TOO close. Alternately shrill, arrogant, and whiny, the book supposes ridiculous motives behind his opponents' actions, and offers his own clients as selfless angels. There's no doubt that the issue is complex. That, alone, would seem to be a reason to recognize that there could be different perspectives without nefarious or purely self-interested motivations.Lots of heat, no light. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased and unprofessional effort","review":"I too began this book with an open mind, but the author's blantant antagonism toward all agencies, parties, and conservationists in the salmon restoration debate quickly became too much to stomach. Saving Pacific Northwest salmon, especially on the Columbia & Snake Rivers, will take working together and understanding all sides of the issue, which this book does not take the time to do. It is single minded in its condemnation of everyone who attempts to make true progress on the issue, instead focusing on and glorifying those who advocate delay and denial. It's not worth your time--instead I would recommend Keith Peterson's \\"River of Life, Channel of Death-Fish and Dams on the Lower Snake River\\" and Blaine Hardin's \\"A River Lost-The Life and Death of the Columbia\\" for two much more balanced and well-thought out perspectives on restoring salmon to the Northwest's greatest rivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible lies!!!","review":"This book unsuccessfully attempts to discredit leading scientists and studies that have linked the decline of salmon to the interests that the author represents.

Author John Hubner takes us on an unrestricted tour of the jewel of the Texas Youth Commission, Giddings State School.Gidddings which holds 400 youth is a hybrid between the \\"boot camp\\" ideology and intensive therapeutic treatment. Their role play therapy of a client's history and crimes combined with a victim impact panel, demonstrates how the clients who pass the Capital Offenders group are measurably more successful when released.The big carrot for active participation in the program comes from large determinate sentences. A Special Services Committee made up of corrections professionals and clinicians at Giddings can release a client after a successful few years or send them to the Texas Penitentiary to complete what may be a 20 to 40 year sentence.If that isn't motivation for taking ownership of your actions I don't know what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Concept","review":"\\"Last Chance in Texas\\" is about Giddings State School in Texas.

He heard of Giddings State School's [...] surprising success with some youths. He spent months at the \\"school\\" observing capital and violent offenders. He draws their stories from their dialogue, records, and interviews. Gidding's gets the worst, and this book genuinely mirrors much of their lives and predicaments. Beyond the individual and societal tragedies, Hubner finds that sometimes Texas love and nurturing, along with discipline, saves some of those previously ill-destined kids. It reduces crime in your future too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopeful","review":"Would give this book 5 stars for the hopeful ideas about rehabilitating violent youth offenders.

The other, Madame de Pompadour, was generally more intimate and entertaining. However, this book introduced me well to a subject and place that I don't know much about, and was consistently interesting. Her description of Frederick's childhood and family relationships was engaging and by far the strongest part of the book. I'm not particularly interested in military history, so I had to slog through the long descriptions of battles. Many titled persons are introduced who don't do much, and I found it difficult to keep track of them all. However, Frederick's personality, and those of his immediate family, dominate the book, and they are very very interesting people. Mitford has a unique sympathy for privileged subjects, their manners and ideals. After reading this book, I immediately ordered \\"The Sun King\\" by Mitford, and enjoyed it even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitford's Frederick the Great","review":"Mitford's treatment of Frederick the Great is good for those readers who have little to no background on his life and times, since it is a very fluid read and is loaded with humorous anecdotes. It also is relatively non-partisan in its treatment of the subject, although Mitford clearly admires Frederick. Nevertheless the book tends to be very light on important details surrounding Frederick's campaigns, and not nearly as good an introductory piece to Frederick's life as Asprey's >The Magnificent Enigma<. Serious Frederick fans can bypass this book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book on Java","review":"This book is required for my College level introduction to Java.

The reason the text is so large is because each code example has a page of text walking you through it, which you may not need to wade through. The coverage, topic flow and examples are very good, pointing out tips and common errors.

There is a large fold out map that details Greece in full. Also, it's written by a Greek archaelogist who knows the islands and Greece very well. He provides a service to tourists and visitors who seek to know Greece very well. It just makes me want to Greek lessons and move to Greece. The beauty of Greece is unsurpassed as you look at the pictures of this book. The shear beauty of Greece is that Greeks appreciate their country and are proud of it's magnificient history and contributions to today's world.

However he's not gay (he says again and again and AGAIN) and dumps the guys when things get too serious. The guys always commit suicide or go crazy...but he sees nothing wrong with that. Then finally he meets a man who he falls in love with totally and has to admit he's gay...but how will his wife take it.Merrick's books are hardly great literature but (with the sole exception of \\"The Lord Won't Mind\\") they're homophobic, negative and always end with the gay men being murdered or committing suicide. The gay world is always shown in a negative light and God forbid anyone should have a happy relationship! The ending of this book is extremely tragic and I threw the book away after finishing it. Negative, homophobic and just plain sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is this Book Still in Print?","review":"I had read other books by Mr. Merrick, so I was not expecting great literature. For me it's sort of like watching an Ed Wood movie. They're humorous, because they are so bad. This book was even worse than the others. The ending is what really ruined it for me.

There are many books that deal with gay love in a more positive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desideratum - Another Synaesthesia collection","review":"The reader needs to have something reinforced here.

I enjoyed the 1st CD which had a space-age sound to it, 7 songs fit for long nights underneath the stars. Yes many of the songs are long winded but they definitely aren't devoid of atmosphere or action.There is no darkness in the first CD but has a more airy ambience feel about it. The best tracks on CD1 are 'Conciousness', 'Umbra' and 'Surface System' with its catchy industrial beats.On CD2, check out the ethereal beats to the song of 'Subversion'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synaesthesia - 'Desideratum' (Cleopatra) 2 1/2 stars","review":"Band's second release,key players for this studio project are Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber.Two CD's,duration is two hours and twenty minutes.Best described as industrial/electronic with a somewhat 'sinister' edge to it.As a friend of mine put it,'Desideratum' is borderline tolerable.As for myself,I prefer to listen to one disc per time I choose to check it out.Tracks that I most remember noticing were \\"Orion Nebula\\",\\"Dark Core\\",\\"Barred Spirals\\" and the fifteen-minute \\"Lifeless\\".Might appeal to fans of Front Line Assembly,Delerium,Surface 10,Philip Glass and Red Shift."},{"rating":"2","title":"dancing in a multicultural world","review":"This is a simply written, beautifully illustrated book with humor.

You get 5 different versions of this very good song re-made and remixed by Belgian pop-trance-disco geniuses D.H.T. Lead vocalist Edmee Daenen has an appealing mellow voice. She really sings with ease, as if she were sitting on the other side of the room delivering the late 80s ballad by Roxette. Her DJ, Flor Theeuwes is not the finest DJ to emerge from the low countries but his work is passable. This UK version is superior with more mixes as opposed to the trashy thump-thump which is tacked along with the radio edit and the piano and vocals on the American single version."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH....YEA OK","review":"Ok this group totally murdered this song! I love the classic even though I am 15 ok?

I mean, Heaven by DJ Sammy? So HORRIBLE! Totally not the same as Bryan Adams' original romantic song. And this?? Terrible! Roxette's version had so much more feeling & emotion behind it. I'm a huge Roxette fan & if anything, this version is just so insulting, they definitely didn't do it any justice. I'm tired of watching people think they can just take over an old song without really trying & they just can't match the original. Come up with your own stuff, man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same DHT ??","review":"that does the song \\"White Power\\"? As far as I can tell, it is. Just something to think about before you buy.

The piano, acoustic version is the most boring thing I have heard in years. And the hard-core remixes are unlistenable. Don't waste money in this bad done cover. Buy Roxette's \\"Look Sharp!\\" or The Ballad Hits\\" and you will enjoy the original and real version of the song, that is lightyears better than this! In addition, in \\"The Ballad Hits\\" you got all the greatest ballads that Roxette has released through these years. It worths every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mix single","review":"Another one of Robbins remakes. They pick a great song to redo, and overall the song is catchy, and the vocals are pretty good. However, the engineering and music are a bit subpar, and the six versions or so are simply not distinctive enough. Worth buying? Sure, but not the best engineered music out there. The highlight here is the killer vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album... as expected","review":"The DHT album is not the most original piece of work, but the girl can sing, and if you want love songs and songs about break ups and such, this is the CD for you.

The whole CD is an easy listen and a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"This book had all the right ingredients but the author just did not have the necessary skills to take this book where it should have gone. The characters were not fully developed. Many issues are introduced but left unexplored until finally there is a real bombshell that gets dropped but nothing explodes in the story. I was left feeling that a promise to me had been broken. The romance between the two main characters was boring. The book is just OK.

If he loves something he says so and if he thinks someone is a fool he says that too. You'll smile, you'll be offended and you might hurl the book down in anger but read it. Mr. Crouch has an interesting mind, something that is sorely lacking in much of our media figures today."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not raise the bar","review":"Unfortunately, Mr. Crouch's arguments have run out of steam and settled into a argument for the status quo.

It covers design and implementation of classles and classful routing protocols as well as DDR, making it a good resource on your CCNA and CCNP routing exams. It also covers in detail different router's specs, which was vaulable while studying for the CIT and BCRAN exams. At the price this is selling for used, it seems almost criminal.

I had to hold the button down myself or press the bottle down against it because the bottle wasn't heavy enough. Otherwise the device doesn't turn on or shuts off the second the button is not fully depressed. It's a pain in the butt to me. My baby doesn't eat on a specific schedule so I don't start heating a bottle until she starts to wake up. It takes 5 minutes just to get the bottle out and situated, then it takes 15 minutes to heat the bottle because the heating band is only against about 2/3rd's of the bottle.

Sadly, that was not the case. It was almost as if two different people had written the book as there was no connection between the beginning and the end.

F------"},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"The first thing to note is that this film does not feature the real Frances Farmer as the video info states. Rather it is a biopic which makes the 1982 version with Jessica Lange look like a masterpiece. As Frances, Sheila McLaughlin is abysmal. In some scenes she's not even blonde! And she looks more like Piper Laurie than Frances Farmer, who was petite and luminously beautiful. The film offers no greater insight into Frances than the Lange version, in spite of the publicists claim, and the direction is heavy-handed and humourless. A lot of the time it reads like a bad play with hardly any character interaction or drama. There is even some pseudo-Bergman touches which are almost laughable. In spite of the scant Frances Farmer titles available on video, a viewing of Come and Get It or Toast of New York is preferable to this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the brecciation!?!","review":"The seller claims that this is classified as L4 to L6, but I'd say it's a low L3 (maybe even L2), and I have a degree in astrology.Also, the \\"detailed history\\" was written in crayon.

In his \\"Preface\\", Chet explains that he began writing this book in an effort to illustrate how Englishmen were militarily transformed into Americans; how they gradually gave up their European defensive tactics and instead adopted Indian offensive tactics. As with most myths, the deeper you dig, the less you find. The book Chet wound up writing demonstrates the exact opposite of what he originally thought he'd find. It shows how and why European tactics WORKED in North America, despite the terrain and theIndians' guerilla tactics.Although the book deals with the colonial period only and does not analyze the American Revolutionary War, Chet's argument fits in with what we know about George Washington's management of his army during the war.The sections about Benjamin Church, Rogers' Rangers, and British light infantry tactics are particularly interesting.The endnotes contain interesting and funny incidents that reallyenhance the impact of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit, Great Value.","review":"I had read reviews that some third-party batteries didn't fit quite right in the camera, but figured the price couldn't be beat.

She has a livein boyfriend, of course and her younger sister shows up, as does a mysterious handyman who plays some part in the mystery. The real mystery is why movies like these continue to get made. No payoff and what has happened by the end is never explained to its audience.

It eventually had some interesting parts, but parts are all they were. The majority of the movie felt like pieced-together bits with a cheap, extremly disappointing ending. I was hoping the caretaker had some mental powers, like astral projection, which some of the bits would have supported, but no such luck. I have no love for movies that end up being all someone's psychosis, but I can tolerate them if the psycho trip is at least interesting. Her's was not... except for a few tiny bits.

My older child appreciated the math at the end -- how many times would you multiply 1 by 5 until you reached the population of the earth? (Each person is inspired to do a good deed for 5 other people.) The powers of 5 are listed up until they reach over 6 billion.My kids completely got the message of the story and thought it was very cool. The only reason I feel this book is less than perfect is that the writing is not very fluent.

Weird for this kind of film. I am going to take as wild guess that that is because most of the natural audience did not see this and the few who may have really had little to say. This implies no nudity (female) - and who would, with no offense, really wish to see Gil naked. It also implies special effects not good enough for comment, though possibly not bad enough for same either. Overall I have to go with my impression that I have no reason to buy/watch this film.

The best tracks are definitely Morphology and Hypoxia, both of which have that wonderful Roland TB-303 squelching sound that sounds so foreign for a band mostly about \\"organic\\" sounds.Recommended for hardcore Delerium fans, but be wary if you're only into the modern stuff, as this is nothing like it. There are no female vocals (or any vocals other than movie samples) or lush soundscapes - just cold, hard-hitting, electronic sonic imagery."},{"rating":"1","title":"moNOtoNOus!","review":"A no no CD...After the first track you feel you are wasting time with your ears/years.

Keep it up!!","review":"Great story, maybe a little more dawdling than I'd like, but otherwise awesome. I might mention I'm a hardcore SW fan-- just about any SW book I read is gonna get at least 3 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY EXCITING !!","review":"I ust started to read this book and found out that M. A. Stackpole got the best out of Corran Horn and Mirax. I always wanted to know what happened to Corran and Mirax but, X-wing #4cut all of that out and didn't give much detail (besides that they were getting married.) I am on page 124 and I like how this book bridges to the Jedi Academy Trilogy. I am surprised that this book goes into more detail than Jedi Search but also keeps the search for Mirax in it's own part of each chapter . I hope that in the end Corran fids Mirax and when he does I hope she doesn't Give him hell for not deciding sooner about the baby .Well anyways I recomend this book to all of those who are triing to find out what happend to Corran and Mirax after X-wing #4. By far M. Stackpole's best book, keep it up Michael!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and un-nesasary","review":"I, Jedi is confusing and VERY un-nesasary in the series. The first person concept Stackpole uses causes a CONSTANT re-reading of pages. E.g. \\"I'm coming to the acadamy.\\" \\"Great.\\" He replied. Due to the normal 3rd person sceneario we really don't know who is saying what! This book is un-nesasary in the series because it dosen't fall into place. This book takes place during the Jedi Acadamy Trilogy. If you read this before reading JAT, JAT will be very boring because you know what happens. Also the JAT books are just better in general so you wouldn't get all the quality out of them. If you read JAT then read I, Jedi the book is even worse. You know what's going to happen next and this book is just bad in general. So I recommend skipping this one, in fact try to petition this book out of the series. (IF YOU MUST READ ALL THE BOOKS READ THIS ONE AFTER jat.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book about Corran! (need i say more)","review":"As a person of suprior intelligence. I can honestly say this is the best Star Wars book ever written.(Zahn fans breath its okay...really) I love the perspective you can get from first person. It eleminates all the jumping around from the Empire then back. Corran is a great character with a lot of depth he has a real back ground and dosn't just seem to appear out of no where. I also love all the action in this book. it's very suspenseful. And oh my gosh one author is acully not afraid to let Luke make a few mistakes. He actually seemed like a real person in this one instead of a Mthylogical Mistical Hero who no one can touch. Micheal Stockpole also does a great job with Mara Jade.(in my opinion the first person to do this since Timothy Zahn). He also gives us a unique look at the jedi and thier heritage. Don't miss this book it is a classic. Parsecs of any of the other novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book S_ _ _ s ... You fill it in !","review":"I agree with the reviewer who's posted twice about his displeasure of this book. Who the heck is Corran Horn ? And how did he get to be such a powerful force in the Star Wars Universe ?I don't remember this character or the alias he (supposedly) went by in the Jedi Trilogy series ? From the way this book was written you'd think Horn should be running the Jedi Academy !This character, Horn, is soooo into himself that he's a Living Legend, in HIS own mind.And what's up with making Luke seem such a weak Jedi ? After reading (practically) every Star Wars book, including the Dark Horse comic series ... with ALL that Luke has been through and that's from the Light-side to the Dark-side and BACK again, after defeating the clone of Emperor Palpatine and countless other events, you would figure that Luke would be much, MUCH more powerful than Stackpole made him to be.This author should refrain from writing within the Star Wars Universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine look into the Jedi mystique...","review":"While I, JEDI does, at times, read a bit sluggishly, the overall impact of the book is positive. Stackpole gives the reader quite a few interesting insights into the psychology and spirituality of the Jedi Knights, while maintaining an interesting plot and diverse array of settings and characters. Along the way, he even does an impressive job of playing revisionist-historian with some of Kevin J. Anderson's abysmal ideas from the JEDI ACADEMY series.If you're a fan of Corran Horn and/or Mike Stackpole's other Star Wars fiction, buy this book. If you're a fan of the Jedi legend and an enthusiast of the Jedi philosophy, you should *really* buy this book. There are quite a few Star Wars novels about Jedi Knights and Force tricks, but only one that deals with the *mind* of a Jedi- this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new perspective on Star Wars novels...","review":"I thought I, Jedi was well done as a first person novel. However, The first half of the book deals with Corran's Jedi training, then the Jedi part is just left behind. Also, it deals with events in the Jedi Academy trilogy, which is just like reading those books over again. Later, he becomes a Invid and fights against the New Republic, while inviltrating the Invid's command structure. I was hoping a part of the book would be set aside for dealing with the issue of Corran's fighting against the New Rebublic in a military tribunal."},{"rating":"1","title":"recycled plot","review":"I found this book and many recently published Star Wars Titles extremely predicatable and at times boring. The Star Wars univese needs to start coming up with new plots because every book seems to put the characters in similar, recycled positions...I feel that the Star Wars Universe is being polluted and exploited with too many excess novels and Bantam should stop putting out so many new stories. When Heir to the Empire came out in 91 I read it at least 3 times... now, with novels like I Jedi, I find it had to finish one... I think the publishing company should take it easy for a while for the sake of the readers and star wars itself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing, bad story","review":"While the language itself was admirable, the plot was ludicrous. The title is I, Jedi. The main character is a jedi-wannabe who can't do jack, drops out of school, and searches for his wife many months after she becomes missing for no apparant reason at all. I also did not think that he could ionize rouge squadron while flying a tri-fighter (The rouges have a reputation for being good). The description was pretty good, but the plot needs work. I like the parralel to Jedi Search, but Corran really didn't do anything now did he? I know that this is a contraversial book (Some people feel like they are Corran Horn, they should get out more often) but I would think that it is somewhere inbetween. I don't regret reading it, yet like the X-Wing on the cover that is missing a cannon, the book still lacks something."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad...","review":"In fanfiction circles, the book's main character, Corran Horn, is amazingly popular. After attempting to read this novel, I am completely *mystified* as to why. This book is so poorly written that I couldn't even finish it. Corran is inexcusably arrogant. He insults, puts down, and otherwise undermines everyone in Kevin J Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy (particularly Luke), any chance he gets.I *much* prefer JAT to this crap. Not only does Corran have an ego that's limitless, he also comes off as a player that cares precious little for his *wife*. Total fail. If I could I'd give I, Jedi a zero, it's that excruciating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I was dissapointed. There was too much shallow philosophising and reinterpretation of other people's story lines (Lucas and Zahn). If you're going to philosophize, make it thought provoking! Also, too little real charachter study to make the dialog time worthwhile. The rusult was not enough action -- mental, emotional, or physical. I can believe that Stackpole wrote this one quickly, because it looked like he never took the time to go back and trim the parts that dragged and beef up the parts that were really exciting.....A final beef, Luke is a hero and I don't like it when heros are made to look impotent (a problem I also had with Zahn's original stories). Heros can certainly have (and should have) flaws, but that's not the same as impotence. All that being said, if you're as much a Star Wars fan as I am, you'll read the book and enjoy it anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bre's","review":"I loved this book!(Note the five stars. I don't give 5 stars to just anything. Firstly, a great story line. Secondly, Luke is not represented as an omnipotent Jedi like he is in the Jedi Academy Trilogy. Instead he is a human being just like everyone else. Thirdly, Stackpole has done an impressive job with Mara Jade (whom I love). Fourthly and Fiftly, this book has great insights about the Jedi and about the events that are recorded in other books. Sixthly, Corran, whom I was not really keen on in the X-wing books is actually an enjoyable character in this book. Overall, a simply excellant must-read book for any Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecellent book one of the best Star Wars books ever written!","review":"Stackpole totally outdid himself with I, Jedi. It's simply a magnificent read, one level with Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. I, Jedi is the first and only Star Wars novel written in the first person and follows the character Corran Horn from the X-Wing series. Almost al the other beloved Star Wars characters are featured in the story but not as the main characters. This gives the book a very refreshing slant. Stackpole also improves upon Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy, fleshing out plot and fixing inconsistancies etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone, and I simply cannot praise it enough. It is really a incredible creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Jedi Academy Should have been","review":"Michael Stackpole filled in some major holes that Kevin J Anderson left when he did the Jedi Academy. With Stackpole's previous writeings in the X-Wing Novels I knew I was in for a good read. Then realizeing how much of a good read it was it shocked me. Seeing a character from the inside out is always great.The amazeing thing is that in the long broad spectrum Michael Stackpole's work all meshes together into one neat drawn out storyline. The X-Wing Novels and Comic's are all one long Storyline. We see in the books for the most part much of the End Results and breif summeries of what has happend. I highly suggesting picking up some of the Trade Paperbacks. Alot of Tavira's storyline is introduced in the Comic's.Another A+ job for Stackpole."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books.","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has a very complicated plot,but that just makes the book better! Just when you think it is the climax, Stackpole delves into a completly different storyline. I would reccommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not that great.","review":"I've read the X-Wing books and thought they were good, but I've gotten rather sick of Corran Horn. He's been overplayed too much-rather like Kyle Katarn and Kyp Durron. Not only that, but like them he's characterized as almost superhuman in a way. I also think someone should resolve the way Luke Skywalker is portrayed. Sure, in the movies he wasn't all macho but in these books he seems to not be able to do anything at all. Isn't he the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy and also the most intelligent? Then why does he either sit there and do nothing, or pull a trick out of his hat that makes being a Jedi look like being a stage magician? There's no power behind his techniques, just flashiness. Overall I think that this book was a disappointment; just another run-through of the basic storyline that's been echoed over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGGGHHH!","review":"As I read through the Star Wars Saga in continuity beginning after ROTJ I have to admit that this was my least favorite story so far. While Stackpole built up the Corran Horn character towards greatness in the Rogue Squadron books, this long, drawn out, often silly always egotistical novel, bored me to the point where the final 40 pages blurred as I wanted so bad to just finish the book and forget about it. While writing in the first person was inventive, Stackpole as Corran comes across as fan-boyish, as does the constant fact that Corran comes out as the true hero in situations already handled by others in the Jedi Academy Trilogy. I just hope that the newer books stick closer to his Rogue Squadron roots than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozfest","review":"Soo boring, ive read 20+ Star wars books and this was by far the lamest one. Sure, it gave you a better ideal and description of the force, but I kept waiting for something to happen. I stopped towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, Jedi - I, Puke","review":"I'm sorry, but this is the worst Star Wars book I've ever read. I really enjoy most of the books, but I found the trite dialog and hero worship of Corran Horn offensive.I didn't enjoy the first section of the book but didn't find it horrible. It wasn't until he starts lecturing Luke Skywalker about being a Jedi that I got sick. The idea that he could defeat a 4,000 year old Jedi while Luke is blasted senseless is just silly.I also found the use of the dialog to explain everyones' actions really sad. This is high school level writing. Example: \\"You didn't like this book because it had really bad dialog and was utter trash. So that is why you are writing a review. Because you didn't like it.\\"If you want some good Star Wars read Timothy Zahn. Kevin Anderson has written some decent books also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a bad comic book","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst Star Wars novel I have read. It's incredibly cheesy, predictable, and utterly uninspired. On the dedication page Stackpole admits that he wrote it in one month and it shows. Luke and Mara are completely out of character. Luke is basically made to seem unintelligent and lost and Mara is soft. While developing this annoying characterization of Corran Horn, he tries too hard to make him seem good at everything (even better than Luke). It reminds me of a Steven Segal movie at certain points. It has maybe one redeeming scene *SPOILERS* where Corran Horn's grandfather (a pre-clone war jedi) is described absorbing all the energy from a light saber when it punctures a hole in him and causes it to shut down. That's all you really need to know though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book so much I'm posting a second review.","review":"This book is tripe, and I'm in disbelief at the constant praises it's been receiving. Badly written, with boring villains, weak ending, weak characters, weak Luke, absence of Han and Leia, and a Super-Corran (funny, he isn't even mentioned at all in the Jedi Academy Trilogy) all combine to make this one of the lousiest books I've ever read. And to the viewer who criticized my earlier review, TESB had FAR more action than this trash, and the focus of TPM wasn't on Anakin; it was on Qui-Gon. DUH! Even The Crystal Star is better (MUCH) than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the journey","review":"Tepid at best, boring at its worst, \\"I, Jedi\\" managed to turn the exciting world of the Star Wars universe into a dull plod through the day to day life of a Jedi hopeful. It featured a romantic separation that didn't capture any of the angst, ho-hum battles, and even a sophomoric morality lesson about sex. This book had none of the passion that made other S.W. books great, nor did I care about any of the characters in this installment. Although this book didn't sink to the level of the abysmal \\"Courtship of Princess Leia\\", it was lackluster and at times tiresome reading. My advice is to avoid \\"I, Jedi\\" and re-read one of the S.W. books by Timothy Zahn or Kevin Anderson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Jedi","review":"This is a bad book. The first person perspective in Star Wars is truly awful because as an author you cannot expand to include several of the characters. Corran (The main character) is always absent in the critical moment, like when he was conveniently gone when the Jedi apprentices defeated the spirit of a fallen Dark Jedi. I understand that Stackpole was forced to dance around the plot of the Jedi Academy Trilogy, but he fell to his knees doing it. Also, Corran's enemies never make any sense, like when a group of all powerful dark Jedi decide to aid a rogue imperial admiral who has one Star Destroyer and a midget of an armada, rather than siezing galactic power by themselves. Finally, while the characters are often in danger, the New Republic is never in any trouble, which limits the scale of the book. Buy the Jedi Academy Trilogy, by Kevin Anderson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserves zero stars","review":"Like others, I can't believe all the positive reviews. This is the worst star wars book I've read! The first person perspective is boring as it leaves out important events. The main character is boring as well. How can a guy go on for weeks knowing his wife has been kidnapped? The plot was totally unrealistic, even for sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book . Well worth reading","review":"Gave a great insight in other jedi traditions and the founding of the jedi academy. Answered a few questions about the colour of jedi lightsabers particularly considering the hero of the novel has a lightsaber with a silver blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good sci-fi.","review":"The book itself is great. In my copy there were about 15-20 misspelled words, but that didn't effect the book. My one problem is actually with the cover. In the lower-right-hand-corner the X-wing is missing its upper-right laser. It is also the same on every other paperback copy I have seen, even the ones pictured on this site and others. I just wish that there would be a sequal to it with a continuation of Corrans training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but not what I expected","review":"The book jacket summary says that Corran Horn will have to make a \\"terrible choice - whether or not to turn to the dark side.\\" I thought that this \\"dark side\\" of Corran would be similar to that of Anakin Skywalker, who becomes Darth Vader. If you're buying this book with that thought, you may want to reconsider. Corran's dark side dilemma is not quite like Anakin's.All in all, it's still a great book. It's got lots of humor to keep the reader going, and Stackpole does a marvelous job keeping the excitement going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play It Again Sam!","review":"Ummm.... I don't even know where to start. This book was written for one purpose and one purpose only. To make money. It is basically the Jedi Academy Trilogy all over again except the writing it terrible, the characters personalities were not portrayed correctly, and the main character is completely arrogant.The author made Luke Skywalker look completely clueless. I really don't understand why this book was almost rated as good as the Thrawn Trilogy. It wasn't even close!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Question","review":"I have a question for Michael Stackpole: Why did you create Corran Horn? What possible reason did you have of creating him as a character? Whould it not have been easier to use Kyle Katarn? Kyle is a Jedi, like Corran, he has a cocky attitude (Though usually doesn't come across as being pompous). He is a much stronger jedi than Corran is (he can actually PICK SOMETHING UP using the force). He is also pretty easy to marry off to Jan Ors (Who, incidently, like Mirax, is a pilot). So, why not simply reuse Kyle, I find him much more easy to understand than Corran, plus he isn't so stupid as to put a Cubit Zarchonia in his lightsaber (YOU, incidently, are the one who can't spell, Mr. Stackpole)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke the buffoon...","review":"I was disturbed at Stackpole's take on the Jedi Academy. I haven't read many of the X-wing series as space combat given in such tedious detail is boring to me. I liked Corran's character for the most part and kind of liked the idea of different people having different strengths and weakness regarding their talent using the Force.The portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the book was terrible. Stackpole made him out to be an insecure and incompetent person until the very end. Stackpole seems to want to make the Jedi Academy into a military academy turning out Jedi cadets. It seems that an Jedi apprentice should find their own way through the Force with the guidence of their master.I did enjoy the book and I do hope to see Corran Horn in other SW novels just a little toned down a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOOh Brother","review":"I'd have to say that this is the most poorly written Star Wars books ever. After reading them all I really think that Michael Stackpole could do the universe better justice than this. His original X-wing series was great (though hardly the best) and I have to respect the way he uses his own characters. But the feeling I got from reading \\"I, Jedi\\" was \\"In the Jedi Academy Trilogy, Luke Skywalker made this or that move, and then Cilghal did this,while Streen did that. However, this was all really the manipulation of undercover agent Corran Horn,who knows everything that's going on better than the Jedi master whose running the show.\\" Come on! Kevin Anderson's novels where totally awesome, but I, Jedi really felt like it was trying hard to replace their grandeur. Grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly...","review":"This is one of the worst Star Wars books written. The first person view sucks and Corran whines all the time about his dad's death , GET OVER IT. Luke's whiny and weak , and worst of all , a FEMALE Moff??? I thouht the Emperor was biased against females. Daala was said to be the highhest ranking Imperial female , and now we have a female Moff?. wierd. And there is apperently a timeline inconsistency here , since this story apperantly takes place with the Jedi trilogy. Corran Horn sucks. I hate him. And I hope he doesnt look as ugly as he does on the cover , if so I cant imagine why all these females in the X-wing novels were atracted to him. skip this book. nothing important happens anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Jedi of books.","review":"Despite some discouraging reviews on this book, it is my favorite Star Wars book to date. I believe Stackpole's use of first person throughout the book added a great deal insight and excitment. At times you felt as if you were Corran Horn. I also thought the character development was done quite well. Also, the different perspective given from the books that paralleled this one made this story all that much more enjoyable. However, if you have yet to read the original X-Wing series I would suggest that as a prerequisite to this title, and I would also suggest reading the Jedi Academy Trilogy beforehand as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish","review":"Frankly, I'm disappointed. After a bang-up job on the Rogue Squadron series and on the Blood of Kerensky trilogy, Mr. Stackpole seems now to be using his book as a Corran Horn vehicle to the detriment of the other characters. I shudder to think that he may be a participant in not only the Star Wars, but Battletech universe as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch among Star Wars novels","review":"I, Jedi details the life of Corran Horn after the X-Wing novels. He earlier had passed on a chance to study with Luke and the rest of the newly formed Jedi Academy, but he begins feeling lost. Not certain of his path, he bounces from place to place, essentially trying to find himself via that literary technique known as a hero's journey.His adventures call upon him to use all his past experiences, from his origin as a type of federal agent (for the Corellian Security Force), to his time as an X-Wing ace pilot and member of Rogue Squadron, to the time he spent at the Academy.This story is told first person, and it is quite well done. While among the top as far as length goes for Star Wars novels, this book seemed to go too fast. There was nothing, in my opinion, in the way of dull or dragging parts. Just an excellent novel by an excellent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmm.... pretty good actualy","review":"When I first picked the book off the shelves I did so because it was new... I didn't even glance through. On returning home I opened it to find it all writen from a first person perspective... argh!!!! But after slogging my way through it was actualy very good. After a while I didn't notice the 1 st person storyline and just got on with enjoying the book. One niggle though.... while at the academy during the events of the same trilogy, corran is a core character... yet he obviously dosen't appear in the origional. it seems faked. he should have arrived at a later, less important date. otherwise, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of Jedi and pilots","review":"This easily ranks among my favorite of the Star Wars novels. I would highly recommend reading at least the first 4 X-Wing novels first in order to understand where Corran Horn is coming from.It's nice to see a newer character focused on and Corran has (through this and the X-Wing books) been one of the most intresting expanded universe characters. I also liked how Mara Jade (another great character) was depicted. I liked the concept in this book that different jedi have different strengths and weaknesses both in their use of the force and as people in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"I, Jedi, the best book ever","review":"Stackpole's I, Jedi allows readers of his amazing X-Wing series to see Corran Horn's character in a much deeper way, which to me is a very good thing! The storyline combines Jedi and fighter pilot very well, and, contrary to other opinions, Stackpole's portrayel of Skywalker is great! It's good to see Luke Skywalker unsure and vunerable for a change, and addresses a few questions that have bugged me (like why was he allowed to keep the name Skywalker, even though he was supposed to be hidden from Vader?) In all, Stackpole's book is a masterpiece, and I look forward to his New Jedi Order book coming soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I, the reader","review":"I have recently started reading the star wars books.

If you have experienced the mass of information/details/characters that comes from each book, you know it's hard to keep it all straight. What an awesome solution! By telling us what was going on in the Star War's universe while Corran's life unfolds before us, made for awesome continuity. Keep up the excellent work. This well spun tale reflects an author that is a master at his craft. Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and redundant Jedi Academy material","review":"In the end I liked it but it was tough going at the beginning to get into. Stackpole's attempt at a first person account is quite stilted at first but seems to flow better once the story gets going. I thought it would have been much better if less time was spent on the Yavin Jedi academy story which we have already read about before and more time was spent on the new Jedi sammari and the twisted babe admiral. I liked somebody standing up to the two dimensional nature of Luke Skywalker and the great Lucas Good vs Evil dichotomy of the universe but it could have been so much more...I like the other Rogue Squadron novels better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but it falls far short","review":"Mr. Stackpole has apparently spent too much time writing Battletech novels because his characters are too stiff and formal to fit into the Star Wars Universe. It pains me to see a mighty Jedi Master fall and a fascist cop/fighter jock telling him how the Academy should be run and then take off himself to go looking for his wife. Hardly the Knightly ideal. Quite honestly Stackpole has got it wrong about Luke Skywalker- human he may be but not wimpy. I also feel like many readers that this is basically a long self-centred rehash of the Jedi Academy series by Kevin J. Anderson. Wake UP, MIKE!!!!! Do something original!

Customer service acted as if it were my fault and basically did not offer a solution to repair or replace. Buyer beware!I cannot recommend this autowinding unit. Its not the smoothest mechical operation and my wife hates having to wrestle with the hose to unwind it for use. Admittedly, not a well built unit.Just not worth the price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you are very gentle","review":"The retractable hoses are great if you are very careful and gentle. I had three and they gears began to strip after about six months. All three are useless within a year. I used them about once every few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"water waster","review":"What they don't tell you is that this unit wastes 12 gallons of water from a drainage hose when it is rewinding. You will not find out this fact until you read the instructions for setting it up. The instructions also say you can catch the water in a container for watering your plants. I wanted to water my plants with a HOSE, not haul water from a container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"I've owned this product for about two years. It has seen no winters and has generally been used about once a day during summer months. I have 100' of medium grade hose installed.Initially the unit worked very well - it fully retracted all the hose and I made sure never to let it bind up at the end. This summer the unit started slipping and pulsing. After disassembling it, I noticed that not only was the large plastic (very poorly made) sun gear cracked, but the unit leaks internally. It is now completely useless.For $ 85.00 I thought I would get a few years out of it. All the good reviews in here are in for a shock when their units start failing (which they will).If your a fan of nature, you might be impressed by this units ability to safely house a number of different interesting insects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for about 1 year...","review":"I see many of the reviews on this item are high and are fairly current. I suspect that many of these same reviewers would come back in about 1 year and change their rating downward.I too was impressed with this unit.. a birthday gift for my wife. I guess it is a good thing her birthday comes around once a year because that is as long as this things seems to last.It no longer will rewind unless I manually turn the big reel. Stay away from this unit.. It is cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I've had two for about two years. Had problems from the get-go. One quit winding early fall without manual help. The other broke a gear tooth after a month and barely works. Think I will take them out for target practice with my 12ga. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a totally flawed product","review":"I purchased this product and almost immediately had problems. The hose would not stay on track and required that I open the top lid and pull it out. Then the handle to shift between rolling up the hose and allowing the hose to be taken out broke.I contacted the company on two occasions and never received a response. Never have I written a product review on line but this product is so unabashedly worthless that I have felt compelled to share my experience. Run, don't walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good initially and then FAILS","review":"This item seemed incredibly wonderful at the outset. However during its second season it started being difficult to pull out. There were lots of tugging thumping noises. After that started, it would not rewind without my opening the unit and hand rolling the 100 foot no kink hose all the way inside. I would not recommend this to anyone considering the cost of purchase and the short lifetime of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it worked...but not for long","review":"Purchased one year ago at Home Depot for $89.99. It worked well for about 6 months then gradually got more and more difficult to unspool the hose. After about 9 months, unspooling became impossible(required two people to yank on the hose and one person to sit on the base to keep it from moving) and rewinding slow and weak. I will never buy another suncast product again. Expensive junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"batting .500","review":"I bought two No-Cranks, although different models, one has a swivel base, the other fixed. Pretty sure the internals are the same. 1st works great, the 2nd, poor. Squeaks and binds, particularly difficult to unwind.Unfortunately I thought the hose was the problem, and didn't return it. I disassembled it, suprised at the number of internal parts. Found nothing wrong, probably just poorly designed, or maybe the manufacturing tolerances. So I'm batting .500, and wondering if it's worth a few bucks to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working after one year","review":"This item delivers as promised with few minor glitches. My units have both leaked a bit, and the initial connection is somewhat difficult. Yes the hose is neatly re-wound, but both of my carefully stored units do not work well this year. They both require assistance to rewind, yes you must open the lid and assist with a tug on the wheel every one to two turns. That is not to much fun especially if the sharp edges on the wheel cut your fingers. Anyway if you check with the manufacturer, even though their phone states they are closed during their stated business hours you can leave a e-mail message and order parts (if you know what you need) on their website at www.no-crank.com.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"This is an absolutely amazing invention and....it really works. My wife kept telling me not to get it, that nothing like this could ever really work. Well it does, and I am very happy with it. The only issue to be aware of is that it expels water through a 5 foot hose while rewinding, so that can affect where you keep it (or you can get a bigger hose). And if you want to conserve water, you can have it expel the water directly into buckets for use in gardening, etc. Do not hesitate to make this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A low-quality novelty","review":"It does work, but that is about as good as it gets. The quality of the materials used is quite low. I found that you sometimes have to pull pretty hard to unwind the hose which can be annoying. The worse problem is that I had this product for about 2 months and it already has a serious internal leak. These were summer months (no freeze occurred). My next step is to just throw it away and start over with a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Flimsy material","review":"Ok, We thought we had finally found the solution to reeling in the hose! We bought one, tried it, loved it, and bought 3 more! Alas, a lack! The lever to flip broke after just one summer's use. This is the essential lever to rewind. We mailed the company a check for the replacement part. The check was never cashed, and the company never responded. We cannibalized one of the more infrequently used ones. After a few months, that lever also broke.Now we are researching hose reels that work, are not much hassle, and that are built with quality materials. Maybe you could buy this hose reel if you plan to use it just once or twice a year. Might last you a bit then. :p Me, I feel robbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragging out the hose is no longer a drag.","review":"Just ordered a second one for the front yard faucet. Have had one in the back yard for a year now. Works great! Makes watering a pleasure rather than a pain when putting the hose away. A great addition to the yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot...","review":"I collect Roy Loney...with the flaming grovvies and more. Actaully filmed him play at the EMU Ballroom in late 80's with my friends band: \\"The Nads\\" backing him up! He was awesome!!!But I fear that he is struggling with the world as much as the rest of us old rockers...and cannot say I'd buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just gentle ambience","review":"This is gentle but intriguing, electronic with piano. It is so relaxing but not boring, almost stimulating. A great listen after a stressful day at work or whatever. I love it. Reminiscent of old Tangerine Dream but vamped up for the modern ambient generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite McGee_ Hope I Haven't Said this about his others","review":"The trouble with discovering John D. McDonald's Travis McGee series is that there will be no more. Mr. McDonald passed away several years ago. I find myself re-reading his books in order about every other year. They are still fresh, funny (at times) and insightful.I like Empty Copper Sea best because Travis meets the main love of his life. Gretel Howard is all that Travis deserves and more. Meyer, the famous economist and chili maker extraordinaire plays a pretty big role in this installment as well. All the familiar elements of Travis' life are here in this book yet the presentation is still fresh. Do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrator boring","review":"The guy reading this GREAT adventure novel almost put me to sleep several times. The reading of a book needs to be interesting. Inflections, accents, etc. are necessary. If you pay me, I will narrate a book for you. I may even do it free the first time, just to show you my chops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special, but typical of the serials' waning days","review":"This 1950 serial adventure stars Kirk Alyn, more familiar as the star of the \\"Superman\\" serials. This has Alyn in civilian clothes, taking on villain John Merton and thwarting his plans at every turn. By this time the Republic studio was no longer paying license fees for established superheroes, so this is a generic cops-and-robbers story with the standard number of fights and chases, but without any really distinguishing characteristics. Serial collectors may want to see this because of Alyn; if you've never seen a serial, try an older Republic title first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and full of errors","review":"At first glance I thought this book would be really useful. Then I looked more closely and noticed that there were font changes in the book. That must be what they consider an \\"update\\". The book uses outdated terminology and refers to antiquated materials and equipment. There is a small section of the book that might be of some use but this was a compete waste of money. This book is being \\"weeded\\" from my collection immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-organized study!","review":"In this book of more than 700 pages, Ryding presents the essential details of the Arabic language's complexities. The work is well-organized, systematic and thorough and the index facilitates its use."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"Karin Ryding has done a truly amazing job putting together a thorough, well-researched and accessible reference grammar of contemporary standard Arabic. There is really no other way to describe this book but in superlatives. It is a must-have for any learner or scholar of Arabic. In terms of comprehensiveness, accessibility and clarity, it has no competition on the current book market - not only here in the US, but worldwide, including in the Arab world (yes, I know what I am saying). Fifty years from now, it will still be the classic source on contemporary grammar. And, given the sheer immensity of undertaking a project like this one, I am afraid in half a century it may still be the *only* source on contemporary grammar. It takes serious guts to attempt a book of this magnitude. Not many scholars would dare put their expertise to this kind of test. I am glad she did.I'd give it six stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I read about and ordered this product, but it did not live up to my expectations. Maybe it was because our tub is too curved, but I could not secure the bottom bar. (I was able to secure the top bar though.) Anyway, it does not fit ALL standard tubs and tub openings 19 - 26 inches, as advertised. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as secure as needs to be","review":"The bars tighten but loosen when the tub gets wet, my 14 month old has been able to pull the thing down and has on one occasion used the top bar to pull herself up causing the thing to collapse sending her face down into the water, could have been very dangerous. If using this, ALWAYS be within arms reach. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xylon - 'Mooncafe' (Cleopatra)","review":"It's been awhile since I randomly went through my own and / or a friend's stash of CD's of ambient, techno or electronic artists and bands that was issued on the Cleopatra label (or their associated labels). I forgot completely about Xylon - essentially a solo musician who also goes under the monicker Alfred Gregl. Believe that Xylon has another title or two out. Liked what I'm hearing on, especially \\"Bizarre Plant\\", the stunning nine-minute \\"Raumklang (Stufe 1)\\", the somewhat astounding ten-minute title track \\"Mooncafe\\" and \\"Rainforest\\". Plus, I thought that Xylon did a good job of fusing together funk in with an ambient beat \\"Raumklang (Stufe 2)\\". Might draw in fans of Meat Beat Manifesto, Front 242, Psychic TV or possibly Download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfume Unboxed, possibly used.","review":"I purchased this thinking that it would be sealed in a box. Instead the item was not sealed and packaged in a cheap plastic makeup bag. Since it wasn't sealed, I have no idea if someone has used it before (it feels full) and in correspondence with Cosmetics Plaza, they told me that this is the way it came and that it was new.It completely sucks because I bought this as a present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably sweet and strong smell","review":"I love all kinds of perfumes, I never stick to only one product. Though I have to admit, French make the BEST perfumes. This one is just so bad, every time I wore it ( which is only 3 times ), I got a massive nausea.

The models span nearly any leadership situation and frames the issues within the Leader-Follower-Situation (L-F-S) framework. The book goes into great detail on each aspect of the framework and touches on many current issues. It's by far the best book on leadership I have ever seen and it's based on research rather than opinions like most of the \\"feel good\\" leadership books out there. It covers a broad range of topics from ethics and diversity to emotional intelligence, situational leadership, and leading high-performance teams. It also goes into \\"dark-side\\" personality traits and talks about how to select the best people for a given assignment. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of schlock!!!!","review":"This is a required text for a business class at Lawrence Tech. University in Michigan.

Josh's plaintive, sweetly naive tenor is juxtaposed by a rich, sonic backdrop of haunting feedback and wurlitzer that gives an emotional power to his lyrics,yet never cocoons them. Pain and longing are the stuff of these watercolors, and the mesmerizing, subtle arrangments remind me a bit of Chris Whitley's best work on \\"Living with the Law\\". But you cannot pigeon-hole Rouse's work very easily. His lyrics are so personal that the listener at times feels almost an eavesdropper. In \\"The White Trash Period of My Life\\" the simple refrain, \\"happy and willing to die for your love..\\" becomes tremendously moving. David Henry's production--most of the album was recorded in his home studio--is just about perfect. Dressed Up Like Nebraska haunts me, and if you lend him your ears, Josh Rouse will haunt you, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good record","review":"this album is pretty good. it is sometimes a little slow. but, the texture of it is really pinpoint. it just gets into you somehow and grabs hold. its minamalist pop but seemingly intense at times. its a good one to put on and read or relax or drive to. its a good record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nebraska may be dressed up, but it's got no where to go","review":"The monontony of the production of this record kills me. I heard Rouse live on the radio, and was really impressed by \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"L.N. Conversation,\\" but there's a real sameness that permeates the record. Sure, he's got that great R. Smith/Cure pop guitar strum/singsong melodies (which makes those two songs so infectious), but any sense of newness peters out very quickly over a long player. I think the problem is the album has a flatness to it; there is a serious lack of dynamics to the song structures. This record probably works best when you don't have to listen to it the whole way through - a song here and there would stand out next to other/different kind of music. I know a previous reviewer favorably compared this record to Whiskeytown's \\"Stranger's Almanac\\", Freedie , M. Eitzel, E. Smith - no way, no how, no sir. This release is not in the same league as the recent releases by those artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroyed","review":"When I received this book it was completely destroyed.

I got it just to see how bad it would be but to my surprise there are a lot of hot tracks on the album. Now P. Diddy is by no means a great lyricist but he works well with what he has. Also-more importantly, P-Diddy has an eye for talent which really helps this album shine (no pun intended). Either way-Puff has been through a lot and Im glad to see him doing well on this album.

Surprisingly, I liked this album...I couldn't believe it myself really, but yeah I think its a solid album. Some songs are totally wack, but some are dope...like Blast off, Let's Get it, Roll With Me, Child Of The Ghetto, and a few others.

The higher quality the audio equipment the more noticable the distortion.According to Macrovision, the company that has provided the technology to several major music labels, the test has been going on for four to six months. Although it's not disclosing just which titles have been loaded with the technology, at least one has sold close to 100,000 copies, the company said.I have talked to two other owners of this CD with the same problem.

But then knowing Sean Combes he probably did rip it off someone else. This sad attempt at music, crossed with his endless, yet futile crusade to portray himself as a 'hard man' only reinforces the fact that he is a fool. Maybe if Puffy began to make his own music rather than covering classic songs, then maybe he would have respect.This record only furthers his fall from grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!","review":"I'm still wondering why I bought this stupid record. I should have known it was going to be bad since it was by \\"P.Diddy\\".

Both were made for money and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually listened to the CD!","review":"That's right. Amazingly, their are people who make assumtions about this disc because of the artist. Well, let me tell you these assumtions are all wrong, and why you should by this disc:1.All PD talks about is money. Wrong. In most tracks he talks about life experiences (ie the trial, J-Lo, God etc) Cheak I Need A Girl, and On Top. Why can other artist talk about what's real to them and Diddy can't.2.It's all dance music. Wrong. If he wanted to do that their would be samples. On this album, Puff strays from his previous sampling mode.3.The rapers have no skill. Well, that's a judgement call (Loon is cool, but not a convincing Ma$e). But I promise U let's Get it is only the surface of G-Dep's talent.This is really a good album. Not great, but equal to NWO. No this isn't inspiring music (ie. Mos Def or Kweli) but it is what it aspires to be. Like Mase said \\"sold 4 million, somebody got to love it\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from this album","review":"Puff Daddy or P.

Very bad lyrics and weak Beats, that's an awful Album. A lot of things have Changed with the Beats and Guest Rappers, but it has changed and it sucks! Bad Boy Records is better in R'n'B than Rap now, with 112 and Dream, but in Rap they are behind all other Rap Labels. So if you like Bad Boy, buy 112, and if you like Rap, buy Lil' Romeo or Redman."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only enjoyable part was the story...","review":"First off, let me make this clear, I read this book as an asignment for an Apologetics class I was taking, so my opinion could be biased as no teenager in highschool wants to read books like this. HahahaBut on a more serious note, I find Josh McDowell's writing style to be a bit dry and somewhat of a bore. As I stated in my title, the story was the only semi-entertaining part. Of course this book was not made for entertainment but to get you to think deeper on such matters as beliefs and convictions. The only problem was that I didn't need to think deeper while reading this book, because everything in it I had already been told by teachers, parents, or other books. I definately did not get out of this book what I had hoped for!In fact I was glad when my teacher told me that we didn't have to read the last few chapters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Belief","review":"This is an eyeopening book on the current cultural condition of youth today, and reality as they see.

I think that other books on Social Stratification are much better than this one. The author jumps aroung issues instead of discussing them, and uses redundant termanology throughout a sentence, paragraph and even chapters. Throughout this book when the author trys to make a point the reader can become lost and confused due to the author dancing around the main point (or Issue) by using terms like, \\"By and Large\\" and many others to complete a thought, that render the sentence unintelligable. I think that the editors are also to blame they should have deleted that redundant statements made throughtout the book when necessary.

For those who want to sit longer with poses, here it is. It's TWO practices in one! You can choose one or do both, which provides an optimal and full workout.I've spent nearly a year researching and building a yoga library. In the process I've bought some bummers and clunkers.

I tutor students preparing for the SAT and was hoping to find some good sentence correction practice. Unless you are a non-native speaker of English, I cannot imagine that the questions in the sentence correction section of this book would present any difficulty to you. In other words, they just don't accurately reflect the level of difficulty of questions that are on the SAT.The key also contains errors, and some of questions are poorly constructed.

T.E. Lawrence slowly rose to international fame for standing up to Europe's imperialism in the middle east. A superstar following World War I for being both an advisor to Winston Churchill and one of the people fighting against him, his story is a riveting tale that is timeless. \\"The Golden Warrior\\" is a must for anyone who wants to know the entire Lawrence of Arabia story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different take on Lawrence of Arabia","review":"According to Lawrence James's account, the Lawrence of Arabia most of us know is largely a myth concocted in accordance with TE Lawrence's huge ego and his overwhelming desire to present the Arabs, for whom he desperately wanted to secure the right of self-rule, in the best light. James concludes that much of what we think we know about Lawrence, including his infamous rape by the Turks, are lies.

My favorite songs on this album are \\"If Tommorow Never Comes\\" and \\"The Boys from the Bay.\\" If you like Richard Elliot's other albums, I highly suggest buying this one.

It was a pleasure to read this book as it contains: the role of tradition, Church teachings, noted theologians, the place of apparations, Marian prayers and personal reflection all in one volume. Most important, however, Ms. Scaperlanda stresses the place of Mary in Catholic teaching and her role thoroughout the book. Mary is \\"honored\\" by the Church, not worshiped and her role is to point to Jesus. Mary is a model of obedience, that is, of listening to God, and she shows us what God's grace can do in us when we say \\"yes\\" to God. . .it allows Christ to be born in us.

A woman's voice in the background chanting gives the song much more of a feeling of being in the \\"Outland.\\" Track two starts with this kickin didjerydoo beat, building up with some nice synth sounds, but goes quiter instead of slammin at you, only to later bring in some nice drum beats.

Personnel vary between the two, but Phil Woods is the standout soloist on both, although Melba Liston, Clark Terry, Patti Bown, Jerome Richardson, Julius Watkins, and Benny Bailey are among the other musicians offering satisfying improvisations as well. Worthwhile listening, especially for fans of big band jazz.

There is nothing here for ULTRA,the title track is about the only clean track you can blast around your kids. Everything else,oh my God watch out. The guys are vexed to the limit,why?

While it primarily applies to warfare, with a little thought, you can understand how the information within can be applied to anything -- from business to sports.The book is well laid-out, with an informative introduction to the work. Throughout, we get the primary points of Sun Tzu's work, which are further expounded upon by other Chinese philsophers that followed him. In most cases, this allows you to understand exactly what Sun Tzu what saying, there are instances where the quotes/explanations from the other philosophers directly contradict what Sun Tzu said, which makes things a little uncertain.This does not mean you should discount this book -- it is actually an extremely good piece, both for the Eastern Philosophy or Military Sciences enthusiast, but for the beginner as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art with Director's Commentary","review":"I cannot rave enough about this book. As I'm sure most translators or more authoritative people will point out, the translation quality here is superb. But, from the angle of the guy who knows almost zilch about that, the book offers guidance and discipline. While the original is short and to the point, this book offers a more 'warm' (if I can call it that) feeling, with photographic, smooth paper and various related pictures from the time.That being said, this book also features commentary by other guys from the time relating to their opinions of Sun Tzu's words. It's definitely interesting to get perspectives from them and not just the author or translator. I felt that was a unique addition that really added to the book. You can read the whole thing of Sun Tzu's words in a couple days or so, but the deep discussion behind it offers a whole 'nother book in and of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nunca llegó!

UPDATE: Ok so now I have had it for 3 winters and it does great. Gets kinda sloppy underneath your feet with all the wet drippings of the snow but it holds it beautifully. Even when it gets below freezing it turns to ice and still holds everything. Just pull it out when you get sick of all the snow/water and dump it.

Chet Baker had a velvet touch on the trumpet, and an almost niave, innocent voice that invites one into his world. His interpretations of these standards are entirely original and his own. He captivates the quiet intimacy of a hushed candlelight dinner. His boyish charm flows from each song.When he sings the ensemble let's him sing when he plays the ensemble let's him play giving his talent center stage.

The main character in this book resist actually becoming a communist, but by the end of this book Greene removes any doubt that he is one of the unfortunate, naive leftist writers who was still holding out hope for the communists to get it right. Greene knew about the horrors of communism but in this book the good guys are all Soviets and, of course, the bad guys are all those callous, racists, greedy capitalists. Perhaps he never learned what an unbelievable racist Marx (not to mention Lenin and Stalin)actually was? I picked this book up at a used book store because I had read so many other spy writers compared to Greene. To ensure no one else will make the same mistake I did, I am throwing it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The profound yet popular","review":"Like John Fowles, Greene writes extremely readable and compelling yet deep novels. I'm impressed by his ear for conversation in The Human Factor and his comic observation of the way the profound and the banal mix themselves up in our lives.

I am especially moved by portraits. There is something about the portraits that make them very different from most others. The pictures are not posed, but don't seem to be too candid either. I get the impression that the subject is aware of the photographer, but is not posing for him, at least not physically. It is as if the subject is exposing his/her inner soul to the camera. The photographs work, in deeply satisfying way, very well. I know I will look at them again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I bought this for my son at the beginning of the school year for emergencies. Far too expensive on the minutes that must be used before they expire. I tried getting more minutes on their site that you must use and is poorly setup. It keeps looping you on a minimilist site. Good luck trying to find a phone number to call them and getting a human being. I sent email and a day later they responded with a phone number to call. No, the number is not listed on the site. Finally I just gave up and got a free real cell phone for just $10 extra a month on my plan (T-mobile). I'll take the chance of him being responsible than having the frustration of trying to work with this substandard product (there are no number buttons on it and it is difficult to hear anyone) and poor customer service.

I just made sure I added $10 every 3 months. After adding minutes to my son's phone on 7/3/08, it stopped working on 7/05/08. Apparently, the company that provided service for firefly changed. To make a very long story shorter, the new company now charges 35-cent daily fee (without informing us of impending changes), new sim cards were issued with new numbers and balances were not transferred.

To me it sounds completely derivative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: Chet's Voice is Not For Everyone","review":"I'm a big fan of Chet Baker's music but had never heard him sing. I was very disappointed by this album. I find his singing to be flat -- all quiet -- , weak and void of emotion, not to mention that he has trouble reaching the high notes. Perhaps this style of singing was sort of cool and hip back in the 50's, but it leaves me cold.Musically the back-up and Chet's trumpet playing are great as would be expected. But beware, make sure you like his style of singing before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful showcase of Baker's original talents","review":"Chet Baker's voice had an innocent, sincere quality that few other singers have matched (although they've certainly tried).

There are significantly fewer songs, but the songwriting prowess is still there. The problem is that you can have excellent songwriting and still end up with some mediocre songs. There are some truly awesome tunes here, notably \\"I Can't Wait 'Til I Get Rickets\\", \\"The Rewards of Gourmet Cooking\\", \\"The Misguided Self-Punishers\\", and \\"Carmen's Theme\\". That's nearly half of the album. However, when pretty much 100% of the debut CD is great and only 50% of the follow-up is, there's inevitably some letdown, however small it may be.Fans of the first CD will also note that track 66 from that one is in finished form for this CD and is aptly entitled \\"Track Sixty-Six\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before buying!","review":"OK I did not read the reviews and got screwed.

I cannot wait for the rest of the episodes to come out, especially seasons 5, 6 and 7 with Dr. Craig, Katie Jo and Steve and Betty Jo's marriage. If you loved this series, you won't be disappointed.

The production quality is poor, there is very little barre work and the instruction is brief. Much of the DVD is in fact movements which aren't related to ballet.

I am so sick of discotheque boomchickaboomchicka music and 10 pound weights as the new standard for female fitness. This DVD has enough material to merit two workouts.Cons: The final choreography at the end is taught with the instructor facing forward, i felt that if she faced the back it might be easier to follow. The transition between \\"phrases\\" of dance included some pretty quick foot movements. The direction changes are pretty hard when one's \\"studio\\" is a limited space like a bedroom, if you live in an apartment the choreography portion could pose more than a few challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of ballet and exercise","review":"I really like this video. It's a nice mix of ballet and exercise. The last section contains a choreographed routine to the music of \\"Paquita\\" which is one of my favorites! However, this is not for someone with no dance experience. Choreography is very fast and it helps if you know the moves. It could be a little harmful if you're trying to fly through the moves without proper techniques or body alignment. At one point, even the instructor is laughing because it's so fast. It would have been nice to slow down the music a bit, or to mark it to half-time.Overall, fun way to get into shape. Definitely helps to have some dance background!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I like this video for the workout. You are not going to become a ballerina by doing the workout. If you want to learn classical ballet, take a class. This is a traditional workout video. The majority of the workout involves doing floor exercises were you are going to work your abs, arms, back and legs. These are exercises that a dancer would do to maintain his or her body. Yes, there is a section in the beginning were you warm-up doing some ballet moves, and another section at the end were you can practice some more ballet moves. I usually bypass the latter. I would recommend this video. The video was filmed in a dance class, so don't expect a lavish production. The participants also appear to be students, of all ages, who are actually taking a ballet course from the instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL BALLET CLASS FOR EVERYONE","review":"This DVD is the best i own that really resembles a ballet class, it runs for about 1 hour and 40 minutes if you do the entire workout.The explanation is excellent, the music is excellent, the only thing i would change about it is offering a version without the initial explanation of every exercise, after you do this dvd a couple of times you could easily skip this part.This and the NYC Workout Vol2. deliver excellent results in the entire body."},{"rating":"1","title":"It you buy this item, cross your fingers","review":"I ordered this spice rack and one of the arms was broken when I recieved it.

We loved that it had the vibration and the mobile but in less than two months one of the mobiles on the bouncer broke and the other one makes a loud sound. I contacted Fisher Price to see if there was something we could do they were not very helpful they told us to take it back to the store (we got rid of the boxes) or to take the base and one wire leg and pay to ship it back and wait six weeks to get a replacement.

This is a GREAT buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Rest or Play","review":"My preemie son loves this bouncer seat! The toys are colorful and stimulating, the overhead mirror provides lots of entertainment for little ones. The music is soothing enough for when he falls asleep, but also upbeat and the volume can be turned up if you choose.

A worthwhile product that will keep your baby happy when you need a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great item!!!","review":"I really love this bouncer. I bought it for my daughter when I was pregnant and started using it when she was days old. The colors, music, toys, and vibrations really captivate her. At only a week old she is already looking and loving her toys! The only slight problem is the seat covering, which keeps sliding off it's velcro fasteners. I am a little worried that as she grows older and gets bigger(she's only 6 lbs. now), the seat covering will continue to come off. Other than that, I absolutely love it and would reccomend it to any family."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this one!","review":"My son, who is now 10 weeks old, has had this bouncer for about a month.

He recently started trying to touch and grab the little bear and the bee as well. This has been such a great investment. I love the look of it too, and the music is not annoying.

First, the two side holders could not fold out without squishing her in. (And she is small for her age) The mobile was neat. For some reason, the removable bee made her cry on instant. The seat seemed small and like she would grow out of it quickly. However, the fabric is soft. The speakers were a neat unique feature. Overall, she never grew to like it and we returned it. We ended up purchasing the Leap Frog Learning Seat which is really neat and has age appropriate stimulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay","review":"I had read a lot of good reviews of this product which is why we bought it.

Now that she is older, 6 months, the hard toys she just chucks on the floor.

It has a nice deep seat, and a nice size strap on piece in the front (the ocean aquarium's is too short and too small). It bounces better than our other bouncer; the metal frame it sits on is designed the opposite way of other bouncers, therefore, i think, giving it a better bounce when the baby moves. As for the features, I originally thought all of the extra attachments were unnecessary. But my baby loves them! She loves the bee rattle, and loves the overhead mirror/mobile! One drawback. There is no padding down by the frame where the babies kick their feet, so they are kicking on the hard metal frame. So I stuffed it with some padding. But this bouncer was made with a lot of thought, and it shows.

Both are dramatic, a workout for your stereo, but there's nothing new here, in either recording. But anyone who buys this disc surely does not want or expect anything new . . . no doubt my yawn is occasioned by the simple fact that I've heard this music far too many times to find anything exciting in it now that I'm no longer that adolescent boy discovering classical standards.

A single example will serve to show why everyone should avoid this work.The Seals, Trumpets, and Bowls take up 11 of the 22 chapters of the book of Revelation. They are saturated with Old Testament quotations and allusions. Yet LaHaye doesn't use a single Old Testament passage to help him explain these three series. This is completely inexcusable. But even more, when he considers the first horseman (the first Seal), he completely ignores Revelation's own use of the symbolism of \\"white robes\\" and the \\"crown\\" (Greek: stephanos, the crown given to the righteous). By doing this, he turns the meaning of this symbol completely on its head.No one should read this book for anything other than a good example of how not to read the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"revelation unvieled","review":"is a good source of information I have always had trouble understanding the book of revelation in the bible this book has helped me to understand more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to fantasy island..","review":"This book may as well be a science fiction novel.

It is actually a thin silk cloth (with the image spray-painted on it) that droops when you try to pin it to your wall. This drooping affects how the image looks (especially, the logo). If you stretch it enough, you can make it appear somewhat straight, but it never looks perfect.It is very thin and can tear. It comes folded several times in a very small \\"box\\" and you have to iron the wrinkles out of it.

They were correct in that assumption, but incorrect in the long run (but hindsight is 20/20). The earlier Blackfoot albums turned out to be timeless recordings, whereas the ones that had the more \\"modern\\" sound were not nearly as enduring. Both Vertical Smiles and SIOGO are very difficult to find in most markets due to their initial and longstanding lack of commercial success.

If you change a few components in your computer, it will stop working, a crash can easily corrupt it as well.

He doesn't kill to make skin masks, but rather to just thin out the herd of human existence to make room on the planet. He does this from his desert home. Kathleen Benner plays Valora Smith, a woman he has abducted. He has a fancy for her, so he doesn't kill her, but attempts to get her to like him...in his own way. Valora sports a t-shirt that reads, \\"Some call it stalking, I call it love.\\" She is not very likable either, and seriously lacks personality.

I could really relate to how she felt at times and admired her courage.Hyoue is the character that really made the manga for me. He is just so hilarious without even trying to be.

Instead of the Olympian rhetoric usually found in a Stephen Ambrose book, this book is often quite critical of the individual qualities of Allied soldiers and commanders-with exceptions, of course. The Germans, by contrast, are often described as superior warriors, despite the fact that the German formations opposite the Allies involved were considered unfit for service on either the Russian or Italian fronts.

Mr.Lawless has one of the most distinctive voices in music and it suits WASP's music perfectly. My personal favourites are \\"Tormentor\\" and \\"The torture never stops\\". Believe me, the songs are even better than their titles! \\"B.A.D.\\" is another classic, a memorable sing-along anthem. \\"Hellion\\" rocks as well.

Now believe me WASP has as much talent as everyone else. It wasnt really shown until The Headless Children. But I will give this album props because of the songs I Wanna Be Somebody, BAD, Tormentor, Hellion, and LOVE machine. This album is catchy as hell and proves that WASP had something different to add than most other bands in this genre at that time. Now yes I didnt say I liked Animal, and truth is...its an okay songs when you look at what they had in the future (Headless Children, Crimson Idol).

Their last album to be taken halfway seriously was K.F.D. as the band chose to update their sound, bringing in some electronic elements a la Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson. But their first album contains a number of classic tracks like Love Machine, Sleeping in the Fire, On Your Knees and Hellion. I don't get why W.A.S.P. was so controversial, big deal one swear word in the chorus of one song?

This aside, its a cute movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Good movie and kids are loving it. The story is a bit weak, however, it makes it up with good character interactions and slapstick moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blu-ray only buy?","review":"This movie definitely has replay value for kids, which is the movie's audience. Personally I wouldn't buy it in standard definition as it isn't the best kids movie ever, but it definitely looks great in HD and is enjoyable to watch again for the animation (if not the story). My son loves the movie and really that's all that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun for kids and grownups!","review":"My friend and I went to this with kids aged 3, 8 and 12 and everybody loved it! We saw it in 2D and did not feel like we were missing anything. There's a lot of cleverness in here about old monster movies, great sight gags, turning some movie conventions on their heads. The characters are not as deeply developed as those in, say, Up! or Shrek, but this is a MONSTER movie with ALIENS, it is an homage! It's not meant to be a Message movie, just good fun, and it delivers. There is some good action but also a lot of plot. The characters are smart and interesting, and the movie never talks down to its audience like so many kids' movies do. My 3yo daughter did not find it too scary, despite the name it is not loud & frenetic (as opposed to the latest Ice Age, which we almost had to walk out of). Watch it with a big bowl of popcorn as a weekend matinee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT BLU-RAY 3-D DISC","review":"BEWARE IT'S NOT BLU-RAY 3-D FOR USE IN 3D TV WITH 3-D BLU-RAY PLAYER USING ACTIVE SHUTTER GLASSES, i just made a mistake based on some review here that (saying it's a 3-D from start to finish) but i got the disc it's not, the extra has 3-d for just 15 minutes, using a paper frame with magenta and cyan lens - the anaglyph 3-D, in short the old school 3-D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better in theaters until home 3D improves","review":"The movie has alot of potential, but the great cast couldn't pull it off otherthen a fair rating for story telling/watchability. You want a great story, go get \\"How To Train A Dragon\\". The 3D is only made for a short in the extra section, which was the main attraction for this film. Note: the 3D in this blu ray is crappy, no where close to \\"Avatar\\" level. In a 2D version, you lose visually/gimic for what the movie attraction offered in the theater.My suggestion is wait until 3D technology in Blu ray and TV improve and this movie will be much more enjoyable. Two and a half of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster vs Aliens","review":"I bought this movie because it is my little sister's favorite 3D movie.

I don;t know what we were expecting, maybe a funny Shrek-type movie as the kids ones nowadays seem to have a lot of adult humor as well as for kids, to keep us all entertained. I thought the storyline and script were kind of so-so, and it just didnt have that wow factor for me. HOWEVER -- the second time my 3 year-olds wanted to watch it, i thought it was better for some reason. Maybe because i knew the storyline and what to expect. I like Reese Witherspoon, and i think the main character is very likeable because she supplies the voice. I would recommend it for young kids, no scary scenes, and very likeable characters. A decent movie for little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This became one of my favorite animated movies...the characters were funny and easy to love and everyone in my family..of all ages can watch this together and no one complains!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid movie","review":"We watched this movie for our family movie night. We have kids ranging from 1-6years old. My 4 and 6 year old were scared during the movie, and had a lot of questions. After it was done, they wanted to watch it again and again. I think it was hard for them to get into a 'monster' movie, but after they \\"got it\\" they really loved it.

Very cute, not scary for little ones, and there is some adult humor but the little kids really don't catch it. Just a very cute, fun movie - I would recommend this one to anyone! I only gave it four stars because it's not quite up to the likes of Shrek or Nemo or Ice Age - but it's still very, very good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FAST shipping and a silly-fun movie","review":"The shipping blew my mind from the seller, it was second day and awesome. The movie is cute. Funny story and a few moments of pure laughing at the stupidity and genius of the writers. Other parts were a little bit old and less educated thinking moments. The problem with this movie is it's watch about once every year (if your in a crazy-stupid mood) movie.Bottom line this is a nice compilation of older 'horror' movies, and conspiracy theories re-made to show our already over-media fed generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"For me","review":"nice, I have enjoyed it.

A followup to their earlier hit, \\"You'll Never Be Rich.\\" The pacing on this film is great -- it hardly drags at all, has a great ensemble and some genuinely funny routines. The action is set in Argentina (although there's nary a bad accent to be heard in the entire film), and Latin bandleader Xavier Cugat provides all the musical backup. He also gets a BIG speaking part -- if you really want to see Cugie in full swing, this movie is the one to check out! His vocalist, the renowned Miguelito Valdes is also featured in a number at the film's start... Astaire, of course, is also a wonder to behold; these songs aren't his best, but he still shines while performing them! Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"You were never lovelier","review":"Firstly, it plays automatically in Russian but luckily there was someone around who knew how to turn the Russian off as there are no English instructions!

Songs are very soothing and, of course, the dance scenes are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic mix of tunes, great orchestrations","review":"There is a great deal of variety on this album, with tunes from Monk, Mingus, Ellington, Coleman and a few standards and originals by Gunther Schuller and Lovano. The settings range from lush scoring for band and strings to Lovano alone. Gunther Schuller's \\"Rush Hour\\" is for me the highlight of this set- it's a frantic, 12-tone bop line with some fairly free solos. Also outstanding is the arrangement of Monk's \\"Crepuscule With Nellie\\" which manages to capture something of Monk's original quirkiness while still sounding new. This album has a lot to offer, and while some of the tracks are more accessible than others, all are worth repeated listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book","review":"When I bought this bough I had no real idea about the life of a woman in the Moslem world; this book gave me an interesting insight.

I am sure you have. Whether it was in London, New York, or the streets of Berlin. You must have wondered what this masked woman is like inside the veil. If you truly want to experience the real life of a Royal Muslim family, the hareem, and an English family in London and Abu Dhabi, I strongly recommend the book. True and detailed descriptions of mixed emotions will make you fall in love with the characters of the book. The breathtaking descriptions of landscapes, scents and textures of the Gulf will invite you to the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi. The city has changed dramatically since Mrs. Holton last visit here. It is more modern and luxurious. It was amazing for me to see the Hilton Hotel in Abu Dhabi where Mrs. Hilton has stayed and to visit Al Ain city as well. You will read the book in one night I promise you that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as objective as it seems...","review":"Even though the book beautifully unravels the Arabian culture, there are some critical flaws in the way the book is written. Its goes on without any sense of apparent direction or meaning. Also while the author is fascinated and appreciative of the Arab culture, her bias surfaces every now and then as she belittles (no matter how subtle) other peoples from poorer Asian nations. That was a big turn-off. Overall a very fairytale view by a Westerner which is too good to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic view of Arab life and values","review":"Having lived in the region, I was curious to see what insights this woman would give me. I got MANY! She is not looking at the Gulf Arabs through rose-colored glasses and she is neither condemning nor sanctifying their lives. Rather, she is sharing her close insight into a world few westerners really see. I feel I need to comment on another review here that condemns the writer for bowing to her hosts when they doubt the truth of man having landed on the moon... she has obviously not understood the book at all ... I find doubting something you have seen on TV as healthy, and if she read the book through, she would find that views on this subject changed. I definitely recommend this book to anyone (male or female) who is planning to spend time with Gulf Arabs - and others interested in the Arab and Muslim cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"attitude adjustment","review":"i AM LOVING THIS BOOK BUT NOT FINISHED YET.

The flooding buries a dark secret about the town and its people. 50 years later the flooded evil presence threatens to rise out of the waters.The book is such a contrast to the movie. The book is a well written page-turner. The movie is borderline torture if you try to watch it on SciFi with all the commercials.Read the book. Don't let that turkey of a movie steer you away from a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a gift","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book and I gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised because this was really a pretty good read. It was short at 300 pages even. The story moved right along and the build up to something of a disapointing climax was pretty good. There was not a lot of character development and not a great deal of time was spent working on the relationships between characters. This is just a quick fun read with some suspense and some supernatural evil. One character I would like to mention is Sheriff Rogers. I thought he was going to be a cliche, but he ended up being pretty competent and not a cardboard cutout character.

This is a little bit more hard-boiled, first in the series, featuring Hoke Mosely, a detective in Miami. Hoke smokes, drinks, swears, and eats whatever he wants (teeth or no teeth), so this obviously takes place in an earlier decade. Hoke starts out investigating the death of a Hare Krishna at the International Airport, and winds up losing more things than one can count as well as connecting his investigation to a lot of odd twists and turns in the story. Humor definitely plays a part - a large part - but it was a tad to masculine for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE Don't Bother","review":"This was so bad I barely got through it.

I wave my hands and shout everytime I hear \\"Come Ye Disconsolate,\\" but \\"For All We Know\\" is without a doubt my favorite. If you want a great example of early '70's R & B, buy this CD.

They slap some new graphics on every year, but for anybody using Windows XP (or anything derived from NT or later) you're completely wasting your money and the only thing of value will be the Antivirus software. (Don't get me wrong, the Norton Antivirus software is slow and bloated, too, but at least it does the job well otherwise.)Under XP all the other utilities are either disabled, or very close to useless. The native disk check and defragmenter that come with XP work either the same or better than what comes with Norton. Please don't make the same mistake I did.

It really doesn't work. A specific example is Netscape. Netscape has infested my computer and I have tried to delete it through add and remove programs but my Sony (AKA shotty) won't let me delete it. So I thought Norton would go in an tear it out.

WHY???The Antivirus is excellent as usual with Norton. The scheduling doesn't seem to pay attention to your settings. Set what you will, the program still wants to run a couple of times a week, and new a check up.If they enhanced rather than degraded GoBack (suggestions: Allow larger than 4 GB file and run restore the ability to retrieve lost files after a revert), they could do away with a few other utilities in the suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"I dont really understand how everyone can be having problems.

The machine was crippled, startup was 7-10 minutes, opening a program took an additional 1-3 minutes and the virus check would cripple the web browser waiting for every file to be scanned. All was solved by uninstalling the product. Overall it may do the trick at fixing computer problems such as lost files, viruses, windows registry problems, and such.

This biography is nothing but a shrinks' analysis after being cast aside and feeling hurt. Compared to other biographies, you can tell that after Ostwald was dumped he has no solid facts about Gould. And much of what he writes is contradicted by other biographers who were working with Gould's close friends, letters, and other documents.This book is a sham, written by a self-absorbed psychiatrist who wanted to make a buck off of his one-time (and short) association with someone famous. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion","review":"I guess I have to say that I enjoyed the book itself while reading it, since I am such a big fan of Gould but, it just doen't give me any insights on his musical world and Oswalt emphasizes too much about how close they were...

And though it provided some new perspectives, not on new material. I also felt that while he continued to talk about Gould's ego problems, his writing seemed to reflect some of his own ego problems. One cannot forget his contradictory parenthetical statements about Gould's views, and the amount of himself that can be found in a biography about Gould. Overall, it was a good idea, but not necesarily as well implimented"},{"rating":"1","title":"psycho-babble","review":"This book makes you wonder about the profession of psychology. For example: Glenn Gould calls some of his radio pieces, collages of recorded interviews and conversations, polyphonic. The author alleges that this is evidence Gould is pathologically \\"out of touch with reality\\" because \\"polyphonic\\" is a musical term, and music requires pitches. Obviously, Gould is using the term \\"polyphonic\\" figuratively, but whether or not the term is appropriate should be considered a matter of opinion, not psychological diagnosis. Buy \\"The Glenn Gould Reader\\" instead.

I miss the old one. I wanted to like this machine; it is quicker by a good amount. It seems less likely to jam when doing two-sided copies. There, I said something nice about it. Here comes the rest. The main paper tray does not accept envelopes. You're supposed to feed them one at a time into tray #1, a cantankerous option at best, as my success rate with that feed is about 50%. I'll second the earlier report about the occasional need to shut down and restart. The print on ours has begun coming out crooked despite properly set guides on the main tray. The back side of the pages smudge with toner resulting in unacceptable back-to-back printing. I'm looking for an alternative and suggest the same to anyone considering this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regarding the duplex option","review":"This is just a quick comment rather than a full review.Printing in duplex mode (both sides) takes more than double the time of single sided printing. The sheets do not come out printed on both sides. Instead, sheets come out initially printed on one side, but right before a sheet is released in the output tray, it is \\"retracted\\" back inside the printer to print the back side then it is completely ejected printed both sides. So the sequence is: out-in-out which takes close to 2.5 times single sided printing.At least, all this process is done automatically versus printers where you have to print odd pages first, re-insert them in the paper tray, then print the even pages in reverse order."},{"rating":"1","title":"No duplex printing with Windows 7","review":"I bought this printer because it offered duplex printing (printing on both sides of the page).

Hitchcock won two terms in the U.S. Senate, and served from 1911 to 1923. Anyone who is interested in Senatorial biography, as I have always been, will enjoy this work.

This so-called \\"anti-catholic\\" film was released in the 1970s (during a period of intense social repression in Czechoslovakia) not because it was too \\"weird\\" for the censors, but because the original writer of the novel, Vitezslav Nezval, was one of the most celebrated communist poets of the 20th century. He was an upper ranking bureaucrat in the Ministry of Information during the Communist seizure of power in 1948, and in the 1950s became the personal secretary of Vaclav Kopecky, the most powerful (and feared) communist in Stalinist Czechoslovakia. Why do you assume that a good piece of artwork from a communist country must necessarily be anti-communist, or that artwork made by communists must necessarily be garbage propaganda? Get a history book. At any rate this has nothing to do with the film itself, which was released under a brutal political regime in the 1970s, and just happens to be excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your heart will sing","review":"Quiet After the StormIf you love the voice as an instrument, this CD is a winner.Diane Reeves' singing will touch your heart and have you singing yourself.Get this one, even if Jazz isn't your chosen genre.

There is no real feel for being genuine or poignant. Nothing that Stone Sour has created makes me feel connected to their music. I have listened to both Stone Sour and Come What(ever) May. Both albums were the same for me. I feel the same disconnection when I listen to Godsmack. The lyrics are so generic. The vocals and the music do not enhance each other, they just blend together in a noisy bland way. There is no distinct character to the lyrics, vocals or the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Sour Is Bittersweet","review":"Corey Taylor and Jim Root, better known from Slpknot, are now using their pull in the industry to release a CD from their \\"old band\\". Not an uncommon ploy, but this time it's warrented. Stone Sour are basically Slipknot lite with a touch of Staind and Alice In Chains. \\"Bother\\" is probably one of the best songs on the CD. Corey dominates this track by singing. Yes, singing, not screaming. No drums, just guitar. Others, like Get Inside, offer what you would expect from two of Slipknot's front men. Check the samples and make your decision. I loved it. I bought it. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice addition to a music collection","review":"Stone Sour hits the stores again with their second self-titled CD. Corey Taylor and Jim Root from Slipknot, along with a few other talented guys make this band. While, there are some pretty obvious relations between Stone Sour and Slipknot, this band has a name of their own. Sure, some of the songs sound a lot like typical Slipknot. But there are differences as well. Corey sings and shows that he actually has a great voice. The radio-played song \\"Bother\\" is just one of the songs that shows how marvelous his voice actually is. The harmonies, mixed with the guitars and other instruments make this CD and great musical experience. There is little I see wrong with this CD. It is easy to see the relationship between Stone Sour and Slipknot, but that isn't any reason to pass this CD up. Hopefully we will see future albums from this band. They are definately gifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid CD","review":"I was recently introduced to Stone Sour because they are touring with Papa Roach and I have tickets to their concert.

I listen to it all the time and have never had any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"E J","review":"Stone Sour's best album to date. Starts out like a freight train and rocks right up to Corey's final commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot Plus More!!","review":"You may know that the frontman of this group, and the front man of Slipknot, Corey Taylor are one. Now you may think this would be just another band like Slipknot, you're wrong. This band gives the explosive and heavy energy that Slipknot has to offer, but also a slower and not heavey, but lyricly emotionally heavy side as well. If you listen to Slipknot you know that Cory can sing, and he gets a chance to do more than just scream here. Stone Sour is an amazing band, with emotional lyrics, cool guitar riffs, hard and soft sides to show. If you're into Slipknot check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good... But it's no Slipkot","review":"This CD is a good Slipknot alternative. Taking into to mind they're 2 different genre's of music I say this:The lyrics are good, but not as strong and passionate as those used in Slipknot songs.The music is good to listen to when your \\"metal-exhausted\\"Finally, it's a better decision than Murderdolls... Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my thing, got bored","review":"First off i would like to say that although i like a limited amount of nu-metal (system of a down, Mudvayne, i guess you could throw tool in there even though they are more there own thing) I am much more into the harder stuff like nile and black metal like Soilwork and Opeth. With that said this niche of music is not my fortay. \\"Get inside\\" and \\"Bother\\" are decent songs but the rest of it just got boring for me. I try to give it a full listen and i just can't. I end up taking it out and putting something with better instrumentation in. Was not a huge fan of slipknot either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this CD for the radio release \\"Bother\\" which is a great melodramatic balladish song. I expected the rest of the CD to be similar, but it's much more metal than ballad. If you like the \\"hard\\" stuff, this could be a good CD, but definitely don't buy it just for the single. Personally, I hated the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"Their sophmore effort is 10 better than this one, don't bother buying this one, theres only 2 good songs on this album, their 2nd cd is great from start to finish...I bought this one after i had their 2nd album thinking it would be just as good, but i was dissapointed, just go out and buy---Stone Sour, Come What(ever) May....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was a huge dissappointment, Dont bother with it.\\"","review":"This album is a poor metal/alternative rock record.Stone sour are nothing like slipknot, which I thought was greatso I bought the album cause i heard \\"Bother\\". I have to say is this album I got really bored of really quickly, I cant listen to it straight through, its only got 1 great song which is \\"Bother and 2 farely decent songs and they are \\"Enhale\\"\\"Get Inside\\". Funny the only listenable songs on this record by Stone Sour are the ones that are actually promoted as singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is no good","review":"This Cd only has a couple of good songs the rest are horrible, do not waste money on Stone Sour and just stick to Slipknot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot part 2.","review":"Slipknot is one of the worst bands out there- they try to be \\"heavy\\" and instead make noise with turntables. There really is no difference between this and Slipknot except in the song \\"Bother\\". I hearby nickname Corey Taylor \\"...\\". If you want to hear some new bands that actually aren't posers (Slipknot and Stone Sour are), check out Burnt By The Sun (metalcore), Superjoint Ritual (Pantera-style music), Shadows Fall (thrash), or Dying Fetus (death metal). There are more in those genres and if you want to hear a band that isn't exactly \\"new\\" but can blow Corey Taylor[away], Cryptopsy. How can anybody stand this? If I didn't know what this was, I would just say it was Slipknot leftovers from \\"Iowa\\". Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Special Edition","review":"As you might know this is a special edition of the debut album, and it's great, because it features the full debut album plus 5 bonus tracks that were actually released on the 3 Stone Sour singles (Get Inside, Inhale, Bother.) But now you have the chance to get this all in one, which is a lot cheaper. Also this special edition gives you a bonus DVD that contains the band's videos (Get Inside, Inhale, Bother.) Which is excellent cuz you get all the Stone Sour music for the price of just one. Since I live in México I got this Special Edition for $37 Dollars, cuz it's a rare import down here in México.But still a good deal for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot Frontman shows amazing vocals and great lyrics","review":"This album is a combination of metal and just plain good rock.

A must-buy for any metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"I was really suprised when i first heard this cd.

Well, sure. You can call it that. But this deserves 2 stars for \\"Inhale\\" and \\"Get Inside,\\" yet it also deserves 1 star because it is getting compared to a perfect band like SlipKnoT.Buy this if you want a good little time-killer, but if you want a great thrash or speed metal album, go buy Iowa and SlipKnoT, where you could get a better taste of Corey Taylor and Jim Root."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this Singer","review":"I heard \\"Wish We Never Met\\" on the radio one day and went right out and found this CD...the whole disc is amazing. Very bluesy, throaty songs -- in the same category as Sheryl Crow. You can see her in all sorts of recent movies such as Nurse Betty (the best friend of Betty)and Pay It Forward (the AA sponsor).I heard she has a new CD called \\"Shiva\\" but I can't find it anywhere...if anyone knows where to get this, please post a review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathleen Wilhoite, \\"Pitch Like A Girl\\", I love it!","review":"Kathleen Wilhoite is one of the best new artists I've heard in years! The combination of great story telling lyrics and beautifully written music makes her cd easy to listen to over and over. Kathleen performed some of her new songs in St. Paul, Minnestoa in February and gave a great performance. Her voice was as \\"real\\" and enchanting to listen to in person as it is on her album. I would highly recomend her cd to everyone! If you have ever been in a relationship that left you with low self esteem and with an empty bank account,this one is for you! In three words...I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific performance of songs that both surprise and delight","review":"Kathleen Wilhoite not only sings and plays several instruments beautifully on her first CD, she wrote the words and music as well. I was first interested in this disk because of her acting career (ER, Mad About You, L.A. Law, The Edge, Angel Heart, The Color of Night, Lorenzo's Oil) but it became obvious to me that here was a complete surprise. Instead of the usual Hollywood \\"I am an actress, hear me sing\\" effort, her songs are wonderful, thoughtful works that start in one direction and by the end take the listener to a completely different and unexpected place. One wonders what life experiences she has drawn on to fuel these wry, insightful glimpses into her (and our) very soul(s).

It's so fresh and funny forty years later I can't do nothing but love it. I love each tune here but in particular I find LOVELY for real the Burt Bacharach cover and the second tune, \\"I'm gonna make you love me\\". The album is in the Lou Donaldson, Lee Morgan-Sidewinder boogaloo vein, with some personal touches here and there. I love it! It's splendid! Yeah it's a rare album right now.

On my 7250, I had to strain to see things like my PIN number, and it never seemed quite bright enough. I am very happy with almost everything about the 8700C.One of the selling points for me was the ability to view message attachments. Image files such as JPEGs look great, but I need to see Acrobat PDF and PowerPoint files as they truly look. The 8700C does not do this -- it converts the text information to fonts that BlackBerry uses, even when the PDF is created with embedded fonts. Embedded graphics do not show up at all.Now I am considering a subscription for third party software so I can view PDFs and PowerPoint files for $99/year!If you do not have this concern about attachments, you will love the 8700C.I am happy with Cingular service so far, too -- setup was easy and mostly automatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product","review":"I love the product.

A little small, but easy to get used to.My big complaint is that although it says a rebate is available it is only available if you don't transport your number from your old carrier. Now who doesn't have a cell phone number that they want to keep? A 13 year old who is getting his or her first phone?

I would have given this phone 5 stars except I had problems with getting the software to work, and talking into this phone is like talking into a calculator (ergonomically). That is easily fixed with the use of Bluetooth, which I highly recommend. Buttons are extremely small (sacrifice full keyboard for button size). Internet is awesome (for $47 a month I pay, id expect it to be). Not having a camera on the phone, unlike my previous Motorola, makes this phone more business like, and less play. The address book is invaluable. I have around 300 business cards from clients and this phone stores more information than you can find on a business card. The calendar is an organizer and you can program meetings.

The manual feed slot is almost worthless.The font problem is caused, according to HP, by the driver for the printer. It is faulty, and even though HP has released an updated driver, that does not fix the problem. As of June 1, 2005, HP's fix for the font problem is to tell you to load software from another one of their printers (which means you lose some of the funtionality of this new printer).The manual feed is for one piece of paper at a time and is just a slot - no tray or feeder support.There are cheaper printers that will perform the same functions as this printer, without all the font issues.

Featuring an all-star lineup that includes heavyweights Herbie Hancock (piano), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), and Joe Chambers (drums), \\"The All Seeing-Eye\\" is an often fascinating journey of dark moods, interesting textures, and unexpected highs. The frenetic, kickoff title cut has Hubbard and Shorter feeding off each others' energy to the frantic beat of Chambers on drums. \\"Chaos,\\" a great hard bop number, hits you hard with its fierce blows of aggression, while the best is saved for last: the dark and ominous \\"Mephistopheles\\" which is a true mind-blower. A must own for those who like a little spice in their jazz collection, \\"The All Seeing Eye\\"'s power can't be underestimated.

It has a lighter sound than his other CDs that I have heard- Soul Makossa, Bao Bao and Electric Africa. There are big gaps in my knowledge of his music and I definitely want to hear more. His older records knocked my socks off more with their faster tempo and more intense sound.

It is the best basic watercolor book I have come across and I have recommend this book to many of my artist friends both who are starting out and have been painting for many years.

However, after giving great accolades to this book I would not recommend buying the book at this time until the price is adjusted. In April I purchased the book on line new for around $20 and now they are asking over $150. it's a great book but not worth $150.

In this way, he not only delays his journey, but squanders his fortune. In the end, he dies having once more saved a child from certain enslavement and death.

Holmes is forever amazing his friends, the bumbling Inspector Lestrade and Dr. Watson, with his astounding deductions. Because this series is dated, they seem a bit corny at times.

It has every song from Bat Out of Hell, all the best from Bat Out of Hell II and a few others from assorted other albums. These live versions are very well done for the most part.

Really, I am. I even travelled to France with the one intent of visiting the pantheon in Paris where the plaque commemorating him is. My house is filled with little homages to him and The Little Prince. The point I'm trying to make is I almost worship everything that is related to the story of The Little Prince.Almost everything - but this movie was such absolute drivel! I persisted watching it to the end purely out of respect for Antoine de Saint-Exupery, but I was absolutely put off this film so many times. I can forgive trying to make the story a little more modern and child-friendly by the musical numbers, but they weren't even tasteful.This movie took a perfectly good story and desecrated it. I want so badly to apologize to Antoine de Saint-Exupery on the filmmaker's behalf.P.S. Why does the snake/\\"Satan\\" character sing about suicide so happily while imitating Michael Jackson's dance moves? Argh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get enough of that laugh","review":"This is one of my Mom and my favorite movies. I belive it is a wonderful movie for kids and adults alike. We had this on VHS but had to have it on DVD.

I can't remember where or when I first heard of the Little Prince, but it was many years ago. I recently re-read the book, and decided to watch the movie. I wasn't disappointed. The movie was a very well done musical-fantasy. Richard Kiley has such a beautiful voice. Steven Warner, who played the little prince sounded fine also, in spite of his youth. I wonder what ever happened to him? I couldn't find any info on him on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nauseating film","review":"Many people have apparently enjoyed this, which amazes me. It is as sugary, cheesy, and fake-tasting as some punitive junk food. The child is a brat who makes one's toes and fingers itch; the adults are dead to any sort of shame. (The memory of the pseudo-Fox capering round the trees is one I would pay a lot to exorcise.) The worst thing about it is that it exposes something in the book that's better not exposed: its borderline cutesiness and mawkishness. The book keeps its balance, and the result is haunting and beautiful; if you love it, I urge you to beware of this exploitation, which lunges right over into a swamp of stale marshmallow, and spatters the original too. Try instead the new opera by Rachel Portman (also on DVD), which is delicate, reticent, and magical, and will remind you why you wanted to watch \\"The Little Prince\\" and not a romance between Danny Kaye and Tweety Bird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I carefully read the reviews before I bought this DVD. One review panned it severely, but dummy me went with the majority. Yes, the music, if you can possibly call it that, is atrocious. I could not even sit through the whole movie. It was painful to listen to. I can't account for the rest of the movie, but the first part did not follow the original book in which the boy does NOT run away. Acting was mediocre to say the least and the boy lacked the inherent charm of the book. So I will see if I can get a hold of the original French versionEnd result, I will not give this to my grandson.I am sorry I wasted my time and money on this. . . I am donating it to Goodwill, maybe someone else can enjoy it.I would not even add the tag of philosophy nor French literature, that would be an insult.No I am not French :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for Children","review":"I did not read the book. I only viewed this movie. I thought it was very strange, but that is just personal and I would not give one star for that. I gave it one star because I do not think suicide belongs in a children's movie. The snake sings a song telling the prince that one bite from him will solve all his problems, without his body, he will be able to go back to the planet he came from, etc. With the teen suicide rate so high, this is not a message I want in the mind or soul of any child of any age. Also, the snake seem analogous with the serpeant who tempted Eve in Eden, in other words, the devil. I recommend that parents watch this movie first before they let their child view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied with the quality of the Little Prince","review":"I picked this movie up as gift for someone in Europe. It is the classic movie they all saw as children. This version with Richard Kelley is the definitive movie version of the classic story.

Great film and if you pay attention you could get it for a great price here too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Masterpiece","review":"Kudos to Stanley Donen! His vision made this film a exhilirating experience, and gave it a heart.It has a superbly creative cast, especially Bob Fosse and Gene Wilder, who played snake and fox respectively. Bob Fosse's snake looks and moves would be imitated (and made more popular) years later by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. The snake dance is more than enough reason to watch this. Gene Wilder, as the very wise fox, is so endearing. Steven Warner, as the very young prince, is so cute and lovable, you would want to take care of and protect him from all kinds of harm.The music is great, too, especially \\"I Never Met A Rose\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"Never has a cast been so perfectly suited for a film. The chemistry between the actors is amazing, and each turn in their best performances, creating a magical re-telling of the original story.

I guarentee you wont disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Film... some details differ from the book","review":"I bought the movie because I love this book and use it as supplemental reading material for my seventh graders. There are so many literary elements I could teach with this book/movie such as plot, character traits, symbolism, theme. The kids find this book amusing and generally enjoy it. The movie portrays the prince exactly as I thought. The film is musical, which I didn't expect, but still enjoy. Unfortunately, some of the characters on the other planets were totally different from that of the book.

Aun así, la forma en que se han traducido los controvertidos versículos Dt 21, 22-23 refleja que los traductores se han dejado influenciar por ideas preconcebidas, no obstante en el resto de pasajes que históricamente fueron traducidos errónea o confusamente aquí se han vertido al castellano de una forma fidedigna.

This album is the best few dollars you'll ever spend.

I will be more subjective: I enjoy Depeche Mode, and I also love electronic (trance, house, jungle etc.) The way this CD has blended the two is a real departure from any Remix or Single - and is far more impressive. While some tracks are more loosely based on the original songs than others, all tracks bring some melody or hint of the original - beyond that, it's a new experience. I enjoyed every track on this CD, which is quite rare. Despite the wisdom in DANO's review, I enjoyed this CD so much that I impulsively ordered the second - Tansmode 2.02.

Then sadly not too long after that we lost several of them in a helicopter crash.Although \\"fiction\\" this was an insult in how this military character was written especially since our Country has been at war for over 10 yrs. now.

The author is fairly successful in the beginning at keeping her writing interesting until long-winded dialogues that sound akin to attempts at intellectual tent revival start popping up every few pages. Furthermore, I found quite a few of the author's small jibes, especially those concerning one secondary homosexual character, both insulting and puerile. The saddest part is that Ms. Hunt's descriptions of the rainforest, and much of her writing, were quite compelling before rabid faith hijacked the narrative.

On \\"In League..\\", \\"Black Metal\\" is a VERY abbreviated 40 second live version, and sounds much newer. Other songs are later live versions as well on that one.

The questions about Tiger's past are answered only ambiguously, there is very little of our beloved Southron vs. Northern tension, and nothing is truly resolved.Seeing as this is ostensibly the last of the Tiger and Del novels, one would expect a certain level of resolution. However, at the end of this somewhat less than fulfilling novel, the reader is left without any resolution at all.Overall, while the promise of having the questions of Tiger's past pulls the reader through most of the book, there isn't much there to make the effort worthwhile.

I am amazed how sharp these knives are now. The other sharpeners put a good edge on these blades before but this sharpener made the edges smooth and razor sharp to the point where slicing single sheets of paper was unheard of before with the other sharpeners I own.

To see a 17 year old writing a book is a refreashing chamge from what we normally hear about young people today and gives me hope about the future of our country being in the hands of people like Anthony.I think that those other reviewers should look around and hope for more young people of this caliber learning about the world that they will some day be running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orlando Fan..","review":"First, I would like to say that the review by Matisse Musique is completely ridiculous and has no foundation of truth about his personal character. I know Anthony Orlando and he is an inspiration. He, in his almost 18 years of living, has accomplished more than most people could ever hope to accomplish. I am extremely disappointed in the judgemental attitudes of some of the reviewers on here. Calling Anthony an idiot is like calling a red pen a blue one. It just is not true at all.Second, his book is very well written and an interesting read. I enjoyed it and related to it.

He wrote so many great songs I won't bother going over all of them. Just get this cd! You will probably find some great songs you never knew about.

Some combinations of cameras and readers work, Pentax and Casio Exslim. But using a Kodak DX6440 will not get a read on any card reader. Works great in the dock, but you can't take it to a photo lab to print without risk of corrupting the card.San Disk customer support is great, they sent a label to pick up the corrupted card (which worked sometimes when it was new) and sent a replacement card.

However, every once and a while, especially on cameras, the file almost seems to become corrupt. This problem actually happens on the card, for I have conducted numerous tests, all showing that the card messes up the file. It really only happens once in a blue moon, but when it does, it's quite a hinderance.

Honestly, that's the best assessment I can give.The set itself is largely material from \\"Tribe\\"-- this was the tour for that album and six of the fourteen tracks are pulled from there, with the rest distributed across the band's catalog. Two songs (\\"My Global Mind\\" and \\"Roads to Madness\\") get acoustic performances.

Being an artist I really appreciate this book. The illustrations are perfect for photo- copying and can be used for photo transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cahill's Erudition is a Pleasure","review":"Most educated people have some idea about the important contributions the Greeks have made to Western Civilization. We usually learn of their deeds in a hodge podge fashion. We learn about Pythagoras in Geometry Class or Socrates or Plato in an Introduction to Philosophy class. We know the Greeks are important but most of us know this in a scattered sort of way.The beauty of this book is that Thomas Cahill gathers all their many varied contributions and distills them into one very well written single volume. I am sure there are other books that do the same thing. I would also doubt if there are any great scholarly breakthroughs in this book. However, what makes this book special is Cahill's talent as a writer. He has all the erudition and confidence that one associates with an Oxford or Cambridge don. It is good to know that the United States can produce such a well rounded and talented generalist. This book was a great pleasure to read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ancient Greece for Dummies","review":"The brief overview of what Cahill deems important about the Greeks, the pronouncing gazetteer, a page on the alphabet, a miniscule bibliography (no doubt the source of this opinionated arrogant book) were all fine I suppose for people unfamiliar with the existence of Ancient Greece. But the last chapter comparing John Kennedy to Pericles (wouldn't Ted Sorensen have been a better choice?) and attacking President Bush in his facile comparison of the decline of Greece to the current administration, show Thomas Cahill's breezy tome for what it is: Ancient Greece for Dummies.Partisan ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Unconvincing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work on how the Irish saved civilization. But this book was a disappointing compendium of Greek myths, legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book. Taken in its subparts, many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose. Yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight. Where's the big picture? The author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the Greeks' \\"variety of human response, lightening quick transmutations, resourcefulness, and inexhaustible creativity.\\"A subtitle like \\"A Greek Treasury of Personal Vignettes\\" might have been more descriptive and merited another star. But it falls short as a \\"hinge of history\\" with impoverished and even maladaptive connections (FDR as Solon - really?) to the modern world. I am sorry to not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better!","review":"Unfortunately, there is little in the book relating the Greeks to modern life, very few instances of why the Greeks really matter to us. It is an interesting discussion of the Athenians but virtually nothing about the many other Greek City-States, including Sparta, was included, and these other polis are no less important in defining Ancient Greek society as the Athenians. How did the oligarchs and kingdoms abounding in the Aegean two millennia ago affect future history? Is there an element of Sparta in present day governance, or in other aspects of life today? What were the differences in the various Greek States and why did democracy lose out among these various other systems? Is it true that the Athenians virtually argued themselves to death through their democratic processes and were they more successful when they turned, although briefly, to oligarchic rule? This could have been a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short in all areas except sexuality","review":"I wanted this to be a great read, unfortunately it was not. The author spent more time on Greek sexuality, specifically homosexuality, than on any other topic. Every chapter, whether it dealt with Philosophy, Art or War, spent an inordinate amount of time delving into Greek eroticism. In the end I felt that Cahill delighted in using foul language and crass terms for shock value -- they added nothing and certainly became more than annoying towards the end. Cahill opens and closes the book by talking about America and North Korea -- dating the material and making me wonder how serious he was when he wrote it.Thankfully it was a quick read and not too much of my time was lost. I suggest you pass on this book and look for another. You won't learn anything interesting here, unless you want to know more about the sexual habits in ancient Greece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"I had read Cahill's other three \\"Hinges of History\\" titles before I read this one. In comparison with the other three books, \\"Sailing the Wine Dark Seas\\" seems less planned and less insightful. Cahill never really establishes a solid link between the Greek world and our own. This is not to say that he does not explain Greek contributions to art, theater, and philosophy. However, at the end of the reading Cahill left me unconvinced that the Greeks were that important in the shaping of the modern world. Of course, the Greeks did make significant, lasting contributions. Cahill simply does a poor job of making the connections seem important.If you are going to read a Cahill book, I recommend \\"How the Irish Saved Civilization.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much speculation presented as fact","review":"I am enjoying this book, but have the same problem with it that I encountered in \\"Irish\\"; Mr. Cahill makes statements that are clearly speculative read as fact. I could make an extensive list, and these obvious to me...an uneducated dilettante with little scholarly inclination. It makes me question the veracity of the facts he presents that I am not familiar with. So, while I enjoy the imagery and (unlike most reviewers here) his irreverent, gleeful quotation of Greece's more \\"earthy\\" literary offerings, I am not sure how much I'm learning actual history as opposed to Thomas Cahill's version of how history SHOULD'VE been."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Cahill?","review":"The author's excessive vulgar language and needless Bush bashing make me want to close the door on these Hinges of History."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get my teeth into this book.","review":"I found myself admiring the authors intellect but at the same time wondering why his readers would hang in there in such detail about Greek classical writing unless they were experts or had studied them.I found, it wondered a lot and doubled back on the subject more than once.The author's speech about his book was much more direct, entertaining, and interesting than the book. I'm sure all of this is in the book but I couldn't get myself interested enough to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Ride","review":"Again, Mr. Cahill makes ancient times come to life and gives his readers a fresh, organized, and insightful view. Many of the modern era analogies he attempts to establish are biased and clumsy, at best, and have a \\"tacked-on\\" feel. This is a minor distraction from a terrific work and I feel as though I have sailed the wine-dark sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD TO LISTEN TO","review":"I find that with audio, if I am not happy at the end of the first cd, I move on to the next book... This is one of those. I learned little in the first cd, didnt learn anything about why the greeks mattered - maybe he is saving the interesting stuff for the last 4 cd,s."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Sad Use of Writing Talent","review":"One would think a person with Mr. Cahill's education and vocabulary would have found suitable euphemisms for 'c***sucker' and the 'F' word. Masking this garbage under the guise of intellectual freedom and reality is truely sad. Including shards of porn to reflect the art of Greece is another example of Mr. Cahill's taste and sensibilities and more reason to avoid this book if you don't find such things enlightening. Go with Gustav Schwab's \\"Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece\\" or Michael Grant's \\"The Rise of the Greeks\\" or Allen Mandelbaum's translation of Ovid and pass on Cahill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, offensive, annoying.","review":"Mr. Cahill is an accomplished, erudite, sophisticated academic with a gift for simplifying the complexities of ancient civilizations and, thereby, making them accessible to the casual modern reader. Sadly, in Sailing the Wine-Dark Seas, he has allowed his obvious preoccupation with base erotica (often stooping to vulgar phrases that most who are reading this text would not use in discourse with close friends)to obscure the assumed goal of enlightening the masses. Athough clearly more than adequately conversant with the culture under discussion, Cahill provides the reader with only the most superficial analysis and precious little original thought. In addition, Mr. Cahill's anti-Bush political beliefs are permitted to intrude into the narrative, serving only to demean his scholarship and date his work. A very disappointing offering in what is otherwise an excellent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greek History \\"Lite\\"","review":"Actually I was enjoying the book most of the way through. Cahill writes well, without every drab detail that most history textbooks include. My disappointment started around chapter 7 \\"Greco-Roman Meets Judeo-Christian\\" where Cahill applauds separation of church and state. Worse, he takes it a step further and jumps on the Bush-bashing bandwagon, even specifically calling out Don Rumsfeld as an imperialist and criticizing the current administration for a \\"dismissive\\" approach to the UN. Perhaps the author hadn't noticed the UN is filled with dictators and deep corruption. Sorry Mr. Cahill, you just alienated half of your fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective part","review":"These are 600mAH and the one I received was open circuit.Get the more expensive ones that Staples sell.

Although the pictures and some other reviews would lead one to believe it is a great product, the reality is something different. First, the unit itself does not have the feel of quality. The plastic is cheap and the finish is not particularly good. Now, onto the performance. The feeling of the pivot points and joints is poor and not very stable. Once mounted the arm sways and bends, not providing a solid structure for the screen. With a 21\\" LCD screen the arm actually sways a full inch in either direction. It does do the job though and does allow for forward and rotational movements. Again, just not engineered for high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medium grade product cut too small","review":"This is a relatively low quality product made from what appears to be a good material but there is no overlapping where the material is stitched together so I expect it to pull apart before the fabric itself fails. The mirror pockets are cut 2\\" too short so the mirrors have to be folded back against the car to be able to put the cover on without a lot of stretching of the material and the seams where the mirror pockets attach to the made body of the cover.This is the 4th car cover I have bought in recent years and though not the least expensive it is the mostly cheaply made.

I only have two complaints: first, the disc lacks all of my favorite body-opening poses, namely the triangle series and the hip-opening poses like pigeon pose. I find that as a result I don't feel as energized, loose, balanced and strong as when I do one of Bryan Kest's or Baron Baptiste's sessions. Second, and this is only aesthetic, the teacher's manner may get on your nerves. To me that is a minor problem and the I would definitely recommend the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, move on to another","review":"First of all, this DVD does not use any of the inherent advantages of DVDs at all: i.e., chapters, different workouts, and special featuresHaving said that, while this DVD does emphasize more aggressive or challenging postures, in the end, it offers nothing whatsoever over any of the other many Yoga DVDs.

A character gallery is the only added feature.4. \\"Daemon Rising\\" (90 minutes - (side 1)5. \\"My Two Bobs\\" (90 mins - side 2)These two feature length movies continue the story line after REBOOT - The Battle Comes Home. Thanks REBOOT for all the good times and memories. Fans, do you think we can get the original TV series on DVD? Lets try. Amazon.com...Do your thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ReBoot lives on ! ! ! ! !","review":"ReBoot is probably one of the best pioneering computer CGI shows ever made. Season four was very edgy with its content as was Season three, but pushing the envelope is what makes a show better.Four stars you wonder? I think the DVD could have been better. An interview or special feature with the actors / actresses as they worked on ReBoot. Now that would have been quality. Now Mainframe (the company that is) needs to finish off where \\"My Two Bobs\\" ends. We have to see what happens at the end of the hunt. Will Megabyte actually win?? We'll just have to wait..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great, like Seasons 1-3","review":"First, I need to get this out of the way: I loved seasons 1 & 2. They got me into the series and made me love the characters. I hope they're released soon. (I mean, wth? Where are the first two? Why start with 3?) Okay, now that I have that out of my system...This is an excellent collection. You can't fault the DVD in any way. They did a good job. I have no problems with the way the DVD was put together.Now for the content. This portion of the storyline is very cohesive. It's edgy and fun. Sometimes it seems like they try too hard, but other times, you see the early humor of the series come into play. This portion ties up a lot of loose ends and questions that fans had, but it also creates new ones. That's good, though.Overall, it's not truly great, as I feel seasons 1 and 2 were, but season 3 stands on its own if you know the characters already."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!","review":"There is an audio problem with the dvds, but i have recieved official word form Anchor Bay saying a new batch of correct dvd's will be arriving in the middle of june. This problem is being fixed. I still give this dvd a five simply because the show is so inivative and unique. The quality of the picture and the sound are supurb, the only audio problem is with the voices which are lower than they should be. But it really is'nt all that noticable and as this problem is being fixed i strongly recommened this dvd!

I rolled my ankle awhile back and recovery is taking awhile. I will also be using this when I go on jogs and work out in general to prevent swelling of my ankle. I have had it for a day and it is extremely comfortable. It has silicon pads on both the inside and outside of the ankle bones and the compression is quite perfect assuming you measured your ankle right and purchased the right size support. I will write more after having used it for a bit.However, there is little in terms of support to prevent the ankle from rolling. I will not be using this for basketball or any other 'contact' sports where having to break and change speed quickly is needed. The MalleoLoc is probably better suited for that and will be tested soon.Pros: Effective, Stabilizes, Easy To Use, ComfortableCons: Provides Little Support in terms preventing ankle rolling/sprains"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"I wore the Baurfeind Malleo ankle support for three weeks after coming out of an air cast. I'm finally recovered from a bad peroneal tendon sprain. I'm a runner. I wore this ankle support during those first weeks back on the treadmill and on the road. Thanks to the Amazon reviews; I feel like I made the best choice. This ankle support is made of excellent material. It is very fine quality. It's beautifully woven. Stands up to washing. It ended up in the dryer, still came out fine. (I don't suggest putting it in the dryer) Overall, I'm impressed. The gel fit right around my peroneal tendon. It protected it in a way that allowed me to wear my sneakers/shoes without aggravating the tendon. The compression was just right. It wasn't too tight. The top of my ankle measures just under 8.5, so I ordered the III. They were out of the black, so I got the blue colored featured. I would have preferred the low-key black, however the blue is muted enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things should remain hidden","review":"We just returned from a trip to BC where we used this book in conjunction with others.

I say this only because they know the city well, and this DVD is simply 22 minutes of images of their shattered streets. No human drama or personal stories. No images of the attack.

There is zero human aspect here, devoid of voices or people. This video is really just a camera panning across building fronts, broken windows and ground debris after it was all over and no one was around. No chronology, no sensible order of footage. The only human contact is when the cameraman walks past a group of firemen, but they are just sort of standing around their firetrucks. As a viewer I din't feel I was participating, as a matter of fact I felt disconnected. Be aware that 90% of this footage is just panning the streets hours later and the next day. Absolutely silent with no one on the street. The helpless fear we felt that day is not expressed. This DVD is not worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold","review":"Although the opening segment of this film shows a couple of jumpers and one of the towers down, the vast majority of this is just shots of the devastation and the beginnings of the rescue and clean-up with no music or narration of any kind. The filmmakers may have thought both of those intrusive(and in some 9/11 videos they have been) but the absence of both here made this rather cold and unemotional, almost 9/11 as work of art.

The concept was great and my Dad & I were both very excited to try the product. The problem is that this product is just not user friendly and not easy to use.The first time my Dad, who is 80, tried to vacuum seal the top, he broke the lid. Since I had 2 lids, we swapped the lid out and then I would vacuum out the air out of the container. I had trouble with the lid, too. Getting the pump placed just right and then \\"fiddling\\" would commence until the pump was in the appropriate placement before air removal commenced. This morning my dad again attempted to seal and vacuum the air out of the cereal container, again, with no luck.I don't recommend this product.

These are wonderful units for doing a quick marinade of meats and vegetables. I pickle cucumbers and Grabanzo beans and I also do meats in it. This new unit is considerably bigger and appears sturdier. It uses the same simple rubber wine cork type pump down system which is easy to clean.Two things - First, don't overpump. It's not necessary and may promote cracking. Second, Lexan is hygroscopic at elevated temperatures which means it will absorb moisture which may eventually embrittle it and cause cracking, so I don't recommend using the dishwasher. It's easy enough to hand wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Useful Life.","review":"No gurantee. Manufacturer will not stand behind product. Purchased few years ago. Product imploded upon initial test. Manual does suggest nor warn user that over pumping the pump to create the vacum can cause the plastic container to break (implode). The product itself does not offer enough resistance nor give indications when to stop extracting air to form the vacum inside to marinate the meat. Contacted manufacturer for replacement. Manufactuer refused to replace product while it was still new. Never had a chance to test product on meat. Spent over $30 (probably close to $40). I would not give this product any stars. But I'm forced to give it at least one star. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! SAVE YOUR MONEY! No matter how favorable the reviews.

The bowl is large and can fit a few ribs or two good sized steaks. The vacuum pump works great and while the meat does marinate faster there doesn't seem to be any extra flavor imparted if you leave it in there for four or five hours (vs. overnight when not using a marinator).As one or two other reviewers have mentioned, the bowl design does not make any sense. The bottom is curved so the edges of the meat are in the marinade and the middle part is dry. I'll open up the marinator and move things around, but it is a pain. It really seems like there was a mistake that wasn't caught during manufacturing as you would think the bottom should be more bowl like to cover all of the items in the marinator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacu Vin Instant Marinater","review":"This marinater does a great job in tenderizing meats, sometimes in a relatively short period.

The pump has greatly improved; so much easier. But the bowl has a very stupid design. The bottom of the bowl is not level...it's \\"humped\\" whereby the middle section is raised and the area near the edges (where the bottom of the bowl meets the sides) are much lower. I don't get the reasoning behind this! So, part of the meat (the portion that's against the edge) is in the marinade, but the remaining portion of the meat (the part that's not shoved against the edge) doesn't touch the marinade unless you pour a HUGE amount of marinade in the bowl to fill up the entire bottom. Dumb design.

I believe what happened was that the volume of what little air was left in the Instant marinater \\"shrunk\\" due to the colder temperature of the refrigerator, increased the strength of the vacuum and that the sides of the container were not strong enough to withstand the forces.Or maybe it was because there were some scratches on the surface of the container that was enough to sufficiently weaken the container wall. I was cleaning the item with a soft sponge and non-abrasive liquid dishwashing soap.Before this incident, I had done the same as above (meat into Instant Marinader, pulled vacuum and put in refrigerator) without any problems.I think this item has a nice concept, but that the materials could have been stronger.

The curved bottom of the bowl has made no difference in performance. The pump is easy to work.

As has happened to so many others, my lid cracked after only a few uses. Did I pump too many times? Maybe. But this device needs either a stronger lid, a weaker pump, or a vacuum-release valve. It simply costs too much to be so prone to breaking in normal use.I emailed the company about getting a replacement lid. $9.99 for the lid plus $11.54 for shipping to Seattle; just shy of what a completely new unit would cost.I'm generally a fan of Vacu Vin products, but I'm looking for a different brand for my replacement marinater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavors meats wonderfully by drawing the marinade in","review":"I just bought my third Vacu-vin vacuum marinator.

No matter how well you 'align & secure' the top, once you stop pumping after 10+ times, you can hear the air escaping.

Some of the ab exercises are the type where if you do them quickly, as the model does, you are using your back and neck muscles, not your ab muscles, which defeats the purpose of the exercise.The music on the DVD is very annoying, a very short loop played over and over. Many of the exercises seem to be right out of Callanetics, which has a much, MUCH better 15-minute workout in the book of the same name. Also, the chaptering left a lot to be desired--the exercises were all in a single chapter, not broken down by body section worked.

And let me say those negatives are only momentary lapses brought on by the fact that this music is so good that you're completely disapointed when it lapses into just pretty good. Yes, that's mid 60's Beatles and '70 McCartney you hear in there. And, yes, I think George Benson was listening and figured out 5 years later what the heck Nascimento was up to. Yet it's without question of its time, it sounds absolutely early 70's. Except for that little part that...well you get the picture. Or maybe not, because I still don't. It's its own thing, without a doubt. And it can't be described in words, which is why Nascimento chose music.

Indeed, in his book he tells us that he is a latent pedophile. I would not be a bit suprised if he masturbated whilst he was writing it. His book is sickening beyond belief. He has written this book for own sexual gratification whilst exploring his own pedophilic fantasies, and it has no basis in any known fact to what happened to JonBenet Ramsay. It is appallingly written and it appears the publishers could not run to the cost of a proof reader. The idea that this man could make money out of this disgusting book is sickening. I suggest that someone at Amazon is given the unenviable task of reading it immediately and that it be withdrawn from sale.

So what, that's not even what the movie is really about. The movie is about what you would do if you figured out that someone you had accepted into your home had been lying to you all along and had even put your family in danger. This concept creates an entertaining film and makes up for the few unrealistic scenes in the beginnning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeply moving film about a crucial issue of our times","review":"Devil's Own has been badly under rated by most reviewers. The film treats a tragic and ongoing political issue which has deep historical roots. Brad Pitt gives a passionate, convincing and moving portrayal of a young IRA activist. The viewer can understand where he is coming from (to use an Americanism) and empathises with him. Harrison Ford's character also brings across the dilemma he faces as his affection for the Pitt character conflicts with his perceived duty. The film was certainly a contribution to the understanding of the North Irish problem. I also enjoyed it tremedously as a political as well as a personal dilemma film. Perhaps the Harrison Ford character should have been less 'soft' in his policing scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Devil's Own","review":"The format was to large for a letter box film.

I knew this movie was doomed right then and there. And I was right. My goodness what an awful movie. I mean I can't even tell you wtf was going on cuz I was too busy being annoyed with/laughing at Pitts accent and all of the bad acting. Wow, never has a non comedy made me laugh so hard. Heck most comedies don't even make me laugh this hard.Needless to say, I don't know what happens in this movie, I don't even think I could fall asleep to it. I think I actually turned it off, pissed off that I had wasted so much time (45 minutes) watching this crapfest.

The plot wasn't too clear for me, but the fact that the DVD I have of it, has an error in it, probably doesnt help (it replays the first chapter over and over in loop LOL)It was hard for us to know why he was doing what he was doing, where the money came from, who this mobster was, and so on.... like...all right. And now he has his own boat too.... it was all just a bit odd LOL a lot of info was unspoken or skipped.Another reviewer made the good point that the film highlights the contrast of a happy versus a bitter family life; while I agree, the fiml was itself very bland and had little to no dramatic or emotional value or impact.

It is made by someone on the other side of the atlantic who clearly has no real knowledge of the reality of the situation and is sympathetic to the IRA. The truth is, both sides have killed and injured too many people in the last 30 years and it is totally insensitive to release a film which attempts to justify Pitt's IRA characters motives because his family was killed by \\"evil\\" loyalists. The peace settlement is something everyone in Britain and Ireland wants and films like this show little understanding and I urge people not to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted a different ending","review":"When Hollywood finally chooses to make a movie about the struggles, it of course chooses to tell us that even though those nasty Prods have no problem killing our people in cold blood, obtaining the arms to fight back is wrong and must be stopped by Captain America aka Harrison Ford.

The new unit was hooked up in about five minutes to play through our Kenwood Dolby Pro Logic receiver and Advent speakers into our Panasonic 27\\" TV. The sound is (as expected) awesome and the picture is very, very good (not equal to a DVD, of course, but as good as a VCR can produce.) We went (again) with Panasonic's excellent repair history; everything we have bought in Panasonic products still function perfectly. One important feature is the good-sized Universal Remote that came with it that gives commands at wide angles to the VCR, as opposed to other Remotes that must be pointed point-blank at VCRs. There'll come a time when we'll add a DVD player, but for the time being this high quality Panasonic VCR is everything a person would want. An excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finicky and refuses to play many tapes","review":"I actually bought two versions of this by mistake - one was branded Quasar, and was very cheap but gave me problems, so I went and bought a brand name - and found it was the identical model (poor memory of what the Quasar looked like when I was in the store)! Even the instruction manual was identical - just the brand name changed.The controls are all fine and when it records the quality is fine, but it refuses to play many commercial tapes - just ejects them, gets them stuck on loading and I've had to take the top off a couple of times. These are the same problems I had with the Quasar branded one. A real shame, as I believed Panasonic did high quality goods until now.

Commercial advance is lovely, but sometimes it gets confused and zaps through regular programming by mistake--but it's accurate 90% of the time. After all the recording is done, the VCR will re-wind and then re-play the shows you just taped, marking where commercials started and stopped. This is annoying if you want to use the machine, because you CAN'T while this is going on. VCR-plus made life easier too.Unfortunately this unit died after only 18 months. I think that the commercial advance system put so much strain on the motor that it just wore out. We tape about 5 hours of network programming a week (Raymond, Frasier, West Wing, Friends, ER, The Practice) and then on the weekends we catch up on our favorite shows. I guess that was enough to kill it. Poor little thing.

It's extermely loud in fast forward and rewind, but also make noises when in the play noise that are nowhere near acceptable. But worst is the picture quality. I played tapes in it recorded from 2 other VCR's, and ones I bought from the store, and they all had a gritty picture. Even tapes recorded with THIS unit played somewhat gritty.

They are simple to put together using a mallet (or hammer with a towel to blunt any potential damage you might otherwise do to the plastic.)

We wanted a 9\\" that had a quality picture at the lowest price. After searching through reviews this is what we found and have been very happy with the unit. Other reviews indicate the battery life is low but that will likely never be an issue since our van has a power-outlet. The controls are very simple to use which was another huge bonus.

The father is a retired doctor who hoped to bequeath his practice to his eldest son, but the latter died saving a complete loser from drowning. The remaining son hasn't risen to the occasion.I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this movie was adapted from a play: the action is all verbal, all internal. Why was this even a movie? It was serviceable material for a book, to be sure, but the element of film was poor soil for this material: one frequently finds oneself nodding off.It's a very Henry James sort of approach: all the \\"action\\" is internal, psychological. So far, so good. But the film fails for the same reason that films based on James's books usually fail: unless your action is visual, it's probably not a good idea to make a film of it.

Brose blames feudalistic, blue-blooded, aristocratic, reactionary technophobes and the middle-class bourgeois who aped them for supposedly ignoring the impact of technology in the pursuit of chivalric glory (yes, Brose actually uses quasi-marxist terminology to the point of parody). The author does not seem to understand the practical issues involved in resolving the paradoxes between dispersion and tactical control, or decentralization and coordination, all without handy and reliable radios.Echevarria's After Clausewitz was actually published before The Kaiser's Army, but feels like a successful refutation of Brose's effort. Spend your money there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed","review":"The most blatant trait of Brose is his exceedingly negative portrayal of the German forces. To argue that the reason for Germany's' defeat rests on decades of slow acceptance of new technology is foolish. For instance, Brose fails to mention the superiority of German heavy artillery during the first few years of the Great War. Furthermore, it appears Brose is incapable of writing Kaiser Wilhelm II when referring to the German monarch. Calling the monarch Kaiser William is nothing short of arrogance.If you want a fair assessment of the Imperial German Army look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book to have if you like to sing","review":"This is a wonderful book if you love to sing.

He was recording albums faster than Columbia could release them, and when he finally crashed in 1975, the label had reams of material in the vaults.Big Fun could now be thought of as an early 1970s sampler for the master. It was first put out as a double LP and goes from 1970-74, releasing material from all the collectives Miles assembled fromBitches Brewto an even more dizzying army of players fromOn the Corner.So went life in early 70s music when it was common to issue two or three albums annually. Miles moved so fast this contains psychedelic jazz and Corner funk. \\\\All of this material is worth getting, but if you are a serious Milesphile, the album is not needed.

There are good moments, but there are also stretches where the musicians seem to be searching for a groove or just repeating a figure. The performances could have been edited down to about one third their length and had greater impact. This is from Miles' unusual electric period, which some people like a lot, but which many people find abrasive and dull. It's a matter of personal taste.

They are so totally different from anything alse i have ever heard. they dont rap about money, b**ches, and murder. it is so different but still awesome. The lyrics are way better then a lot of stuff that you hear on the radio (like DMX). The beats are fresh and the whole CD is full of awesome mixes.

Add masterful scratching, sampling, and energetic flows, and what we have here is a real throwback -- back when hip-hop was a FUN artform. Does anyone remember the Cold Crush Brothers? Well, this is along the same lines. It would be foolish to review each track: they're all flawless. J5 is bringing back the vibe of the golden age of hip-hop, before platinum mattered and it was all about the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally fresh","review":"This CD is one all hip-hop fans should own. What really sets it apart from most rap artists is its style. Jurassic 5's songs just flow better than anything else out today. It also points to a new direction. Back to the old style of rap, unlike the gangsta rappers who run rampant in the world of hip-hop today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just 2 Dope!!","review":"From Quality Control to The Game to W.O.E. Is Me, J5 drops the illest beats that makes you feel like your taking a trip back to the days of Special Ed & Schooly D. The lyrics are always on topic like in the jam \\"The Game\\" that mixes rap with basketball, DJ Cut Chemist flows heavily on Swing Set proving that he is one of the dopest DJ's around and their freestylin skillz come upon us on \\"Improvise\\". I just can't stop listening to this album, the songs have the funkiest beats, true lyrics, and if ya wanna get yo boogie on, just pop this in yo CD player. I still feel that no songs on this album could ever compare to their truly ill joint \\"Concrete Schoolyard\\" but if you a true J5 fan like me, you would pick this album up cuz you will be groovin from the first jam to the last guaranteed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but could be better","review":"Ok dont get me wrong this albulm is phat. I just expected better. It doesn't live up to their EP. Many of the tracks are dope like \\"contribution\\" or \\"Jurass finish first\\". Some of the earlier tracks just aren't as good as I was expecting the CD to be. Overall it is worth getting. J5 is a group that flows together perfectly. They have a style seperate from most of the mainstream that you are exposed to. They get back to the roots of hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeter than ice cream","review":"Wow, the new album is finally out and it is fantastic. The beats, the lyrics, the flows.....ooo man do they deliver the goods. To see these boys live is an honor, and they are actually really genuine and nice guys.

They have an original sound for these times and they are a refreshing part of today's hip-hop.. This is a must for anyone who loves positive turntablism and old school flows.. If you like Hieroglyphics, Digable Planets, Black Eye Peas, Common, The Roots, DÁngelo, Tribe Called Quest, Slum Village, etc...get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"J5 for real","review":"Wow, I have been waiting years for some real rap to come out and these guys are without a doubt true hip hop. I haven't heard a group that can flow like J5 since De La Soul or EPMD. Pure genious! This isn't any Puff Daddy garbage this is actuall music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out their quality control","review":"With hip-hop slipping into a dark age of wannabe gangsta rappers making carbon copy singles off of other rappers, many fans of true lyricism and talent had given up and left hip-hop to adrenalized 12 year olds. Except for Outkast, and at times Mystikal, there was nothing ground breaking. That is, until Jurassic 5 came around. First of all, what makes this group so good is that they focus mainly on their lyrics. Sure, there are some great background beats, but they aren't the main focus. Instead the focus is thoughtful, INTERESTING lyrics that aren't about smoking weed or shooting somebody or about how many girls they can get. Plus, they also enunciate so you can hear every word they are saying. The music is pretty good. When they sample, they don't sample 70s disco stuff. The variety of sampled music is more varied, and definately more interesting. So for the teenages sitting around in your baggy pants, pick this up for some hip-hop that actually means something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"Just when Rap was becoming stale, Jurassic 5 released their first full length-album. Fresh on the heels of their selftitled EP, \\"Quality Control\\" delivers the multi-voiced stylings of the 6 man L.A. hip hop crew. The lyrics are clever and flow perfectly with Cut Chemist and Nu Mark's tracks. Chali 2na is the outstanding performer here, putting on a rhyme delivering clinic. Quality Control has wide appeal combining underground hip hop elements with the more commercial stylings. This is an excellent rap album that is a must have for casual or hard core fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dj premier cross Pete Rock","review":"This is true hip-hop down to the core. Everything that represents true hip-hop / Jazz / Old Skool is within this highly rated album.Very simlar to Pete Rocks smooth old skool cross jazz sampling with added old distorted beats and exactled scatching make this a real true classic of the modern era.A must buy for all Pete Rock / East Coast style fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a hip-hop album should be","review":"Attention all MC's, looking to gain respect among the hip-hop community and its fans? Look no further than Jurassic 5's \\"Quality Control\\", this album is amazing from it's beats laid out by J5's two DJ's DJ Nu-Mark & Cut Chemist, to it's smooth laid back old school lyrics put down by Jurassic's four amazing MC's Chali 2NA, Akil, Marc 7 & Zaakir. What more could you ask for from an album? Not to much, the best examples of Jurassic's skills are showcased in the songs \\"The Influence\\" \\"Quality Control\\" \\"W.O.E. is me\\" & \\"Improvise\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what it appears to be.","review":"Good cross section of best hits on the first couple dvds, then the collection crash lands.

Reading the FAQ for this printer revealed quite surprising information. Apparently, this printer *requires* you to replace a color cartridge (cyan in this case), even if you're trying to print in black and white only. Now, I don't care how much a replacement cartridge costs, I'm simply appalled that the printer becomes useless if *any* of the four cartridges run out of ink. True, the scanning capabilities are obviously unaffected, but I find if very inexcusable for Epson to have designed the printer with such a nasty flaw.

Only 3 months after purchasing it, it started acting up. Now there is no water feeding the coffee maker. Before the water pump was loud (at least more than I would expect). Also, it would only drip when the setting for the coffee strenghth, but the machine could not handle this setting.I tried to clean it with declasifier, changed the settings for grind coursness, and coffee strength levels... nothing change and all went from bad to worse.I am living overseas so warranty repair or exchange are not options.This was a waste of money!

Coffee is much better than the horrible \\"french roast\\" of Starbucks.It broke down after 3 years, leak from the boiler, of course out of warranty.De Longhi tells you to go to one of their service centers.You have to ship it there ($50), have the boiler and who-knows-what replaced ($200) and have it shipped back ($80, with required insurance). Repair took 3 weeks and over 50% of the price of the new machine, but they did fix it.4 years later the same problem, leaks water all around, plus broken door latch.Called the center (sounds like some guy doing it in his garage), repair more expensive,so it's time to discard it.It is noisy, takes a while to warm up. If you drink the coffee right out of the machine, it's the right temperature, just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent coffee but...","review":"Brand new machine. After the 2nd cup, tried the frothing wand. Steam started shooting from the side and back on the machine. Nothing from the wand.Was a very loud pop and the actual control knob for the frothing wand shot out from the front of the machine and leaked all over the counter...So each cup of coffee has so far cost around $400.Hopefully the amazon reseller will replace it instead of having to send it for repair after 2 cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOUD MACHINE","review":"Great machine.

A tiny rubber o-ring broke and they charged me $20.00 to send a new one. It quickly broke again, and when I called again they wanted to charge again! Got it for free after making a stink. Before inserting it I went online andfound them on sale for $0.03 each. Unfortunately there's a minimum order of $5.00 so I'm waiting for delivery of 167 little o-rings. Better than getting ripped off for $20.00 again.Also another problem occurred soon after purchase. They told me they'd give me the \\"white glove\\" treatment by sending a box to send it back to factory for repair. Never arrived. Decided just to live with the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker!","review":"We saw this coffee maker in Bed, Bath & Beyond for $700 and was able to purchase significant lower on Amazon with a $100 rebate!! Was an early Christmas gift for moving into our new house and it makes wonderful coffee and looks great sitting on the counter. It may not be the most silent coffeemaker out there. We always try to buy American but could not find a coffee machine made here. This one is made in Italy and not China, good quality and easy to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant Magnifica!","review":"I got my machine a few weeks ago. I love it. Its like driving a really well made, luxurious car. The taste of the espresso and the lattes are amazing. Its fast to heat up, fast to pull several shots in a row and the foam on the milk is tight. The temperature of the latte is hot not lukewarm. The temperature of coffee is hot but not scalding. Easy to clean. Perhaps because I was prepared, I did not find it that noisy when its revving its engine. Its a great little Porsche of a machine. Any complaints I have seen on Amazon relate to durability, so time will tell. However, I am comforted a little by Delonghi's white glove policy for repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfect cup of espresso - until it died 2 months out of warranty.","review":"Loved this little machine - takes up less counter space than many others, easy to keep clean and made an absolutely perfect cup of espresso. Milk frother works well and it also of course dispenses hot water, though pretty slowly. Grinds the beans, tamps, pumps, out comes perfect brew at the touch of a button.However, mine decided to break down almost exactly 26 months after I received it - and of course the warranty is 2 years. I'm now trying to decide if it's worth the trouble to send it in and have it repaired, compared to buying a new one. If I get a new one it won't be a DeLonghi. This one started leaking water from inside the inner works into the drip tray instead of making coffee with it. This is my first fully automatic espresso machine, so maybe they all do this, but I think I'll go with a different brand on my next attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Espresso Machine","review":"We had this machine for 4 months, and we are completely in love with it. The espresso is excellent, and the milk steamer outstanding. We use it everyday, suffice to say our coffee consumption went up by a factor of 3. We also particularly like how easy it is to clean (the brewing group comes out easily and can be rinsed in the sink), and the cup warmer (which really warms even heavy ceramic cups).We are very happy with our purchase and hope it will keep working this way for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made with cheap parts, and horrible customer service!","review":"After only four months of owning this machine and taking meticulous care of it (it requires almost as much care as an infant, for heaven's sake!) the steaming nozzle broke off and shot like a missile to the floor, narrowly missing my foot! I contacted customer service and they sent me the prepaid packaging to send it to their east coast repair facility. That was 2 1/2 months ago!!! We still haven't gotten our espresso maker back!!! Repeated calls to customer service have gotten me nowhere, and the wait times are ridiculous! They are all very polite, explaining that it's a parts issue, but they can never tell me when we will get our machine back. I can't believe we paid $800 to have to go back to using our little old Mr. Coffee, (which, by the way, has always worked fine with minimal maintenance).

I have had to send it in once already to have fixed. Recently, it stopped working again. I have tried calling customer service, no one answers. I have left messages, no one returns the call. I have sent emails, and they are EXTREMELY slow at responding, and at this point we are at a stand still.

Then coffee is served at 160-180 F. StarBucks coffee is set at 180 F, maybe a little hot for immediate drinking. The 3300 delivered coffee at 140-145 F, way too cool, since coffee then cools more in the cup. The 5400 delivers coffee at the right temperature of 160F. All the other controls also work excellently.

We have 4 kids who have their teenage friends over frequently, and the machine is put to use making lots of lattes. LOTS. It is noisy, but that is not a problem for us. The decalcification light also flashes after one month, so buyers should make sure to find the water hardness test strip in order to set the machine to your water hardness. Otherwise, the machine will determine when you should decalcify. So far, the ESAM has not made a bad cup of coffee and has been easy for us to use.

For the cost of a upper-mid range major appliance (washer, dryer, dishwasher, stove, etc.) I think I should be able to expect a device with at least some degree of quality. Not so this machine. It is, well, just cheaply made. Cheap plastic. Cheap controls. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Ok, I guess $800 in plastic junk is what the market will bear. $800 will buy a pretty decent stainless steel range, with a life expectancy of 10s of years.

JoJ takes a bonafide metal approach - not Korn-ish \\"nu-metal\\" or the like - and makes it catchy and tuneful. My favorite tracks here are \\"Strawberry Gashes\\" and \\"Nazi Halo\\" with their relentless barre chord wall of sound and angry screaming (it's really more melodic and engaging than the words \\"angry screaming\\" would hint at). The musicianship of the entire seems to have suddenly grown by leaps and bounds from their previous album, which is also a compliment to Jessicka's songwriting and band leadership talents.Since I'm a man, most of the gynocentric lyrics examining the role women are forced to play are, frankly, not really something I can relate to. However, Jessicka's anger is not misdirected, and somehow manages to avoid the cliche fest it could have easily become."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distilled Feminine Rage Rocks","review":"Jack Off Jill trumps their first album with a polished showcase of screamingly passionate, yet melodic, rock n' roll. It's really rare to hear tunes that are this well-written and well-produced that still pack such an emotional wallop. All the songs are worth listening to, but I have to mention Rabbiteen, which features a ten-ton guitar riff that any modern \\"Stoner Rock\\" group would kill for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Hearts Grey Flowers is the best CD ever made.","review":"Clear Hearts Grey Flowers, is the best CD I have ever heard, The lead singer, Jessicka's vocals are simply amazing. Incredible. She sounds better screaming then anyone I've ever heard. Moulder's Bass? Awesome. Helen Storer, and Clint Walsh's guitar riffs are so catchy, I find it very hard to get \\"Strawberry Gashes\\" out of my head. The drums, as in ALL Jack Off Jill CDS, Play out a wonderful beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an interpretation, not a translation.","review":"Like the title of the book says, it's an interpretation, which is simply a summary of someone's understanding of the book, not the book itself. If you've read a decent translation of the Art of War, this might be worth looking into in order to get someone else's opinion on such an old text, but if you haven't, get a translation first. This will only confuse you otherwise.The reason I changed my rating to two stars is because I think that Stephen should make a point in the beginning on the difference between an interpretation and a translation, so people really know what they're getting.If you are looking to get your hands on a translation of the Art of War, go for Lionel Giles translation. The two things that really make it great are the fact that it contains two sections(one with and one without commentary), and the translations themselves seem to be very well preserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic, no background of Sun Tzu.","review":"The book is very easy to read but is missing some very important background information about Sun Tzu.

They're informative. They're cheap. If your child is too young to read, they're perfectly good read-aloud books.What more can you ask for when stocking your kid's library?This book is filled with stunning pictures of snakes being snakes - so if you're squeamish, avoid it. If you're not, though, you're sure to love the snakes eating rats :)One problem I *do* have with it is that not all the information is well-integrated into the text. There are too many little \\"fact boxes\\" on the pages. These just distract from the main text, and make the book harder for beginning readers. All information should have been written as a cohesive unit, not as a page with a separate little box of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snorkel Hawaii The Big Island --New Edition","review":"The second edition of this book is great. There are so many snorkeling sites that this book will be a welcome companion for years. In fact, it has already made the Big Island a favorite.You won't find places like Frog Rock described anywhere else, so you will likely have this fabulous site to yourselves. One can snorkel a different site each day and find them just the way the book describes them. This book helped discover the Big Island in a very special way, and I fully recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Condition Used Book","review":"Book condition was quite good. Good product, good service, good value. Everything was done on time. Thanks for taking care of this well. I would recommend this to others without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is incomplete, inaccurate and superficial.","review":"Only 40 of the book's 126 pages cover snorkeling sites, and the site reviews are usually half a page or less. Access information is sketchy and incomplete, which is too bad since the most important part of snorkeling the big island is knowing how to get to the sites, which are often poorly marked. One map shows the Mauna Lani Bay resort located adjacent to a famous bay and beach (Anaeho'omalu Bay), when it is actually miles to the north. Also, the authors continually refer to the Ritz Carlton Mauna Lani, when it has been called the Orchid at Mauna Lani for years. Only 22 sites are listed, although the jacket claims 26, which is still a superficial look at the many snorkeling sites. The rest of the \\"book\\" is basically a primer for snorkeling generally. This was purchased at the same time as \\"Hawaii-The Big Island Revealed\\", which might be the best guide/travel/scuba/snorkeling book available"},{"rating":"2","title":"Led us to new adventures. Recommended.","review":"We know Hawaii well, but had overlooked the snorkeling on the Big Island. A friend recommended this book, and it got us to try some wonderful sites we never would have found on our own. We even learned a few tips about how to snorkel better. Kealakekua Bay blew us away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoekel Hawaii","review":"I was very disapointed to fine this book had no photo's, just blk/wht line drawings.Most of the sites reviewed are on the west/Kona side of the island, which is fine, if that is where you are going to be staying.Descriptions and directions seems a bit breif and I'm not sure how useful this book would have been.For almost the same price, \\"Hawaii the Big Island Revealed\\", covers many of the same snorkeling spots, and alot more, in much more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Be aware that Carter's excellent story of Lizzie Bordenis edited in this editon. The fabulou8s dinner scene, described in great detail in other editons of this story has been deleted from this version. E. Hobbs"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine collection.","review":"This collection of Carter's work showcases her unique genius handsomely. Her interesting reworkings of popular myths and tales (see also her shorter collection, \\"The Bloody Chamber\\") are classics not to be missed, and this text provides one-stop shopping to get her body of short stories in a portable size. The tight, half-creepy, half-sexy, vaguely nihilistic narratives are rich and textured, and are the perfect length for very grown-up bedtime stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking","review":"This is a great book. I was taken back by her imagery. Her tells are striking and slightly unnerving. I recommend this book to any one who is tired of the usual narrative template. However those who are not open-minded about their ethics, morals, and sexuality, I caution about reading this book. She is a great weaver of words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloying and Difficult to Get through","review":"I tried to like \\"Burning Your Boats\\" so very much, but these retellings of fairy tales with a feminist slant are too much to bear. They're often far too long, far too pretentious, and self-aware. Carter is no doubt very talented, but aside from a few stories in the beginning of the collection, I found the most interesting part of \\"Burning Your Boats\\" to be Salman Rushdie's fantastic introduction. 2/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew on me in a big way...eventually","review":"A day after purchasing this, I was cursing my impulse buying. Boring I thought, not enough happening. But, as with many records, you need to give them time and extended airplay. This I did and now I love it. Good for a remix album - most of the songs sound fairly different to the originals. You don't need to go much further than tracks 2,4,6,7,9,10 and 11. 'Coltrane' is an awesome psychedelic melody and 'Sunburst' builds up to a quality 'chorus'. There's no need to be a System 7 fan either - this was my first S7 buy. Enjoyable, addictive and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The easiest introduction I have seen.","review":"While most Gothic language introductions and grammars assume a very thorough knowledge of Germanic comparative linguistics, this one actually defines most of the technical terms it uses. Has a good explanation of the rules and even some exercises (no answers, though). Seems adequate for classroom or self- study. Texts in Gothic are used from the very beginning (some original, some from ancient sources). Above all, the way the rules are presented and the choice of readings make this book a FUN learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very important book.... wait and see.","review":"Will people 100 or 200 years from now look around and wonder where all of the rivers are?

Obviously being familiar with the band before hearing a song like that, on the radio for instance, helps. Otherwise you'll get some snickers at first.New songs on their latest CD such as \\"River (Depot Song),\\" \\"Dancing In The Light,\\" \\"The Underworld Song,\\" are already out there and hint at a much more highly produced and evolved sound. I look forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photographic Record of this Huge Base","review":"The Images of America series of books from Arcadia are a great concept. In this one, Major Newlin, the historian and deputy curator at the Jimmy Doolittle Air & Space Museum located at Travis near San Francisco has collected 200+ photographs that show Travis from when it was started in 1942 (as the Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field) until now.Travis is a huge base, and has been active in every aspect of Army Air Corp and Air Force life since 1943. The photographs start with one of newspaper headlines saying JAPS OPEN WAR ON U.S.! Within a few months bulldozers went to work building two runways to handle bombers for their last stop as they headed further west.Through all of the wars since then, Travis has been involved and this photographic record shows the people, the equipment, the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for hardcore fans or music people.","review":"I am not a music person but I still appreciated this piece.

I was excited to see the little shell shape as a nice accent, but when they arrived, they were squashed flat and bent out of shape. They are very flimsy, and so they were easy to set back into place (sort of), but you can tell that they are mass-produced and not much care is taken with their quality.

That is surprising since it is a \\"Complete Idiot's\\" series. The applicability to the business side of e-commerce is especially good. The book, taken as a whole, is a great starter's bible on e-commerce and technology businesses in general.

Somehow this book manages to dodge both ends of the spectrum and provides little value to anyone in either category. The main purpose of the book seems to be endless self-promotion for the author's personal web site. I could accept that had they actually provided good examples of how they built a successful ecommerce web site.

Crowd noise is only good when you are also full of beer, and even then, only good the first time.This group not only yells and claps after every good bit, but they know the tunes and crank up the noise when a good bit is coming.

Would you be upset if you bought a book from Amazon and then found out that 10 to 15 % of the pages had been removed? OF COURSE YOU WOULD!

To those of us more familiar with the genuine thing in its original form it's a shoddy hodge-podge of lazy research, self-aggrandising opinionated padding and (most damning)typical sensationalist journalism.Without going into details, Marcus takes terrible liberties with his subjects - by that I mean he tries to be daring and original and ends up sloppy and ridiculous.The best that can be said about this is that it will point people towards the genuine article. Save yourself some time and go to the genuine source material.Or read Stewart Home's \\"Cranked Up Really High\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Catalog of Style Leaps.","review":"I agree that this book is a page turner.

Sinon le livre est très interessant d'un point de vue documentaire et historique. Quant au coté politique des situs, il est tout simplement passé à la trappe. Les surréalistes sont classés d'emblée dans le camp des staliniens. Bref il vaut mieux lire directement ce qu'ils ont écrit pour se faire une idée.Enfin, s'il y a un endroit ou je n'acherai pas ce livre, c'est bien sur ce site (pour tre un brin fidèle à l'esprit de ces gens).Tchao."},{"rating":"1","title":"aged stains","review":"The obvious silliness of someone who is of a very different generation intellectualizing on a subject that may not need it was clearly beyond the scope of the publishers thinking. If this book had anything to do with Punk it would read loud, fast and short.Despite that many view Mr. Marcus as having a level of \\"importance\\" in the field of music journalism, I would prefer that he stays within areas that are closer to his generational concern. Bob Dylan is always looking for another bit of blind praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"an exercise in masturbatory, pointless BS","review":"\\"lipstick traces\\" is nothingbut an incomprehensible mess written by an author driven not by the spirit of dada or punk, but buy the spirit of the dollar signs, a very prevalent one in our culture. the ultimate purpose of this book is precisely nothing, except the opposite of what everything discussed in it respected--money. and jesus, if you actually got into this book, get out of the house every once in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout When You are Short on Time","review":"I ordered this DVD to add to my Crunch Fitness library. It is a great workout that gets you sweating a bit. Since it only is about 30 minutes long, it is good when you want to get in a quick workout. I wish the muscle toning sections had more reps to work up a burn. I am an advanced exerciser and found this DVD pretty good. However, if you are looking for some hard core sweating, this may not be the DVD for you. To challenge yourself, you may want to use heavier weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"great overall workout in a short amount of time","review":"Great work out! I keep it in my rotation. When I want to get a great cardio, strength, abs in, in a short amount of time this is great. Easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout DVD","review":"This workout dvd is ok, not as tough as I thought it would be. I have numerous other crunch DVD's that I like more."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This is the best video I have ever done. I began using it the day my daughter turned 6 weeks old, with the ok from the Dr. Within two weeks I could make it all the way through and by the time she was 10 weeks old I was skinnier that before I got pregnant. I was a size 7 before pregnancy and now size 5 is baggy on me. It is a tough work out, but worth every minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Effective","review":"I loved this workout scheme. With the combination of low impact cardio and weights, you really feel incredible after you finish. When I bought this tape, I was not really sure the weight lifting techniques and I really loved Susan's attitude. As a big fan of yoga and pilates, this tape really kept my interest and is very easy to follow. If you are a beginner, you will love this workout!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I thought that this video was ok. The title is very misleading, I thought. I was expecting a challenging workout but found that this was too short to effectively do anything. It was fairly entertaining but I didn't feel like I got a good workout. The Method Cardio boot camp manages to give you more workout in each of it's 15 minute segments, so I'm not sure what makes this video feel so rushed. Also, there is little discussion about form. If you are doing the jumping lunges, and you do it incorrectly, you could really hurt your knees and end up not being able to exercise for a long while. I didn't mind it for something new to do, but I needed to do another tape right after to feel anything. I will use The Method Cardio Boot camp when I want this style of exercise-it's much more effective and you have the choice to do any of the 3 15 minute workouts or two of them or all of them. You get much more out of your money that way. I'd say pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crunch-Boot Camp Traning","review":"This video is great! I've been working out with videos for years and was looking for something different. This video gave me what I was looking for. My favorite part? The push-up combos! They really work the upper as well as the lower!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructor barks orders at the viewer...not for me!","review":"I bought this video due to the numerous positive reviews I read here on Amazon, and was very disappointed. I know the video is called \\"boot camp\\", but much to my chagrin, the video made exercise feel like work to me, and was not fun (just like real boot camp)! I didn't like the instructor's harsh style of barking orders at the viewer, not to mention the fact that there is not much emphasis on form. It may be a good workout, but the style of the video was such a deterrent for me that I will be sticking to my other videos instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not for intermediate-advanced exercisers","review":"Ok, lets just say I'm not a crazy workout fiend. I do like to feel a nice burn and pain the day after a workout, just so I know its working. This workout was good, I did it with 5 lb weights and I was kinda out of breath at the end of the workout, so I know it got me moving. I was so disappointed when I didn't feel the burn later that day or the next day. The push ups in the workout were awesome, and I still didn't hurt. So I guess this workout is best for beginners getting into shape kick butt workout, but I don't know how good its going to be for advanced exercisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This tape is really great. The warm-up is fun, and the instructor goes right into the workout. It includes all the inportant lower body exercises that really work- like lunges, squats. It has a lot of upper body workouts with weights, and some of the upper body work is done while doing lower body. This is a really efficient workout for only 30 minutes.It will really work your whole body!This video is mostly strenthening and does not have a lot of aerobics. This is a good tape if your new to strength training like I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great (quick) workout","review":"The only complaint I have about this one is that it is a little too short. Which is no problem, I just rewind & do it again! It's nice to have a 30 minute workout on hand, though, for those times when time is short. The girl who keeps making \\"growling\\" type faces is a bit over the top.Basically, though, a great workout wher you will work up a sweat every time, and feel it the next day. Definitely NOT for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFAA certified Instructor Gives Thumbs Up","review":"This video is a great weight and conditioning video. It works for all fitness levels.

You can play this video again and again and you will never get tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"believe the title","review":"i workout all the time. i do it for 2 hours a day everyday. i love it! it just my thing. this workout was the hardest 30 min. of my life. it is NOT for beginers. but it is great for people like me that just love to feel the burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THAT challenging","review":"When reading all of the other reviews posted for this exercise program one thing comes to mind. Why are these people calling this the most challenging workout they have ever done? I got this DVD because I was looking for a good workout to tone. With the \\"Boot Camp\\" title I thought this would be a really intense sweat session. Don't get Me wrong, it is a good workout and probably not suitable for beginners but not exactly what I would call boot camp. You really have to know something about proper form when lifting to use this DVD. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who is looking for a thorough instructor who will explain a lot about the movements and how to correctly do them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tough enough!","review":"Although I did work up a sweat and like the cardio aspect of the workout - which is what I was looking for, 30 minutes is just too little time. You would be better off jumping rope and doing lunges, push-ups and crunches. If you are looking for something that is 30 minutes and you are in fairly good shape - I would keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really aerobics","review":"The instructor cues very well; no trouble following this workout. Unfortunately, I don't think it should be considered an aerobics workout. It was mainly floor work and arms/weights interleaved with some short aerobic-style sequences, but not enough aerobics to do the job -- get the heart rate up and keep it up. I guess \\"boot camp\\" is appropriate if you remember the old idea of boot camp being all pushups and situps ... but I was expecting an aerobics routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $, IMO","review":"The instructor barks her orders like a drill sergeant, that's for sure. The problem is that if you don't already know what \\"out out in in\\" means (or if you, like me, can't even understand what she's saying) you might feel a little lost and in over your head. It's very fast paced, but not actually long or strenuous enough to inspire a sweat. I have tried many times to make myself enjoy this DVD like most of the reviewers, but I don't. Just my honest opinion. I'm sorry if you don't find it \\"helpful\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for beginners....","review":"I do Tae Bo Advanced series and I thought I might give this a try to add some variety. I had NO problem w/ it. It was very easy and just too basic. I have been working out for about 2 years and it just wasn't enough challenge. If you are a beginner this might be for you--but the more advanced stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"death by push-ups!","review":"I really enjoyed the video! Crunch has not dissapointed me yet. It is a hard video and I'd advise to watch it a couple times before attempting to do it. There are a lot of push-ups involved so be warned. But it is a fun video and Crunch has once again chosen a \\"down-to-earth\\" instructor that doesn't intimidate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like you're in boot camp!","review":"Okay, I bought this video about 3 years ago and brought it out of retirement after 2 years and for only 30 minutes, this video kicks your (...)(!!! I was sweating more than I do at the gym, getting my heart rate up, my legs felt like they were going to fall off after the first time doing the workout, it was great! Highly recommended, use it in addition or as a substitution to your regular workout for about 6 weeks for noticeable results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating work out for everyone","review":"As a beginner I find this to be one of the best work out videos I own or have seen. AS a beginner to home work out (and work out in general, bad me!) one of my biggest fears is staying motivated and interested in what i'm doing. I don't want to dread the workout even more then I would normally. This video however was excellent, highly motivational, not overly difficult, and it keeps your attention throughout!! My biggest complaint is probably that the video isn't longer and I can't continue on with this type of workout!This video is definately going to be spending plenty of time in my machine, in fact i don't see me stopping this any time soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomeness","review":"I really enjoyed this workout. Cardio,Weight Training and some Ab Work all in one. It's very short but you can always combine it w/ something else you like to do. The instructor is great.

Maybe not for a beginner though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I used to love this workout when it first came out. It's 5 years later, and of course, I grew out of it.

She's always reminding us to \\"apply the movement to the muscle\\" and then gives examples like \\"move ribs to hips.\\" For once on a home tape I felt certain I had proper form on even the first few workouts. The energy is always high and the pace is fast. I look forward to my Boot Camp workouts! But as a previous reviewer mentioned, this is a challenge to beginners and intermediate levels, but if you've been seriously working out for a while, it may not be a challenge unless you up the weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 30 minute workout","review":"Crunch Boot Camp is fun! It's short, to the point, and fast paced enough to keep up the heart rate. The video shows modifications for an easier workout. Time goes by in a hurry!

I workout daily and use this on my days I cannot get to the gym. The cardio section gets your heart pumping and the weights & push-ups really help to tone. I would recommend this workout to both beginners and avid exercisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me feel strong","review":"I feel so energized and strong after this workout! I bought this video over a year ago and still find it fun enough to use about once a week. When I first started I was using 5 and 8 pound dumbbells and I've advanced to using 10 and 12 pounders. The workout is fun, safe and challenging. My only complaint is that as I've gotten stronger I've outgrown the abs workout a bit. I also usually prefer DVDs, but since you'll do the whole workout in sequence it's not too bad on VHS.I wish this instructor would make more videos-- I'd buy them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe, motivating, and professional.","review":"As a professional dancer, fitness instructor, and Pilates instructor and trainer instructor I can highly recommend this workout. I originally took this out of my public library and kept taking it out until I felt compelled to purchase it for its quality. Sue's instructions are clear and the movements simple and challenging at the same time. You can easily adapt it to make it harder and the modifications are provided. It is comprehensive and efficient and it feels like you are in a class so it is motivating and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better analysis exists","review":"A much better and more recent text on the same subject is \\"Mind vs. Money\\" by Alan S.

This is one of those films where you watch a character evolve in front of your eyes. You watch Matthew Modine's character grow up in the film. As he goes from being a careless flunky who barely made his way through a less than top notch school, you see, as Christine Lahti does, that he has something. And she makes him believe it. And finally, in an emotional scene in a diner and an even more emotional scene in a classroom before final exams, you realize he has. A great film that you can identify with if you've ever known someone who seemed to have so much going for him, but seemed to just want to play the clown all the time. A beautiful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gross Anatomy DVD","review":"This DVD is not sold in stores. I have a daughter who is pursuing a degree in physical therapy and this movie is pretty close to what happens in college while pursuing this degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly well-done","review":"This movie is a fairly standard 80s drama. It reminded me a lot of An Officer and a Gentleman. It is the story of a talented but undisciplined medical student from a lowly background who has an easy time in medical school but struggles to live up to the expectations of his teachers and fellow students. It has some interesting characters that are fairly well-developed through the course of the movie and it gives a good feel for what certain aspects of medical school must be like. There are the usual plot twists for a movie like this involving a number of personal struggles and obstacles for different characters to overcome and a few surprising turns of events. Because of the nature of what Gross Anatomy is, there are a few scenes that might be tough for squeamish viewers to watch, but if you like dramas from the 1980s or are interested in a film about medical school, you will probably enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it before ...","review":"It's not that this is bad in any way.

I started reading her books with her later work and thought I'd enjoy her earlier stuff, too. Boy, was I wrong. Apparently, at this point in her life, Catherine Coulter was much too influenced by the genre common to so many of the 70's and 80's romances. She would have us believe that, after being raped repeatedly by Magnus, Zarabeth would feel anything tender for him? For 2/3's of the novel, Magnus treats Zarabeth with contempt and barely controlled rage and we are supposed to believe that this is conducive to inspiring love and faith in him? Not likely.Also, I know that Catherine Coulter's writing style today is much, much better, but I have to say that the dialogues in Season of the Sun were clipped and the character developement was horrible, with much left to the reader to fill in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Catherine's best book","review":"I love Catherine Coulter books but this one was disappointing at best. The formula for the book which involves female slavery has been used over and over in historical romances but this plot fails where many others succeed.

Or was it her being whipped that was so much better? If I wanted to read about abuse and slavery I'll re-read ROOTS. At least it is well written.

I want some gentle, protective feelings from my hero. And the heroine, I would like to see more backbone and intelligence from her. 'Magnus' and 'Zarabeth' were both lacking of all the ingredients that make for a truly romantic and memorable romance. I liked Lotti the best. 'Lotti' had a bravery and sensitivity in her little body that 'Zarabeth' lacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"Having read other Catherine Coulter novels, I expected this to be along her usual level of excellence. I was wrong. In the introduction she states this isn't a rewrite of the novel, just putting it in different clothes -- she should have done some rewriting! The characterization leaves much to be desired, the hero or heroine don't inspire any empathy, the writing at times feels emotionless (her complete lack of emotional punctuation, such as exclamation points, is an excellent example) and the dialogue is clipped and underdeveloped. While the idea behind the story is good, the actual story itself is not up to Coulter's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"MWHAHAHAHA da Prowlers will get u..............","review":"its a cool book wit lots of gore and i just bought da 2nd one so ya...... and da person Courtney is cool!!!cya"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"Jack Dwyer runs a bar in Boston with his sister Courtney and is having a pretty good life. However, the morning after a date, Jack wakes up to find out that his best friend Archie was murdered. Later, as if things weren't bad enough, Artie's ghost appears from a place called the ghostlands to warn Jack about the things caused Artie's death: the Prowlers. The Prowlers are wolflike creatures that are able to masquerade as humans and have been living since before mankind appeared. When Jack sees the damage the Prowlers can cause first hand, he wants revenge. Jack has decided to hunt the Prowlers, but with bold leader Owen Tanzer, things won't be easy. Unfortunately, the Prowlers know where Jack lives, and they want to hunt. However, when a group of Prowlers attacks the bar, Jack's world goes even more out of wack... Prowlers is a great book and one that I definitely recommend reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book in a thrilling new series.","review":"Jack Dwyer lost his mother in a car accident when he was just ten. Nine years later, Jack and his older sister Courtney run Bridget's, an Irish pub and restaurant in Boston. When Jack's best friend Artie is brutally murdered, he is devastated, as is Artie's girlfriend, Molly. But soon, Jack and Molly begin to suspect there was more to Artie's death that simple murder. When Jack is visited by Artie's ghost, he discovers that his best friend's killers were the Prowlers, an ancient race of beats that can make themselves appear human. And to make matters worse, the Prowlers have marked Jack and Molly as their next prey - for no human can discover the truth and live. Now they are fleeing for their lives, and must take one last, desperate chance. The odds are against them. But Jack and Molly are determined to survive.

The first day I used it, I was at an outdoors festival where I was running a booth. I was sweating more than I ever had since I started wearing antipersperiant because the product didn't do a thing for me. Even under average weather conditions (75 degress F) the product seems to start to weaken after an hour or two. Also, the scent mixes with my natural body odor (which is not offensive unless I've been working out hardcore) and creates a bizarre smell. The price is good, even if you want to give it a try it's not a bank breaker.

I can tell you that they are not easy but they do work. When I do \\"Static wall\\" I can feel the knots in my upper back just melt away. The only problem I have with doing the exercises is the length of time they take. But taking time to improve our health is a choice we make for ourselves and probably most of us should take more time than we do. I did recover in large part to these exercises and a new concept of how the body compensates for poor posture.

The text is filled with errors--basic grammar, punctuation, misspelling, etc.--making it difficult to read. The subject deserved better treatment. Readers who care anything about the English language should pass on this sad attempt at a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersive,pulsating techno heaven!","review":"Astralasia are the best kept secret in Electronic music today.\\"Seven Pointed Star\\" will drown you in lush trance soundscapes and blow your mind the first time you hear it.Expect to hear a lot more of Astralasia in the future.Essential to any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Freaked Out GOA Techno Trance","review":"Astralasia's Seven Pointed Star is a mind bending Trance LP.

Too often ignored because his position on Indian removal, Jackson was a genuine patriot, worthy of admiration and, yes, awe. Brands did justice to this tough, son-of-the-west, whose courage is sorely lacking in the leaders of the common age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man for His Time","review":"Typical of his time,and perhaps of today,a man dedicated to the belief in America\`s Manifest Destiny and dedicated to killing anybody who stood in its way.But also a fascinating Life Story of a man who had empathy with underdogs in his own society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times","review":"Brands gives us a stellar, well researched, and documented work covering a slighted historical era in America. This is a must read for Early American History buffs and affords an insightful look at a very interesting figure, Andrew Jackson. The political upheaval of this period is captured well. I was hoping for a more critical approach, but can understand the devotion Mr. Brand has for his subject. From my viewpoint as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, I could not have been as kind or objective as he."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another triumph for Brands","review":"As always Brands delivers a comprehensive but totally readable work of nonfiction. As far as the scope of the book I believe it is the best book out there on Jackson. Brands is truly a great writer who really wants to tell the story of his subject. My only problem with this book is that I think Brands has been too quick to overlook some of Jackson's faults. Issues such as his failure to obey orders in Florida, or his actions towards Native Americans (even those who fought with Jackson) are simply glossed over as the actions of a man doing what was best for his country. This of course was the excuse for countless despots throughout history and Jackson shouldn't be given a free pass on some of these issues. However he clearly made a great diference in the history of his country and this book makes that clear in a book that is very enjoyable to read. For a totally different perspective on Jackson read Burstein's book The Passions of Andrew Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History...","review":"The book is incredibly well written. There is much more information on Jackson's earlier life that I would have expected (though that may be a nieve assumption). Also, if you're interested, Brands includes enough detail of other events during this part of American history that enables the reader to better understand the aspects that specificaly involve Jackson. It really is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man On The $20 Bill","review":"One of the mosty important presidents who has been recently ignored out of fears for political incorrectness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Critical Look at an American Legend","review":"The phrase \\"Jacksonian\\" has a specific meaning in American history and sociology. Populism, personal pride, going quickly to a military (or violent) solution to life's problems. H.W. Brands seems to strain to extraordinary lengths to show how these few characteristics guided *all* of Jackson's decisions. This insistence on ramming a point of view down the reader's throat gets irritating after a while. While well written and obviously well meaning, Brads' book should be the dictionary definition of hagiography. All that said, it was still an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Your PHD in English BEFORE Reading This One","review":"This book was very thourough and would probably be best for someone who is into Andrew Jackson and American History big time. The writter tends to go on and on in some cases.You better bone up on your English vocabulary through and through before tackling this book. Brands used words in his book that I have, quite honestly, never seen or heard of before. I may be a little challenged in that department but this made the reading difficult for me and lost my interest in what he was trying to convey.For someone wanting the basics on Andrew Jackson's life and times without all the flair I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy History","review":"This is pretty flowery stuff. The kind of soft peddled history that either glosses over more controversial and negative aspects of the man, or completely ignores them. The author's other newer book, \\"What Hath God Wrought\\" portrays a very different Jackson. This one is more like something one would have been taught in an American history class in the 1960s- a sanitized version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great President, Great Book","review":"Andrew Jackson was one the greatest U.S. presidents - his life and presidency exemplified honor, character and guts, and many of our current politicians could learn a great deal from him. Although a little on short on the Jackson presidency, H.W. Brands does a great job bringing Andrew Jackson to life in a comprehensive, fast paced and a very enjoyable book. One of my favorite details that Brands brings out is Jackson's aversion to taxing and building up control of spending by the federal government - Jackson feared that federal control of spending would encourage corruption, reasoning that congressmen would be tempted to approve one another's favorite projects and contractors would be tempted to bribe congressmen (see page 434). Unfortunately, subsequent politicians have not followed his example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"One of the Presidential Bio's that really brings to light how America changed between the Revolutionary war and the Civil war."},{"rating":"2","title":"American History Masterpiece","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I didn't know much about Andrew Jackson before reading the book but I learned a great deal in a short time. The book flowed well and followed Jackson from birth, his early life, the revolution, his business ventures, duels, through wars, the presidency, and death. The material was so interesting I found myself flying through the book.Jackson was involved with the Indian wars, Florida, New Orleans, and even Texas be it in battle or influence.

There's no fastforward or rewind in songs! What's that about? How could you not add that? To get to song 160 you have to click the forward button 159 times! Very inconvenient. But that wouldn't bother me at all! If the sound was blow me away, amazing. But it wasn't, it was what you would expect from a generic cd player. I need loud and I need bass. I also bought new koss headphones for this thing and still, dull sound. I can't yet point you to the perfect mp3/cd player. But trust me, it's not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution Regarding Resume Feature","review":"The product description on the Amazon site says that \\"resume picks up EXACTLY where the player left off\\". That is not correct. The owner's manual correctly says that \\"the player stores the TRACK where you stopped play\\". When you restart the player, it will start at the BEGINNING OF THE TRACK where you left off. That may work for some people, but not for those who want to pick up play in the middle of a long track. Amazon should correct the product description on its site!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It DOES have resume","review":"If you read the manual it does have \\"Resume\\".

It fits my semiauto compact pistols like the Taurus MilPro's (PT140, PT145), Taurus 24/7 C DS 9mm/.40 SW/.45 ACP great. However, it's too small for the pistols with 4\\" barrels like the Ruger SR9 and the Taurus 24/7's full size. It can hold one of my compacts in the back holster and still has plenty of room for 2 or 3 mags in the front without printing. It might not be the best but I would say it works very well for cc'ing the compact pistols. The good things are it doesn't look obvious as other cc pouches, it is made of durable material and it's not too big on my belt.FYI, the dimensions of my Taurus compact pistols are (HxWxL) 5.125x1.25x6.125 (inches). This pouch holster fits any one of them like a glove. I don't think it will fit bigger pistols."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"This is a nice pouch that I wanted to try for conceal carry. It fits my Taurus 709 and S&W 642. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a built in holster, just a separate compartment and they use velcro to hold it closed which makes alot of noise when opening it. I use this now and then when I don't want a fanny pack on. I have no real complaints about it except the velcro, I think it should of had a zipper, one for each section, that is why I gave it 4 stars and I would still recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off-Duty Pouch","review":"I purchased the Uncle Mike's Off-Duty nylon pouch for my son for hunting purposes.

For someone who has pies very rarely, these recipes may be a revelation, but for accomplished cooks and for pie-savvy diners, I cannot recommend the book.

There is a recipe for A Common Apple Pie, however it calls for sugar(no amount) and ground cinnamon (no amount). The author writes that it is intentionally imprecise because there are so many variables to consider, however I would have liked some kind of guideline for the inexperienced pie maker.

However, compared to my primary scanner (Lexmark X5150), I found using it as a stand-alone very confusing and finally started using it only through my PaintShop Pro 7. When it's in operation, it sounds as if it's grinding coffee, and there's now a very discernable (and growing) streak on the inside of the glass. I'd swap it out if it had been purchased locally, but for what it cost, I'm not going to bother, since it's already paid for itself over what it would have cost to have the transparencies scanned.It's not bad as an auxiliary scanner, but if it's to be your ONLY scanner, it just doesn't seem likely to hold up.

Then you can put the original 2 x 512MB in the slots with the black clips. Basically, you have to put them in pairs, and the slots white clips need to have your largest memory modules.UPDATE: with no warning, the new RAM stopped working after several weeks without problems. One day there was simply no booting up and a \\"RAM error\\". We removed the RAM, put the old RAM in, and it worked. Then when we reinstalled the new RAM (again in the proper slots), but no go.

I don't add that much cream either, just a little splash. I needed to add more coffee than before because I think the lower brewing temperature is not extracting the full flavor out of the beans. I wanted to like this thing because it looks really good, but why can't they make it brew at a higher temperature?

I purchased it last year based on two magazine reviews that raved about this group and its music. Both reviews lead me to believe that it was modern Portuguese pop music (Huh? It is?). I was so dissapointed - and - not only because it wasn't what I expected, but mainly due to the fact that it is simply mediocre, overrated, New Age fluff. Now don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Enya and other New Age artists, however, Madredeus does not make the grade, and Teresa Salgueiro's voice is at best ordinary (not sublime and unique - as it was described by the reviews I've read). There is so much great music of this genre out there.

Aidan Quinn does a fine job as David Ash, the skeptical investigator of things that go bump in the night who is still troubled by the death of his twin sister years before. Kate Beckinsale steals the show as Christina Mariel the \\"audaciously charming\\" girl whose home Ash comes to investigate. Their love story is well done. (When will Kate Beckinsale get the kind of notice she deserves? The lady continues to do superb work in every kind of role.)

As far as the rest of the moive, the acting wasn't bad, the special effect will not wow anyone, and Kate is at least partially nude for most of the movie.

It is scary, although there have been better attempts (scarier) on this subject in recent years, like 'The Others' or 'Stir of Echoes'. It's true value, in my opinion, lies in the romantic side of the story. The performances are good and Kate Beckinsale is just perfect. I cannot comment much on the movie without spoiling it for you if you haven't seen it. So to wrap this up I'll move on to a more technical aspect. The copy is not very good, but it's decent, they didn't do a great job parsing it to DVD and it doesn't have any interesting extra features.

I bought this DVD to replace my VHS but have some misgivings after doing so. After comparing the transfers side by side there is very little difference in picture quality. Detail isn't much better either except you can see more film grain on the DVD than on the VHS. Another minus is there is no closed captioning or subtitles on the DVD, but the VHS does have closed captioning. So if you are hard of hearing the video tape is your best bet. There are not extras of anykind on this DVD just the movie and it's pan and scan, not widescreen. Maybe 1:33:1 is the OAR for this movie but I doubt it. Oh well, I guess what I'm saying is if you have the VHS go ahead and stick with it unless you must absolutely have every movie you own on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best movie you would find in the Horror aisle!","review":"This movie IS scary. And it IS NOT becouse of scary faces (it's NOT like in the EXORSIST) and NOT becouse of blood, gore and violense (It's Not like CHILD'S PLAY). No, this movie isn't really violent, what is scary about it is the WONDERFUL story of James Herbert's novel. The story is not only scary but it's iteresting and beautiful (so not only guys would like it but girls will too).The movie has actors that played GREAT! This isn't the movie that will amaze you with it's makeup and super effects. This is a movie that will amaze you with a story much stronger than any other movie you will EVER see.And the best part is the twist in the end that will make you not only like the movie but LOVE it!

The cast is well-chosen and oozing talent, and the production and direction are worthy of that fine cast.Alas, I have a basic version of the DVD, with no Special Features, but if there is an enhanced version out there, I would certainly seek that out, as any 'Making Of' and interviews would be well worth the viewer's time.As others have said, this is a gem and a very underrated movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I need to buy and read the book!","review":"Outstanding ghost story, beautifully filmed.

I just thought the movie was very slow and predictable, the \\"twist ending\\" could be seen practically from the opening credits. But maybe I've just watched too much horror to be surprised anymore.

Well, you get what you pay for.I guess both versions of this disc are bad. I was truly disappointed because this movie really does look like a VHS tape, and although the story is only o.k., it's filled with possibilities that yes, fall short, but is photographed really well and with a real touch of ghost story feeling.Aidan Quinn's performance like so many before, (Legends of The Fall) is wooden and boring. Beckinsale and Edwards are very good, or bad in this case (you'll have to watch the movie to get the meaning).Chances are this movie won't be released again on DVD. My advice is to stick with the VHS, even if the DVD is only $11 believe me there is no transfer improvement here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rough Ride","review":"The first entry in Monogram's \\"Rough Riders\\" series is a dull programmer with little action until the exciting final reel.

The plot is great and the story builded strongly, with the right details at the right moment. They should make a movie, although it would probably not be loyal to the movie, as usual.

I thought the premise was sweet -- showing that genuine niceness and self confidence can lead to popularity. However, I found the references to \\"Turkish-style\\" sex scenes in romance novels unnecessary, the repeated scenes of Steph spying on her naked male neighbor distasteful, and the following quote to be a total dealbreaker: \\"Because if I were dating Mike Finley, I would totally put out too.\\" Obviously teenage sex is a reality, but I have no interest in my 12 year old -- or 14 or 15 year old, for that matter -- reading a book where the heroine takes it for granted.This is a shame, because it is a sweet and funny book, well written with a great ending and a good message -- except for the sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersting","review":"This was a really good book.

However, the durability is by far the worst I've ever seen. Within a month the part that held the cd player closed had broken off, and the motor that turns the CD was broken.

CDRW with UDF not yet tested.- Excellent digital AM/FM tunerCons:- The headfone wire sometimes comes out (kinda loose)- I had to order new $5 Sony headfones, the Panasonic ones that coem along aren't that good - this is however a personal choiceThis may not be the best player in the market vis-a-vis sound quality, but is simply great for its $55 value. So if you're looking for a first time player with no frills - this is the perfect thing to go for.If you are an audiophile and want only the best, and want advanced features like ID3 tags etc, and dont mind a $100+ price tag, go for the IRiver series or SONY."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear a thing","review":"I was so dissapointed when I finally tried this much awaited delivery.

Hers doesnt even play CDs anymore.. only the radio works.To be honest, we dont take the best care of our electronics. But we've always been able to use our old portable cd players after accidentally dropping them on all sorts of surfaces.

Very bummed that a little bit of water would destroy this keyboard.Ive had many Logitech keyboards wireless and wired.

Firstly, if you are one who inhabits a cleanly lit office space with about 1 candlepower of light per square inch this jet-black stealthy keyboard could be quite suitable there. If not so fortunate, a crippling flaw of this keyboard will present itself rather immediately... the constant fishing around for the proper keystrokes led only by your sense of touch. Sure I upgraded from a noisy, clicky, dirty white, AT connector keyboard that I ran into the ground after years of abuse. It was spacious, not compact like this one (heaven help you on a smaller keyboard than the 4000). I could get up at 0300 and bang out a letter with ease, bathed in only the dim light of the monitor. Why... BECAUSE MY OLD KB HAD EFFECTIVE KEY BUMPS YOU CHEAP MS MORONS.Maybe you're more tactile-sensitive? Prepare yourself for the non-existent keybumps. Buyer Beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent membrane keyboard","review":"My wife and I both purchase through this account; she loves this keyboard so that is why I am giving it 4 stars. I docked it a star because this is the 5th one I've purchased in the past 3 years; either keys stop working (even with cleaning) or like this most recent time a problem happens in the electrical cabling and part of the keyboard stops responding. I also never understood why the 6 is on the wrong side for a touch typist, or why a slider was stuck in the middle of the keyboard when instead it could be something MUCH more useful.Anyway, I don't use the product, my wife does. She'd probably give it 5 stars but the durability just isn't there so I docked it one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've tried.","review":"I got this 4 months ago. I know some people have complained about letters rubbing off, etc., but no serious problems for us so far. It can get a bit noisy when you type fast. This is the best keyboard I've tried. You can't beat the price. I would like to try some of the super ergonomic keyboards (ie. Kinesis) some day, but they are around $300 or $400. This one is helping prevent fatigue and stress injury. Plus, it has a lot of convenient shortcut buttons, etc. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent shape, lousy key response","review":"I love the shape of this keyboard. The curved, split design feels wonderfully natural under my fingertips, and the wrist wrest provides excellent support. Unfortunately, the key response is terrible. Keys are spongy and require a good bit of force to press. The worst offender is the space bar, which, as other reviewers have noted, is wobbly and unresponsive if pressed anywhere other than in the middle (and, given the split design, the middle is a difficult and impractical spot to hit). The space bar also rattles quite loudly, which may not be appreciated in a quiet office setting.I really wanted to stick with this keyboard for its excellent ergonomics, but the key response was a deal breaker. It's back to the trusty old Comfort Curve Keyboard for me. Now if Microsoft could figure out how to combine the light, pleasing keys from that with this one's ergonomic shape, they'd have a real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Idea, lousy keyboard","review":"Loud keys are a serious issue, but I sent this back and exchanged it because of issues with the spacebar. I found if you hit the spacebar off center it would stick. This was the case with either my left or right thumb. This happened often enough to seriously slow down my typing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible key touch","review":"I have used an earlier Microsoft ergonomic keyboard in my office for 10 years or more and love it. When I needed a new keyboard for home, I quickly purchased this one. Regretfully, this keyboard is much worst than the old one. As mentioned in other reviews, the keys are hard to press with the space bar being the worst. As I type, letters are frequently missing. While the layout and features of this keyboard are great, the keys are terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"I purchased the keyboard just THREE MONTHS ago and the space bar is starting to malfunction. It either sticks and won't create a space or, as in the sentence above, sticks and creates too many spaces. This is with only average use. I have two other computers, an office desktop at work and a Toshiba NB205. The keyboard on the Toshiba, comparatively, is excellent and has lasted well through two years of constant, vibrant use. Other keys on the Microsoft \\"product\\" also gummy now. Poorly \\"Mad e in China,\\" under the Microsoft label/gi mmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor spacebar","review":"Features are great including new keys introduced above keypad and soft handrest. However, the spacebar is difficult to press 30% of the time. The spacabar is the most used key on the keyboard. This occurs when you tend to press the spacebar near the top of the spacebar (closer to the next row of letters) vs on the lower half. The key is bigger too than normal keys which magnifies the problem. You just wouldn't expect hot spots on keys and the spacebar has hot spots and cold spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent it back.","review":"As is customary, I did a ton of research and after much agonizing, ended up with this one. Sent it back within 2 seconds. I really couldn't/wouldn't get used to the split style.

Loved it! But it broke after only 3 months. Several keys suddenly stopped working. Tested it on multiple computers so definitely the keyboards problem. Going to try an Inland which looks the same, is half the price and has gotten good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I wanted this keyboard because I have tendonitis in both hands and arms, and the layout felt very comfortable in the store where I tried it out. However, as some others have mentioned, the spacebar requires a lot of force if you have small hands and cannot press it down in the center. My thumbs and wrists hurt after just a few minutes (I could work for 15-20 minutes on my old keyboard before having that much pain). It's a shame because otherwise I really like the design; maybe they could split the space bar into two keys (one for each thumb) and then you wouldn't have to press it so hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ached before, now I hurt.","review":"I spend anywhere from 3 to 7 hours typing nearly every day. I bought this keyboard thinking I would relieve some of the aching that recently developed in my wrists and arms. I tried for over a week to get used to this keyboard and finally decided to return to my old one after nearly ending up in tears from my discomfort and frustration. I was never able to adjust to the key placement and my typing speed was severely affected. I don't necessarily wish to discourage anyone from buying this keyboard, but instead ENCOURAGE trying it out in a store first. I believe I should have tried a less ergonomic keyboard first as I may have had an easier time adjusting. Pay close attention here: the spacebar is unbelievably stiff, just as another reviewer mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typists Need Love, Too!","review":"Microsoft?

Microsoft is the only company that makes a proper ergonomic keyboard. I have used the older version at home for years. I purchased one for work about 9 months ago. It was wonderful. The keys were tight, with no play. I liked it so much that I requested one for Christmas. The one I received had a quality issue. The spacebar was very noisy - and drove me crazy. So, I returned it and ordered another. The second one was worse. Not only did the space bare \\"clack\\", but the \\"N\\" key did not work properly. We then went to Best Buy and purchased another. This one is a bit better, but the space key is still bothersome. The quality of this product has deteriorated over the space of 9 months, and I would not now recommend it. This is quite sad, because otherwise the product is excellent. I have notified Microsoft that they have a quality control issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, bad execution","review":"It's a comfortable keyboard to use, and the extras like the volume buttons and other shortcut keys are nice, but the workmanship and quality is just lousy. It often misses the 'i' key when I'm typing which is quite annoying. Yesterday my escape key stopped working all night until it magically started working again this morning.I have also had problems with a recent Microsoft mouse that I bought, which they replaced for free after 6 months when I called them and complained, but the replacement lasted only another 6 months.I love MS's ergonomic designs for their mice, keyboards, and gaming devices, but they really need to get some quality control if they want to keep their reputation in this market segment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I type yor work everyday pretty much all day and this keyboard lets my hands rest comfortably and I don't get aches or pains in my wrist.

The software installs very nicely. Only one big issue, which is why I am giving it a 4-star.The spacebar key is too difficult to be pressed from the edges (where I normally tend to press then).It seems I need to learn again to press the spacebar key in the middle. And if you think it is a minor issue, then no. The spacebar key push effort at the sides is 3-4 times more than any other sweet soft keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"After reading a ton of reviews on this keyboard, I decided to purchase one anyway. I got two whole weeks out of it before the \\"y\\" key stopped working altogether. Undaunted, I tried another, the second board was slightly better in that all the keys seemed to work... most of the time. The entire board is unresponsive and unreliable. For anyone who types quickly, this is not the keyboard for you. In addition, the lettering on the keys is rapidly disappearing. I love the setup and the feel of this board. Everything I look for except it's usability. If there are any missing \\"n\\"'s in this review, you'll understand why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space Bar is Poor! Making otherwise excellent keyboard unacceptable","review":"Like most others have stated and I wished I listened before I purchased, the space bar is very poorly designed and difficult to depress. I've found that if I use my left thumb it works well, but trying to depress it with my right thumb in the upper center quadrant of the bar is almost impossible. I will probable be returning this otherwise great keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great keyboard / Terrible OS X drivers","review":"Using the most recent Intellitype 8.0 mouse and keyboard drivers on OS X Snow Leopard, my system would crash (Kernel Panic!) almost daily. It always happened when I would press a key (such as the arrow keys) in rapid succession. I could never reproduce the error at will, but when it did happen it was obviously frustrating since I'd lose everything I had running at that time. Deactivating the drivers would not help.After my system froze for the third time in a single day, I completely uninstalled all of the MS Intellitype software and haven't had a problem since. Only downside is I don't get to use the functionality of the extra keyboard/mouse buttons, but so far the trade off is worth it.I love the keyboard otherwise, I had the previous Natural keyboard for 15 years and hope to keep this one just as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider it disposable","review":"I bought this to replace my original generation natural keyboard which I had for seven years at work before one of the keys stopped functioning. This keyboard lasted just over a year of home use. I do not consider that an acceptable lifespan for a keyboard, especially one at this price point.With this poor reliability I'd suggest buying something of higher quality, or lower cost (like the 2000 series keyboard) so that you either get something that will work for a longer time, or won't feel bad about throwing away after a year of relatively light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space bar problem still there","review":"Since there were so many complaints about the space bar on this, from so far back, I figured Microsoft would have fixed it. Nope. On the one I got, if you hit it just right, dead center on the LEFT side only, the sound was tolerable. Only one problem: I always use my right thumb for spacing. And when I did that, the \\"clackety-clack\\" was intolerable. The noise was exacerbated by the fact that the other keys are remarkably quiet, so the sound becomes even more annoying. It had to go back. I now have the Adesso Tru-Form Media, on which the keys are slightly louder but since the sound is uniform you don't notice it once you get into the rhythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"4000 Ergo","review":"Got this keyboard a few weeks ago. It performs well. I had to use it for a while to get use to the design but even with the old hunt and peck method it serves me very well. I have easily grown accustomed to it. The only draw back is the on board sound control which seems very sluggish to show the volume adjustment bar. It seems to load that op very slowly. Even with the latest Windows 7 drivers. I had the same issue with other boards as well. Overall a very good buy and I am well pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK--but not great.","review":"I am a retired computer and typing teacher. I am probably much more fussy than an average user. I had one of the first curved keyboards made by Microsoft and I absolutely loved it.This keyboard makes a clicking noise every time I use the space bar. The space bar and several keys do not always push down enough when I push them. What I mean by that is that after I type a paragraph and I look at what I just typed, I now see missing letters or spaces that I know I typed in. I don't know if it is just this unit or if they are all like this.If it is just this unit, then I would rate the product higher. I will have to return this one and try another.

Went back to my old standby, the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable, Would Recommend","review":"I've only used this keyboard for 1 day, but my initial impression is very positive. It has very obviously improved my hand positioning while typing (straighter wrists, compared to my old standard keyboard). The shortcut keys are also very convenient, but beware that many are enabled automatically (I turned the \\"Save\\" and e-mail \\"Send\\" keys off immediately to avoid any future disasters :). As others have mentioned, the space key is harder to press than the others, but I don't find uncomfortably harder. In the end, I think this is a great keyboard for the price (even though my co-workers have been making fun of it all day :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"too noisy to use around others","review":"the lay out is just fine, but it took a few weeks to learn to hit the keys hard enough to make them work, I now find myself pounding away at my keyboard, which is working ok for me. but- since I now work around others, I have annoyed everyone around me with how much noise I make, the space bar was the hardest to learn to hit, you have to really go at it to work it, its a very loud key. it will interrupt others phone calls in the area. it is so noisy, they are making me get a new one. the keys are also so hard to use, I do end up making countless mistakes even after using it for over 6 months now. its easy on your hands from a position point, but I wonder how much wear and tear I am getting from the way I have to pound these keys? it's just too much effort to keep using. I have also worn most of the letters off the keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Option","review":"This is the only keyboard I use; at work and at home, on Mac and PC, the Ergo 4000 is *the* keyboard. It's quiet and comfortable. The only thing it isn't is waterproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead keys in 5 months, buyer beware.","review":"I've bought Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for years. My previous one lasted two years before keys mysteriously died -- not great longevity, but acceptable. But my newest one has become useless in just over 5 months. Today multiple keys on the right side just died on me, seemingly out of nowhere. Reading these other reviews, I guess they have a quality control problem with this board now; buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this keyboard for my mother as she has wrist issues and uses the computer often. Everyone who has tried the keyboard has found the ergonomics of it to be pretty mediocre. The deathblow to it is that the space bar has the worst feel to it, and makes a loud clanking noise. Not too happy with it, but oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommend this keyboard","review":"Not easy to hit space key. It's stiff in some angle in typing and loud. Not recommend this keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is MUCH nicer than some previous keyboards","review":"I have despaired for a long while of finding a good replacement for my Microsoft Natural keyboard. I loved it so much I bought several of them. This keyboard has all of the good qualities of that one - full size, standard key layouts and a good ergonomic design that keeps my wrists from screaming after a hard day of use.Further, it allows you to ignore one of the most annoying \\"features\\" ever foisted on customers. In the tradition of \\"New Coke\\", the newer Microsoft and Logitech keyboards have remapped the function keys on their keyboards. Earlier models required you to hit the \\"F-Lock\\" key every time you booted.Happily, this keyboard remembers the state, so you only have to set it once. That's good enough for me! It's a wonderful keyboard.Just remember to set the \\"Legacy USB\\" support for keyboards in your BIOS if you want to deal with a DOS like environment, like a Linux boot, or the Windows XP boot process (\\"hit F8\\", etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The space bar is ridiculous","review":"Due to a crack in my work laptop screen I asked my husband to run out and buy me a monitor and keyboard today. He came back with this keyboard and it looks great and I like the way it is shaped. However, the space bar is so poorly designed, it isn't really useable. Every time I hit the space bar it make a loud whacking sound. It is incredibly hard to push down, to the point I have been using this keyboard less than thirty minutes and I have pain in my right thumb and the area connecting to my pointer finger. Great job making an ergonomic keyboard that actually CAUSES pain. I had to take breaks to type this review. This is going back today. I searched the web and found complaints of this issue since 2008...how lazy is Microsoft that they haven't fixed it and keep selling it? I won't be buying a Microsoft replacement of any kind because of this. It is a shame because the keyboard is great otherwise, but this flaw renders it unuseable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ergonomic placement good, key feedback absolutely horrible.","review":"First off, I did give this some time to adapt to (around 1 week) and it is not the positioning that I have an issue with, it is the tactile feedback of the keys. I am not expecting mechanical keyboard feedback, but these keys are some of the hardest keys to press down for a membrane keyboard. Pressing down the space bar especially makes your thumb tired quickly. This defeats half the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard if you have to strain constantly just to press down the keys. Also, the size of the keyboard is just monstrous. I'm not sure where you would be able to put your mouse without having to adjust your space or reach really far out with your arm, again defeating the purpose of the ergonomic factor. I am returning the keyboard as we speak. I would rather type on a better feedback experience (mechanical classic layout) than an ergonomic with the stiffest keys of any keyboard I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return this","review":"The space bar was hard to press down and caused pain in my thumb joint! Very bad design, given this is supposed to be ergonomic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"I've had two of these, and while I like the keyboard design, it is NOT designed for households with cats or kids who might spill something on them. The last one fried after only a few drops of water spilled onto it. I'd only had it 3 months. Durability wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't so expensive. I'll be looking for an under $20 keyboard I don't have to worry about."},{"rating":"1","title":"cut corner on wrist rest - a serious problem if you have big hands","review":"It was almost a better keyboard than all the rest, BUT- It is less bent than the earlier natural keyboards -- - unless you are tiny, your wrists won't be straight- the home-end-pgup-pgdn key group are changed again -- - back to 2 rows of 3 keys- - - if you just relearned the 3 rows of 2 keys layout, this is really bad- the left corner of the wrist rest is cut way too close -- - if you have big hands the edge digs into your hand - miserable!- the rows of keys are FLAT -- - you must prop your wrists up high- - - - so you don't hit the key below the one you want- - - - BUT adding a wrist rest hides the LED's for caplock, etc- - - - - and blocks the back & forward buttons- the cord exits right on the edge- - don't let it land on edge - the cord will be severely bent- - - I lost a Natural MM KB with a cord like this- - - - (Natural Pro recessed the cord exit, no risk of bent cord)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff keys & stiff space bar","review":"The keys are much harder to depress than most of the keyboards out there. The keys are much stiffer than the generic Microsoft ergonomic Natural Keyboard elite. The space bar is at a poor angle and takes a conscience effort to depress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Horrible Spacebar","review":"The spacebar is practically unusable. If you hold your hands in a normal position then you'll likely hit the bar near the edge. Due to a pitifully bad design the spacebar will bend incredibly far before suddenly snapping and finally registering the keypress. Yes, if you press it closer to the middle then it will work (but still requires far too much force to be considered ergonomic). Why should anybody have to use a non-standard typing style to use a keyboard, though? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of supposedly being ergonomic? It's just really difficult to understand how such a bad design got onto the market. Absolutely don't waste your time on this keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Support is Hilarious!","review":"Bought this keyboard in August. Today 5 months later the spacebar stopped working. Under microsoft warranty you must pay for the shipping to send your defective keyboard to them first before they send you a new one. Uhm no thanks. I'm just going to buy a new one at any store switch them and give microsoft their broken keyboard back that way then write a bad review on amazon costing them thousands more in lost business. Way to go backwards company microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it stops working","review":"This keyboard was terrific for me until the E and L keys stopped working 55 days after I purchased it. Unfortunately, Microsoft's warranty on this keyboard only lasts for 45 days. So now I'm stuck with a large, useless keyboard. I would recommend buying an ergonomic keyboard with a stronger return/refund/exchange warranty.UPDATE 3/18/2008Surprisingly, Microsoft sent me a replacement for the aforementioned keyboard. It worked like a charm until this morning, when the exact same thing happened again. Random characters and other random things started happening on my Mac until I unplugged the keyboard. Hopefully Microsoft will be kind enough to replace their replacement. Whether they do or don't replace this one, I cannot recommend this item at all. Beware that if you purchase it, it might stop working suddenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't live without it","review":"I actually bought this keyboard when it first came out (love at first sight and all).

It is so great that my IT husband asked for one for Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural: sure; ergonomic: not so much -- too hard to type!","review":"This keyboard has nice large keys and an agreeable shape but the keyboard action is way too heavy and it takes up so much space that you have to move your mouse way off to the side. I've switched over to an old, flat logitech keyboard that agrees with my forearms/wrists much better. If you're looking for an ergonomic keyboard, I'd keep on looking.Also, the software for mac is stuck in the dark ages. Can't ding it too much for that, but it's hilarious to see it mention \\"sherlock\\", which hasn't been around for the past decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, Shoddy construction","review":"I enjoy the ergonomics of the key board, but one feature that I also love is the quite touch keys. Well they all are quite except the SPACE BAR, the most used key of all! It's some how seperated from the rubber spring pad under it, so every time I press it, it makes a loud clicking noise. Well the space bar spans both left and right hand sides and, in my case, only the right side of the space bar clicks, so I've slowly been learning to use the space bar with my left thumb. This may not work because I've spent so long using my right thumb. The fact of the matter is, I shouldn't have to make these exceptions. Don't be gutless like me and make sure you return your keyboard if any of hte keys make clicking noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"keyboard","review":"Works just fine. I feel better after using it for long periods of time. Which is why I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard","review":"The only problem I have with it is the space bar is clunky sounding and the keys are totally quiet, so I can live with it but I don't like the noise of the spacebar. But for the price it is functional and ergonomic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fluff, but great keyboard","review":"I've been using this keyboard for few weeks now and am very happy it.The space bar is still quite annoying. You are supposed to push the very center of the button, which is far from ergonomic.I found I never use the advanced features. They looked promising, but I just don't find them very useful.Those items aside, this has been a great keyboard. I think it is much more natural than the other split keyboards I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"remapped keys","review":"Alt-f4 doesn't work because Microsoft remapped the keys on this keyboard so the keyboard's shortcuts don't work the same way as the Windows operating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"N\\" doesn't register !!","review":"I agree Microsoft has to work on quality control, here's a paragraph with the word \\"none\\" typed with this keyboard to show how often it didn't register \\"n\\":none none none none none none none none one none none none one none none none none oe none none none oe none none none none noe none none noneIt reduced my word accuracy by 17% by eating \\"n\\" in 5 of my 30 sample words !A pity, there are so many lemons in this line, since it is an otherwise a good product !"},{"rating":"1","title":"6 is mis-positioned and key letters are worn already","review":"I'm a touch typist, and was taught that the left index finger types the numbers four and five, and the right index finger types the numbers six and seven. Guess what? The number six is split off from the right side of the keyboard so you must type it with the left hand. After typing the same way for thirty seven years, I cannot adjust. Plus this then requires you use the left index finger for three different numbers. Is this supposed to be an ergonomic style? In addition, I've used the keyboard for about two mos. (with 10 days of vacation in the midst) and already four of the keys have the printing nearly worn off. Not a good quality! Too bad, because the shape is comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The letter \\"N\\"","review":"I've owned this keyboard for a few months. The letter \\"N\\" has been a real headache.

It makes me a much faster typist by giving me a more natural hand position. I also love the little calculator shortcut button.

I find it incredibly uncomfortable. I think it's more ergonomic -not- to use the feet at the back of the keyboard. But if you don't agree and like to use those be forewarned, they're pointy hard plastic and it will slide around with no grip. When the board is flat it doesn't move anywhere. The keys take some time to wear in (especially the spacebar) but once they are it's very comfortable. The letters rub off eventually. I don't use many of the shortcut keys. I only use the calculator and mute button. Pause comes in handy too I guess. It's a good ergo board. There aren't many around anymore. The Belkin was my go to, but it's just too noisy compared to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Fairly quiet, very comfortable keyboard. My only complaint is that the space bar is badly designed in terms of balance--it should have two springs, or should have been split into two keys. I had to replace my 3-year old keyboard earlier this year because over time, it would not cooperate when pressing with my thumb on the far right of the key--I'd have to press right in the middle of the bar to get it to work, which was inefficient for fast typing. I've seen online instructions for fixing this problem, but decided not to risk it and just bought a new one. So far so good.My only wish for this keyboard (besides a split spacebar key) is that it could be folded for travel. I travel a lot of work, and using my laptop keyboard is very hard on my wrists. I tried carrying this beast to Africa with me, and it just wasn't practical (nor did it fit in my carry-on baggage so I had to check it). Ah, but a dream to have a foldable ergonomic keyboard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to send it back","review":"I was very excited to order this keyboard. I have used Ergo keyboards exclusively for over 10 years now but this one I just could not adjust to. It was hard for me to reach all the keys that required my pinkies (it actually hurt and gave me finger cramps!). Although the key layout didn't *look* all that different from what I was used to, it *felt* really different. I had a hard time doing any shortcuts with the CTRL key too. And the way the keys pushed felt weird, like I couldn't really feel if I had struck the key, I had to look at my screen to see what I'd typed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-ergonomic for me","review":"Microsoft Natural keyboards have been kicking around for a long time, and while they are reasonably inexpensive and decently constructed, I find them even less comfortable to use than flat keyboards. The only keyboard I have ever found to be a real improvement on standard ones is the oddly shapedKinesis Advantage USB - Keyboard - USB - black. I have used mine (an older version, of course) for over ten years, despite its worthless function keys, because it is the only keyboard I can find that lets me type as much as I want without causing my wrists to hurt. My hands are large with long fingers, but otherwise normal, so I don't know why my experience with ergonomic keyboards seems to be atypical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Keys!","review":"The keyboard was easy to install, but once installed you notice a huge transition from traditional keyboards! Some of the keys have a little too much spring in the keys...meaning that they keys can be difficult to push down. The spacebar is not easy to push down w/ your thumbs. It makes typing cumbersome at times. Not sure if it is really helping me too much. I'd stick with a traditional keyboard that is a lot easier to push down on the buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best keyboard I've ever used","review":"I work in IT and spend my day typing.

She bet me I would never go back if I tried an ergonomic keyboard. After a few weeks I bought one for my house. Coming from a standard keyboard this was pretty easy to learn and it has some nice extra keys like the \\"=\\" and \\"(\\" and \\")\\" keys which is a big plus for those Excel formulas. Just do yourself a favor and do install the software. It makes a good keyboard really good. The only downside: no USB ports. It would be nice to have someone to plug in other peripherals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard","review":"I'm about to order a new keyboard, because I spilled water in mine and need to replace it, so I'm going to order another Microsoft 4000.

I won't regurgitate the design flaw, since others on this board have mentioned (which I regret having accessed only after receiving the keyboard), but I have put it back into the box to return. I usually try to avoid the hassle of returning things, but this keyboard is just too seriously flawed to overlook. Kudos to those of you who aren't bothered by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Keys","review":"I appreciate the keyboard design. With some practice, I am sure I would have gotten used to the keyboard layout (keep mis-typing). I can even get around the hight and bulkiness of it, even though it is too hig for the keyboard drawer on my desk. What I simply could not accept was how sticky the keys are. I even thought it was a defective keyboard. But then I went back and re-read the reviews and realized that I missed that about this keyboard, in the negative reviews.
