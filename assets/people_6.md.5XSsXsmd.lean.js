Also, there are some errors in this book that are not addresses in the eratta, and the Visual Studio .NET IDE is not covered in this book. The authors use archaic techniques to do things that a VS .NET developer would do in the IDE, like compiling a library file via the command prompt instead of using the IDE to make that library file.

Did Uris copy (read plagerize) from The Wall? I couldn't find any info on a lawsuit, BUT...I recently saw a quote about \\"Uris BASED Mila 18 on The Wall\\".

That wasn't the worst, though, because I wouldn't mind changing her more often, but the wet was held against her skin all throughout the diaper, even above her legs at the snaps! No wicking at all and I know she was really uncomfortable. Plus at 10 lbs this diaper already seemed too small for her, or very soon would be.

We are very attentive and change her all of the time, checking her to make sure she doesn't get any rashes. We don't like using these. ALSO- a note about \\"THANKSMAMA\\"- it says you receive a coral, yellow and purple diaper in this set in the description on Amazon. I did not receive three different colors, only 3 white ones. I was upset about this, and wrote to them. They offered to replace them with the correct colors if I sent them back.

Even if you think you have the basic idea of what bilingual education is, this book provides everything from the history of bilingual education to its legal basis to teaching strategies. A great book that should be read by anyone interested in education, even if your focus isn't dual language instruction.

All items had received comparable reviews. I was disappointed when the cartridge I received looked considerably different than the one in the photo. In the photo, the word \\"Stanton\\" is painted directly on the cartridge. On my cartridge, the word \\"Stanton\\" is a rectangular sticker, and it is slightly crooked, making the item appear--to my eyes at least--cheaply constructed.Perhaps I am too picky and put too much emphasis on appearance; but if appearance is not important, why didn't Stanton show me an accurate picture of the item I was buying? Because if they had, I would have bought a Shure or an Audio-Technica cartridge instead, that's why.Thus far the item's performance seems fine; I've only had it for one day.

Justin's contributions are the only worthwhile pieces at all. \\"Had to fall in love\\" and \\"Driftwood\\" are solid Hayward songs--lyrical, sweet-natured and pleasing--but not spectacular. By far the most interesting song on this record is Justin's \\"The Day We Meet Again,\\" a radical departure from his typical style. It sounds like the 3 a.m. drunken ramblings of someone who's just had their heart shattered, as it careens wildly from hope to deep despondency. It's worth buying the album for this song alone, especially if you've just had your heart stomped on and you can't find your Patsy Cline collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a 1.5","review":"A truly horrible comeback. Bland pop tunes that sound nothing at all like The Moody Blues we knew from 1967-1972. I agree \\"The Day We Meet Again\\" is the best, and \\"I'll Be Level With You\\" is alright, but \\"Under Moonshine\\", \\"I'm Your Man\\", \\"Steppin' In A Slide Zone\\", and \\"Had To Fall In Love\\" are Moody Blues at their all time worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Octave is a middle C at best","review":"The few years spent apart from the rest of the band apparently wasn't long enough for Hayward and Lodge. Their work here sounds like leftover tracks from their solo records. The Day We Meet Again comes closest to recapturing some of that old Hayward Moodies magic, but then Nostradamus from his Songwriter release did it much better. Lodge opens the album with the very boring Steppin' in a Slide Zone. His other contribution, Survival, is better but the extremely poor production values make it sound like it was recorded in a pool of sludge. Pinder turns in a decent enough tune, but after a few plays it too becomes tired and forgettable. Only Edge and Thomas manage to sound like they're still writing for the Moody Blues. For the serious Moodies collector only."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of the Moodies","review":"Even though it had been six years since their last album, the boys had been very busy. All members released at least one solo album, and Hayward and Lodge recorded together. So it's not like they had a huge backlog of songs that had piled up, and it shows here. The song selection is weak, and the band seems to be going through the motions here. The first side of the album is pretty solid, but the second side is abyssmal. Skip this one and go right to the much better Long Distance Voyager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is a good CD - the songs aren't the usual Moody Blues...usually, they have an upbeat tune, but the songs on Octave are just \\"there\\", comparing it to their other CD's. But, it is still ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy addition","review":"I still remember anxiously awaitng the new Moody blues Album \\"Octave\\". From the very first opening of Stepping in a Slide Zone, to the haunting \\" The Day We Meet Again\\", (still my favorite Moody Blues song)stands with the first seven Moody Blues albums. Different to be sure, but the trademark vocals and instrumentals were great. Besides, I feel the album was recorded better than the earlier LP's. Not the traditional tape hiss so noticible in the first albums.Though I was a bit worried that Mike Pinder was not going to be on tour, I knew Patrick Moraz from Yes could do the job. They were great on stage. Justin Heyward is one of Rock's greatest gutarists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A question of unbalanced","review":"Buy only if you collect the M.B.'s.

But on \\"Octave,\\" they forgot to include any good ones. Released the same year (1978) as Yes's worst album, \\"Tormato,\\" it may have had something to do with lumbering dinosuar art rock bands failing to compete in the brave new world of Punk rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Great, Lousy Album","review":"Someone wrote that everything will be released on CD sooner or later. This just in...everything will be re-released and remastered sooner or later by greedy record companies trying to stay alive. Such is the case here. Take Octave for what it truly is, an uneven mish-mash of styles from a band trying to regain their focus after a long sabbatical. Yes, there are some nice moments but there are a lot of dreadful ones as well. Fast forward to the BONUS tracks. Five live cuts culled from various shows that sound like they were recorded over the phone from the 99th row. Save your money if you think there is anything revelatory on these tracks. The title for this album should have been \\"Will The Real Moody Blues Please Stand Up\\". An embarassment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I only like one song off this one","review":"I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song...\\"Steppin in a Slide Zone\\". I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works. \\"Driftwood\\" and \\"I'll be Level with you\\" are also good. After that, the quality severely wanes."},{"rating":"1","title":"they all step and slid....","review":"Yup the members all slid into the abyss of pointless and directionless musicianship in this album. It seems evident that Mike Pinder just fulfilled his contractual obligation just to satisfy those who demands it. Iam a great fan of the Moody Blues and surely a big rebound came in Long Distance Voyager but certainly this album is the poorest of them all. The only track worthy of keeping this album is the opening track \\"Steppin on a slide zone\\" but the following tracks are total rubbish devoid of praise. So many times I try to appreciate this cd but most often I just realized that I have fallen into a deep nap. But if you have steppin.. track in any compilation of the MB, better skip this cd. Actually I bought this cd for [price] but decided to dispose it in the sale bin for only [price] and I dont feel sorry.

Lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"The edition I read was called Opal Dream","review":"This is a charming and heartbreaking story set in the opal fields of Lightning Ridge. The author uses words with skill. We feel the hot, dusty air in our lungs, we experience the ostracism and community of spirit of small town Australia and our hearts tear in two for the unhappy little girl who has lost her friends. This book may be short, but it is potent. I highly recommend it.There is another short story included at the end of the book entitled Specks in the Sky. It is strange and confusing and worth skipping over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story and Voice","review":"I grabbed this book off the YA rack of the library for a sick-home-from-school teenager. She read a few pages, observed, \\"This is not a children's book,\\" and didn't move until she'd finished it. An older kid came in, picked up the book, and sat immobile until done reading. Before going to bed, I noticed that the book had migrated to the top of the refrigerator. I opened it, and was transfixed--read the whole thing standing in the dim kitchen for an hour and a half. It's the voice--a tough young boy who muscles aside resentment and sibling rivalry to help his family in a crisis. And the story--a good structured story that teeters on a gritty realistic brink above a mine shaft of myth. Look forward to more from Ben Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A child's parable parading as an adult novelette","review":"I read this while waiting for a hair cut appointment. Yes, it was simple and sweet, but not much more. I was expecting substance, but instead treated to a predictable outcome, albeit via an original voice. Ashmol's search for his sister's imaginary friends, to redeem his family's reputation and recapture some semblance of happiness, is succesful in an ironic way. The most enjoyable component of this book is its setting. An opal mining town in another country served as the perfect backdrop to frame this lttle tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Moving","review":"This is unlike anything I have read before or since. I simply could not put it down. Ben Rice does more in less than 100 pages than many authors do in a lifetime.It is about the things that really matter in life. Incredibly moving. Very few books move me to tears but this did.I wouldn't call it a children's book. It has universal appeal, but I doubt whether it would suitable for children under 10.By the way for all you who have been wondering - in Australia lollies are candy, a Violet Crumble is like a British Crunchie Bar (chocolate covered honeycomb/sea foam)and the cherry ripe is a candy bar I've never seen outside Australia and New Zealand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely tale of belief","review":"This lovely novella tells the story of Kellyanne Williamson's love for her imaginary friends, Pobby and Dingan, and how her brother exhibits his love for her after these *friends* are lost. Despite his exasperation with his sister's behavior, Ashmol does his best to find her invisible friends and to help her recover from her mysterious but desperate illness.Although small in size, this book gives the reader a great deal of information about Australia and about opal mining, using authentic vocabulary and the artless, wry, and down-to-earth voice of the young Ashmol. This young man is wise beyond his years in the way of life lived in the opal-mining area of Lightning Ridge. His voice was a refreshing change from many contemporary angst-ridden narrators."},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"grown-up\\" storybook","review":"How can you search for imaginary friends when you can't see them? I think that Kellyanne would tell you that you just have to believe. But it ends up being her unbelieving brother Ashmol that gets the town to believe when Pobby and Dingan get lost at the mines. Pobby and Dingan is a sweet surprise, a fun story book that you might read with your older kids or a gift for a friend who has gotten ....... into the corporate world without air. It's short, it's imaginative and unpredictable even given it's length. I loved that the book was set in austrailia and utilizes aussie terms like pom and fairdenkum and that I could listen to the accent between the pages. It's a story book, nothing more nothing less. I wouldn't anxiously await a next book by Ben Rice, but, fairdenkum, this one was a super surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and only one step above cute","review":"It seems that the positive review of this book in the NY Times Book Review started a stampede towards it.

In the 46th chapter, he even goes so far as to suggest that the writers of Scripture were confused. I guess he should have been there to set them straight. If you buy into the 19th century theory of the rapture, this book is for you. If not, this book is torture.

I love Bon Jovi and I love all the past songs, but this just shows again why they have lasted so long. As I have matured so has their music. This is one of the best. Interestingly enough, the songs I never cared for and thought were alittle cheesy have now become my favorites. \\"Bad Medicine\\", if you don't like this then you must be a monk, VERY sexy. \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\", soooo much better. Now the reason I gave it 4 stars, my all time favorite, \\"I'll Be There For You\\" lost all of its emotion. Sorry guys but this was the one dissapointment.If you want the old style, then listen to the old stuff. But if you want to hear some great music that stands on its own, buy this one. I haven't listened to anything else since I bought it. The music is great and Jon's vocals are incredible.THANKS GUYS FOR SOME GREAT NEW MUSIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!","review":"I,ve been a Bon Jovi fan forever but this left feels wrong,You can,t take songs that people have loved for years and destroy them.You should be ashamed!!Put out an album with all the original version of all those songs on it and i,d buy it and play it everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHK!!","review":"I'm sorry to say that this cd has to be the worst that my favorite band has ever come up with. I own every cd this band has ever created (along with interviews and video clips) and all of them rocked except for this one, and it is a huge dissapointment. I would have given it just 1 star if it wasen't Bon Jovi, I had nothing but respect for this band until now.:( I'll think I stick with the orginal versions of the songs after hearing this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"messed up","review":"if u like bon jovi this cd is not for you unless you also like like calm low tempo music. they destroyed some of the greatest hits i want to burn (litterally) evrey copy. this is terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?!","review":"I usually download a cd, listen to it then buy it if I like it. I do not do this with Bon Jovi however, because they are my favorite band. But I really wish I would have downloaded the CD first. Then at least I would not be out $21.95. This is a sad day in the world of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"I've been a fan of Bon Jovi since i could walk and it truly amazes me how dissapointed I was in this cd. I honestly had to ask myself what were they thinking. This cd puts a twist on our favorite classics alright...almost like they've been taken to hell. Were they drunk or something? Hopefully none of us will ever have to hear anything from Bon Jovi as bad as this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD and ALIVE!","review":"The CD is DEAD, but they are still ALIVE..........so get back into the studio guys and Rock ON! never mind this getting old now gotta play mellow junk!!!!! I'm greatly disappointed in this CD. Perhaps, one - three songs are ok, but the WHOLE CD is a ONE STAR! I've been a fan for 20years guys, take this one wiht a grain of salt! This CD SUCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen if you love bon jovi and want to cry","review":"This CD was terrible. I keep it in my car to show my friends a good laugh. Whenever I feel like I might want to see a Bon Jovi concert, I put this CD in to set me straight. I USED TO LOVE BON JOVI. I have all of his other CDs, and still love the old songs. But I don't like elevator music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sambora Disappeared","review":"I wasn't at all happy with this disc. As another review stated, it was supposed to be a live acoustic set, and the best part of those is Sambora's back-up and harmonies. This album was a true disappointment!! There is no great guitar work (acoustic or electric) of Sambora's, and his voice is nowhere to be found. BOO!!!! If you're a Jon fan however, this should be heaven to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't One Song I Enjoyed","review":"I'm sorry Bon Jovi, I have always been a huge fan, and I love your recent box set...but \\"This left fee's right\\" does NOT feel right to me! I cringed with every song.Let me repeat: I didn't like a single song. I tried to give the CD a chance, I listened to it once & I listened to it again. I found nothing redeeming. Thank god I only borrowed the CD from the library- or I'd be demanding my money back!!If you're looking for \\"new\\" BJ, get the new box set- it's awesome! It's worth the extra $$ by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible","review":"I bought this CD thinking it was some of Bon Jovi's top songs. It is their top songs, IN ELEVATOR STYLE.

One person even brought it back to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"This is absolutely the worst CD I have ever purchased! What a disappointment! If this is the best they can do now, it's time to give it up! What WERE they thinking??????????????????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I am a die hard Bon Jovi fan. There are very few songs that I dislike by Jon and the boys. This album, however, is HORRIBLE. It's like Bon Jovi meets Radiohead, not a good combination. The band has done various acoustic versions of several of their hits, and this collection is very unnecessary. It sucks. Stick to writing new material boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this left feels right","review":"If you like Bon Jovi because of all their hits you heard on the radio and bought this alblum to hear them at your leisure, then you will be disapointed. These are NOT the hit songs. This is Bon Jovi laying on couch, bored with their same old songs, obligated to the record company for another alblum.no passionno enthusiasmno fireblahIf you never heard of Bon Jovi and just stumbled across this alblum, you might like it. It's not bad in its own right, just way too far left of the songs that made them great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I absolutely loved This Left Feels Right. I'm a big Bon Jovi fan and I wasn't sure about it but it's like 12 new songs. I listen to it over and over and like it better every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This whole CD feels right!","review":"This is probably one of the best remix cds I have listened to. I am a huge BJ fan and thought that I wouldn't like any of the new versions to the old classics, but I love them!!! This is one CD that stays in the disc changer! One of my favorites on here is the new version of Livin' On a Prayer, adding Olivia D'Abo to the vocals was brilliant (who knew she could sing?) Her voice adds a feminine touch to an otherwise classic-never-change-a-thing song. Overall one of the best CDs ever, remixes or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"great remake","review":"this cd is great, on their first greatest hits back in 95 they remade living on a prayer and all i wanted was for them to remake all their songsand finally its here. keep an open mind while listening and you will find a new exploration into a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would they make this?","review":"When I went to the store and saw this CD, I was so happy! Finally a CD with all my favorites and more! YES!..Once I bought it and played it in my car, I thought I got the WRONG band. THIS CD IS NOTHING (STRESSING NOTHING) LIKE THEIR REAL (STRESSING REAL) SONGS. Really soft,slow, and boring. Okay - the songs are like this...They took awesome hits (Livin' On A Prayer,It's My Life,etc...) and DESTROYED them by taking out every speck of tempo and sang the songs like their wife was about to die. Very depressing and sad.I would definatelt NOT recommend this CD (AT ALL)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Left Feels Wrong... VERY, VERY VERY, VERY WRONG!!!","review":"Being a massive Bon Jovi fan for most of my life, I believe I am entitled to also be their greatest critic. And let me begin by saying, as if their cd's from the 90's weren't average enough, this cd SUX... this cd takes the cake for undoubtedly being the worst Bon Jovi cd EVER! Who are Bon Jovi trying to impress by raping their classic songs, especially the one's that made them who they are?! If only the band would grow their hair back and be the rock band they were before they sold out to stay on the pop charts (not that this album could possibly help the cause!).... what's next?! A duet with Britney Spears?!Don't waste your money on this cd, you'll listen to it once and then throw \\"it in with the rest\\".. 1 star is a compliment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Letdown!!!!!","review":"ok, I admit, I didn't read the reviews...I should have.This album is AWFUL!!!!!They took every kick-butt, hard-rock tune they ever did and turned them into a BALLAD!Yes, it's true. Imagine...\\"Bad Medicine\\" sung as if it were a love song.If you're a Bon Jovi fan, and are looking for their \\"Greatest Hits\\"...don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy CD","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD, so much so I'm writing this review. Elevator music is better that this CD, so don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst...CD....Ever","review":"This is by far the worst CD I have ever bought. Buy \\"Crossroads\\" if you want a greatest hits CD, buy this CD if you want to lose any remaining respect for this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Gosh! What happened?","review":"This will be a very simple review. This cd absolutely stinks! My wife, who is mainly a country fan, but still knows Bon Jovi (doesn't everybody?) hates it also. Glad my copy of this cd was free. Even at that, I'll probably give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the F?","review":"Frankly, I'm not real sure what any of you are talking about. This cd is horrible. They butchered every song. This cd will make you depressed. I feel embarrassed for them releasing this load of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful...","review":"Well, first the obligatory listener definition I suppose - I'm 30 years old and have been listening to Bon Jovi since 1986. Been to countless concerts, slept overnight in arena parking lots to get tickets, all that jazz, and I absolutely hate these new renditions.Judging from the overall \\"star\\" average on Amazon, however, it appears that I'm in the minority, which is interesting. Most of my criticisms have already been drawn out by other reviewers, so I won't waste any more space here.I can't fathom their rational to have released this tripe -- I would much prefer a super clear, well recorded acoustic album of their greatest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"This left doesn't feel right!.....2.5 maybe","review":"I am a pretty big Bon Jovi fan. It's the first hard rock i ever discovered. But this cd is probably their worst yet. I bought it a couple days after it came out, and i was disappointed. Even after a few of the songs grew on me, it's still pushing it to give it a 2.5 out of 5. This would have been a five star cd if there wasn't a \\"twist\\". I would disagree with recommending this to hard core Bon Jovi fans. I think you'll hate it. i would say maybe if you're new to Bon Jovi. But even then, you're still missing out from the real version. What have you done with the classics Jon!!!????"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a greatest hits album","review":"I purchased this thinking it was a greatest hits album. It is not. It is alternate versions of Bon Jovi's popular songs - like Sting's Symphonicities. I was disappointed when I received it but that's my problem for not looking at what I was actually buying. Because it was not what I expected I have not given it much of a listen. Maybe some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I bought this expecting to hear Bon Jovi's normal upbeat tunes. This was a huge disappointment. The group sounds like they need Geritol. I threw it away before I finished the third song because it was so depressing and dull. Don't waste your money unless you need a slow, boring version of what used to be great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"When I first bought this CD, I was hoping for a greatest hits, like many of the other reviewers it seems. When I popped it into my CD player, I immediately knew that something was up. I scanned through the rest of the songs and couldn't believe what I was hearing...this was not the Bon Jovi that my mom and aunt had introduced me to all those years ago. Needless to say, I got rid of that CD the same day I purchased it.Now, I do applaud BJ for trying out something new with their classics (much like \\"Crossroads\\" \\"Prayer 94\\"), but it's just not right. If you want to try a new sound, try it out on a new CD; leave your old gems alone.In a nutshell, leave this disaster on the shelf. It almost hurts listening to all of their classics \\"sung\\" like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoustic Renditions","review":"This is pop metal sensation Bon Jovi's greatest hits album, except they are all played on acoustic guitar. Those familiar with the group's flavorful pop metal may find this not very satisfying because the energy is gone.One of the best looking frontmen in Jon Bon Jovi who made his comeback in movies. I wouldn't recommend it, but worth a listen or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like fine wine, Bon Jovi gets even better over time!","review":"This is Bon Jovi recreated. This album is pure Bon Jovi. You will not hear the \\"arena rock\\" songs from the 80s on this album, at least they won't sound like those same songs you loved for the past 20 years. Bon Jovi has grown up and so has their music. They have introduced new music and instruments. Jon's voice has never sounded better. Number 4 It's My Life will resonate right through you. Only a few bands can pull this off and Bon Jovi is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"Wow, I was really looking forward to this cd and it was a total disappointment. I love Bon Jovi, but this really stinks. They did the songs right the first time and should of kept this release as an accostical of the originals. It was all I could do not to throw it through the window of my car on the ride home. Don't waste your money even if you are a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, save your money","review":"The single worst album I've ever purchased.If you're looking for something to play in your elevator or doctor's office waiting room, this is what you're looking for. Think Bon Jovi music for senior citizens. Wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't fix what isn't broken!","review":"This Cd is horrible!! Did they do something artistically different? Yes! Should they have? No!!! It pained me to listen to these awesome songs redone like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!! AWFUL!! Save yourself some money don't buy it!","review":"DON'T BUY THIS!! If you are expecting \\"Normal\\" rock n roll Bon Jovi don't buy it. Listen to the songs on amazon, I purchased this thinking it was a greatest hits albumn! Its terrible! This will be going in the trash can! I won't even donate it to Goodwill! I wish I would have read the reviews about this before purchasing it from ebay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","review":"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. I own all of the CDs including JBJ's solo efforts. I have videos, DVDs, and even a cassette-single from the 1980s. But this is by far the worst CD ever recorded. Not just the worst by Bon Jovi, but the worst in the history of the recording industry. Basically they went back and ruined a dozen Bon Jovi classics.Do not buy this. Do not download any of the songs. Do not rent this from a library. If someone offers this to you as a gift - politely decline. If you see it in a parking lot - pass it by, or better yet step on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I wanted a Bon Jovi's greatest hits for Christmas and I was so excited to listen to all their songs I love..........and big disappointment.

Save you money and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth rating!","review":"With a twist? how about twisted cruelty to fans!This CD is hideous! I am ashamed with myself for paying money to listen to this utter rubbish! Have Bon Jovi run out of ideas for songs?? Shame on Bon jovi for ripping of their fans with crap re-makes! Shame Shame Shame!Come on Lads get your flippin! ACT together!I pray that they never do a concert with those songs being played like that!!!!!Find your mojo sunshine and start ROCKIN again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge dissapointment","review":"I consider myself a Bon Jovi fan - been to a bunch of shows, have all their music on various formats (vinyl, cassette, CD) and will buy one of their new CDs without hearing a track or reading a review. And that's what I did with this CD - I saw it and went \\"Cool, a new Bon Jovi CD\\", picked it up and thought \\"Hmmm, an un-plugged type release of their hit songs.\\" I bought it and put it on in the car. I think I listened to half of every track, constantly fast forwarding through a song and on to the next thinking \\"This has to get better\\". This CD is one step away from elevator musak. The songs are slow, uninteresting and at times unrecognizable. I found myself picking up the CD case to see what song was playing now. I think I'll give this CD to someone's grandmother or maybe my dentist. Listening to this CD makes the drill seem less painful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i can't stop laughing","review":"... i'm listenning to the CD right now. I bought it today thinking \\"finally a new Bon Jovi out\\".. after the first song, i was like \\"this is a joke right????\\"... but its not. Some songs are ok (it doesnt get better than \\"ok\\" for me with this CD)..i liked \\"it's my life\\", and \\"keep the faith\\"... but like another reviewer mentionned, you sometimes have to look at the cover to know what song they ruined this time. I love Bon Jovi - I have every CD of theirs, including the Young Guns Soundtrack - and i'll keep listenning to this CD hoping it'll grow on me, but till now, sorry it's just a bad joke. If you still want to buy this CD, you have to listen to it without thinking of the original versions - trying to sing with it is impossible - everything's different. I hope they do release a NORMAL acoustic CD, coz i love Bon Jovi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi - This Left Feels Right","review":"What a waste of money and as far as I'm concerned this cd is a real disappointment !!!! At first I thought that this must be a joke or some kind of intro and at any moment the song , LIVING ON A PRAYER ,would kick in . WRONG !!!!! I listened once and actually threw the CD away .Instead of Bon Jovi's explanation of the CD inside the case , they should have given some insight into the type of music PRE -SALE ! If I wanted to listen to ballads ( not that I would want to )trust me I would not have bought Bon Jovi . P.S. One star is too high to rate this bomb !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"Not a single song sounds as it was originally created.

If you want to hear the original hard rock Bon Jovi then this album is NOT for you. These are artsy folk-type versions of the band's original songs, which I was not aware of when I bought the CD. I wish I had gone to Amazon first to listen to the tracks on the different albums so I could have chosen the one that was right for me. Total disappointment and waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?? It's not the Bon Jovi I was expecting!","review":"WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!

But I liked it at first listen and have grown to love it more each time I hear it. Bottom line, the songs are beautiful. Bon Jovi is just so talented that he cannot help but make wonderful music, even when he is totally re-doing his classics. I doubt any other artist could have pulled this off for me, but he sure did. I like all the tracks so much I can't even pick a favorite. I am giving this one for Christmas :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a long time Bon Jovi fan, I was very disappointed with this CD.

This is NOT the Bon Jovi that any fan is used to. Believe me, take it from a fan who has actually collected ALL his CDs and been to his concerts. What the Hell is this album?

I am VERY disappointed about this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi Is Going Downhill","review":"I just want to say that I have been a Bon Jovi admirer for years. They are without a doubt my favorite band. But other than \\"It's My Life\\" the last few years have been bad. As well as the early 90's. This is when the boys from Jersey started singing to the ladies. They got their hair all gelled up like little girls. Jon and Richie are my boys, but change your hair (esp. Jon). You guys need to go back to pre 1988 when you were just starting out and not make your record to try to be so commercially successful.This new CD is a perfect example. Listen to Wanted Dead or Alive in this CD and than in Slippery When Wet. Guys if it ain't broke don't fix it. You guys need to go back and bring out some new stuff with the old sounds. None of this new guitar stuff, none of these news sounds, none of the new Bed Head. Go out and make yourself an album with the same rock and roll you started with. Make an album that will not only bring you a million faces....but rock them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin your own songs","review":"They must be joking.

It's almost painful to listen to. You keep waiting for Jon to break out into the familiar version that everyone loves and it never happens. Although they feel that an accoustic CD would be an easy way out, I was really looking forward to it. I'll never tire of hearing BonJovi live! They are undoubtedly one of the best live performing bands and an accoustic CD would have been so uplifting to listen to. Very Dissapointing. As one of their biggest fans, it pains me to give such a bad review."},{"rating":"1","title":"they should not have taken a turn at all","review":"This cd was horrible.

They would do this to thier own songs????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you want","review":"I bought this item thinking that I was getting a typical greatest hits album; I was wrong.

Jon and Richie \\"unplugged\\" was classic..as VH1 as all reminded us...but this is a weak attempt to recreate the same effect.Loved Crush in 2001 and Bounce in 2003...would love to hear some new classics in the old vein in 2005..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"All I have to say is that this is freakin ridiculous. The original versions of these songs are awesome and this album makes them crappy sauce. Just buy the original, don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.Cd.Ever!","review":"I'm so saddened by this CD. I cannot believe how truly bad these songs are. I have loved Bon Jovi for at least half my life and this just ended the love affair. The vox are bad, all the little extra guitar twangs and effects are out of place. Several songs are barely recognizable except the lyrics. They did no justice to their own songs, these at one time may have been their greatest hits.. but not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"To anyone looking for acoustic versions of Bon Jovi songs (as adverised on TV), don't look here. An aging Bon Jovi has taken the spectacle out of the vocals, dropping all the old hits into monotone easy-to-sing versions. Additionally, what had the makings to be a fabulous CD has been curropted by synthesizer beats, tones, and vocal processing. The only redeeming track is the \\"You give Love a Bad Name,\\" which has a \\"Layla\\" unplugged ring to it. It is also the only track that A) has an excuse for changing-up the melody, so as to fit the blues and B) does not have a synthesized background. Even \\"Bed of Roses,\\" which could have sufficed with a just piano background, and a few new vocal stylings, is laughably bad. A band whose popularity is drawn largely from their livliness should not drain the energy out of the songs; it just makes them sound old. If you are a fan that's been waiting for a collection of two guys with guitars, keep waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're too tough","review":"I just bought the new cd of bon jovi and at first i hated it.The reason i hated it was that i am a big bon jovi fan HARDCORE lost girl friends over the music.But as i sat and listened to it i listened to a different way of singing their old songs and i is actually greatFOR US HARDCORE BONJOVI FANS ENJOY HIS MUSIC EVEN THE NEW WAY HE SINGS HIS OLD SONGSBUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned left, and nothing went right","review":"This is an attempt at art gone terribly wrong. Billed as a \\"greatest hits\\" album, but a better description would be \\"how we killed our greatest hits\\". As a Bon Jovi fan since Runaway, I was appalled by the garbage they have the nerve to sell. It seems like they think they can take good music, kill it on purpose, and watch the fools buy it and say how good it is. Unfortunately, I bought it, but I will never say it is even remotely decent. Not since New Jersey has this band done anything good! The music is mundane, and the vocals sound like someone just shot the cat. This disc after one listen has found a new home, in my trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out--this CD mislabeled","review":"Even though thic CD is marketed online as This Left Feels Right: Greatest Hits With a Twist, the album cover just says This Left Feels Right. There is no indication that the songs are new versions or arrangements of favorite songs. It's typical yuppie pablum for presenting the \\"Holiday Inn Lounge\\" version of great rock anthems. That's why they're too embarassed to mentioned it anywhere on the album. And why this reviewer simply doesn't buy albums anymore.If your expecting the hot chops of Bad Medicine, you'll get the push-down, screw-cap, Tylanol-for-kids version instead. But if you like this stuff, you're too old to enjoy what Bov Jovi was in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi Sucks","review":"Get real people. No matter what kind of music you like, whether it is rock and roll, rap, r&b, country, bluegrass, or jazz, there are talented folks out there. Jon Bon Jovi, however, just sucks PERIOD. His music is for those too ignorant to change the radio station from the top 40 pop hits that 12 year olds like to a real radio station. For the sake of mankind, I hope people begin to realize this so I do not have to see another crappy opening ceremony to the Daytona 500. I would seriously rather watch a puppet show for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"One theft... but otherwise their best stuff","review":"The song 'It's My Life' is an almost direct copy of the The Mission song 'Kingdom Come (Forever And Again) - see the album 'Grains Of Sand' (ASIN B000008IIZ).Apart from that, not much to add - Bon Jovis HAS made quite a few good songs, and many of them are featured on this compilation. They should stop now though before it becomes pathetic (never knew why they were called hardrockers anyway) and forced to copy more songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This left does feel right!","review":"Having been a Bon Jovi fan for 20 years, I was a little nervous when I heard about the idea for the new album (you know the old saying, if it ain't broken don't try to fix it...) I was also a little nervous when I heard snippets of the songs prior to the release. But my feelings changed when I listened to the album in it's entirety...what a refreshing change. I absolutely loved the way they reworked all the favorites! This album is fun, refreshing and very sexy! I think New Jersey's finest have come through once again for the fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those on a suicide watch","review":"I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 1987, so I was looking forward to listening to this CD. I was in for a major disappointment.Most of Bon Jovi's music is upbeat and cool. But these songs have been done in a way than they are mourneful and depressed. Only one song on the whole CD was not ruined by the new style.Unless you are contemplating suicide, and want something else to listen to besides Kansas' \\"Dust In The Wind\\", avoid this CD like the plague, especially if you are a Bon Jovi fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I missed the part of the title that said Greatest hits \\"with a twist\\". Was expecting just the songs I know and love. The words are the same but the music different, slower. Not a fan at all :-(."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEYOND BAD","review":"I bought this piece of crap from Best Buy. It said simply \\"greatest hits with a twist\\" and had a lot of songs I have heard from Bon Jovi so I stupidly bought it. I had no idea what the \\"twist\\" was--it was not explained on the package. I think this is the worst music I've ever heard and I love(d) Bon Jovi. I tried to take it back to Best Buy and they wouldn't take it back so I'm out about $20 for something I would not pay 20 cents for. There is nothing redeeming about it-it doesnt' get any better. I learned that I will only buy music where I can hear it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I am a huge bon jovi fan, but was a little let down by this CD. I like their music as hard rock etc.....not accoustic style. I didn't even recognise many of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an album for the broken hearted!","review":"Like others, I felt like crying after listening to this. There's a reason the original songs were such hits. The twist means that the songs are slow and depressing. I was totally disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"New\\" Songs with Familiar Words","review":"This CD has a lot more depth than the average person (myself included) can hear in the first pass. The key to appreciating this CD is to approach it as brand new material--don't try to sing with it, don't listen for familiar chords/riffs--just remove all expectations.After my second time listening to the songs, I \\"heard\\" strings and new instruments I hadn't heard the first time. The second time I didn't hear Jon singing low instead of high, and I didn't try to sing over him during every chorus. By the third time I could sing with him, in the right tempo, and appreciate the fullness of all the sounds.This isn't a traditional Bon Jovi CD or traditional Bon Jovi sound. It's a mature, thoughtful, and creative compilation that gives our old friends a new sound. I think any open minded Bon Jovi fan will appreciate the effort by the second, if not the third listen. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Left is sooooooo Right!!","review":"I first listened to this album with mixed feelings - a couple of friends had listened to some of the tracks on the website and were not at all impressed.After hearing the CD for myself all I can say is WOW!!!!The hits have been completely stripped back and approached from a totally different angle and the result, for me, is awesome.Anyone who was blown away by the acoustic version of Living on a Prayer that Jon and Richie did at the MTV awards a few years back will love this album. It is more mellow than we are used to from Bon Jovi but they obviously knew what they wanted and chose the right producer to help them with this project.Pat Leonard, who has also produced a couple of the Unplugged albums, has taken Bon Jovi on a complete 90 degree left turn with this album.So if you want to completely rediscover Bon Jovi, buy this album and you will listening to it for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Letdown","review":"Most Bon Jovi loyalists should enjoy the new album \\"This Left Feels Right\\". But for some of us, it is a major disappointment.To begin with, it was quite simply falsely advertised, or at the very least mis-promoted. With a subtitle \\"Greatest Hits With a Twist\\", the album gives you the impression that you are getting the long-awaited acoustic greatest hits collection Jovi fans have been pining for, without steering you in the correct direction before you purchase it. The band has simply put a sometimes interesting but often odd \\"twist\\" on their songs, it's as if they were just fooling around in the studio and decided to release it. Experimentation is one thing, but not at the expense of your classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Left Foot for Me","review":"Love Bon Jovi and love these songs, but not this CD. Do not like the arrangements. These songs are better as they were done orignially. Sometimes it's best to leave perfection alone. Listened to the CD once then gave it away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I can't believe I didn't read the description better. My kids have recently \\"discovered\\" 80's rock and love Bon Jovi. Thought this would be perfect - NOT! The songs are NOTHING like the originals except for the words. We all hate it. My fault for not reading the description all the way through. I didn't even listen to one song all the way through, let alone the whole CD. This is a weird CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I got this for my teenager for Christmas. She eagerly put it in her CD player right after tearing it open...and neither she nor I could believe it was even the right CD. I learned my lesson not to buy an album without listening to the samples first because this is most definitely not what she wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth in Labeling","review":"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. I bought this CD in Wal Mart and there was absolutely NO indication on the label that this CD was anything other than a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation. I was disappointed. Be warned, if you are looking for the Bon Jovi you are used to, do not buy this CD. If you want to hear them try their hand at accoustic folk/ballad style singing of the songs you are used to \\"rocking\\" to, then feel free to give it a try...I should have looked on Amazon for a description before I bought it at the store, but it was an impulse buy. Still, like I said, there should be a warning on the label that this is NOT the Bon Jovi we know..."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest hits(!) with a strange twist","review":"This is different, very different to what every die hard (me!) bon jovi fan is used to. yes i like it and yes its good BUT its not as good as the older stuff obviously the originals are better but it doesnt match up to their usual standard. my fave tracks on this cd have to be born to be my baby (one of my fave originals) and bed of roses. Livin' on a prayer is probably my fave original from my fave cd (slippery) but i was a little disapointed with this track i feel it could have been remixed better and if it was minus the woman it would have been better. the rest of the cd is ok not brilliant but good. wanted dead or alive is a good track but i much prefer the original! If your a die hard bon jovi fan you will like it but i think you may be a litle dissapointed as its definately not rocky like the oringinals and its showing that bon jovi are mayb becoming older and are changing from what they used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a satisfaction guarantee? I'd like a refund!","review":"I'm a huge Bon Jovi fan and after reading through a few of these reviews, maybe I'll have to give the CD a few more listens. I really hope it grows on me because right now I am thoroughly disappointed. My first instinct was this was a sell out to reach the 100 million albums sold mark. My second instinct was the Jersey boys are finally growing old and had to turn the music down. Regardless of the intention, I prefer the songs they way they were originally done. This is far too slow and boring, nothing like the awesome unplugged remakes of \\"Dead or Alive\\" and \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" we're all familiar with. I agree with another reviewer- This left feels really wrong! Make it stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This left feels really wrong","review":"Really this CD is the worse release by the band ever. Either the rumors about JBJ not working with a band and not having much chemistry with the rest of the band specially Richie is true..Or the guys have no idea what their roots are anymore... Either way, this looked like just a poor attempt to make some money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Disappointment","review":"I am a diehard Bon Jovi fan, and am totally disappointed in this album. \\"It's my life\\" is the exception, it's terrific. Who would have thought you could turn that song into a ballad and have it be so good. \\"Bad Medicine\\" is awful, what were they thinking. \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" is one of my favorite songs, ruined by this horrible woman singer. Richie's guiter is great, Jon's singing is nothing special. Come on guys and get something moving again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I have absolutely loved Bon Jovi since the mid 80's, however, this CD is not at all what I expected. The band grew on me because they had a rock 'n roll image and not too hardcore rock but not soft rock. It seems to me that since they are all getting older that their music is getting softer. I'd like to hear some new rock 'n roll, not remakes of the classics. It hurts me to rate this album so low but it's how I feel. My husband couldn't even make it through listening to one whole song on the CD :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"We love you guys, but what possessed you to do this??","review":"Not at all what I expected. In fact I grabbed it the moment I saw it thrilled to see something new from Bon Jovi. Needless to say I was a bit dismayed after hearing the first 10 seconds. Did we need to add an outside voice on Livin' on a Prayer. I don't think so. Listening to this is like listening to nails on a chalk board. Love the guys, but what were they thinking!! I've even tried what others have suggested and have tried to let it grow on me, BUT, it just aint happenin'. Time for the boys to get back into the studio and crank out some new tunes reminiscent, but NOT the same and more upbeat. This last one has left me somewhat depressed. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they need the money??","review":"This was originally supposed to be a LIVE Acoustic album. Then they switched gears and said they would put out a studio accoustic album. THEN they changed again and released this garbage. These re-worked hits are pathetic, sad, and ABSOLUTELY AWEFULL!! What were they thinking? When is this awesome LIVE band going to give the fans an accoustic album? This Left Feels Wrong as one of the other reviewers stated. This is a total waste of time and money! Totally GARBAGE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I am a Bon Jovi fan and I love this music. It is the same music that I loved, but done in a different way.

Thank you Amazon for giving us tracks to sample and very detailed descriptions of the albums. Customer for life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say It Isn't So!","review":"No matter what other reviewers might say, I am a huge fan of Bon Jovi. After listening to this, I seriously wanted to cry. If you haven't heard it yet, just try to imagine Bad Medicine as a ballad. Ridiculous, right? And that's exactly how it sounds. I got a feeling of impending doom as the first song started, and it just got worse with every song. Who could have done such a horrible thing to all my favorite songs? Surely not Bon Jovi themselves! They wouldn't do this to me, would they? Alas, it was them, and not some awful cover band. In my opinion, the only people who could really enjoy this are people who weren't really fans of the original songs. I have tried to give this CD away to 2 people already who listened to some of it and said no thanks and gave it back. I am just sooo glad Have A Nice Day came out to erase this bad memory. Now let's just forget this ever happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Bon Jovi Fans","review":"This album does not sound like Bon Jovi at all.

I've been a big fan for the last 20 years at least and let me tell you, this record really suck!!!!It's incredible how a dozen or so of very good songs can be ruined in such a way. Maybe they did it in order to avoid some one else to do it, the only thing missing to give this record a zero star grade is a rap version of maybe \\"She don't know me\\".My humble advice is: listen to it before buying it, otherwise you will possibly be trying to give it back to Amazon as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your vintage Bon Jovi fan","review":"I was excited to listen to this CD since it offered up so many great Bon Jovi songs. I was disappointed with the album. It's not that I dislike an acoustic, mellow approach, which has worked for many artists like Eric Clapton, but this remake lacks the energy of the original songs. John's voice sounds abrasive on many of the tunes and the synthesis between drums, guitar, and keyboards doesn't quite work.You have to give 'em credit for trying something new but I'll stick with Jovi straight up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi at their worst!","review":"Big time waste of money.

Thank god, the Target store gave us back our money (the girl behind the customer service counter even agreed with us). Don't waste your money on this. The guys in the band are not even singing, they are just saying the words while a really slow version of a song is being played. This is not a rocking disc!

Bon Jovi has done what no other band/singer has done. Instead of taking a bunch of #1 hits and slapping them on a cd and calling it a gretest hits cd they put out a whole different type of cd.It is remenicent of an MTV Unlugged type performance of 10 years ago.

This is just awful for the most part. The original of Bad Medicine was bad; the remake is horrendous. Livin on a Prayer has already been remade once by Bon Jovi on Crossroad; I have no idea why they went for it a third time. The original was pretty good. This band has put out some pretty strong material in the nineties and 2000s, which is something you can't say for hardly any other hair bands from the eighties. Even Bounce, a cd that came out more about two decades after their heyday, is pretty good. This is just rehashing old ground that, frankly, didn't need to be rehashed. If you want a greatest hits compilation, avoid this at all costs and get Crossroad instead. This is a waste of money, and I'm disappointed that Bon Jovi would take advantage of their fans with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO Soft","review":"I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 1984 and I always loved the postive additude and hard loud music. Even their Monster Ballets like my Fav \\"Bed Of Roses\\" were loud hard and perfect. This Album is so different. Don't get me wrong I love to hear Jon's voice on anything, but this is to soft for the best rock band in the world. They shouldn't have messed with perfection.

While \\"It's My Life\\", \\"Bed of Roses\\" and \\"Always\\" are shining moments, and \\"Keep the Faith\\" and \\"Wanted\\" are interesting, this is a overall weak release. Also for the confusion about why the songs are sung how they are, I believe it's 'cause it's very hard for Jon to sing many of the songs the way they were originally recorded because somewhere during the last tour he blew out his voice. (Someone who saw them recently would likely concur).In a way, a release like this is a clever way to not advertise that."},{"rating":"2","title":"BON JOVI ROCKS!!","review":"This Left Feels Right....ROCKS!!

Some people do not like the direction of this album. Bon Jovi did this album not to feed the hunger of music fans but to feed the minds that control the band Bon Jovi.Bon Jovi show they have grown up and show there knowledge of music by combining music of the past to music of the present.They belted out the musical inspirations from the 50's,and they highlighted the happy years of the 7o's. They took all those years and those between and combinded it to that of the rocking 80's and the keeping there heads above water 90's and even threw in there getting older not old millinium years.This album is about showing diversaty and talent. The knew younger fans of generation x may not except this ablum but they don't have to like the album to respect it, respect it they should."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf?","review":"OMG, I WISH I would have read the reviews before placing my order for THIS CD. Complete waste of my $9.99 (would have rather spent it on 3 gallons of gas for my Jeep). I even had 3 other people ATTEMPT to listen to the CD and they couldn't even get past the first song. Let's see....how would I say this in \\"Bon Jovi Terms\\".....oh, yea, \\"BAD MEDICINE!\\" Doesn't even deserve a 1 star but I had to otherwise I wouldn't be able to submit this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE FOREWARNED","review":"These songs are not at all the originals. Do not buy the CD if you are looking for the classic rock style Bon Jovi has had in the past. This CD is completely mellowed out, and none of the songs stay true to Bon Jovi's energetic style. It's good, but just not the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"uggh...","review":"Interesting experiment Jon, please don't do it again.Well there are a few bright tracs that give this the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This left doesn't feel right!!!","review":"I am a pretty big Bon Jovi fan. It's the first hard rock I ever discovered, but this cd is probably their worst effort yet. I bought it a couple days after it came out, and I was very disappointed. Even after a few of the songs grew on me, it's still pushing it to give it a 2.5 out of 5. This would have been a five star Greatest Hits if there wasn't a \\"twist\\".I would disagree with recommending this to hard core Bon Jovi fans. I think you'll hate it. I would say buy this if you're new to Bon Jovi. But even then, you're still missing out on the real versions of these hits. What have you done with the classics Jon!!!????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi nothing better to do?","review":"Ack! I just heard a friends copy of this CD tonight and this is sad. Bon Jovi got nothing better to do then to slaughter 12 of their best hits? Not that this couldnt have been decent, if they had played these songs accoustically with a little heart and effort, it could have been an interesting CD. Maybe not a top seller or something to shout from the mountain tops about but at least something half way enjoyable. Honestly as it is, I dont think Bon Jovi could have made this worse (even had they tried). Unless maybe they all got loaded to the T and staggered into the recording studio and went at it. Then again, maybe it would have been BETTER? This CD stinks period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears are bleeding!","review":"If there were a selection for \\"0\\" stars, I would definitely have rated it with that. This is absolutely the WORST rendition of any of these songs, ever. As a Bon Jovi fan for years, I am completely appalled by this fatal monstrosity they call \\"Greatest Hits With a Twist\\". The vocals on this album can easily be likened to those of a drunken hobo. Truly tragic, and highly NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plan Bad Bon Jovi","review":"Oh, this is sooooo bad. I have been a Bon Jovi fan from the very beginning. I remember seeing them as an opening band. This CD is just bad, bad, bad. They took great songs and changed them. They should have just released another Best Of if they wanted to put another CD out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money","review":"In brief, this CD stinks. The band took their greatest songs and completely reworked them - unfortunately, the songs just don't work anymore -the tempo/rythm is completely off and I can't even describe what style music the \\"songs with a twist\\" are - it was so bad I couldn't even listen to the entire CD. Bon Jovi doesn't have many greatest hits albums so I don't think they would have been cheating fans if they did the original versions of these in a greatest hits compilation - its not like it would be \\"just another greatest hits album.\\" If you're looking for that or for anything that sounds like the Bon Jovi you know and love, don't waste the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This left feels wrong","review":"This album is a sham. The remix is tamed and sounds like elevator music. For the most parts the remixes don't go with the words and take all of the fun out of the music. It is awful when a very fan friendly band like Bon Jovi takes advantage of its fans by putting out rehased music. Work on some new stuff fellas.The reviews were promising but were incorrect in saying real fans would like this. They should hate it and maybe newer fans (36+) will like it. Bon Jovi isn't built for hold music and this is EXACTLY what this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","review":"Have to agree with R. Graves' comments. Reading the liner notes, I got all excited because it talked like this was going to be an all acoustic version of these fabulous songs; then I continued to read and discovered the songs had been totally remade!The only remake ever to sound just as good as the original and be a totally different song is Eric Clapton's \\"Layla\\".Sorry, guys, I love ya dearly, but stay with what works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When something is right don't fix it....","review":"This is possibly the worst cd I have ever heard from a good band. I do not know what they were thinking, but I do not recommend it at all. Although there are a few good songs, I shared it with several other fans who would not even listen to any of the songs in whole, which I did thoroughly. If they had used this approach on a whole new set of songs, I think it would have been incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I have been a Bon Jovi fan for 20 plus years and this is the worst album they have ever put out. They should not try and change the sound of already great music...reason being is that you cannot improve on perfection. Unfortunately, I truly believe that this is really something that is difficult to listen to. Recommendation to Bon Jovi fans who have not bought this is try and resist the urge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This left feels wrong","review":"I have listened to the album and gone to the live DVD taping. I just cannot force myself to like this album. The acoustic DVD that came with the album was excellent so it's not that I object to change. I think it is a real shame that such a talented band has been reduced to performing such weak and lifeless music. Rumour has it that they will be cutting a new album and going on tour in 2005. Let's hope it is real rock n' roll. For now, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is good","review":"Bon Jovi's new album is a complete change for the band, but a good change. The maturity in the music is felt in all the lyrics. It is a great kick back and relaxe album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this left feels just right:)","review":"i don't want to say a lot. but... i feel like listening it nonstop and i do it whenever it's possible for me. it's just beautiful music, modern music. Well, it's got nothing to do with hair rock of 80s and THIS IS GREAT!.I am Bon Jovi fan since 80s, but i' m sure that i won't be with the guys today if they were living still there in 80s with no changes through the years.A little advise : listen to the songs like if they are completely new ones. Don't compare versions. You give love a bad name makes me smile because of clear resemblance to one of my favorite artist Tom Waits%). Also i found Always much more touching and.. well.. real maybe, that original version never was for me. it's my life - yes! it's MY life. i admire new arrangement of ivin' on a prayer, but female vocals a bit spoil the song. Listen guys, enjoy and forgive my english. hope you understand feelings anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"maybe you remember when bon jovi used to rock. apparently, they've all settled down and decided to be tame and quiet instead of rocking. maybe you remember listening to \\"livin' on a prayer\\" and singing along at the top of your lungs with your fist in the air. but then you listen to this album and you just get quiet while your hand falls down, sad, into your lap. because the rock is gone. the edge is gone. the album sounds good by itself, but in comparison with the originals, the rerecorded songs are shabby and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Jersey Boys","review":"Love the new cd by the best boys outta Jersey! The classic songs performed a \\"left\\" way is refreshing. Way to go, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If P. Diddy is Master of the Re-Mix Jon is his arch enemy","review":"The songs sound lame, which is 100% the opposite of most Bon Jovi stuff. Yes, you can hear him sing and hear Richie play more but so what. An acoustic album has soul and this album (pardon the pun) lost its way. The followers of Bon Jovi will be dissapointed with this re-hash of old favorites from Wanted to Its my Life (or its my LIFELESS) this album turns good music into soft Bread like ballads, desined to put you to sleep or send you in search of smelling salts. Lets hope this does not inspire anything beyond this album.The Pay-Per View special based on this should hopefully push Bon Jovi back to reality. Its not bad looking in other directions but always remember your roots. Even country has energy, which is what this album sorely lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist is back...","review":"Here I was expecting a \\"greatest hits\\" CD but what I have is absolutely terrible. I can't find a single person who actually likes it either. I wish I would have listened to it prior to buying it. Listen before you buy! I looked at the listing of songs and thought \\"I like all of those\\" but I don't like them this way. Total disappointment. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"at first?....but love it","review":"They brought the passion of their lyrics to a new level.... thought is was going to be a rockin \\"greatest hits\\" but these guys accoustic.....they are great, the strings, keyboards great compilations of old time favs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good but it could have been better!","review":"All Bon Jovi fans have to buy this one. Although the album could have been better, the Jersey guys show passion in most of the songs (what were they thinking with \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\"?). In the song, \\"It's My Life\\", Bon Jovi shows what a great singer he is and this version is actually better than the original. The rest of the songs have good moments but they are too slow and at times too boring. However, Bon Jovi shows, with this album, that they are original, and that they still love music and their fans. Please support them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi's Worst","review":"What was Jon Bon Jovi thinking? Obviously he was not thinking when he decided to butcher his own classics. If something ain't broke, don't fix it. I had to look at the list of songs on the cd case several time to find out what song he was singing. There must have been a lot of whiskey flowing during the recording of this classic mistake. If Jon couldn't think of new songs why did he have to ruin the songs we all love. Better luck next time. Oh well Jon, ya still got your looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left waiting for the real Bon Jovi to show up","review":"I was so excitied about getting the new Bon Jovi CD that I rushed into buying it without waiting for the reviews. I'm sorry to say I am very disappointed. I wanted the CD to workout with on my treadmill, upbeat music keeps me walking,,,well this CD was putting me to sleep. Everytime a new song came on I felt like screaming NOOOOOOOOO...don't butcher this one.. The only song on the CD I liked was EVERYDAY the rest I just can't listen to. I was left wondering if it was John Bon Jovi really singing the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruined","review":"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan but they have ruined their own songs with this cd. Most songs are worse when they are remade, however it is another band that destroys the songs, not the artists themselves. I am deeply disappointed in the way that Bon Jovi decided to rerecord some of their best songs and create the awful noise that is heard on this album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK boys, stop fooling around and get back in the studio...","review":"I've been a fan for 20 years and I'm getting too old for this nonsense. I'm a die-hard fan who loves you guys more than life itself... but what were you thinking? We're not going to hold it against you, everybody makes mistakes, now let's move on and get back to the great stuff we're used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Left Feels Right","review":"I'm a die-hard Bon Jovi fan since the beginning so I had to have this in my collection. For die hard fans like myself it's a MUST HAVE!! Especially the one w/the bonus dvd. The first time I listened to this cd, after the first 3 songs and I was very disappointed, however, after listening further it improved. It's growing on me alot more now, but \\"Living on a Prayer\\" is just awful with that woman singing. I was told she was the producers wife, but she's horrible and ruined the song. Jon should have sang it by himself or with Richie, not this woman!!! The rest of the cd isnt too bad, I really like \\"It's my Life\\" and \\"Everyday\\", but there's still a few that need some getting used too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music!","review":"I was so disappointed in this cd. It seems to me that the band took their greatest songs and zapped every ounce of energy out of them. They sound like elevator music, bland and out of rhythm with the way they are supposed to sound. I still love Bon Jovi, but get their Crossroads album instead. It has a great toned down version of Living On a Prayer that became beautiful instead of boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grampa's CD ............TLFR was definitely wrong..... !","review":"I think it will go down like \\"New Coke\\"! JBJ stick to what you do best rockin out !Elevator music sounds better.Seems to me this album was just another way of milking the fans... ! As a long time fan your \\"Bounce\\" tour at the Giants Stadium was Awesome...! Unfortunately this Sucks Bigtime...! The unplugged show on MTV you guys brought the house down with your acoustic renditions of your songs.Hope you guys get back on the right track making cool music!This CD should have been titled \\"Detour to Nowhere....!\\" Songs on this CD sound like stripped down demos to me, not new arrangements ? Do you need the money that bad to release this GARBAGE !Although there will be many that will buy anything from the Bon Jovi band no matter how \\"..Bad..\\" Unfortunately.....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product photo","review":"The product photo showing a simple flat rectangular night light does not represent what you get when you order. Instead, you get the ugly, thicker, arched & ridged lights in the customer-supplied image.While the ugliness doesn't really merit a 1-star rating by itself, the inaccurate representation of the product is hard to forgive, since I was looking specifically for the plain flat rectangle style light and could have ordered one from another listing had I known this photo was not correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same as one in picture","review":"I ordered this for my husband to be able to see around the house in the morning without bumping into things. First off I didn't receive the modern sleek looking one as pictured, I got 4 that looked like maybe the old version and not quite as attractive. Second they glow, but not enough to see something an inch away. They are practically useless and they have them at Walmart for half as much. I will be going to Walmart to buy new night lights that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just received this Saturday--was stoked...","review":"And the SACD/CD won't play at all.

A solid five-star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Effort","review":"In my opinion, this is the Moody Blues' best studio album. Although they start off with a very unusual, mostly instrumental/special effects \\"song\\" which appears to trace the history of humankind, from there on it is pure Moody Blues. The songs are lavish, thought-provoking, and utterly entertaining. The album has a certain \\"Middle Earth\\" quality to it which seems to transport the listener to another time and another place ... where things are difficult, but both hopeful and tolerable. I've listened to this album well over a hundred times since 1971, and it is probably my all time favorite of all genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION AMAZON - Bad Production Run!","review":"Note, this one-star rating is for the product, not the artist/music.Hoping that I would receive one from a previous production run, I placed an order anyway. No such luck, mine does not play in standard or SACD players.It looks to me like the bad ones started showing up just this year. If you can be assured that yours is from an older production run, you are probably safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't Work At All","review":"Well, I have bought two of these now from different sellers and neither one of them will work at all. Not in 5.1 sacd, sacd cd or cd stereo (red book). It looks like a bad batch is going through. I would give the music 5 stars but can't since the cd's won't work. I also have the rest of the Moody Blues sacd series and they all work fine.4-16-12I just received a used copy from the EU in like new condition and it works just fine!

One More Time To Live, The Story In Your Eyes, and Our Guessing Game our true highlights of an album which has no weak links.

All the songs were very draggy and seemed like they would never end. Some songs were flat out fruity. It's not a good CD at all I'm afraid. My parents like it a lot(they're more into older rock)and I got stuck listening to it in the car. I almost fell asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"To my ear, this album, while having a few seconds here and there of pleasant music which tricks you into believing something good is about to happen, it instead leaves you waiting in vain for anything enjoyable, interesting or catchy. I bought this album, trusting the band would live up to their name. But a lot of the vocals are sung flat and a lot of the writing sounds like a song-writing attempt of 13 year olds with no musical talent. Steer away from this album. Those who praised it as a \\"masterpiece\\" ... well, I can only conclude that they never heard the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration In Tune","review":"Everytime I hear this album, I want to write poetry, learn classical ballet and take up ice skating.

I have received 4 copies from Amazon and they are not recognized by either of my SACD players or a normal CD player. My other Moodie SACDs play with no problem. Wait until the issue is fixed before ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still works after all these years...","review":"The Moody Blues are as much a phenomenon as they are a group of talented musicians. Stirring poetry, meticulous harmony, powerful music that moves the soul - these are a few of the descriptions I use when thinking about the Moody Blues.Many years have passed since I listened to this album. I was amazed at how relevant the music is today as it was a few decades ago. Moreover, in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the music caused great introspection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best !!","review":"Consistently rated one of the Moodies best albums...Mike Pinder pushed his song writing & lightened up on the mellotron, everyone contributed, they rocked harder than ever, this is probably their best collective effort. On this album they stripped away the excessive overlays and trimmed back the heavy sound effects (mellotron & chamberlin), even more so than they did on Question. It's still lush, it's still cosmic, and yes, It's the Moody Blues !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even approaching best practice","review":"This book contains very little information on benchmarking and even less on best practice.

Both Lodge and Hayward should be complimented on their blending of writing skills. If anyone else agrees, please drop me a line. I consider myself the #1 Moodies fan. Prove me wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The melodies, lyrics, instrumentation and, not least, vocals on this album are stunning. Justin Hayward and John Lodge's voices and guitar work are plaintive and emotive at the best of times but on these tracks, they are awesome. It's difficult to pick a best or favourite track from such an album but \\"Who Are You Now?\\" is simply heartbreaking. I bought this album firstly in its original vinyl format and recently bought the CD with the extra track, the single \\"Blue Guitar\\" (my vinyl copy was more than a little worn!). If ever there was a flawless album, this has to be in the running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart and Soul of Moody Blues","review":"I first heard this lp in 1975 when I borrowed it from my later to be brother-in-law. He wanted me to hear one song 'I dreamed last night'. Well that song was just the beginning to a revelation that I was actually listening to THE Moody Blues. In this one production Hayward/Lodge managed to capture the complete essence of who the Blues were(no disrespect to the other memebers of the band including 'Wings' Denny Laine). This album is as good or better (except perhaps 'A question of Balance') than any prior release of Moody Blues, the band. My own personal tastes are such that I program my player to start at cut 6 and go through cut 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree, where is the SACD?","review":"This is a great album and worthy of an SACD multichannel reissue, not just a remastering and repackaging reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow, melodious, lush and lyrical treasure of sound","review":"Fabulous. I've had it for weeks now and am still playing it on repeat and liking it more and more.

No bad songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for fans of Justin Hayward and John Lodge","review":"I first listened to this album over 25 years ago, I liked it then, and I like it now.

She apparently believes that transsexuals are willing to risk loss of family, friends, income and life just to undermine the women's movement! Ms. Raymond has come up with a theory worthy only of Dr. Evil. Save your money or better yet spend it on \\"Sex Changes : The Politics of Transgenderism\\" by Pat Califia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful book","review":"What to think of somebody that writes \\"all transsexuals rape women\\" and more such nonsense? Ms. Raymond has no clue what gender and sex are, much less what it means to be transsexual. But she is quick to spread nonsense, lies, and hatred. A shameful book to be used only as an example of horrible bigotry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think it might be","review":"This book is well out of date, so it's only valuable as a reference book. As a trans woman I find it rather wrong-minded. It is an attempt to show we are just 'men' WANTING to be women, and that we are doing this for all the wrong reasons. It claims strongly that the binary gender world is the correct model. Essentially it is elitist Woman Rights Femnazi propaganda. Pretty strong language I know, sorry, but you will understand all that if you read any part of it. It attempts to show how we are absolutely not women, just because we are born with a penis. A penis we never wanted but a penis regardless, grin. Read it and laugh - although there are probably still super-fem-rights women out there, in a modern world they are not so militant anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A badly skewed analysis of the mid 70s Medical Situation","review":"I read Raymond's \\"Transsexual Empire\\" just before I transitioned, and I wish that \\"Sex Changes : The Politics of Transgenderism\\" (by Pat Califia, also available via Amazon) had been available and I'd read it instead.

She would have us believe that transsexuals are frustrated men who can't possess women directly as they would wish, and who therefore conspire to appropriate the female body by becoming women themselves. She paints all T*s as reactionary perverts who want to force \\"real\\" women deeper into their traditional gender roles. Nowhere in her book does she admit of the possibility that transsexuals may be seeking some sort of inner peace for themselves in their private lives. Raymond is an embarrasment to the feminist movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful Bigotry Disguised as Academia","review":"This sophomoric rant is pure bigotry disguised as a \\"serious thought-provoking look at transsexualism\\". The idea of transsexuals as a construct of male surgeons who have designed them in order to subvert the women's movement would be laughable if so many misguided souls had not actually BELIEVED this tripe to be the truth! Ms. Raymond does an extreme disservice to the gender rights movement and to queer people everywhere, and sets back the women's movement 20 years by pitting us against each other. \\"Gender rights are human rights\\" - we need to stick togethor to fight the oppression of society, not get derailed into bickering that is generated by texts such as this. If anyone want's to read a book that SERIOUSLY examines transsexuality in the light of gender rights, then read Riki Anne Wilchen's \\"Read My Lips - Sexual Subversion and the End of Gender\\".

As a transsexual, reading this in the '80s set me back ten years. I'm just glad that the rise of Queer Theory, the gradual subsidence of separatism, and the arrival on the scene of a new generation of lesbians who aren't consumed by fear, has rendered this pathetically vicious screed into an ideological fossil. Only reason I'm even bothering with this is it came up on a word search for \\"transsexual\\"; only reason I gave it one star is I can't give it none. They should handcuff Raymond to RuPaul and force her to shoot a remake of \\"The Defiant Ones\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite Case for Recycling - Doesn't even rate 1 star","review":"Poorly written, illogical, circular arguments (if a m2F TS rises to a position of respect or responsibility in the women's movement, then it was because they were male(?) Oh, and if they don't, what is the cause of that, Ms. Raymond?) The women's movement was fragmented for many years because of this and other books of its ilk, serving the patriarchy by fragmenting us and keeping us in-fighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I picked up this publication mainly because of the poor reviews that it had received, which had gained my curiousity. Poor writing aside, this book would be laughable if the author didn't seriously seem to believe her own outlandish claims that Gender Dysphoria is somehow an attempt by men to somehow attack the feminist movement in America. Her outlandish claims (with a complete lack of factual support) make this book outright distrubing. There's a good reason that this book is out of print, and it frankly boggles my mind as to how any reasonably responsible publisher put it out in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transsexual Empire","review":"I have read both versions of this book. I tried to have an open mind. Dr. Raymond is not trying to have any sort of constructive dialogue with transpeople. She is just pushing a transphobic form of radical feminism. It is possible to constructively critique the male dominated industry that regulates transsexual surgery but Raymond is more interested in attacking transsexual people. It is wrong to call her book the mein kampf against transsexuals but there is little positive in the book. Perhaps someday Dr. Raymond will realize that her book has hurt transpeople and revise it yet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transmisogyny and Transphobia is NOT Feminist","review":"This book and the very basis for it is absolute tripe serving only to devalue trans* identity. The mere fact that \\"she-male\\" is in the book title alone should tell you that this is something to avoid. As a trans* identified person raised by two generations of second wave feminists, I cannot endorse anyone read this book under any circumstances at any time. This is disgusting, misogynist garbage but since trans women aren't *really* women it's totally okay right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor taste on a critical subjet","review":"Ms. Raymond must have been dilussioanl when this book was written. Never saw so many misconceptions regarding this subject. Many lies, distortions, and falsehoods re the person, the medical condition, treatment, sociatial acceptance etc. As a member of the TS community, this book is in bad taste. Ms. Raymond did little research on the subject,and only hurt the community. BAD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty, vicious and ill-informed","review":"Minus 100 stars!That one human being can express so much hatred and pour so much energy into hurting a group of people, who through no fault of their own find themselves in such a ghastly situation, turns my stomach.Gender Dysphoria is a curse and I personally would not wish it on my worst enemy. That I and others should be condemned for the results of a biochemical mix up in the womb is a sad indictment of our society.Ms Raymond you are a disgrace to woman kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because there's no option for 0 stars...","review":"Apparently the author has some sort of personal vendetta against transsexuals and is trying to spread her narrow-minded and illogical views to the world.

Once a year they have a \\"Yanks event\\". They have a convoy and everyone dresses up like the 1940's and they dance and recreate some of the scenes in the movie, like when the inn keeper empties the chamber pot out of the window.The reason that I'm writing this is that the \\"nuclear power towers\\" that another reviewer complained about are not nuclear. They were cooling towers from the 1930's and have now been pulled down. They were actually there during the 40's and there was nothing nuclear about them. I know because I asked the local people who live there. Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT LOVE STORY","review":"AMERICAN SOLDIERS & BRITISH CITIZENS WERE FOREVER CHANGED.

Booth goes one step further and argues for what can be called dialogical rhetoric. This is where parties to a discussion truly engage with each other in an attempt to understand where the other party is coming from, rather than simply trying to conquer all opposition. Booth's so-called 'Listening Rhetoric' has much in common with Hans-Georg Gadamer's notion of the fusion of horizons where different parties seek deeper understanding of each other, and through this can come to a deeper understanding of their own position. Anyone looking for a primer in rhetoric should look elsewhere as Booth's book provides only an overview of the field. He is more concerned to raise awareness and arouse interest in a subject that has been sadly neglected for too long. Rhetoric needs to be rehabilitated and Booth's book goes some way to achieving this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Things","review":"A oddly weak book, reads like the transcript of a series of lectures and notes. Booth must have written this in his last days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing Tech Support","review":"This product would not install correctly in Windows 2000. Symantec support policy is to either post problems to a bulletin board and wait 24-48 hours for response, or pay...to call them. The first method is slow, impersonal, an above all ineffective.

Although this time, the story was told from Corwin's point of view instead of Nia's. In this book though, Nia has changed too much. In the last book, Ascension, she had a really bad temper, and now she's all patient and stuff. Its not a change that happens very often. Other than that, it was really cool. The whole reading minds thing is really creepy though.

They come in a sealed (thank goodness) plastic glassine bag with a \\"sweet gourmet\\" sticker on the outside. I believe that they are generic brand candies, and not the name brand Trolli's that I was expecting based on the name of the product. I am not impressed.I was buying these to display in a candy bar for a party, and they look terrible as display candy because of all the speckles. It looks like they were in a giant container with tons of other candies, and candy crumbs that then stuck to the outside of each little candy. Definitely not good enough for a glass display jar. Probably fine to eat, but If i were buying them for a gift, I would be mad that they didn't come in Trolli brand packaging. I'm also concerned with how they were handled before they were sealed into the current bag since they were obviously not factory sealed by Trolli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, Well Worth It.","review":"Now, I've always been a fan of gummies. I love gummy candies, and I can never have enough of them. During one of my usual browsings through Amazon.com, I noticed they had these Strawberry puffs! It's something I have a lot of trouble finding nowadays. I couldn't resist ordering two pounds. Trust me, it's a bargain. Here, in NYC, my sister had bought 4 lbs of the stuff for about $30USD. Tell me that's not a little too pricey.The Strawberry puffs tasted exactly as I remembered them. They're sweet but not too sweet. I used to buy them from a little corner convenience store after school when I was little. But as I grew older, this type of candy grew rather hard to find. The stores that do sell them, they're overpriced!Anyway, if any of you love gummies, then I highly recommend these little candies. Just stay away from the apple flavored ones. They taste rather nasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Certainly is No Action in this Book!","review":"This book is nothing like what you would expect from Brockmann. It has absolutely nothing in it that you would buy a Brockmann book for. I to also disliked this book immensely, and had to force myself to finish it! I certainly hope this isn't a new trend that Brockmann is starting to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable, wouldn't reread","review":"This was my first book in the series to read, and I wish I had not bothered. Brockmann kept flipping between three different stories, and it broke the flow of the novel. Just when I had started to get interested in one set of characters, the book would switch back to one of the other sets. I started skipping entire chapters and going back later just so I could follow a complete story line to a more natural break. By the end, I just didn't care what happened, I just wanted it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"How boring can one book be?!","review":"I can't understand how anyone liked this book. No romance, no suspense, so SLOW, boring, and lead characters (there were so many in the book I lost track of who they were) had no chemistry.This is by far the worse book I have read in a while. Don't waste your time with this entry in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking, boring, not her usual...","review":"I've read all of Suzanne Brockmann's Team 16 stories, and enjoyed all of them -- except this one. The pace was slow. The story was disconnected. It was too much about boring, pathetic Mary Lou. It contained little, if any, Navy Seal action. Suzanne's books are usually full of action, clever dialog, comaraderie between the Seals (who seldom featured in this novel), and at least some heat. I was disappointed in this one. My advice: skip it and read the previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brockmann does it again!","review":"I love Suzanne Brockmann and her SEAL Troubleshooters. This is yet another thrill-filled sexy and steamy encounter that you won't be able to put down. But even better than the thrills her books give is the fact that they are incredibly well-written. She develops her characters masterfully and consequently keeps you coming back for more, I highly recommend this installment and all the others!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"intense, satisying--Brockmann at her best","review":"At first I was put off by Brockmann paying so much attention to Mary Lou. Then to my surprise and emotional satisfaction I was won over. Sam smolders for Alyssa in the background. Mike Muldoon has his story told with What's her name. The only blemish is the down right cowardly female Suz created for Mike. She tried my resove not to to throw the book across the room before she had the courage to follow her heart and love Mike as he deserved. The ending was a susprise reminding me of \\"Who killed J. R.\\" Brockmann fans will be pleased with \\"Into the Night\\". Bobbye"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Fan Gets Let Down!","review":"I would give her other books 4-5 stars, but not this one. As with many of the other reviewers I have also read all of Ms. Brockmann's books and this one was a real bummer. Characters and plot were slow moving,(although at the end of the book we find out why). I found myself looking at how few pages were left and thinking, \\"A heck of a lot needs to be wrapped up here.\\" This book is just the begining of the rest of the story, which comes out in July 2003. The teaser pages at the end of Into the Night have me eagerly anticipating what awaits the main character from a previous Brockmann book. If you are already a fan of Suzanne Brockmann you will read the book anyway, if you are new to her try Out of Control or any of her others first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike and Joan were a little lackluster","review":"While I really enjoy the character of Mike, and I loved Joan, I didn't feel as if the reader got the most of their story. Joan, especially, was a bit hard to warm to.Having said that, I liked seeing Mary Lou's story advance. I liked that the reader got to know her, and it made the Sam and Mary Lou dynamic make sense.Joan's grandparents' story was beautiful and I loved the terrorism subplot, I was just less than thrilled by Joan and Mike's relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Me Turning the Pages","review":"A nice mix of military, mystery, and likeable characters. I liked and respected these folks and I wanted to know what happened to them. I rooted for the protagonists to find each other, to work out their problems, and to save the president.I'm waiting for the next one to see how they are all doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"I really enjoyed Into the Night. The romance between Mike and Joan isn't full of sparks and fire, but it's still sweet. Regardless, it moved fast with a great plot that you just can't seem to put down. I have to admit that I was really interested in the ongoing Sam/Alyssa thing and I figured that I'd just skip to those parts, but Brockmann makes it hard to do that. You want to read the entire book. I was also eager to see how she dealt with the infamous Mary Lou and I wasn't disappointed. I still don't like her, but her story is really, really good. I also really enjoyed the secondary WWII story, it was just as well developed as the rest of the book. Never a dull moment. I'd highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo to Gary Trudeau","review":"I purchased this book for my husband, an injured Vet from Desert Storm.

A completely new look at the character B.D. --- he's missing his helmet ... and his leg (from a military injury).Trudeau somehow manages to meld an important, poignant, contemporary story with his unique art and dry wit. Hard to believe he can make you laugh about this subject, but you will. You'll also have tears probably.You'll appreciate this book if you're a Doonesbury fan (though it's a different 'experience' than most of the others -- to me, anyway), if you're a veteran ... and especially if you're an amputee.According to the publishers, the proceeds go to the Fisher House, which materially supports the amputees and their families after the primary medical part is done."},{"rating":"2","title":"BD's story is incomplete","review":"When BD loses a leg in Iraq it's a powerful story in itself, especially since BD has been with us since early Doonesbury days. Trudeau tells the story with dry acuity; along the way, he teaches us much about amputee rehabilitation;. But BD's story was put into a book too early. At this writing, it's still running in Doonesbury, and it gets grimmer and grimmer. The digest we get in THE LONG ROAD HOME has a conventionally patriotic veneer; the actual strip is less reassuring. I suggest readers of this book visit the Doonesbury archive on the web to learn about BD's life once his supposed rehabilitation is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked some of it","review":"I bought this album after listening to the first few songs.The first 1/3 seems more rock & roll then country -- and that's the part I like.

Unfortunately while there is useful information presented the author is so one-eyed that it is impossible to know what is truth and what is his slant on the subject matter. A bit more knowledge and a lot less bias would make this a far better book. I must admit I found it very hard to read the book - not because of the subject (which is interesting) of even the writing style but the entirely one sided approach taken meant that nothing stated could be trusted without independent collaboration and this is very annoying. His argument does not need propaganda but carefully researched information - which unfortunately this is not. A lot of information is buried in here if you know what to look for it.

It does show a young Angelina Jolie, back when as an actress she had to work for a living (not a put-down, I just like to see superstar actors back when they had to act in a movie to be famous). I guess I would classify it as a pure junk food movie, the premise of the movie is worn out and tired, the acting is mostly sub-par, and the script is almost unbearably cheesy however when those qualities are put together in the right way you get a movie that you just can't help but love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic.","review":"This movie captures the enthusiasm and imagination of the people involved in the growth of the personal computer.

But it is a main stream hollywood teen flick about fighting they system, yes i know thats an oxy moron, much like wearing gap to be diffrent, but hey what ever. its fun to watch but don't expect to learn to hack or phreak from it. or see any semblece of reality, but hey i like star wars also and if you did you just might be able to suspend you disbelif and watch and enjoy this flim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This Movie was recently shown on Sci fi (July 2002) I though it showed the dangers of Hacking almost accruate but kept it simple.

It shows us the life of the underground generation, hackers and club kids. Even though the movie does more than its share of exaggerating on the real lives of hackers, crackers, phreakers and ect... I enjoyed the plot of the movie and the actors who portrayed the characters. This is an excelent movie to watch if your into cyberthrillers, club scenes and techno background.

Why?), bland lead, and tired plot, Hackers doesn't even manage to be interesting, let alone memorable or good."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding kid flick","review":"Films based on technology should become dated...fast. But this one doesn't. Teenie bopper hackers vs corporate techno-crooks while using all the lastest hacker techniques and technology circa too long ago. But since a lot of the filming makes fine use of visual metaphor to supplement actual techno-things, the film comes off as slightly timeless.Miller's ex overacts, as usual, but the cast is very well chosen and succeeds as techno-weenies. Fisher Stevens is at his best as corporate techno-crook Mr. The Plague with Lorraine Bracco as his idiot sidekick. You'll probably want to invest in the techno-rock CDs that make up the soundtrack too, I don't know which was better, the film or the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hackers - the marmite of computer films","review":"That's right. Marmite. You'll either love Hackers or hate Hackers. I don't think I've ever seen a middle ground. The film is great though. You've got the two clearly defined sides. The good guys: Hyper-intelligent Lord Nikon, Elite Hacker Crash Override (Zero Cool), sex interest Acid Burn, utter nutter Cereal Killer, underated coffee-and-fags addicted Joey and the Phantom Phreak. The plot is not exactly stunning. The characters are a little 2-D. But there is something in the film that's almost <cheesy sound effects> magic. I found myself laughing at the jokes and wishing that I too could be inducted into this underground world of hacking and fun. It won't exactly rub shoulders with The Third Man or The Seventh Seal, but it's still worth adding to your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes.....","review":"Every time this movie is on TV I just have to watch it. It's the best movie I've seen that involves computer and teenagers and it's actually fun to watch (Unlike others) It's true that the world of hacking looks mad easy in this movie,I actually believe it was real but it's not but it's still cool.

Hackers are not cool, sociable kids who go to raves and casually go to their computers and \\"hack\\". Hackers are geeks who stay inside all the time and do nothing but use their computers, and their only friends are over the internet. And when you hack you don't get these wonderful graphics and animations it's all text and really boring. I don't understand how people can say that this is accurate it's only a farce made to make hacking seem cool and trendy.

The speed at which they are able to connect via analog modem was also very accurate. Also it was great that the hackers have their own proprietary broswer and instant messaging technology. If it wasn't for this movie, I would never have seen those kickass graphics with the jail bars that load so quickly when you try talk to a corporate computer.

The plot was implausible and the acting bordered on caricaturistic. Especially awful was Matthew Lillard in the role of Cereal Killer.

The only thing keeping this from being a no-star review was the fetching presence of Angelina Jolie. This film is already hopelessly dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hackers Is A True Ride","review":"Exillerating is the only word that can be used to describe the pace of this movie. Admitedly this movie doesn't depict the true actions of hackers, but that's okay since this is a movie not a documentary. The graphics are below par when compared to today's standards but they are still satisfactory. This is not the type of movie to watch if you are just into sitting back and not thinking at all, you need to think at least a bit. Over all this is an excellent movie, especially when complemented by the pumpin' soundtrack. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love this movie. I know it exagerates the Hacker culture a little too far, but that doesn't take away from the great story that it is. This is definately one of the best 'computer' or 'tech' movies around. A must have for anyone who is into computers. Hackers may find it to be a complete comedy.The only bad thing I can say about this movie (ie: 4/5) is that the video quality, although acceptable, is not up to DVD standards, IMO. The letterbox in which the movie actually is looks okay, but about 15% of the screen hight is wasted in a gre/black band above and below the letterbox. Then there's the regular wasted 20$ of the screen because its 16:9, but that's fine cause that's what I wanted.Enjoy. Its a great film that I had watched at least 15 times since its VHS release, and probably about 6 times after purcashing the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelina Jolie is captivating","review":"So shes one one my favorite actresses.

This movie is only good for background wallpaper in industrial-style nightclubs"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Is Awful","review":"I think my title says it all. Even if you're just an average computer user the blatant ignorance of this movie will drive you insane.Apparently the director thought that hacking had something to do with drifting through expanses of crimson colored space decorated with calculus symbols.I don't know anything about a movie being good because its so awful.

A disturbed teenager needing vicarious victories over the establishment and adults will ignore the faults, technical and otherwise of this useless flick.

I mean, okay, there were _some_ flaws in it, but then again it showed that humans, when working in groups, can acheive their desires easier.

First of all, the movie has WONDERFUL cinematography. In fact, I've rarely seen anything to rival some of the scenes in this film. Plain and simple: It's beautiful. Also, the characters are all unique and fairly well-developed. Lastly, it has an excellent soundtrack. Actually, it has 2 excellent soundtracks out on CD (the first is better, btw). So don't watch this film to see an accurate portrayal of computer espionage, and don't watch it to see Oscar-winning screenwriting. Watch it for the ambiance, and you'll never tire of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie","review":"I love this movie so much. Considering it was made in 1994, it's more than a little dated, and even at the time people would give it grief for not accurately representing hackers. The problem is, people need to think of it more as a cyberpunk/science fiction movie rather than a historical non-fiction or something. It's just supposed to be stupid fun and I think it is.I could go on and on about the plot and the characters and how the story is intricately woven. My ONLY complaint is that Lorraine Bracco is a terrible actress. If all of her scenes were completely cut from the film, it would be vastly improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackers!???","review":"To tell the truth, this is a funny comedy of what hacking is, mean, the one who wrote that this is a good example of what \\"happens\\" out there, must be afraid of a microwaveoven or a VCR.

From now on if it is not in the Google Play store, I will order a DVD and burn a digital copy for the mobile devices. Way to go Amazon, the # 1 selling Mobile OS (Android) that has allowed you to prosper in the Mobile market has been locked out from your services. Thanks.

It's true that you'll see some flaws that slipped past editing if you watch it a lot (me: guilty), but you'll get over it...The people are beautiful, the lines are funny (\\"Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!\\"), and the plot is so uncomplicated that it's okay if you miss a little bit to go hack into someone's gibson...So, what I'm saying is this: if you know how to have fun, buy this sucker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hack me any time baby!","review":"This film is good,however, does anyone believe that these people are real hackers. If it was true to life they would've all had specs, spots and scruffy hair. Hey, this is Hollywood so we'll make the leads good-looking, especially Jolie, and we've got a nice little earner on our hands.The movie, it's got seriously bad dress sense even for a geek haven, the acting isn't good and the soundtrack only sounds good on the film and not on the CD! However, this film is very watchable due to the chemistry between the two leads who lock horns against each other for supremacy of cyberspace. In my opinion, the fact that they're all being framed with the potential of a very long prison sentence holds no signifigance in the movie for me at all.In a paragraph, the films good, there's good chemistry between the two leads.

The characters are generic, predictable, and cliché. The story is even worse! You don't need to have a knowledge of computers, the internet, or hacking to know that this story is completely unrealistic and insulting to your intelligence.

Otherwise, the acting is quality, the music is very suitable(i bought the soundtrack, kickin party tunes), and the setting/cinematography is top notch.I think 2600 said it best (paraphrasing) non computer users will like it for the story, hackers will like it for the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Net was better (but not by much)","review":"Hackers could have been a great movie. It has a great, complex plot which has been lacking from a lot of movies of late. But there was too much that let it down. This movie had probably the most annoying characters I have ever seen. Joey made me want to throw things at the screen, Cereal Killer made me want to stab my ears, Acid Burn just really irritated me, and I just couldn't 'go' for them. The movie also had way too many unnecessary special effects. If the had just been standard Windows screens, it would have been a lot more believable (and made more sense). The final thing that really bugged me was the terminology they used. Give you a few examples \\"It's faster than the Pentium\\", \\"It has a PCI bus\\". Yeah, so?

Still, I might have managed to work through it...if it hadn't BROKE! Yes, that's right: when I tried to turn it on again, the XBox refused to read my saved file.

There are some great songs on here such as denial twist which is one of my favorite white stripes songs it has a great drum beat to it. Other standout tracks include blue orchid, my doorbell, forever for her is over me, and take take take. The only two songs I don't care much for are the nurse and little ghost. But otherwise this album is genius. There sound has changed on this album, this is kind of like their white album or zeppelin 3. I have all the white stripes albums and I must say they are going to be legends, the best band out there today. They are this generations Zeppelin and anyone who says different is a fool. Also if you like the white stripes, check out the rockin new band rose hill drive, who kind of have a zeppelin sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music for people who don't like music...","review":"I lump White Stripes into the same category as the Dave Matthews Band in the sense that their fans don't typically listen to a lot of music. They like whatever they hear and don't give it too much thought.Specifically, this album (like any WS discs) contains nothing that many other bands aren't doing better. So, look around - you're bound to find something that you'll like better. Unless, of course, you just want to buy whatever Rolling Stone or Time Magazine is drooling over this week (last week it was Acrade Fire)."},{"rating":"1","title":".... yeah, but can you dance to it?","review":"Someone's gonna have to explain this band to me. I've listened to this Cd, the previous one, the Loretta Lynn CD, seen 'em on the TV, and all I hear is something between art school and ugly. Were I Paige or Plant, I'd b-slap the next monkey that compared this duo to L Zeppo (and I HATED Zep). What anybody sees in a guy that can't sing, isn't very good at guitar and a woman who re-set the Karen Carpenter level of drumming LOWER is beyond me.

I appreciate when bands go in a bold new direction as much as thenext fan. Unfortunatly I think this album lacks the fire, energy and passion previous 'stripes' CDs have displayed. In addition to that the instrementation on this thing is sub-standard at best. Jack sounds like his hand was still in acast while he was laying down these tracks.

I thought their songs on the radio were good but I'm always so wary of buying CD's for \\"just 1 song\\". Then I heard \\"The Denial Twist\\" I was hooked! I just had to get this CD and boy am I glad I did. Now I am a Stripes fanatic I have almost all of their discs exept for elephant only b/c it is hard to find. Most of the songs on Get behind Me Satan are great except fot in my opinion The Nurse I just can't get through it. There are so many styles of music on this CD anyone of my friends who have heard it found at least 1 or 2 tracks they liked. This as well as any other Stripes album is so worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh...","review":"Seriously, the only good song on this album is \\"Blue Orchid\\".

Well, then again, that's Rolling Stone and for years now they've been catering to the Teen Magazine crowd. I just can't understand how so many people can get sucked into thinking that this type of \\"music\\" is \\"great\\". It's not even relevant. The worst joke on here is track #9 Passive Manipulation.

I really really believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Behind Me Satan","review":"The way I see it is that every band puts out a crappy album. I had high expectations from this album. What is sounds like is someone secretly recorded them making songs for fun. It sounds like it was rushed and like they didn't care what they put on there. I'm a big fan of their old music. If that's what you're into, you won't like this. I'm not going to put down every song. Blue Orchid is a good song. If they went for more of that sound, I would be happy. As Ugly As I Seem isn't that bad either. I'm not going to put down all the songs. They might grow on me. I might even like the whole album. It just didn't grab me the first time I heard it. Maybe on their next album they will go back to the way they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the last ones were bad","review":"All I can say is that the radio is a horribl horrible thing. Blue Orchid would come on and I'd turn it up because I thought above allm the music is interesting, change of pace, you know be open to new ideas. This is just unfogiveable.

I love everything that the Stripes put out, which is why I am so surprised at how awful this album is. It is incredibly boring from start to finish - so boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire CD. I appreciate that Jack is trying to \\"experiment\\" with different sounds, but it just doesn't work. This CD lacks the raw emotion, energy, and passion that I have come to expect from the band. The songs are dull and repetitive and soooooooooo looooooooonnnngggg, it's enough to put you to sleep!!

I guess he spent too much time hanging out on the Cold Mountain set, or playing slide with the coal miner's daughter, because gone is the White Stripes sound of old. And this new sound, man, it's just terrible. From the sound of the other reviews, people are liking it because they like the band and not because they actually like the music.

I bought it based on all the hype and positive reviews throughout the press. I was a little encouraged by the openning cords on the first track, but it was downhill all the way from there. The songs are all insipid with bland melodies, inconsequential lyrics, terrible voices and even worse instrumentation. It sounds as if it was recorded in a garage by high schoolers just starting to learn their instruments. Overall, very disappointing and a total waste of my time and money.

Totally blatant Led Zeppelin ripoffs. everyone these days is too lazy to be original, so they steal from the past, knowing their young consumers don't know the original sources. there's no excuse for such unoriginality. After so much Zep robbing, their next album may as well be 80's metal, since the next progression from Zep's 70's Hard Rock was 80's metal, so they may as well complete the circle they are in. rock is dead. from the 90's to today all rock has been retreads of the past. just let it die. then maybe it can be reborn truly refreshed years thereafter. having years go by with no rock groups sounds good about now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"Another case of a crappy litte coffee shop band getting an undeserved break while real talent in Detroit goes unnoticed.

This is the White Stripes at their finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiating from the Center","review":"I love this band's music and this album is no exception. Each album always has a prevailing theme throughout almost every song, even if they vary greatly individually.

Definitely not worth your hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loretta Lynn is spinning in her grave","review":"Oh, she isn't dead?

There is something to be said when someone gets to big for their own head. I like to call it Billy Corrigan sydrome. If you are a Stripes fan, retire with what you have in your collection, because this is just out and out bad music. I do like Blue Orchid, and that's it.

Instinct Blues-Just.No. Passive Manipulation-why??? White Moon-fingernails on a chalkboard. The rest-extreme indifference or active dislike.Yes-some music snobs and critics will fall all over themselves praising this. FWIW-I'm a big White Stripes fan and just because I am a fan doesn't mean I have to give a tonguebath to every one of their efforts.

Me being a more than average White Stripes fan, I was very excited and worried at the same time. Excited obviously because it's a new White Stripes album, but I was worried because I knew it would be extremely hard to top Elephant (One of the best albums EVER, I put it up with Dark Side Of The Moon and AEnima). Alas, my worries came true. Though I totally respect an artist's right to do what they want, that doesn't mean that I have to like it. Though not everything on the CD was bad, most of it just seemed to lack the harmonized chaos of Elephant. It is just straight chaos. The few bright spots for me were \\"Take, Take, Take\\" and \\"I'm Lonley (But I Ain't That Lonley Yet)\\". I really don't want to take anything away from this great band, but if you don't have any White Stripes CD's and you plan on purchasing one, go with Elephant. You'll be alot happier if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Am i missing something? Since when did the stripes take a complete 360 degree turn in the sound of their music? I mean i was very pleased with the raw garage punk sound of white blood cells and even the poppier rock sound of elephant, but this just isnt what i enjoy listening to. If you liked the single \\"Blue Orchid\\" enough to buy the album, think again. The album is COMPLETELY different sounding then that one song. If you liked Blue Orchid that much, consider buying elephant becuase thats more what it sounds like. I highly reccomend listening to this album well before buying it, just to make sure you know what your getting into and dont make the same mistake as me. If you like it, cool, but if your like me and dont like this new blue grass, loosely recorded sound, then keep your copy of white blood cells happily and hope for that sound to return to the white stripes someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I bought this cd when it was released and was pretty taken back. The music on this cd is different from the whites stripes older cds but it is still interesting to listen to and enjoy. I still listen to this album and most of the songs are pretty cool and fun.

Not that you won't hear the mainstream on this album; it'll just be standing on its head. :) Nice change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've lost it","review":"This album just keeps getting worse and worse with each passing song. I was a huge fan until this album. Now my image of the band is ruined. The single is definitely not indicative of the rest of the songs, so don't be fooled. I couldn't even listen to the whole thing I was so bored and disgusted. Don't buy this album and don't pay attention to any of these rave reviews. Listen to their old albums and be happy. I just wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE DID THE WHITE STRIPES GO?????????","review":"The White Stripes were amazing with the rock-based album Elephant. Get Behind Me Satan is a pathetic excuse for a rock album minus the song Blue Orchid.

If you like bluegrass, get it, but otherwise, just buy Elephant and be content with the music from that album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"this band used to be about good, simple rock and now it's churning out total corporate baloney.plain and simple.this album's straight-up commercial and should be tossed in the garbage along with every other artist that's sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not going to be a fan anytime soon","review":"Over the years, I've heard so many good things about this band and yet refrained from buying anything they've done.

That song is the ONLY good song on this disc. Horrible. I guess you have to be a devoted fan to really appreciate this abomination of a recording.

Forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the return of the concept album","review":"I think what a lot of people missed is that this is a concept album. Like Green Day's American Idiot or Ben Folds Five's Unathorized Biography of Reinhold Messner, each track relates to the next in telling the story of the demise of Jack's relationship, Renee Zellweger (referred to as Rita Hayworth). It's a cathartic release of all the pain and loss and anger and grief at the ending of a relationship.Personally, I love how conflicted the lyrics are. This is not a giant flamefest against 'Rita'. In exposing her flaws, he continually exposes his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ode","review":"This CD really only has three tracks that are good singles.

I probably can play as bad as the White Stripes do in this album. What happened to the simple \\"just follow the beat\\" rule? Obviously the rule doesn't apply to the Stripes. And that's why this album is a collection of noise, with some melody behind it. Pretty annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleah","review":"I'm from Detroit.

But the real star on this album and in my opinion one of the best Stripes songs ever is \\"Red Rain\\", it's an intense, hard-rocking, heavy song. Jack really put the Big Muff Pi to work on that song, it's incredible. I would buy this album just to hear \\"Red Rain\\". The other songs are misplaced stepchildren from Canada, they just don't fit in. I was really disappointed with this album, but Jack and Meg picked it back up with the next albums. I really dont even understand what people are raving about \\"Blue Orchid\\" for. It's pretty basic and boring. But that's just my opinion. Thanks for letting me say it.

(electronic sounds, etc) as Jack put it in an interview I read: \\"it's a toy that has been over-used\\" On par with albums like \\"White Blood Cells\\" and \\"De Stijl,\\" \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" is a natural progression. (\\"Elephant\\" was kind of a 'get to know the white stripes' album and shed some light on their previous work and opened the door to their new stuff) their lyrics always seem older somehow like they could have been touring with Led Zeppelin or another good old rock and roll band. Here's hoping The White Stripes never lose their formula to create original music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant","review":"This is The White Stripes most artistic album. Jack White's guitar and vocals take center stage. The album also has some country elements to it which are nice. Though not as cosistent as their earlier albums this album has some personal songs which show Jack isn't scarred to show that side of him. The first single Blue Orchid is a good heavy song too. Favorites include Blue Orchid, My Doorbell, Forever For Her (Is Over For Me), The Denial Twist, Take, Take, Take, As Ugly As I Seem, and I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet).

A fan since White Blood Cells, I love all of their CDs to date and was wondering... how long can this last!?! My first impression of this CD was that the White Stripes had \\"matured\\" somewhat. There is more variety on here than any album to date. There's also greater reward on successive listening - it's not often that I listen to a CD several days in a row! \\"Take, take, take\\" is, in my opinion, the band's best track to date, and more 'commercial' tracks like \\"My Doorbell\\" and \\"Blue Orchid\\" are of the same standard as previous offerings.

One review I came across compared this set of drivel to the Rolling Stones' \\"Exile on Main Street\\", but while \\"Satan\\" is eclectic, it doesn't even come close to Exile. Being eclectic doesn't mean it has to suck.Come on, Jack--where's the REAL album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible album!!!","review":"This album sounds like what Jack White was doing in junior high school. The thing I love about the White Stripes is that they are exciting and fun to listen to. This new album is neither one of those. Jack is a great guitar player and musician but you cannot tell from this mess. The songs all sound like they had no effort put into them; very lame and boring. I know that musicians change their sound and all that, but this is not a good change. I don't want the White Stripes to repeat themselves, but they should not kill themselves. If you want to hear great White Stripes buy any of their other albums, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pianos?","review":"I naver accually bought this. I heard it on a CD demo at borders. What The Hell????? I say. I really expected more out of Jack and Meg. Blue Orchid is great(only reason I gave this 2 stars), but after that its just pianos and slow songs. Don't waste yer moolah, and either buy the Blue Orchid single, or Elephant. Thats somthin good."},{"rating":"2","title":"possibly a masterpiece!","review":"The first half of the album is a classic, the rest is innovative...Jack takes the 'beatles' and mixes it with 'Black Sabbath' to make the \\"White Stripes\\" VERY original sound!If you don't love this, then buy a BackStreetBoys disc yousoul-less monster."},{"rating":"1","title":"they might wanna rethink that one....","review":"\\"Get Behind Me Satan\\"...The name makes you wonder if Satan was in front of them on their previous 2 albums. If so, he snuck in on first track \\"Blue Orchid\\" too, then apparently got booted. Being a huge fan of \\"Elephant\\" and \\"White Blood Cells\\", I was anticipating another remarkable rock record and what I got was so much honky-tonk, I had to double check if I had actually purchased that Loretta Lynn album Jack helmed last year.Single \\"Orchid\\" is soo good, it doesnt make you think twice that this album has fallen startopheres below of the normal. After it ends, the album only slightly regains ground all the way down at song 8, \\"Instinct Blues\\". The piano now being brought full-circle within their band, and very disappointingly so. Bring back the all out guitar/drums sets!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Behind Me Satan","review":"I think I am in the minority here who really don't \\"get\\" this album. This is definitely a far cry from their past superb efforts.I'm all for groups tinkering with their sound and trying new things, but \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" is almost unlistenable at times. The good songs are good riffs are nearly gone on this album.I wonder if perhaps the White Stripes feared that they had become too popular and too mainstream with \\"Elephant\\", and decided to throw everyone a big curveball with this inaccessible album.I ask you Amazon.com'ers, if \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" were the White Stripes' debut cd, would anyone like this band? Would this album be the savior of rock & roll? I think not...Here's hoping the next one is as good as their other efforts!And leave the vibes/marimba to Cal Tjader or Roy Ayers :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album 4 1/2 stars.","review":"This sounds so great...you will not be disappointed with this. A bit different from their others but just as catchy and inventive. Who doesn't love piano? It took me one listen to appreciate the talent and diversity. You know you want to check it out....SO DO IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Elephant, but certainly interesting","review":"It's hard to describe a White Stripe's album. More often than not, they're dynamic and sometimes a little too apprehensive for their own good. Their last album, \\"Elephant,\\" is considered their masterpiece and for good reason. \\"Get Behind Me Satan,\\" just because they can, is quite the opposite of \\"Elephant.\\" While \\"Elephant\\" is as far away from traditional as any rock n' roll album, it certainly seems more natural than \\"Get Behind Me Satan.\\" \\"Satan\\" is more effervescent and a little less ostentatious than \\"Elephant.\\" But it still carries the same sting that \\"Elephant\\" did, even if it's not as good. If you like The White Stripes, don't hesitate, buy the new album. If you don't like them, you've probably stopped reading by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"another solid Stripes album","review":"I know the critics have dissed it but I love it.Best songs.Red RainForever For HerInstinct BluesThe NurseIf you like the Stripes you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not one of the White Stripes' better albums","review":"Although this album focuses a lot more on blues than on the hard rock that has been typical of The White Stripes in the past, it still has the same great quality as well as plenty of peppy tracks. The best track in my opinion is the hit \\"Blue Orchid\\", which could use some more publicity because it rocks! This song has occasional wind noises, very hard guitar, and extremely catchy lyrics for a combination that begs to be blasted on a car stereo. Aside from this tune there are also piano-accompanied blues tracks, ones with marimba and occasional instrumental blasts, and some where Jack's voice rapidly darts from amplifier to amplifier. There is much variety on Get Behind Me, Satan, and although I think it is the least good of the Stripes' albums I would still proceed to give it a well-deserved four star rating.I recommend:Blue OrchidThe NurseMy DoorbellThe Denial TwistPassive ManipulationTake, Take, TakeRed Rain"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Experimental?","review":"Yeah right, pull the other one. Perhaps your brains have been addled by overexposure to \\"music\\" industry \\"music\\", that things like this become experimental. Freeform, avant-garde, you say? BS - this is neither technically compelling nor melodic.So, Lord of Karma, what do you say is experimental then? What do you say is cutting edge?I will tell you what - so called \\"experimental works\\" like this have yet to catch up to the 1969 debut of the Crimson King. Perhaps many of you have not heard great progressive or blues music since the 70s, no thanks to big record companies. Today, the 36-year old King Crimson turns out music which is around 1.61803399 times better than this? Nah, probably a thousand times.Check them out, and perhaps you will understand why music lovers shun cacophonic garbage like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent next step - can't wait for more","review":"Once more the Stripes surprise and succeed. This is a great album that continues the theme of true rock and roll: get together with your mates, plug in, play, and have fun doing what you love. Not everyone will find this CD to their liking as the Stripes continue to cross borders and do what they like. I liken them to early Zeppelin in their attempt to blend several kinds of music into their own style and present it as something new. Several songs here will make it on the White Stripes Greatest Hits sometime in the future - I vote for \\"As Ugly As I Seem\\" and \\"My Doorbell.' \\"Little Ghost\\" is a great little piece of mountain music too. As for the controversial drumming? Maybe banging the bongos isn't all that hard? I think Meg does a great job of keeping the beat and adding something good to every song. Great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"First off I've been a big White Stripes fan since I saw them on SNL a few years ago. After that I immediately went out and bought their first three albums, listened to them lots and was hooked. Same with #4 when it came out. And I love their DVD too.But I thought this CD was just OK. I listened to it once, and then put it in the library for rotation. When I get a new CD that I like alot I listen to it everyday for three weeks straight. Sadly that was not the case this time.Although I didn't like this CD, I like supporting musicians as they experiment and grow. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain awful","review":"The early Thin Lizzy wasn't good at all, and it wasn't until their fifth album \\"Fighting\\" they finally got their act together.

There are some absolutely brilliant performances such as \\"Del Gato\\" and \\"All the Fair and Tender Ladies.\\" For a real treat and an insight to Gene's genius, get a copy of \\"No Other\\" - easily one of the best albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Recording","review":"Gene's career seemed to have been defined by his stints in the Byrds but he was much more than that. An excellent songwriter with a wonderful voice. This is one of the few post Byrds recording where everybody else involved measured up to him. There were two different CD releases of this album. This one has the version of Changes he recorded with Carla and the other one has a really raw version of \\"Number One is to Survive\\".The basic tracks are awesome. Wonderfully played, well produced, excellent Harmony. In my opinion this is his best post-Byrds work with the first Dillard and Clark album coming in second. If you like folk rock or country rock or any of the songs he wrote and recorded with the Byrds you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeservedly Obscure","review":"Clark and Olson are world-class talents, and they work together very nicely. Gene Clark is known for his work with the Byrds but not nearly as well known for his extensive solo career. This CD is as good as anything he did, and he did very good work before his tragic early death. Olson had her own quality career with the Textones before she went solo and deserves a good listen. This CD fits nicely in the Americana genre but shouldn't be limited to it. It's a really good CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless and Wonderful","review":"This collaboration between Gene Clark and Carla Olson is nothing short of wonderous. Two unique voices blend perfectly in a pleasing, sometimes downright haunting manner, particularly on Clark's arrangement of \\"Fair and Tender Ladies.\\" In truth, there's not a bad track on this recording. Gene and Carla's rendition of John Fogerty's \\"Almost Saturday Night\\" is as pleasing in its own way as Dave Edmunds' very different, very upbeat improvement on Fogerty a few years earlier. Looking for polished, heavily produced, product? Look elsewhere. Looking for pure, honest music played with depth, heart and sincerity? Look no further. \\"So Rebellious a Lover\\" is an overlooked classic crying out to be rediscovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite Gene Clark album","review":"So rebellious a lover is my favourite Gene Clark album because1:It's got 2 of his greatest songs on it (Gypsy Rider & Del Gato)2:I think his voice improved as it got older, and this was his last official release before his death3:The production and playing are perfect for the songs4:His vocal performances are so powerful and moving"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biological Warfare in World War II and WW3???","review":"Excellent research & story telling, interesting subject matter, frightening & informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor history","review":"This book, originally printed in 1921, shows its age in its biases. Ancient Greece was the most prominent influence on Western culture? I guess the Torah/Bible, which originated in the Middle East, isn't something secular scholars know of or concern themselves with;many would refer to it as the basis for \\"Western\\" thought. They also rely on long-refuted racial categories, talking about how \\"Aryan\\" invaders molded Greece into something important. The book obviously has not been updated enough through the years in order to keep up with science. It also makes little attempt to study modern education, as current issues like vouchers and charters get overlooked. Not recommended in the least - there has to be a better discussion of the topic out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography","review":"I just finish reading this book. I thought it was very excellent and intriguing about Jim Bridger. A man, who took no pleasure in killing, following the number one rule, \\"Survival of the Fittest and Kill or be Killed. I would've like to have gotten more information on his wife and children. It's sad about what happened to his daughter and that he was widowed twice. But it's good to know that his last years were spent with his children and grandchildren. I was brought almost to tears upon reading the final chapter of this book. I'm very fascinated with the Mountain Men and the Indian women they married."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly Inept Writing","review":"Although Vestal establishes his credibility as a researcher, it is not enough to research well; one must also be a writer, and Vestal's embarrassing attempts to mimic Bridger's speech is a travesty. From inane, trite cliches to ungrammatical and unmusical diction, it is clear that Vestal needed a much stronger editor. Recommended only for those who can ignore the non-standard grammar and abyssmal writing or who are interested only in the research."},{"rating":"2","title":"swamp funk blues supreme","review":"This is an excellent album that I never heard of before finding it in a remainder bin for a dollar. What a find! This is some low down funky swamp blues and rockabilly flavored blues rock. From the opening sound of crickets that explodes into some great dirty, smeared, belching, squawking, crying guitar work,sly vocals filtered through a low -fi microphone,and great back beats, every detail is catered to creating a funky, soulful swamp feel with occasional sinister undertones. Billy Bacon, who has some nice blues stuff of his own out, also plays on this album as does Classie Ballou, Jr. who I assume is the son of the great 1960's swamp blues vet Classie Ballou. Highly recommended-- one of the best of this genre. Wish this guy had more material out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh","review":"This book is a \\"must have\\" for any serious Egyptological library. The fact that an excellent, modern Egyptologist such as Dr. Zahi Hawass has also contributed to the findings makes it even more valuable, and clearly shows that Egyptology is a constantly revised, dynamic area of study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swamp Rock and Soul","review":"Tony Joe White at his best can send chills down your spine. But sometimes his own captivating style can be its own worst enemy. Unfortunately, \\"The Heroines\\" is a bit of both. His soulful, whispered style can be very powerful. But it can also make the ambience of where and how you're listening a concern.I first listened to \\"The Heroines\\" in my car and between road noise and the throbbing bass, much of it was unintelligible. The second listening was using headphones in a quiet room. This time I was able to concentrate on the intriguing lyrics and the true sentiment of the songs. Some are very heartfelt love songs and some others reflect White's playful side and his sense of humor. And the contributions of his vocal partners, from Shelby Lynne to Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams work so very well with Tony Joe.All in all, this is a fun project and well worth the price. Just make sure you give it a chance to work on all the levels that it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Lover","review":"It is so refreshing to \\"go back\\" sometimes to real music. Tony Joe White has really over impressed me with this fantastic album of blues, country, rock...as best described. I purchased this one along with the new Van Morrison Magic Time and both CDs are so enjoyable from two musical talents and legends. My acid jazz, soul, funk and other CDs have not returned to the machine since these arrived. Please, if you get a chance to take a trip back to mother earth try and have a listen to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good grooves","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to see this CD for sale at a shop that I visited in Kuala Lumpur recently, so I didn't hesitate to snatch it up. Hearing the wicked guitar licks on the first song, \\"Gabriella,\\" I had the hunch that this was going to be a good album. And it is. Tony Joe White sounds great on this album, and I like his choice of guest female vocalist: Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris, Jessi Colter, and his daughter, Michelle White.

Then again, a good third of the book is reference appendices. These appendicies only go halfway -- they show the objects and their properties and methods, but not any of the syntax for invoking the methods. This makes the reference almost totally useless. That wouldn't be so bad if the index could point you to places in the text where these methods were explained in detail. However, this is the WORST index I've seen in any computer book.This book earns a 2 from me on the strnegth of Wrox's usual saavy tone and attention to detail in the text chapters, coupled with an unparalled depth covering emerging forms of server-side, embedded, and other forms of JavaScript.

The depth and breadth Mr. Horton has crafted into his book allowed me to grasp, with admittedly some effort, Java object oriented programming concepts.This book presents a clear path, by using both words and good sample programming techniques, to learn how to be a productive Java programmer.To have a solid grasp of the tools Java makes available to the programmer, I recommend reading this book first then read a more concise book \\"A Programmer's Guide to Java Certification\\" by Mughal and Rasmussen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning to Learning Java 2","review":"Ivor Horton has done what few other authors are willing to take the time to do: Write a book with COMPLETE examples and THOROUGH analysis. Of course this text can not cover everything, it is a book for beginners. However, once you complete it, you will have a solid foundation upon which to build."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, a book this big IS for beginners","review":"I am teaching a co-worker's daughter to program in Java and this book is exactly what we needed. She was programming-phobic and Ivor's teaching style calmed her down by explaining things very well.At 1162 pages, it is a big book. That might tend to frighten some beginners, until they realize that the reason why it is so big is because things are explained very well. If there is anything overlooked, we haven't found it yet.For more experienced Java folks, there are the later chapters. He covers things like Java and XML. I learned a few things by just browsing around in the book.The primary, target audience is the beginner. I think they would be very happy that they bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adequate beginners book","review":"This book starts of nicely, however, it uses a lot of math related example which are of no use for a real programmer. After all this book is intended for programmers. Second, all chapters are related to one another. If you want to read information let's say on Collections you have to read the section on I-O steams because author uses some examples from previous chapters. Overall, this book is alright to start learning Java with."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BEGINNERS - NOT FOR ANYONE","review":"Long, boring and poorly written. A great choise for a gift to someone you want to punish..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"The author, I am truly sad to say, has done anyone who bought this book a disservice. There is an extraordinarily low amount of useful information in this book, so much so that after owning it for 2 weeks I'd give it away. I would suggest to anyone considering this book to consider another."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginning ?","review":"I must have a library full of WROX books and by far this is the worst book i have read. The author is dry and confusing to say the least. He uses inapproriate examples which may confuse most beginners and his method of teaching is AWFUL ! WROX made a big mistake allowing this author to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"This is my second book on Java and now I realize that it should have been the first. The author does a great job of introducing all the aspects of OOP and implementaing OOP in Java. Beginners should pay special attention to Chapter 6 ('Extending Classes and Inheritance'). Don't skim thru it 'cause if you do, you might not be able to understand rest of the book. Another great thing about the book is the support which Wrox is extending. There is a Q&A seminar link on the Wrox site of this book on which you can post questions regarding the book. I have posted a few questions myself and the author, Ivor Horton, responded within 24 hours. Ivor and Wrox, thanks to you both for such a splendid job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Average","review":"I just got finished eight months of JAVA classes. This book makes it a little easier to understand some of the concepts that are poorly described in other books. I would definitely buy it for a backup to any other JAVA textbook you might be required to have. Since JAVA is my first language I was glad that I picked up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for Programmers","review":"The title is abit misleading. I my self program in MARKIV and COBOL, and found this book very useful in helping me to learn JAVA programming. My friend on the other hand wanted to learn JAVA, with no programming knowledge and found it to be extremely useless. If you have no programming knowledge I suggest another book. My only beef is that he goes into too much detail on little things like variables. On the other hand great to learn concepts like OOP when coming from a structural programming backround. Also if your only desire is to lean applets this book may not be for you, the book builds from the bottom up and teaches the foundation of the language before getting into the more advanced stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book","review":"1.The whole book presents information in a linear, bore-you-to-death, window-help-file style. No section summarys, no warning and tips, no JAVA programming insights.2. The exception handling chapter is confusing, the input-output chapters are unreadable. Window GUI programing (which by its nature should be interesting) in this book can make you start wondering why you want to learn JAVA.3. The book's size can be cut down 30% if it's not as WORDY as it is now.4. After reading so many \\"wonderful\\" reviews at Amazon, I bought this book last year. But after a whole painful month, I gave up and switched to other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read (too much details for a beginner book)","review":"I have been programming in Fortran, C, VB for 15 years. This book, in my opinion, has the following problems: 1.The huge amount of details could be organized in a better way.The author has put too much details into it right from the beginning. The readers are buried in it without seeing the big picture. It could happen that you fight through 1/3 of the book (that's already 400 pages with very small font size) but still don't know how to start to write a real Java program. 2. it would be better that the writing be in a more compact fashion. The author has spent lots of space (and did a good job ) in teaching good, general programming techniques, but I prefer getting to Java's real meat more quickly and directly. . I would love to give a 3 star, but since everyone else (almost) is applauding it, allow me to pull it down a little bit :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pros: THe book covers a great deal of information but...","review":"The books problems are:1. Horton uses too much math to teach java. If you are a math guy, then you will be happy. The problem with this approach is that abstract math in not usually seen in the programming scene! So why teach with it instead of using more real life examples!2. The books examples are boring, you don't get into windowing until chapter 10! Before that you watch JAVA preform as a glorified calculator in a DOS prompt window.3. The examples that actually build something build over many chapters, so you really don't see anything completed until you have read two trees worth of paper. It is far better to teach in small working examples so that the student can get a feel for the entire process."},{"rating":"2","title":"U can learn JAVA!","review":"1. Easy to read and understand this book if you have little programming experience and know how to work computer and download free JAVA software and work with it. 2. It doesn't have answer to the questions. 3. No CD with the book. 4. Chapters are nicely organized. 5. If you practice the programs, I bet you will learn JAVA. 6. Best book on JAVA 2, if compared with other books. 7. Beginning JAVA 2 doesn't mean that it is for beginners who wants to program, it says on top of the book that it is from a PROGRAMMER TO PROGRAMMER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Content","review":"Do not buy this book. It does not contain practical examples and lacks expanation of concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning Java2","review":"It's a good book but it would be easier if you have a good programming back ground. The examples are excellent i.e small and simple hence making it easier to pick up the concepts Ivor is trying to explain. I also like how he uses diagrams to explain loops, buffers, Exceptions, etc. On the whole it is a good book but you would need some experience in programming to go faster. A beginner in programming will have some difficulty initially, but if you are really determine you will sail through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Random and wordy","review":"This guy rambles too much. It's almost like he took a college lecture and dictated it for the book. His almost every thought is included in written form. Lucky us! ;-)For a faster, more direct intro to the language, I highly recommend Java 2: A Beginner's Guide by Schildt. It's much more concise, ordered, and clear.Horton jumps around too much. He touches on a subject and then tells the read \\"but we'll be covering that in a few more chapters.\\" Then why bring it up? There are items like this throughout that really break up the flow.Despite my dislike of straight readability of this book, it will sit on my shelf as a decent reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Trees","review":"Boy, how disappointing, how frustrating - the author does not answer so many simple questions (How do I create a text file? How do I set System properties at startup?) There is a total lack of decent examples. Go get the Nutshell book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well-written book with great detail","review":"This is really one of Horton's best writing efforts to date, and I would recommend this book to anyone who's trying to learn Java. Although the book may be a bit steep for true \\"beginner\\" coders (I'd consider it a mid-level book), it provides a very well-structured and evenly paced overview of the language. I think it will serve a variety of experience levels quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best choice for readers who have some knowledge of java","review":"I have readed Ivor's beginning for C++, and now I am reading Ivor's beginning for java. Although the Ivor's beginning is for beginner, actually they are very complete and detail, Ivor explains conceptions very clearly in his book. I got much from them very much, so I give five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but may be a little too much","review":"I had the previous version of this book and lost it so I bought the new version because I really liked the one I had. Unfortunately my experience has been a little different with this version. It contains a lot of great information however I think it may have too much in it for most beginners and novices. It is also a very thick book and takes up a lot of space when carrying around.The information is great in the book but it isn't something you'll be able to hold in with the first read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical grab your money and run book","review":"The book is confusing to read. And it misses so many important and basic topics (I found this out when I was preparing for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam and reading other books).It's a typical bad book written by Unix-or-mainframe-C++-programmer-turn-to-Java-author. It explains a lot of general programming but is weak on Java-specific topics. Those dull examples and failure to show us what are important and what are not in practice are the result of author's lackness in extensive REAL world Java programming experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for serious programmers","review":"This book is a good intro for someone who has never programmed before; however, if you are serious about really learning java this is not the book for you. This book doesn't even contain a chapter on network programming. The author is very chatty and it takes him forever to make a point. The examples also don't apply to real world situations.If you want to learn java and begin producing useful programs fast, I suggest reading Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel, which is available for free on-line, or getting Core Java volumes 1 and 2 published by Sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encompassing Book","review":"I have a previous edition of this book and thought it was a very good guide to learning Java.

You just won't understand and you'll get really bored!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly boring","review":"Maybe the most overrated book ofthe year.

As a high school student, I had little knowledge of philosophy. This book made me ask myself so many questions that it kept me entertained even when I wasn't reading it. It was interesting to read and think about. It sparked my intrest in philosophy, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone taking a philosopy course, or anyone interested in philosophy. Even though it is big, and a bit long, I found it very enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Should read this book!","review":"The first time somebody try to explain the history of philosophy through a novel, this book will make you feel that you are really learning while are having so much fun and exitment.

I read alot on philosophy and metaphysical subjects, and thought this book would be right up my alley. I shouldn't have trusted the jacket. I thought it was uninspired and sterile. Some topics just can't be happily force fed to the general public no matter how basic a story line. I think this book is a way for pseudo-intellectuals to feel caught up. Sort of like cliff's notes blended together with pillow talk from our apathetical, lazy moder society. I'm sorry Jostein, don't let one punk kids opinion get you down...but this isn't one i pass on to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophies World: Decent book, Long Read","review":"Writing about historical philosophy can be extremely monotonous. The never ending details of each philosopher and their accomplishments find a way to all sound the same. Jostien Gaarder tried to take a different approach on this subject matter. He tried intertwining historical philosophy with an intriguing novel. This resulted in 500 pages of never ending details and subject matter that was presented the same way every chapter. The plot became extremely confusing and difficult to follow and at the same time there were so many philosophers to think about. Jostein's attempt was an unsuccessful scattered 500 page mix of history text book and story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel?","review":"This is possibly the worst \\"novel\\" I have EVER read! It's more like a textbook about the history of philosophy, but with an increadibly weak attempt at a plot. The subtitle is very deceiving. As for the writing--terrible! There were several incomplete sentences. I could definitely not call this \\"literature\\". When it was not boring, the whole book was just strange. The odd twist at the end was definitely not a satisfactory close. Don't waist your money on this piece of junk! If you want a lesson in philosophy, just buy a textbook-it would probably be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, boring, downright stupid","review":"Please save yourself the time and money and refrain from this book which is borderline antisemitic and is plain BORING.

This book had the pretention of covering 3000 years of human thought in 400 pages. I found the plot rather dull and full of unabashedly two-dimensional characters (mere props to the supposesd discourse that was going on) and the coverage of philosophy so standard and without character that it felt like I was reading \\"cliff notes.\\"Coverage of anything that I knew well was a disappointment. The one chapter on the Middle ages covers 1000 years and barely even mentions the achievements of scholasticism, which arguably became a pillar as important to modern science as Kepler's discoveries. OK, you can't cover everything, but that points to the deepest flaw in this book: it is far too ambitious. As such, this is a book for yuppies who want to feel like they are learning something and being significant by reading about an entire epoch in a half an hour.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and sends wrong message to kids.","review":"I think this book is not good. Evidently, the author does not live in the 21st century or has never known a 14 year old girl. He makes this girl invite someone who she doesn't even know to her house. And she tells him when her mom will not be home. I mean, this guy could have been some weirdo and could have done anything to her. And who doesn't know that a mirror is just a piece of glass? Please... I thought she was seven. And the little messenger... OF COURSE IT WAS A DOG!!!What moron can't figure that out. I knew it the first time she received a wet letter with holes. Gosh! This author needs to get a clue. I'm very upset that this book is being assigned in school and giving out the message to kids to invite strangers over and trust people you don't know. This book is not good enough to be considered a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!!!","review":"Sophie's World was horrible!!! The whole book is not even a story, it was just a way for the author, Jostein Gaardner, to get his thoughts out on philosopy to people. I found myself skimming parts of it, and the characters had no depth to them, because the whole book is an annoying trick. Good luck if you buy this- it is in no means a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophie's World","review":"This book was really, really bad. IF not for the fact I was forced to read every little poorly written page for my class, i would have stopped on page 2. Do not get this pile of paper that some one has tried to pass off as a book. IT is nothing more than a textbook that has a pointless and stupid story line. The author seems to have never met any one in their teens because the young girl in this is way to smart for her age. Not to menchian the fact that she follows the direction of a complete stanger. Buy this and suffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and life changing","review":"I first read Sophie's World in 1996. A friend suggested I read it. I bought a copy at Auckland Interntional Airport and took it with to New Caledonia. I could not put it down. I decided then I wanted to read all the philosophers covered and to teach philosophy, and I would even name my first daughter Sophie (actually I didn't). It is to me a book about the power and comfort of ideas and reason. It is also about how complicated notions can be communicated simply and clearly. It is a democratisation of philosophy in the same league as the Khan Academy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Its a great book...I read it in High School and decided to buy it and read it again a few years later----Im still working on it, but am impressed with the reading :) Im glad a decided to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product, timely delivery","review":"The book is more than just wonderful. I couldn't put it down, as curiosity kept pushing me to grasp every word that I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"The book is a must read for all who are slightly interested in where we come from, who we are, and how we think. It explains easily the philosophies of all the great thinkers through known history, and has the reader wandering down philosophy's path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceedingly clever!","review":"Gaarder winds the plot inextricably with the sections of philosophy Alberto Knox (Albert Knag's alter-ego); he uses the plot to illustrate the thoughts of the time. Don't read this book solely for plot or information - you have to read with both in mind to receive the full effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"I think this is an absolutsly fabulous way to be introduced to the heavy subject of historical philosophy in a light and though-provoking manner. It's a mystery, a history, and a child like adventure all at the same time. A history lesson in thought and a page-turner at the same time! Gaarder makes the impossibe possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crash Course to Philosophy","review":"'Sophie's World' is a great mixture of fantasy and philosophy. It's an excellent book especially for those who are interested in philosophy but don't know where to start. It's gentle introduction to this subject that could very easily turn into a complicated jumble of theories, fails to lose the plot, both of what Gaarder is trying to teach us and of the story. Sophie's journey through this adventure, keeps us reading, not just to learn, but to know what happens to the young girl on her birthday. The constant twists, especially at the end, inabled me to put this book down. Gaarder's explanations of certain philosophical theories makes the book a lot easier to understand, and more believable due to the fact that I doubt that many teenage girls would understand the beliefs of Ancient Greecian men if laid out to them without any trace of an explanation. Overall, an excellent read, full of adventure and theories. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"You either HATE it or you LOVE it","review":"Assigned this novel for my Philosophy class, I hardly felt it was a novel. It was a history book thinly disguised as a piece of fiction. I admit it is a great resource for students, but not very comprehensive, and the writing seems as though it is geared toward young fantasy-ridden girls. Worth the time if you need a quick resource for a philosphy paper, but not if you are looking for good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy in a novel way","review":"A very unique presentation of philosopher's work through time. From Socrates right to present day thinking.To weave it into a story was even more appealing and philosophy so much more interesting. A very good effort by the author and highly recommended to anyone wanting a philosophy class."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent book overall","review":"I thought the book was excellent I was refered to the book by my great uncle in Scotland and I loved it . It was an excellent introduction to philosophy and has had me thinking harder than I ever have before I'd say that older readers who don't get bored easily will thouroughly enjoy this book although I must say this jostein gaarder left the end of the book very how would you say it unorganised it was a little hard to grasp the concept but overall an absolutely wonderful book!:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word - Goethe","review":"\\"He who cannot draw on 3000 years is living from hand to mouth\\" - Goethe.To draw on the past 3000 years read Sophie's World.

Before reading this book, I thought that philosophy was rather boring. I also often wondered (rather facetiously) if philosophers and writers of philosophy textbooks competed among themselves to find the most abstruse manner to explain even the simplest concepts. This book made me not only understand simple as well as complex concepts but gave me great appreciation for philosophy. I initially read it to help me with a college philosophy class but found that it also helped me understand history and religion better. Not only that, but it is an incredibly interesting story in and of itself. An awesome book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"Take the plunge. This really is a great introduction to philosophy--If that is what you want to read this book for, then as of yet I have not found a better book. The plot can be gimmicky, but you won't care if you'll realize it is just a little flavor to move the book along while tackling certain philosophical questions outside of history and instead inside the actual novel. There are over 500 reviews written on this book. It currently has a four star review and the only real criticism I see is that people say that it is not 'real literature.' Well I just find that elitist humbug of people who are too proud to admit that this is a wonderful introduction to philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"If you come at this book from the perspective of the a child about the age of Sophie, it is spectacular. If you instead are expecting a tretise for adults you will be mystified and wholly annoyed. The point of the book is to present the many thoughts and theories on the existance (or non-existance) of the universe in a creative and inspiring manner in order to spawn imagination on the subject of what is \\"real?\\" Or if you'll pardon the Clintonism: what \\"is\\" means.This author manages to make the history of thought interesting. As someone who merely dabbles in philosophy, I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for gifted children 8 and over...","review":"If your child has read all the classics, is bored with the run-of-the-mill children's books these days, or simply looking for something to satisfy all those questions - buy this book for him/her. It is a book they will return to many times. Alternatively, read it to him/her yourself, or use the audio-tapes. I have read it twice - and thoroughly enjoyed the philosophy component. It is an easy way to acquaint onself with Western philosophy if you have had no prior experience. The story itself, with a 14-year-old girl 'involved' with a strange middle-aged man, was difficult to explain to a child! I bought this book when it was first published, and have recently re-read it. However, I STILL have yet to grasp the ending! Whilst it is highly unlikely the author would ever read all these reviews, if he does: THANK YOU for contributing so much to a gifted child's mind and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirkus Review REVEALS the mystery! Danger!","review":"Warning! Do NOT read the Kirkus Review of __Sophie's World__ on this web site! The world-weary reviewer bluntly reveals the pivotal mystery inherent to the book, with no warning to his hapless reader, totally spoiling the book for those yet to finish this wonderful experience. I'm furious that Amazon has such a *deadly* review residing on the site of a Mystery novel. It's ruined the reading experience for me; I was half-way through, and the excitement has been destroyed by this thoughtless essay. Bah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It delivers","review":"I rate this 5 stars not bec. it is one of the best books I've ever read, but bec. it achieves what I think is its author's purpose. It provides a comprehensive understanding of philosophy, wound into an equally interesting plot that'll keep you going until the whole thing is unraveled. The mystery turns out quite poorly, but meanwhile I now know the difference bet. Plato and Hume so what the hell? It was meant as a lecture than a story, really and I emerged from it a whole lot satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey into the self","review":"Philosophy is certainly a complex matter if one researches in how it has come to be and what is happening to it at present. When one comes to encounter it, usually as part of the required subjects to be taken in college, one would generally be overwhelmed by the myriad ways of thinking that diverge and do battle in Philosophy.So if you need a primer, what better way than through a lecture in the form of a story? This metafiction-cum-lecture is the easiest way to get a grip on how man thinks about himself and secures his place in the cosmos. Divided carefully into letters which contain the lectures, it provides for easy transition from one mode of thinking to another. And since it's in the form of a story, one need not get bored as it goes on.This book is best read when one is only at the doorstep of understanding philosophy. And believe me, this book is just the ticket to loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"10,000 times better than reading a textbook on the material.

Since i homeschool, he wanted to give me something to read. I wasn't really interested at first, but flipped through some of them and got hooked. \\"Sohpie's World\\", is so amazing, I would have never thought about the concept Gaarder put in, about we, the people being just part of story, where the author is \\"creating\\" our future as he pleases.

While enlightening in weaving the historical thread of philosophy, the story which frames this mini-course is frail, erratic and finally ludicrous. While I enjoyed the philosophy, which truly broadened my perspective on the thinking life of we humans, the story itself made me cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are floating in Space","review":"Sophie's World is the savior to would be philosophy students around the world (ie: everybody alive in this reality). This is the book that will allow you to be floating in space, examining the history of thought, and asking questions that maybe you couldn't ask yourself before. Concise, yet thorough when dealing with the different schools of philosophical thought, Jostein Gaarder has made what could be a tedious task extremely exciting, entertaining, and provoking. Sophie, Alberto, Hilde, and Major Knag , not to mention Mr. Gaarder himself, will open the minds of any reader who dares to dare themself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is a modern classic.","review":"I read Sophie's world immediately after I had read Bertrand Russell's history of western philosophy. I found Jostein Gaarder's illustrative examples in many cases to be more helpful and illuminating than Russell's and whilst Sophie's world does not provide the historical background for understanding the work of the various philosophers, it does manage to get at the heart of their ideas. As an entertaining introduction to philosophy, this work is faultless. As a novel, it has a few drawbacks but the plot has a thoroughly entertaining twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much philosopy, not enough plot- BORING!!","review":"I had to read this book in the summer for AP European History and was at first excited to learn about philosophy using a semi-fictional book. I was wrong. This book is simply an excuse to write a short textbook on the history of philosophy with only hints of an alterior plot thrown in. It took me weeks to get through this one and I was put into the terrible state of wanting to blow the book to pieces each time I started reading. If you are in fact interested in philosophy and simply want to have a concise history of the subject then this book is an excellent source, but I would clearly not recommend it to those of the weak hearted who simply want a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, half-baked...","review":"... but if you loved the movie What the Bleep Do We Know, then you will be doubtless swept away by the warm and fuzzy feeling of this trite plot and rather cursory and one-dimensional examination of Western philosophy, which completely dismisses or ignores Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Schopenhauer, Habermas, Foucault, Heidegger, and others (and totally misses the mark in its analysis of Sartre's humanism)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolproof cure for insomnia...","review":"This book is the most pathetic excuse for a novel I have ever encountered. This is obviously a texbook poorly disguised as a novel. The thought that I spent about ten weeks of my time in school reading and studying this book just makes me nauseous. I would also like to point out that the story line that this book is based on is poorly constructed and the ending is an obvious cop-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Entire Book Club HATED it","review":"We read Sophie's World for my book club. Our group consists of three English teachers, two science teachers, a history teacher, a philosophy major, and an RN. We are not \\"fluff\\" readers, so we expected to enjoy this novel about philosophy. Boy, were we wrong!None of us liked it. It read like an introduction to philosophy textbook with unbelievable characters. Most of us teach middle school and none of us believed Sophie's incredible interest in philosophy, her amazing knack at grasping such ephemeral concepts so quickly, nor her close relationship to her \\"mentor.\\"The idea of the outlying story was interesting, but poorly written. Both the imaginary and \\"real\\" worlds in Sophie's World were so flat and unrealistic that it was impossible to reach the suspension of disbelief necessary to become engaged in the text. I would not recommend this book to anyone for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy in the Mud","review":"As a lover of philosophy, I was simply infuriated by \\"Sophie's World\\". The treatment of the great philosophers and their ideas is so shallow that it is simply revolting. The characters are flat and unconvincong, the dialogues are artificial, and the plot is smart-alecky and pretentious. My only hope is that young readers will not be satisfied with this book and look for ones which do more justice to this most virtuous of human pursuits. If you have not yet read \\"Sophie's World\\", I beg you - leave this mass-market piece of junk on the shelf. It will give you the worst possible misconceptions. For an excellent and interesting account I would recomment Brian Magee's \\"The Great Philosophers\\", and for economic thought - Robert Heilbroners's \\"The Worldly Philosophers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"This is a poorly written novel that pretends to be philosophical but doesn't quite make it. The dialogues are terrible, pre-packaged, cooked up, unbelievable. The idea is stupid: a recast of a high school philosophy textbook into series of letters from a creepy old man to a 14 year old girl. This is a bad way of getting teens into philosophy. Anyone with brains would prefer to read Plato or Nietzsche directly to being stalked by self-proclaimed philosopher. The novel is clearly aimed to people who are not capable going to the sources get the real deal. This is philosophy for sophists."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it negative stars if I could","review":"Sophie's World is a philosophy text book with a small unrelated and poorly written story thrown in between sections.

It was painful having to read this book, and I had to make a little scheduale for when I would force myself to read it. It also seems to be very religious, and it's constantly mentioning why god did this or that. The book did not get good until the last three chapters. I do not reccomend buying this book if you're looking for enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't finish it","review":"I've always been interested in philosophy, but this is just too dull. Not enough time is devoted to any one school of thought to give more than the bare bones of the ideas involved.This kid instantly grasps entirely new (to her) concepts in a way no 15-year old ever would. And I wanted to slap her after a while because I was so sick of all her cute, sarcastic remarks during her lessons. Plus, how smart could she really be to not only give a strange man her address, but to tell him what times of day she would be alone?When I finally decided I couldn't finish it, I looked ahead to see if the \\"big twist\\" I'd been anticipating all along did in fact pan out, and sure enough, there it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"a simple-mimded author","review":"I regard the author as simple minded, almost primitive in his thought processes.

This is a [bad] novel, and drags as a philosophy text. Sophie is just there as an excuse to make this book more than just a textbook. I thought I was reading just another text on philosophy, instead of an interesting novel... Do you honestly want to listen to this: \\"Kant also formulates the 'categorical imperative' in this way...\\" yada yada, yawn...boring!I think gaarder, honestly, should've just written a plain philosophy textbook because that way, you get what you expect: long philosophical departures and notions. Because gaarder attempted to lodge all this philosophy into a novel, he ends up producing a failure--a failure at a book as well as a failure as a philosophy text.

While many kids in highschool loathe reading, i happen to be one of the few who enjoy reading on my spare time. This book made me want to die. While i do belive philosophy is intresting, thought provoking, and entertaining, this book made me want to fall alseep. I love the ideas of these thinkers, but the way it's presented is just..boaring. I often had to read pages over and over again, because i could not grasp the concept. Not because it was too difficult, but because i found my mind wandering off onto other subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised","review":"It absolutely bowls me over that so many people thought this was a great book. I must be out of touch with how most people think. I thought this book was silly and now after a few years I hardly remember any of it. The books I have enjoyed remain in my mind for decades as joyous, wondrous vacations. This one was fluff, pure fluff -(in my 'umble opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"As an introduction to philosophy, this book is outstanding. But it will not satisfy everyone's taste, which is rather a great pity, because I think philosophy is a very important aspect that everyone needs to know of. Oh well...At its core, the story is about a young teenaged Norwegian girl, Sophie Amundsen, who gets pulled into the world of Philosophy through letters written by Alberto Knox, an eccentric philosopher. Later, he and Sophie discuss philosophers and their theories face to face. At the same time, mysterious things begin to appear in Sophie's life. As the story and lectures become paralell, it moves on at such a paste that in the end one cannot but feel both frustrated that the book has ended, and also because it fills your mind with unanswerable questions about the characters and story.For anyone interested in Philosophy, this is a MUST-read. Otherwise, sadly, there's a possibility that you may not be impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product is exactly as it is shown.","review":"The book is exactly as it is shown. I ended up not needing the book for my class, so I had not read it yet, but from what I hear from others and what I have read about it, the book seems interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy Through A Child's Eyes - Brilliant!","review":"With a great mix of history, rhetoric and wonder, this story gives you a great knowledge of the history of philosophy simplified through the eyes of 12-year-old Sophie.While getting her mail one day she stumbles upon a mysterious envelope in her mailbox, and the story unfolds. While slow to start, this novel picks up speed as she delves deeper into the different schools of philosophy until everything she considered true in the world is flipped.A great read for anyone who likes books that make them think. Not a light beach read or a novel to skim through. This will stay with you long after it finds a home on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and informative read","review":"I had a great time reading this book. It has a fun premise and does a wonderful job of summarizing the theories and ideas of several famous philosophers. It definitely got me to think, and I thought it was great fun.

English class, I thought, \\"A history of philosophy? How good can ths book be?\\" But the book is kept alive by the plot, which twists and turns in many directions before revealing a surprise climax - that Sophie is merely an element of a story. The exploration of philosophy and the surprise ending definitely answer the question \\"Who are we?,\\" which Sophie first pondered at the begining of the story. I'm not especially interested in philosophy or other subjects of the sort, but I found Sophie's World to be an interesting and intriguing book. Despite what I have read in many of the reviews, Sophie's World should be read for a dual purpose, as both a story and a history of philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read!","review":"I rate this book as one of the best I have ever read. On one hand it is a unique mystery story about a girl who discovers she is only a character in a book. On the other hand it explains the history of philosophy in such a simple and fascinating way that anyone can understand it. Even after the first chapter I realized I was reading one of the greatest books ever written. I would recommend that absolutely everybody buys this book. Once you read it you will never look at the world the same way again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED It","review":"Hey, I don't know why all of you are bashing this book. I'm about 10 pages from the end and I loved every page.Philosophy was my favorite subject in high school. I found this book to be a very entertaining and clever way to present the materials.

I highly recommend this book.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of 'Sophie's World'","review":"I wish I had read this book when I was about 15. It presents itself as a novel and a primer in philosophy. It certainly succeeds in the latter role. The book manages to covers three thousands years of thought in a very concise and simple format (without distorting positions) for young readers.If this book has faults, they are as a novel. 'Sophie's World' has a great twist toward the beginning of the work, which opens up a second-world that can't be explained without revealing too many spoiling details. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize how chaotic this second-world becomes toward the end of the book. The author takes too much pleasure in fantasy and disorder to render a coherent 'world' for Sophie. The overarching story is still touching and effective, and the second-world effect is, overall, a nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a short review...","review":"I have one word to describe this novel: Genius! I absolutely loved it. I couldn't have learned more about Philosophy if I had taken a course on it! Mind you, I'm not in University yet, but \\"Sophie's World\\" has convinced me to take a Philosophy course as soon as I get there! If you haven't read this book, I sincerely suggest you do so, and quickly! ~Ja ne, Sora T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information","review":"As the title \\"Sophie's World : A Novel About the History of Philosophy\\" says, this sure is a novel about the history of philosophy. Jostein Gaarder did a reasonable good job in holding the reader's attention through the philosophical lessons using a very novel plot (it is not very difficult for the history of philosophy to be dry.) I developed a very keen interest in philosophy recently but I never had a formal education in philosophy. This book was like a text book in philosophy for me. I think this is a must read for every novice philosopher (might still be a good read for others too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The easiest way to read philosophy","review":"This book is written like a fairy tale with sharp weaves of philosophy. If you ever wondered who Freud was, or what Nietchze said or about Hobbes - then this is the book for you. It is simply written and is a great way to start a off-campus course in Philosophy. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy for the uninitiated","review":"This is a book to teach young adults about philosophy and ideas that have influenced the world. 15 year old Sophie starts to receive messages that ask her to think about who she is and where the world comes from. Then Alberto Knox sends her lessons about philosophers' attempts to ask and answer philosophical questions. The lessons cover highlights of 2000 years of philosophical thought. She also begins to receive some postcards from a UN observer in Lebanon. The philosophy lessons are made interesting by the story of Sophie trying to figure out why she is receiving the lessons and the postcards. This book is not only a great introduction to philosophy for young adults but would be a fascinating read for everyone who heard about different philosophers' ideas throughout their lives but never really got around to reading about philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pilosophy starter kit, be careful you may get hooked","review":"I finnaly sat down and read this woderful book. I could not lay it out of my hands. The author takes you and wanders with you through the centuries of mankind's search for understanding who we are, why we are here and where we come from. It is written in a captivating style,wrapped in a mystery tale and I hope that a young person would enjoy it as much as I did. I wish I had found a book like this earlier, it would have helped me to get access to philosophy much earlier in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I have serious problems with this book, which was recommended to me by many people, of whose opinions I am now in doubt. The book serves its purpose well, to educate fiction-readers about the history of philosophy, increase our sense of wonder about the world, etc. However, the book has no sense of wonder for its own characters, its plot, or its literary choices. The novel is not written well at all and there is little if any character development. It's a poorly-masked attempt to increase the points of access for philosophy, but the voice of the main character is oversimplified and insults the reader's intelligence. This book actually made me enjoy philosophy even less than I already do, though it did succeed in answering the question of why we continue to study it at all. Still, the writing is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for those who are too lazy to read the actual works.","review":"I have to say that I did not enjoy this book at all. It was practically like reading a philosophy text book, and the story is a rather feeble and weak attempt to make the book interesting. I found myself quite insulted as I was forced to choose between reading the philosophy part and skipping the story of Sophie or viceversa. I recommend that if anyone is truly interested in philosophy that he reads the actual works of Plato and company."},{"rating":"1","title":"A textbook read.","review":"I picked up Sophie's World at the wrong time. Between school and a busy homelife, I needed some quick reading and this certainly wasn't light reading!The history of philosophy is, of course, very detailed. Jostein Gaarder has written an in-depth, fascinating book, but unfortunatelly, one has to be in a specific state of mind to be able to follow along, and come away from this wonderful literary experience with everything the author intended.So, to recap, great book, but only pick it up if you have the time and interest in being completely absorbed in the very detailed, and often dry, history of philosophy and the world in general.Not unlike reading a textbook -- fascinating, but often boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastical Journey thru Some Basic Philosophy!","review":"Here we have a fun, eye opening trip through a good portion of western philosophy, starting with the Greeks and finishing just past Existentialism. Truly a fun ride throughout, we journey with Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, through Hume, Kant, Marx, finsihing up with a very nice explanation of Sartre's Existentialism. Perhaps the best section is on Darwin, an outstanding capsulation of Evolution, including the famous color mutations of moths in recent day England due to environmental changes. Sophie is never less than a wondrous curiosity seeker, and her teacher almost as good. The labyrinth trip through what is real and what may be be is near flawless with the addition of 2 similar characters. Plus short appearances by certain fictional characters like Carroll's Alice make this book a real fun knockout for seekers of all ages and backgrounds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"serioulsy, this book is AWFUL! after reading all the glowing reviews, i was really excited about this book, but it's one of the worst things i've ever read. the story is ridiculous, and the philosophy is extremely superficial. besides ignoring nearly all of the 20th century philosophers...(where are you foucault?!) the author glosses over HUGE portions of the history of philosophy. philosophy is important to study because it is exciting, groundbreaking, worldchanging... this book left me utterly bored. any author that can make freud seem boring and dry is an author to avoid... AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned off by anti-semitic content","review":"This is not meant to be a comprehensive review. I actually found the book quite interesting until I got to the point near the end of the book where the author attempts to describe Judaic and Christian philosophy. One can infer from his writing that he subscribes to the notion that Christianity is the successor to Judaism, and that Judaism is now obsolete. This is, of course, offensive to Jews. Also, since I know that his understanding of the relationship of Judaism and Christianity is incorrect, it makes me doubt his knowledge of other philosophies. I would otherwise have no reason to doubt the validity of the rest of the book, since this was an introduction to philosophy for me, but I now doubt the author's understanding of all the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Garbage","review":"This book is absolute garbage. This text is approachable, but at the expense of insight and substance. If you can choke down the terrible, tacked on plot, you will be left with a trite and cursory look at basic philosophical issues. It reads like it was written by the book's moronic main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy account on philosophy","review":"An attempt to make philosophy entertaining for the general public is a nice idea but the story contained in this work is weak. I kept reading only to finsh the book and found the end most disappointing.

The author puts this behind a weak novel. Maybe if it was half novel and half philsophy, the book would have more impact on readers, but ten to fifteen pages of the incredibly boring history of philosophers and then two to three pages of novel is unacceptable. The only people who I would recommend this to are masochists and sadistic English teachers (can we say Mrs. Quinn?) Basically, this is an uninteresting and stupid novel that was not meant to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very very childish and BORING, only for girls....","review":"A very informative introduction to philosophy, but thats as far as it goes.

It's a textbook hiding in a novel, but not very well. It's boring and extremeley monotonous. If it was shortened by 200 pages it would be an okay read. It's biased around Christianity and the characters are unrealistic. A real 15 year old girl would not be interested and influenced by an annonymous philosophy course. If you have a passion for philosophy go ahead and read it but otherwise I think you will be unpleasently surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on philosophy, bad on story.","review":"I can imagine Mr. Gaarder is or would be a fine philosophy teacher, and the history of philosophy contained in the book was very interesting and informative if, like me, when people say \\"Let's talk about Kant\\" you say \\"OK, I can't fly\\". However, the story is quite weak for anybody over the age of 14-16. On the one hand I think 14-year old would find some of the philosophy a bit much, whereas someone slightly older would find the story too childish.

If you are just becoming interested in philosophy, are curious about what philosophy is about, or, as I am, deeply involved in studying philosophy, this book has something for everyone. I read this book a few years ago, while I was studying undergraduate philosophy and I found it great as a quick review to trick the brain into remembering who said what. Better yet, it's written in an intertaining way. I still pick it up once in a while, and recommend it to others, because it's a quick read, and it's fun.Enjoy it. Let it wet your whistle for more in depth philosophical works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Several people have said that the main fault in Sophie's world was its lack of/weakness of its plot line, but this is rather done on purpose. If certain readers had truly understood the point of the fictional parts of the book, which are to illustrate the philosophies presented and not necessarily to entertain the reader to any degree. Those who call the plot line redundant or unecessary couldn't have been more wrong. The purpose of the book is for 13 year olds like me to read in school and not for advanced philosophical minds who would rather read the confusing translations of the real works of the philosophers. This is still essentially a philosophy book and not so much a fiction, but if you want to read about philosophies in a broad overview and still get some sort of fiction to help you understand and ease the boredom, then i would definately recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"It's a great introductory book for people interested on Philosophy.

I read it, only to find out it is utterly uninteresting, flatly written and boring.I have a basic knowledge of all the great philosophers, and the subject itself is inifinitely fascinating. The only thinking Gaarder's book inspires, however, is how precious time is and what a pity it is to waste it reading books like this.

Get real!Maybe it works better for the absolutely uninitiated, but still there's better ways to approach the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Mind-Numbingly Stupid.","review":"The plot is awful, the \\"twist\\" absolutely cliched, and, most importantly, the \\"history of philosophy\\" is abismal. Do NOT think you know ANYTHING about philosophy after reading this book. If you want to know about philosophy -- and not just be able to drop names -- GO READ PHILOSOPHY! You can do it. Its not dry, its not boring, and it can be done. If you don't want to actually learn about philosophy, don't pretend you do. And if you want to read a good novel, pick one that has a real plot, real characters, and real ideas. I suggest Italo Calvino -- he actually knows how to do magical realism.

I suppose that would be too controversial. What a shame. I would rather people flame this book for simply disagreeing rather then boring them to death.This book does make it's point though, philosophy is alot of talk with no conclusion.

WHAT A GREAT SUPRISE!!! This may be the best book ever written, and it's at the very least, the best book I've ever read! Not only will you get a wonderful tour of the history of philosophy, but it's all mixed into a brilliantly developed story line featuring a 15 year old girl.

That, in and of itself, could constitute a lengthy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very intellectual","review":"If you have prior knowledge to, and interest in philosophy, don't read this book. The short-stories in between the different philosophical presentations are like reading a paperback novel written for teenage girls, and the presentation of the different philosofical ideas is quite superficial.If you have a developed interest in philosophy, the book is crap. If all you want is an introduction, it might be useful if you are able to ignore the badly written story that sort of nits it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well be a textbook, horrible novel","review":"This is the choppiest novel I have ever read! While I do have to give credit to the fact that I learned much about philosophy, this book might as well had been a textbook. The plot was not well thought out and very engaging. Plus, Alberto's painfully long lectures would awkwardly be interrupted by Sophie, with her \\"I get it now's\\" or \\"I see\\". I don't understand how this book made the bestseller list. I think this book probably has some merit, but it got \\"lost in translation\\" from it's original. I had read somewhere that many changes were made in the book that was sold in the U.S. market.

Enjoy the trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice approach to western philosophy","review":"This book is an easy-to-read introduction to the main ideas of philosophy through the centuries. It is written as a novel, in plain language, and it gives you a good starting point for further reading.The story itself is weak: a young girl starts receiving letters from an unknown philosopher who starts to teach her the most important ideas of the main thinkers. But don't let this fact discourage you as the author tries hard not to send you to sleep and, in my opinion, he succeeds. Be also aware that philosophy keeps your brain pretty busy so it's a good point that the story doesn't require an \\"intellectual effort\\" to be understood.Being a young adult myself, I recommend it for all ages, although some higher instruction is welcome in order to better grasp the concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't decide whether or not I'll finish it...","review":"This might be good for someone who has had no exposure at all to philosophy, in which case the ideas would seem new and exciting. Otherwise, Alberto's lectures are too basic.I'm about two/thirds through it, and I'm getting fed up with Sophie's constant sarcastic interjections during her lessons. Plus, Sophie not only immediately grasps completely new concepts, but she astutely compares one philosopher's reasoning to another's, while accurately honing in on weaknesses in their arguments -- I can't imagine a 15-year old like this.I'll probably just skim the rest of it -- I want to find out how everything goes with my favorite character, Hermes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Philosophy Course, But Medicore Novel","review":"Sophie's World is a fascinating description of the history of Philosophy, but that's all it is. The characters are rather plastic, I found Sophie to a bit annoying, in fact. She's supposed to be 14-15, but what modern teenager doesn't know what keeps the moon in orbit, or who Darwin is¿ The author needs an excuse to insert his monologues on Philosophy so his book doesn't read like a dull textbook, and I understand that, but I think more care should have been given to Sophie's character. It doesn't bode well for a book when all a girl can say for two pages is different synonyms for \\"I'm amazed.\\"If you don't mind the medicore characters, this is a fascinating book. I do have a few problems with Gaarder's choice of Philosophers, though. He mentions Darwin and Freud, which is a stretch I'm willing to accept, but how can you mention Freud without Jung? Despite this, I learned so much from this book and enjoyed it immensly."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Sophie' tries to do two tasks, and does neither well . . .","review":"The problem with this book is that it tries to be 1) a novel, and 2) a history of philosophy.As a novel, it is one of the worst written pieces of prose i have ever encountered, contains flat, uninteresting characters, and no plot.As a histoy of philosophy, it gives brief, stereotyped introductions to complex, important thinkers.If you want a novel and a history of philosophy, but a novel AND a history of philosophy, not this book. If you are looking for an engaging (or even merely entertaining) read, this book is not where to find it, and I see no point in learning the barest facts about something as complex as philosophy, unless you are merely fishing for tid-bits to drop at parties.\\"A little learning is a dangerous thing / Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring / There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain / And drinking largely sobers us again.\\" - Alexander Pope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up","review":"This book opened my eyes to the world around me. It intrigued me that philosophy was such an interesting topic. It was a book about the history of philosophy and the questions that they are trying to answer still today. It's not at all like a textbook you have to read for school. It also has a dramatic story of Sophie (hence the name of the title of the book).

Not only is the story line excellent, but I feel that it has changed the way I look at my life and my surroundings. This excellent introduction to philosophy has caught my interest so much that I have started reading even more philisophical books. This book was a present from my father, and one I will never forget. I made my mother, father, and grandparents all read it. So far, it has been a huge success in my family.

A lot of people give you a crazy eye when you read old philosophy outside of a college course (at least in my circles). Someone noticed what I was reading and recommended I pick up Sophie's World. A novel about philosophy sounds like a terrific idea. It's not really.I did enjoy the simplified descriptions of the history of philosophy as told to Sophie (and Hilde I suppose). This was beneficial but not thrilling.When it came to the story line, a lot is left to be desired. I finished the book of course, because it was good enough that you wanted to see what happened. I am not able to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted artificial prose drags along mechanical summary","review":"As a philosophy graduate, I expected to give to my daughter an entertaining, lively discussion of the great philosophical ideas I had explored at university; but I was greatly disappointed to read painfully wooden prose artificially linking a series of letters (from a mysterious writer) summarizing the history of western philosophy for the edification of a young girl who, in my opinion, couldn't possibly understand most of the material.As a novel, the book is a disaster; as a summary of western philosophy, it is adequate, but I would recommend Father Copplestone's far more academic explorations of the same material. My sixteen-year old daughter, incidentally, agrees with my appraisal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book (almost) because I was genuinely interested in researching some philosophy from a standing start. A novel seemed like a good place to start. I've started to read it 5 or 6 times, but still not managed to finish it.I have to say I found it too slow and predictable. There is very little to disguise the fact that it is a series of history of philosophy essays. No subtley in the anonymous letters metaphor. No characters or narrative to capture the imagination.By contract Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is an evocative roller-coaster ride, that nevertheless exposes important themes of philosophy. No contest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many errors. Much tendentious.","review":"Sophie's World seens a great book for those who understand nothing about philosophy. There are many mistakes in it. E.g.:Jostein Gaarder shows Hume as a radical sceptic. But, in truth, Hume is an empiricist that do a sceptical inquiry to determine the frontiers of human's knowledge.And it's much tendentious.

On this one, the band seem to be questioning their status as professional musicians and wondering if they'll lose touch with reality, even as they turn in the beautiful love songs \\"New Horizons\\" and \\"For My Lady.\\" This album is relevant to a lot of ordinary people whose reality focus has been affected by the Internet and fantasy TV, and is a must-own for anyone interested in progressive rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cherry on top","review":"This brings the Moodies to the pinnacle. This is such a good album and brings this group to the point where there seemed no where else to go. The quality of the songs and the sense of mood created by them are probably universally appealing.

However all tracks can hold up on their right or when taken together they are all excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"seventh blunder","review":"I have the misfortune of owning a \\"BMG Direct Marketing\\" edition of this CD, and it sounds like it was ripped from an old 1972 record. So the sound quality might be ruining my impression of this album. It is hard to hear the vocals amidst the over-busy instrumental mix, and when the lyrics can be distinguished, they are a meandering stream-of-conscious mess, perhaps drug-induced. There are many timeless classics from 1972, but this album just sounds old and dated. Do not recommend.I'm a little curious about the newer re-masterings with more tracks. Maybe they sound a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep...but in a wonderful way","review":"Most people's main observation about this album is how sad sounding it is, and the Moodie's own bad feelings during that time have been well documented. However, once you get past that, it really is a wonderful part of the Moody Blues story. Yes, songs like New Horizons and Isn't Life Strange are very sad, there are a few very happy and optimistic moments on the album, namely Land Of Make Believe and You and Me. The Moodies never could be totally negative, and this album proves that. And Ray, God bless him, as he so often does brightens things up marvelously with For My Lady.

I first purchased it as a vinyl way back in the early 70s, and fell in love with it. The arrangements are lush and evocative; the music itself is poignant, melodic and memorable; the lyrics danced across the turntable. Songs such as \\"For My Lady,\\" \\"When I'm a Free Man,\\" \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" and \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" will be Moody classics in years to come. AS most reviewers agreed, despite it being a fun tune, \\"I'm Just a Singer\\" is seriously out of place on this album, but who can help but like that bass leadin?

I found much of the Oracle-Java specific material very useful, such as the chapters on Java and SQL performance, on using Java and PL/SQL together, and more.

In defiance to many other reviews, the animation was fairly well done, as well as the voice casting. The new voice actor for Starscream was a good fit for the character. And while I do have to say that I have missed a few of my old favorite characters, I haven't yet seen a huge problem with those returning. All in all, except for a few times when the kids got extremely annoying, and the dialouge a little repetitive, this was a very good series, and I would give it a 4.75 but that number isn't selectable.

It's a very pretty book, but a bit of a waste of precious shelf space. There's very little crochet, notwithstanding the title. And most of the patterns are for hats, gloves, scarves - the most obvious contenders for single skeins. I'm not crazy over the skimpy little scarves. And some patterns are ridiculous. Like the cupcakes. What on earth is one supposed to do with knitted cupcakes? If anyone had to gift me with something like that, I would be put off them for life. Useless little dust collectors.... The one skein tank is another joke - it takes a skein of laceweight with thousands of yards of yarn. Hello? If I buy a skein of laceweight, I don't need a stash busting book - it's enough for a shawl.Anyway, if you are still a bit of a beginner, this might be useful. If you have a few knitting books, know how to surf the net, and have half an ounce of imagination, you don't need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a one-skein project book","review":"I bought this book whithout carefully looking inside and of course hoping to find some patterns for a single skein (everyone probably has a few single skeins of different pricey yarns they bought to try but couldn't afford more than that). I was so dissapointed! It seems that author doesn't really know what is average single skein is. One of the projects calls for 1250 yards skein of wool! That is very average skein size! Except for using single pattern for my own project I haven't knitted a single project out of that book. A lot of useless items and not enough of variety. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERRATED and OVERLOOKED!","review":"This is an amazing album, pure and simple. It isn't a balls out rocker but every song is rich, deep and bursting with one emotion or another. It is also Phil at his story-telling best. Must be heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here I Go...Into Your New Way...","review":"This is very progressive Irish folk rock with a lot of afro-american blues influence. This band went on to be an early innovator in that classic 70's metal sound we adore, and you will love this album. This is an epic voyage into modern Irish culture with rocking guitars, lilting, soulful, raspy, raucous vocals, and galloping heavy bass lines, dueling guitar harmonies, catchy catchy, well-written songs, and interesting arrangements of song strucuture, and song placement on the album. Beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and different for Thin Lizzy","review":"This is an incredible album. For those of you expecting a heavy tone to the album, you will be disappointed. The thing I love about Thin Lizzy is how their music changed over the years and as various band members came and went. The is electric-folk pure and simple. From \\"Honesty is no Excuse\\" to \\"Remembering\\" (parts 1 & 2) each song brings its own identity and distinguishes itself from the others. Anyone who was a fan of the work Slash did with Lenny Kravitz should check out the song \\"Ray Gun\\". If you buy this album without any expectations of style, you will enjoy it. It stands on its own separate from their other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"banking on a built in audience for P&P, but misses the point","review":"Ok, clearly Jan Austen is banking on a fan base for Jane Austen but nothing could be further from the original.

Etjole, the main character, is barely recognizeable from the first book(at least he didn't eat anybody in this one)and the plot twists, well, Foster just has plain stopped trying to tie them together or make them coherent. I can almost see his notes prior to writing \\" Uh, insane horses, a swamp, then a miracle occurs\\". As he is aging, Foster must be losing his imagination. What a shame.

However, the more I got into it, the more suspicious I became that it surely can't be real. That's when I did a little google search \\"Soviet Brainwashing textbook a hoax\\" and discovered a lot of evidence that this is not only a hoax, but a cleverly veiled Scientologist attack on Psychology.As a piece of science fiction, it is very gripping, disturbing and even Orwellian.

This is about the fifth or sixth version, with yet another new Introduction. Goff insisted it was written, in Russia, during the 1930s, yet it mentions 'Dianetics', and features other Scientology lingo. (Those Russian spies must have been busy, and had a time machine too!)

Warning: most of these bike bags are about 1/2 the size they need to be to carry even a jacket and basic accessories.Strangely, like most bags, this one is also slightly too wide at its mounting point near the bike stem, s your legs are always rubbing against it.Looks like they invented this over the phone, without speaking the same langhuage, and certainly without ever using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge space ,quality is good..","review":"Oh man !!! i can fit in 2 pairs of T Shirts into it i guess.But i have A reflective Strip T shirt,Topeck 29 tool kit, Extra tyre + Vulcanizing Patch Kit in it.looking to put in a small torch and valve adapter too into it soon.That's the amount of space its got in it.Quality of material used to built this is high grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"this is my second one, I bought the medium and decided to transfer it to my wife's bike to give me more room for tools, spare tube ,wallet ,keys, and more.

The large size of the same pack carries all of this stuff comfortably yet is almost unnoticeably bigger and certainly not intrusive.Very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag is too wide","review":"The quality of the bag is fine and so is the zipper that is used to close it. Holds cell phone, tube, tools and more with no problem. This issue that I have is that the bag isn't tapped narrow enough so that when I slide back on the saddle, the width of the bag is wider than my seat, thus my legs end up rubbing the bag, which is annoying/distracting when climbing hills.

The garden looks really pretty but maybe a little flimsy as far as construction. I don't think it would stand up to much abuse. The main problem I have with it is that it's missing one of the feet on the bottom. So, the garden does not sit level on the table and cannot be used for its intended purpose. I feel like this is definitely a manufacturer error, because you can see a spot of glue where the foot should be. I thought maybe it had just come loose during shipping, but it's no where to be found. Thank god we didn't open the sand before we discovered this. I am willing to give it another try, but Amazon does not allow exchanges with this item. Seems like a hassle to return and then reorder, but it is definitely going back.

Starting off with the berserker sonic vortex of \\"Father Cannot Yell\\", the band carves out a wild patch of territory somewhere between noise-rock, jazz improv, New Music, and beat-poet-ranting that hits home like a .44 magnum bullet to the brain even to this day. The whole second half of the release is taken up by the amazing 'Yoo Doo Right', which is one of the truly great jam classics of all time, featuring astounding work by all the band, topped by the ranting, yowling declamations of Malcolm Mooney. As opposed to the 'peace and love' and candy-rock pretentions of its contemporaries, \\"Monster Movie\\" is like salt on a raw nerve...and it hurts so GOOOOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"complete idiot's guide to football","review":"am enjoying this book. was received as described and in a timely fashion. this is a perfect book for moms who want to know what their sons are actually doing on the field!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a long hidden treasure for beatles fans","review":"first released in the mid 60s, joshua rifkin's baroque beatles book has long been unavailable and is one that belongs in any serious beatles fans' library. the classical arrangements of early beatles hits never failed to impress those classical music snobs that frequented the record store i worked in when it came out. our favorite trick was to entice them to listen to it on headphones without knowing who it was. it never failed. it's timeless. my favorite track is \\"\\"Last Night I Said,\\" Cantata for the Third Sunday after Shea Stadium, MBE 58,000: 1.Chorus: \\"Last night I said\\" Please Please Me\\". nuff'said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was good for comparing apache 1.3 and apache 2.0, and that was the end of what helped.

In the sixty years since its publication, though, opinions and interpretations have changed, and better research has been done.Nonetheless, the very readable style and global scope make this a worthwhile investment.

As is true of Moore's other, related books, they invite you to a smorgasboard of ideas, knowledge and observations. You can pick and choose, take or leave, as you like. Whilst some of his chapters are slightly 'academic', there are many aspects to his interpretations that have perfect relevance to, and resonance with our own, everyday experiences. 'Intimacy within intimacies'-this book is like the candle we hold to the dark window, as we wonder how we might feel less alone in this world. It is a guide only. However, worth the journey and the read.

I especially like how the bag is more narrow at the back end where it attaches to the seat post. I find other, wider bags can rub my legs on my ride. This one doesn't rub at all- a big plus in my book! I also like having a little pocket inside, where I put money, an ID card, and a couple of tire boots.

I used Books Online within SQL to answer my question about triggers. Books Online did an excellent job explaining how to use and manage triggers with the Enterprise Manager.

It has an easy, conversational style of writing that makes the topic easy to conceive.It's great for all levels and is very useful as a reference book. It also cuts through alot of techo mumbo jumbo that you find in many other technical books. My advice is to start your studying for the MCDBA in this book, get the understanding of the topic, and then use other books to fill in additional deatil.I am hoping that Rob Viera gets to work and writes his next book about SQL2000.

It is extremely clear, well written, and covers the essential topics that will confront a SQL Server 7.0 programmer. However, some details are missed. Examples:An SP programmed to raise errors with severity levels of 20+ will run \\"successfully\\" within DTS. Apparently DTS interprets any non-syntax error producing run as successful. How does one check for errors, and run different SPs within DTS based on errors raised?When writing an SP raising errors with severity levels of 20+, the with log option is required. However, this option requires heightened security levels than db_owner. What role should be assigned to the user of SP?

Nor should you come to this CD expecting contemporary African music (although you could see some of my other reviews for that). Instead, this CD is a survey of the religious and healing musical traditions in Kenya and Tanzania. Made at a time when many traditions were all but unknown to the outside world, the detailed linear notes do show some dating. For instance, I'm not sure the term \\"witch\\" or \\"witchdoctor\\" should even be used. Given the negative view of witches in African culture, the term shaman or priest might be more appropriate. None the less, the music here is still potent. This is real tribal music, focusing on healing traditions, as well as spirituality and rites of passage.

Listen To The Music by The Doobie Brothers is not to shabby either although they could have mixed in the catchy guitar riff a little more in the remix. The remix of Rod Stewart's Do Ya Think I'm Sexy is still sexy but I wasnt to thrilled about the remix of Whip It by Devo. I think the original is better.

It covers all of the ASP fundamentals thoroughly and clearly, however some of the more advanced features that came with ASP 3.0 and VBScript 5 are missing, especially the use of VBScript Classes. Coverage of ADO is excellent. If you are an *e-commerce* developer, I strongly suggest you also draw on other resources; the section on performance in this book is rather superficial.

At least that time around, the rest of the album grew on me and provided an overall enjoyable collection.Etterna however is quite disappointing!! Aside from La notte etterna, there really isn't much to look forward to. It sounds as though as though the songs really haven't been worked through and the singing sometimes doesn't even flow harmoniously with the music.My suggestion: buy the single for La notte etterna.

The album title and track title such as \\"Habeus Corpus\\" and \\"When History Sleeps\\" indicate that this is not going to be easy listening. However, what is surprising for this kind of heady jazz is how much heart Iyer brings to it. The only song that is not entirely original, \\"Because of Guns (hey joe redux)\\" takes Hendrix's Hey Joe riff and brings a whole new context to it while retaining the blues of Hendrix's original. The music keeps my attention by not being predictable but still has melody and rythmn.The SACD stereo sounds excellent, but the multi-channel mix is a bit disappointing. There is no subwoofer mix in the 5.1, and consequently the bass seems a bit lost in the surround. Still, I highly recommend this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half The Songs Are Mastered Horribly","review":"This is a review of the sound quality only.I have high standards when it comes to more traditional jazz outings as I find distortion and clipping to be very distracting when it comes to reeds, stand up bass, and jazz drumming. Whenever a forte occurs on this disk, there is a lot in the way of dynamic range compression, clipping, and distortion. This makes the loud parts of this disk unpleasant. Which is unfortunate, because they are all top notch musicians.It's too bad that a disk that received public funding is not of archival grade production. To intentionally introduce clipping and distortion in the sound renders this disk disposable in my eyes.Look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia, or google 'pleasurize music' or 'turnmeup' for more info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged recording - significant clipping","review":"The other reviewer is right.

Almost 25 years later I finally get it. Hank Williams was a young genius who was able to compress a much older sensibility into two minute pieces of perfect songwriting. It's no wonder he's had such an influence on folk, country, and alt. country for all these years. Lyrical wit and wisdom, and mostly impeccable musical decisions keep this collection as current as anything being written today. The few selections that sound an awfully lot alike don't mar the impact because even they are a lesson in how a songwriter makes choices. Listen to this cd, and then enjoy a fresh listen to whoever your contemporary favorites may be, and you'll hear where they're coming from. I dare say anyone who picks and grins owes a huge debt to the senior Mr. Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music!!!","review":"No doubt about it, Hank was one of the best. This CD has lots of his best songs. The best of the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"This cd set is great for hours and hours of listening pleasure.

I recommend it for anyone who appreciates Hank Sr.'s gifted voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF HANK'S FINEST","review":"This album brought back many childhood memories of my older brothers and sisters and also my parents listening and dancing to Hank Williams.

Hank Jr. continues to annoy us with musical litter to this day......Although I have heard very good things about Hank Williams III....Here's another question; why don't we ever hear tragic stories about bands like Good Charlotte dying in plane crashes? Its always people like Buddy, Otis, and Skynyrd.I'm not advocating murder...but why do sucky bands never accidently meet with a tragic end and \\"force\\" us to have to do without their music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"#129 on the Rolling Stone 500","review":"Well #129 aint so bad fer an ol hick from out west. I always listen to this CD set when Im grooming my horses or plucking the chickens. Ol bess jus luves it for that special night out by the barn when the mood is right...Just kidding.This is an essential album to have if you like country music. I like the simplicity and frankness Hank uses in his lyrics. I cant imagine a better greatest hits compilation for Hank than this one. A worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bratty Enough","review":"I was surprised. \\"The Big Bratty Book of Bart Simpson\\" wasn't bratty enough. Or funny enough. In fact it was not even 'okay' and didn't generate one hearty guffaw from me.What I was expecting was either juvenile humor -- you know, potty humor or 'gross stuff' jokes -- or edgy humor, but what I found were some very old and dusty 'jokes' that were being recast as Simpson's humor, as well as some material that could only be classified as filler.The art is good, and what you would expect if you merged The Simpsons of television fame with an old style comic book. But you can hardly expect it to carry a whole book.My 10 year-old daughter, by the way, found the book more a curiosity than humorous, and her 8 year-old brother actually skimmed most of it -- something he would never do with Captain Underpants.If I was to try to estimate who the best audience would be for this book, I'd say it's likely to appeal to younger Middle-grade boys.Pam T~mom/blogger of #kidlit"},{"rating":"1","title":"The text is wrong, no keypad included.","review":"I ordered this face plate for a 2035a. The text for it clearly says that a keypad is included. Without the key pad, it will not fit the 2035a. With the keypad it would. Even though is says it comes with a key pad, it doesn't. I will return it.\\"Each faceplate contains a keypad, a power button, a clear plastic lens, and installation instructions.\\" This came neither with a keypad nor instructions.This is the first time I've been disappointed with an item from Amazon. The real blame is on Kyocera. This same item is on their website. It also says that a keypad is included. That one probably also does not come with a keypad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall review of the early days of the Russian Empire","review":"Grey gives a good general overview of the beginnings of the Russian Empire. However, it is somewhat disjointed, jumping from event to event and back again. That makes it somewhat hard to follow, but in the end, worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crooners at Christmas","review":"I'm happy with the CD. Lots of old favorites. There are one or two songs I don't care for, but the rest are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise extra","review":"This is an excellent compilation of two lesser-known works with folk influence. There may be more idiomatic versions performed by Czech orchestras and conductors, but this is also very good - the conductor judges the scale of the works accurately, and the orchestra is a good one.In addition to the two works listed, the CD includes a surprise extra track not mentioned anywhere in booklet or other details so far as I could see - not a folk work, but a march Dvorak wrote for the celebration of the silver wedding of the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef and his wife Elisabeth. This is also very well played - the only issue by a US orchestra so far as I know.This CD has been reissued on the Warner label but the march is omitted there for some reason, so it is much better to obtain the original issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good look at America - at 10 mph","review":"This book is a delightful metaphor for our journey through life. We set out with goals in mind and find that life surprises us with twists and turns not unlike the roads the author followed on his cross-country trek. This is a journal of the daily frustrations with weather, health, and the logistics of riding a bicycle from Friday Harbor, Washington, to Key West, Florida. It is told partly through the author's email along the way to his wife and friends in Seattle (the introduction to each of the chapters), but mostly by his personal journal of the trip formed during and after. His intimate writing style lets one get to know him and the landscape along the way, but more important is his capture of the peoplescape - literally a cross-section of each state he visited through the people he encountered, and a refreshing look at our American society as we live it. I enjoyed it very much. More pictures would have got it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating and captavating read","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book as the writter has done what I plan to do in 2011 ride Corner to Corner across the USA. Many of the feelings, challenges and views shared in this book are the same as I've discovered on my rides, it's gratifying knowing I'm not alone or crazy about my passion to tour. The writer is an average Joe meaning he's not a super athlete or bike racer he's like any other typical rider with persistance and perserverance you and I too can ride across America. Last but not least, the author provides what it cost him, an equipment list as well as a review of what worked and didn't work for him which will be helpful for a first timer getting ready for his/her own bicycle adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much example, not enough reference","review":"The foundation books feel like my sons preschool class. Very fluffy, project oriented reading, but useless as a reference. Just get to the point and show me how to do it! There's a balance between example and reference that make tutorial books valuable, this book and other \\"Foundation\\" or \\"Friends of Ed\\" books I've bought or looked at weigh in too heavy on the example side and the \\"how do I do this\\" part is mucked up in the mire of examples.If you have NO flash experience what so ever, then this might (might) be for you, but if you've decided to finally get to learning the details of flash and start getting something out of it, then perhaps the Flash MX Bible would be a better choice, that was my choice and I'm much happier with it. My choice for ActionScript is Macromedias' Advanced Flash MX Actionscripting. It's not really advanced, but it is very clear and gets to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Have brought this book but not through Amazon. One of the easiest to \\"digest\\" kind of book if you have been searching for one. Have finished half of the book in 3 days time and hopefully my personal webpage in my company's intranet will be up soon with the things i have learnt from it. If you are a beginner, get this book and you won't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash MX Foundation","review":"I'm a CS major whose desire to learn new tools is waning, so understand that I had apprehensions about picking up another tech book to sit on my shelf. Needless to say, after going through the entire book, I have found Foundation Flash MX to be...A great, easy-to-read book, with step-by-step examples providing solid foundation for real projects using tool, sans ActionScript.When reading through the book, I recommend skipping the ActionScript write up, in favor of going straight to Foundation ActionScript MX, which, incidentally, makes no assumtion that you've read Foundation Flash MX.My only minor gripe is the lack of integration between the two closely related books.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for Those New to ASP Programming","review":"This is the best introductory book I have seen on ASP programming. It introduces ASP technology, ASP objects, VBScript, and ADO. I recommend this book very highly, and I keep in next to my desk when I am programming. It is also a good reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"This book is writin very poorly for the beginner. Instead of showing you each step they kind of put everything together. Example they never really show how to edit a data entry by selecting it. Its always if this user has rights to edit it then they can. That is not what a beginner needs to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on target for any VB programmer to code ASP.","review":"This programming tutorial is very well written and utilizes appropriate case examples to drive home the lessons. I recommend it for anyone wishing to learn to write active server page applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first but errors abound!","review":"I loved this book till I started working on chapters 13, 14 and 15. I can only imagine the other reviewers haven't gotten that far, or are only using it as a reference. Before you buy, take a look at the Wrox support site for this book. First, the errata pages are huge in number (bad sign), and there are still unanswered questions on these three chapters. We users are helping each other as much as possible but we are not ASP gurus. Having bought four Wrox books on Visual Basic I am shocked the quality of editing in this one! I don't know if there is anything better out there or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is plagued with errors in the samples.","review":"This book offers good content and touches base on many topics, however many of the samples have errors and are inconsistant in their programming style. It is very frustrating when you copy something letter for letter and it doesn't work! Then you spend an hour looking over the code and find out that it's their fault!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money: buy the Professional edition.","review":"I don't see how anyone with even the slightest background in coding/markup could stomach their way through the first 12 chapters. With the rare exception of a few syntax/command tables here and there, you need only skim through the first 364 pages to get their full value.The most disappointing aspect of this book was Chapter 13: Databases with ASP. The chapter has a few examples, but does not go into any kind of depth with regards to the syntax, making the chapter basically useless for those interested in learning, and not simply cutting and pasting code.If you've haven't the first clue about programming theory, this book is for you. Otherwise, you would be far better served to spend the extra $5 bucks for the Professional Edition of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is your LaunchPad to ASP World","review":"Very few computer books are written so neatly. It takes you through the paces at a perfect speed. If you are interested in learning ASP this is your launchpad. There will be no turning back. In fact, I am planning to pick up the part 2 of this book i.e. Professional ASP 2.0 immediately after I finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good ASP books for beginners","review":"This book is a very good book for beginners. But I recommend reading \\"Active Server Pages for Dummies\\" first to get an idea of writing simple ASP file. Then, read this book to get a clearer and more systemetic understanding of ASP. Examples in the book are practical and helpful. There are some typos in the book and small errors in chapter 15, but you can figure it out easily by yourself. The next book about ASP I will read \\"professional ASP 2.0\\", which is more thorough but need some ASP knowledge and experience to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is One Great Book To Learn ASP","review":"I have 5 ASP books. This is the BEST to learn ASP!The pace is comfortable for a beginner or someone with programming basics. It starts you off gently but it takes you further than the Dummy book without jokes you might not appreciate.If you are a newbie to web programming, you might fumble a little. Mainly, you might have some problems getting PWS to work properly with Windows 98. You might also launch ASP pages like HTML pages (outside the PWS server) and get an error.You might get frustrated.The solution is you just have to read the beginning pages more carefully.But it works with Windows 98 for sure.However, a beginner might want to pick up a book on VBScript first to learn some programming basics. And, for all the books I have read to learn this exciting technology, this one is unbeatable.Get this book and you will be programming intelligent web pages soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for ASP beginners","review":"I read this book cover-to-cover and enjoyed every bit it. It is very well written and has lots of useful and working examples. Halfway thru the book I had written a number of complicated ASP programs. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn ASP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic guide to ASP","review":"You should consider buying this book if you are new to this field and want to develop a solid foundation in ASP development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Starters","review":"I could not find any ASP books out there that were as easy to follow. This book steps you through creating the code, running the code, and shows you line by line what the code does. I'm almost done with it and now I am ordering the professional version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very clear and helpful book on understanding ASP","review":"Every once in a while you find computer books that shine above the rest when teaching you something new. Though a little basic at first, this book and its authors are excellent instructors for learning ASP. A must read for those making the next step beyond HTML."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other ASP book can compare!","review":"This book is far more useful than the Professional ASP book. It is well written, packed with *useful* tips, and contains all the information you need to successfully implement a web/database solution. The chapters are actually focused and don't stray off into useless, unfocused dribble describing what will be explained, but then not really explaining it (see the other text for examples of this). I am sure this text will prove to be a valuable reference for many months."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great start for a novice","review":"I was given the job to integrate an Access DB into our corporate web site. With only basic knowledge of HTML, I bought the Professional ASP and found it to be a little over my head. This book is great for a beginner like me wishing to integrate a database with the web. I could only recommned adding a little more info on the syntax of adding SQL into an asp. I found it diffucult to get it to work sometimes. However, with a little effort, everything worked out and I still HIGHLY recommend this book over anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to extract information","review":"If you have ever programmed before, you will find this book difficult to use. The Authors feel they have to explain and give examples for everything. This may sound useful, but it simply takes too much work to extract the information your after. If you just want to know the syntax of an active server command, forget it. Rather than providing a concise description, time intensive examples are given."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book contains so many syntax error!","review":"This book is for beginner but it contains so many syntax errors. For example, the 2 line example on page 412 missed 2 parentheses and 1 bracket. It's not a huge error, but for beginner who knows nothing about ASP, would have hard time to figure out what's wrong with their page. Besides, the database section only cover access to MS Access database. Hello! the author forget about the powerful Oracle? ASP is part of the enterprise programming, their must be 50% people who use Oracle, why not even mention it in the book? This is the technical book that has the most syntax errors I've ever read and left out the more important issues than any other technical book. It does bring you through step by step, but it also give you false information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book..","review":"However I think that if you have good grounding in other technologies like VB, ADO, HTML and are pretty swithced on in general I think a better investment would be to buy the Professional Version of this book..Otherwise it is certainly wiser to buy this book first..RegardsJohn Hodgson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I picked up a copy of this book when I was on vacation in Alaska fishing the Kenai. First off, the author is an execellent outdoors writer and really makes you wish you were there. As far as fishing info, the book gives a great overview of the most productive techniques (which are used by practically every guide in the area) used to catch each type of salmon and trout in the area. It gives good information about all the local rivers, streams, and lakes,and most importantly timing information on salmon runs and most productive trout periods. The first section on Lake Fishing is a bit more geared toward local anglers with access to a canoe, but I would definately recommend this book for anyone planning a fishing trip to the Kenai Peninsula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"Book came in only 2 days.

Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodgepodge put together by too many authors","review":"Wrox was slammed by the user groups for these books with ten authors. They've gotten smarter: now they only put one photograph on the cover. But that misses the point; the book is still more a collection of essays by different writers than a book.There are parts of this book that are fairly good, but overall it does not cover the material coherently, and it is 25-50% bigger than it should be for the material covered.There are better choices elsewhere. I just posted a review for the O'Reilly book, which I think is a much better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Over the Place","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewers who say this book is not up to Wrox standards. This book is \\"all over the place\\", meaning there's little cohesion between chapters. This is probably because of all of the authors involved. It makes reading it very confusing.Here's a specific example. When discussing struct's vs. classes, the book starts talking about how memory allocation is different for each, and they referred to an earlier discussion of memory. I didn't recall them discussing memory earlier in the book, so I looked it up in the index. They had given it a sentence or two - obviously written by another author, and not intended to provide the depth later assumed.Unfortunately, I have purchased 3 C# books, and they're all weak. This, though, is the weakest. I gave \\"C# Bible\\" 2 stars as well, but I actually think that's a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned: Wrox has been sold!","review":"This book does have good information if you are new to C# but do not expect to get the examples off the web as the book promises.

You get a broad tour; there's a gaping hole in some of the coverage, ESPECIALLY in the Visual C# area.C#/.NET has so many concepts to it, it'll take more than 1 book. So don't buy books that try to cover it all. Buy a C# beginners book, then buy the book that covers what specialty you need (ie, ASP.NET and C#, Visual C# Applications, etc. )In short: Good for an introduction; bad for any serious development. (not good as a reference either)"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst book on C#","review":"Of all the C# books I own (I own 5), this is by far the worst. Can you learn from this book?

This book contains so many mistakes! Also, because of the amount of overlap between authors, you're really only getting a book of about 200 pages (the rest of the pages are filler and overlap).I can't believe some people give this book 5 stars.

For someone with a VB background, tad bit of Java & C++ from years ago, and a seasoned web, COM, and SQL programmer, I found this to be THE book to get up to speed and use as a reference for my C# learning curve and development. I did buy the Beginning book to answer some OO C# specific questions (delegates for one) and it's very helpful.

I was hooked by Robert Vieira's Professional SQL Server Programming. This book is not up to that standard. While the former was lively, engaging, and made me feel like I had a live mentor walking me through the material, this book is more dull, pedantic, and tedious. Most annoying, though, are the code examples. The authors start out with clear examples that the reader can duplicate or load from the code samples. Then, by chapter 8, the examples and the context are increasingly flawed. I find the text flowing into an example, but I'm not sure whether it's a new project I should create, or just a snippet that I shouldn't bother trying, or what. And the code samples are a mess. They don't align with the chapters, and often they don't work.The book covers all important C# development topics, but I'm disappointed with the execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"\\"Tango music is lush, passionate and rich in its textures\\" - a previous reviewer wrote.If you're looking for \\"fully orchestrated arrangements\\" - this cd is not for you.

On a whim, I thought I'd check it out.Tango music is lush, passionate and rich in its textures. This cd consists of piano, accordian and violin. It doesnt have the passion of Astor Piazzola (sp?) or other fully orchestrated arrangements. I would reccommend seeing Forever Tango when it comes to your town and picking up a copy of the soundtrack.Don't get me wrong, the music is fine.

The players are outstanding, specially those of piano and violin. The accordion sound is truly remarkable but lacking the - for an argentine listener - indispensable sound of a bandoneón, the classic tango instrument introduced a century ago in the port city of Buenos Aires by german sailors.Nevertheless \\"THE TANGO PROJECT\\" occupies a proud place in my,almost entirely of argentine origin, collection of tango records."},{"rating":"2","title":"A passionate and original recording","review":"This is also the problem.

It ran in a DOS prompt, but I could never get my game to save. Worse yet, I tried running it on a newer 400 Mhz machine and the game ran too fast. It was as if the entire game was running in double fast forward. The game has little value if you can't run it.The game itself is fun. ThemePark is the predecessor of Sim Themepark (aka Themepark World), which in turn is the predecessor of Sim Coaster. The graphics are pretty much the same, except you can't walk around your park like you can in the other two. You can still ride all your rides, but the number and theme of the rides is far more limited than in Sim Themepark and Sim Coaster.Overall, if you want to run a themepark, buy Sim Themepark (Sim Coaster isn't much different, and Sim Themepark is cheaper) or Rollercoaster Tycoon.

This author does a good job summarizing the important aspects of this history. Along the way, he brings some interesting stories into the overall historical summation. I like his writing style as it can be understood by a teenager or an adult. The overall message in this book was how the Southwest was first lost by the Spaniards, then the Mexicans, and won by the United States. The Southwest is defined as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and California.As mentioned, Marrin always brings interesting stories into his narration. You find out the origin of Texas, how Ps and Qs became a phrase, Taylor's reaction to a self important Lietenant, and others. These stories liven up the historical summation.

Not only is the product not effective and very complicated to use, but it is NOT what is advertised, it is a completetely different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not exactly what they advertises","review":"We have order the upaa one earlier and did not have any luck on it since it broke as we use it for the first time. So we decide to try it again on a different one. This time we order the product came in didn't look exactly like the picture and it didn't do us justice either. However it is very roomy you can fit others thing in it. The handle is very steady. The bottom seam is not very strong. Again as we use it for the very firt time the bottom part came off and we only put the car seat inside. I think it is very nice and very convenince if they can just make it a little stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Bag","review":"This is the best car seat travel bag for the money on the market!! We looked for months to find a durable and affordable option, and this bag is both. It is made of a thick canvas material that you don't have to worry about ripping during transit. It also zips open from the bottom which makes it really easy to get your seat in and out. There is plenty of room in the bag to add any extra coats, toys, or blankets that you might need. If you are looking for a bag that is well made and easy to use, this is the one. We loved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE smell","review":"I opened the box and I almost vomited from the HORRIBLE smell (and I'm not even pregnant). I left this bag outside for over a week partly because I couldn't stomach the thought of touching it to repackage and return it to Amazon but also hoping the smell would go away. It hasn't. I would never put my baby's car seat in this stink bomb! Do not order this bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag for Travel!","review":"I was pleased to see how LARGE this bag truly was. Within 1 week, we put this bag on 4 flights and we didn't have any problems. We fit two car seats in it (one being a booster) and it was perfect for what we bought it for! It's definitely not square when you use it, so don't expect to hold it in that perfect shape -- however it worked for us because I threw in packages of diapers/pull ups/sheets, etc. that didn't fit in my regular suitcase!Ideal purchase! Durable for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel bag","review":"We fly internationally a lot and have used this bag since I bought it in 2008. I've used it for my daughter's Britax Decathlon and my son's Graco My Ride 65. I've both checked it and gate checked it. It's held up really well for the price. There are a few small holes in it, but nothing that major.I gave it 4 stars because, like I said, it does have some holes in it. It's also really awkward to carry around an airport (that's not the bag's fault... it works like it's supposed to). I also wish there was some sort of padding to protect the seats a little better. I usually wrap them in blankets though.I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carseat protection for the price!","review":"This was a great bag that we used for our most recent trips. The bag fits bigger carseats ( we have the Britax Marathon ) and you can even squeeze more stuff in it if your suitcase is over the weight limit as ours was! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a tiny bit awkward for carrying and would be better with wheels. However, I think it's the best buy for the money and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped During Its First Use - Before the Flight","review":"While the bag was spacious enough (and then some) to fit our Evenflo Big Kid DLX, disassembled, a seam tore when I was removing the bag from the trunk at the airport... before the flight. Given the known fact that baggage handlers are rough with luggage, my handling of the bag was 'with kid gloves' in comparison. Thankfully, I had a large safety pin in my luggage; however, this item was a disappointment and is not recommended. They should reinforce the seams better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"We purchased this based on the positive reviews; however, we were surprised when we ended up with a hole after it's third flight. I don't know how much traveling people are doing with this, but after less than a year and 7 flights, I don't think we'll be able to use it again. It's ripping on a seam and the fabric is sporting several little holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag Ripped!","review":"We received this as a baby shower gift and thankfully did not spend any money on it (the first time). The bag ripped while at the airport during our trip home. Thankfully the rip was not yet that bad. We were able to wrap the shoulder strap around it to hold it together. After we picked it up in baggage claim the rip had become much worse. We purchased another one to replaced the ripped bag and noticed other reviews' feedback warning that the material rips easily, but we needed something to fit the Radian 80 carseat. We haven't yet taken the newer bag through the airport check in yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but bag ripped on first use at the airport.","review":"I chose this because we travel at least once a year to Grammy's.

Stay AWAY!!!!!!","review":"This is garbage. Everlast is filthy, vile, anti-everything good, and of no worth to the human mind other than to dilute, discourage, cloud, and otherwise weed out any remaing positive feelings and thoughts one may have. How's that for freedom of speech? It's the truth! Not worth the disk it was recorded on. Be careful of what occupies your thoughts.... music is very influential. This influence cannot lead to anything good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened to Everlast?","review":"My title explains it all. This album sucks. Don't get me wrong, I know almost all of my reviews are about hiphop albums, preferably underground, so many may think I'm against to his new sounds because I'm a hip hop fan. Not true. When he came with Whit E Ford sings the blues, I loved it. He had a few non hip hop that were nice, including What it's like, which was a great song. That kind of diversity is nice, kind of like Mos Def and K-Os do on their albums. This one, it's like he's trying to throw away that great mc that made him a legend. There are very few hip hop tracks on here, if those are even called that, and he doesn't even play any rock. All attempts at playing the blues, which he did alright, but he's no BB King. After his first solo album, it kind of went downhill and this was no exception. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Everlast's music has always been different than most in his same genre of music.

Whatever the director (and scriptwriter) was thinking does not translate into rewarding viewing.The script had a number of (what could have been) interesting characters and ideas but too many to develop properly. With the exception of Derek Jacobi everyone else was just going through the motions. Perhaps they were as confused as I was.I was left feeling that it would have been better done as one of those British detective series full of whimsy and eccentric characters. The \`secret' could then have continued to be the macguffin without the need for complex historical flashback explanations.My advice: Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Riddle","review":"This movie was order incorrectly.

This movie was seriously terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Weill enough alone ...","review":"I don't know just what Lotte Lenya said on her deathbed, but I personally feel that other singers carry the torch for Kurt Weill as well or better than Teresa Stratas. Of all my Weill albums, this one gives me the least pleasure. The German is bad, the interpretations are shrill and forced. Some of the tracks are almost unlistenable. Was Teresa Stratas simply the first world class singer to rediscover this body of work? Was Lenya giving her a sympathy vote? I love Stratas' singing elsewhere, in the Boulez recording of Lulu (for example), but she is no good here.For a newcomer to Weill, I highly recommend Anna Sophie Von Otter (excellent in every way) or even Ute Lemper's entertaining album. For that matter, go back and pick up Lotte Lenya's remastered Threepenny Opera -- it doesn't get much better than that. This Weill album, however, is tellingly named: it deserves to be unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"UFO Classic's Live","review":"A must for real UFO fans.Disc's #1&2 recorded on 1-28-98 in Vienna Austria are of superb sound quality.

I was hoping for something along the lines of a discussion of designing an implementing enterprise applications.I think their data access mechanism is better than hard coding sql but I wouldn't use it in production.

I had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything I could hope for (with the exception of them having removed the song \\"Home in the Heartland\\" which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle). That night, I ordered not only Riverdance: Live from Geneva, but also Jean Butler's Irish Dance DVD (Which I would recommend). To make a long story short, don't waste your time with this version of the show. The main female singer is absolutely horrible (Definitely doesn't hold a candle to Katie MacMahon's original vocals), and the lead female dancer's too short hair drove me crazy.

I do like the \\"jelly\\" insert and the ability to use the earpiece without having to clip on the wire but the speaker is of such a poor quality that it ruins overall sound beyond anything else I have heard. Would definitely not recommend (unless you like a \\"muddy\\" sound)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst available","review":"I bought a Jabra for my Nokia 6160, and found it to be unusable.

Fans of King Crimson can get a piece of the beginings of the band, although their musical approach on this one is a bit different. Just like Pink Floyd in the Syd Barrett era, this is a less polished, more experimental work from a very \\"early version\\" of Crimson, still looking for their own place within the 60's crazy, creative and insane psychedelic music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheerfully recommended....","review":"A fascinating pre-cursor (by only about a year's time) to the greatest art-rock statement ever, \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\". Robert Fripp and Michael Giles present a sneak peek at the upcoming work with the ethereally beautiful \\"Erudite Eyes\\", which features a \\"Moonchild\\" style melody which transforms into a loose prog-rock-jazz jam at the end. The upcoming collaboration with lyricist Pete Sinfield is also previewed in \\"Under The Sky\\". And, yes, there are the \\"silly\\" numbers such as \\"The Elephant Song\\" and \\"Digging My Lawn\\"... but they are as endearingly \\"English\\" as the slice-of-British-life ditties perpetuated from the Kinks and Moody Blues in the 60's all the way through Martin Newell and XTC in the present day!

It was interesting how the book did point out that many British people could have cared less. I guess the book did not flatter Diana or the royal family for that matter. It was extremely dull.

It would've been great to see it at least try to reflect on some of the major philosophical works dealing with the human soul, existence and consciousness, but to me it remained an enclosed and somewhat boring thought experiment only - carefully built up toward the final Chekhov's gun solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Herbert's best","review":"I am in general a fan of Herbert's writing, and sought out and bought this book since it contained the story leading up to The Jesus Incident.Herbert tends to idealize his characters' observational abilities. In this book, however, he takes it a bit far in the sense that he lets the characters read from each others' body language and behaviour things that simply cannot be deduced from those contexts in such a way. A bit too far towards mind-reading, in my opinion; it continually broke off my identification with the characters and thus made the book appear very fragmented.Frank Herbert is none the less intriguing to read, so while this book would deserve a mere 1 on a Herbert 1-5 scale, it gets a 2 on a more general scale.If I was to finish this off as the review I would have liked to read before reading the book, I would say: \\"Drop reading this book, and go right on to The Jesus Incident. The Jesus Incident is fully independent of Destination Void.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I didn't \\"get\\" this book, but I sure didn't like it.","review":"I found the opening pages of this book absolutely captivating. I couldn't wait to see the devious tribulations Moonbase had in store for the Umbilicus Crew.Unfortunately, the setup was the end of the good times. What followed was, to me, a lot of incoherent babble; endless nonsense about computers and consciousness, and all of it couched in the most impenetrable kind of Herbert-ian drug-trip tone-poem prose.Frank Herbert was obviously a very talented and smart man. Smarter and more talented than I, to be sure. Maybe I am just dumb or merely disinterested in the subjects in question, but I was not at all entertained by the bulk of this story. I just couldn't wait for it to be over.\\"Hellstrom's Hive,\\" \\"Whipping Star,\\" \\"The Heaven-Makers\\"...even \\"The Green Brain\\" were better, in my opinion. I say: pass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Frank Herbert's best novels.","review":"This book is not typical Frank Herbert. There is no complex political interaction and the span of time covered in the book is relatively small. The book is set on a fascinating premise. Artificial consciousness experiments have proven to have disasterous consequences. When the threshold of consciousness is broached by a powerful machine, it develops the power of creation. However, it maintains the frailties of the creatures which built the machine. Notwithstanding other reviews, I found the book an interesting and quick read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destination: Avoid","review":"What a disappointment.This is a boring book about annoying people sent on an inscrutible mission to achieve an incomprehensible goal. It is a very difficult read, the plot and motivations of the characters are never adequately explained, and it is full of scientific and mathematical detail that may well be fascinating to scientists and mathematicians but serves only to muddle and confuse the story even further for the rest of us. There is no payoff at the end, which is as unexplained as the rest of the book.Reading this book is a complete waste of time. There is enough fascinating and wonderful science fiction out there about the nature of consciousness and computer intelligences in deep space (Vernor Vinge's \\"A Fire Upon the Deep,\\" for example) that skipping \\"Destination: Void\\" can hardly be considered a loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I picked this up because of the author's name, having read Dune, but was very unhappy with the science of the book. People can only exist in micro-gravity for 2 hours before they'll die? Huh?

And the computer science is so dated as to be unreadable, which is why I put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"This is not a story.

If you want to read antidotes about the Tigers history written in the style you'd expect in the 1910s, 1920s or even 1930s, you will enjoy this book. After all, Lieb wrote about baseball during that era, and, obviously, his writing style matches that.What I love about the book is that it's a pretty detailed history of baseball in Detroit from the late 1800s until ONLY 1945. It's 294 pages of history. Today, a book like this would include those seasons and about 60 more, meaning you couldn't get that detail. Also, this guy lived it (or at least was living at the time) instead of just researching those years.

In fact, some of the things that puzzled me when I was a child, such as the romance between Laura and Almanzo, took on an entirely new meaning.

Wilder glosses over the ill treatment of the orignial inhabitants of the land that made it possible for her family to settle in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, the Dakotas, etc. They waded to their new lives through the blood of the slaughtered along the trail of broken treaties. The author wasn't a stupid woman; she knew all this, yet she deliberately repressed it. Had she been honest enough to deal with it, I might recommend the books. As it is, they are racist trash and deserve to fall into oblivion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still My All Time Favorite","review":"I LOVE THIS SERIES! I remember collecting this series as a child! My oldest daughter (now 15) read these when she was younger, and now my youngest daughter (8 yr) is beginning to read them. My oldest daughter was a quick learner, reading very young and Extremely fast. My youngest daughter is slower, so I have begun to read these books along with her to increase her reading skills. I am becoming reintroduced to this wonderful series and have also begun to purchase the kick-off series by other authors. This series has also brought back my interest in the Author's life, and I have begun to purchase other books to learn more about her! I recommend this book to everyone, young and old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my books","review":"for the price I couldn't beat ordering these books!

I am so happy to share this gift with my daughter. It is a beautiful colorful box set. She loves to read and I know she will enjoy this special series. It shares special meaning as we live in the hometown of Almonzo Wilder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Printing","review":"I'm thrilled to have a complete set for my daughter, but was GREATLY disappointed by the quality of the printing. The set came with a flimsy cardboard box easily bent. The paper is cheap, and the printing on each page is off-center so that there is a tiny margin at the top and a large margin on the bottom. If I thought it would make a difference to exchange it, I would, but I suspect others would be just the same.This was a purchase I bought with the anticipation that my daughter would have it for a lifetime. Had I been able to inspect prior, I would have sought out a much higher quality printing and would absolutely have passed on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House On the Prairie series","review":"I did not see the books as they were sent directly to my 7 year old granddaughter.

Now at age 82 I am thoroughly enjoying the 9 books Laura wrote in 1932. These are obviously children books but adults will get to know a type of life we have never encountered or visualized. The courage and tenacity it must have taken to live in such conditions are not easily imagined in our time of instant everything, from meals to communication, from travel to health and medical miracles........ Read these booklets with the spirit of the child inside you and you will love them. They will bring you, for a short while, to a time in life you may have forgotten.Thanks to Amazon for making them available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"This book set is classic and well worth adding to any family library. I read them as a little girl and was inspired by the self-sufficiency and integrity of lives of the charaters.

As an adult, I plan to introduce my children to these stories to show them how life was many years ago, in a simpler time. I have always felt kind of envious of Laura's life - how she experienced and appreciated life to its fullest in a family of limited means. I hope my children get the same sense of the importance of family and nature and happiness, rather than material wealth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Half Pint is my Hero","review":"This book has always lifted my spirits. It's a great coffee table book and doubles as a coaster. My mother introduced me to the books while I was still in her womb. They grew on me.

My mother still plays with the paper dolls that she bought...I actually saw her playing with my 17 year old brother last weekend! Just goes to show that Little House laughter and fun never dies. Sometimes I wish things were as simple as they were in the \\"Golden Olden Days.\\" Good old fashioned hard work was the key and you weren't scared of it. Now we've got hooligans running around raising Hades and there's no consequence. Make them read Little House on the Prairie, that's what I say. Then they'll see what living is really all about.

This is my absolute favorite series about American history. Laura Ingalls Wilder is a superb writer, and she tells her story in a pleasant, honest, and detailed style. I am not going to go on and on about what is in every book, as that has already been done. Just pick up the first book and see for yourself.

The seller listed the condition as \\"good\\", which is the condition I generally prefer if not \\"like new\\". In \\"good\\" condition I generally expect the outside with little if any wear and the pages with minimal writing or highlighting (I don't think I'm asking for too much). The seller didn't offer any other comments other than \\"good\\" condition and they had good reviews so I didn't think I would be dissatisfied. There is extensive writing between the text lines, not as much highlighting and the corners are worn down. I wont forget to mention the spine is also in poor condition and taped. I can't return it because I honestly need it but if these things would have been mentioned I would not have spent the $44.00 at the most it's in faire condition and more appropriate to sell between $20.00-$30.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient","review":"I was impressed in which the speed of my book arrived.

Some of the storylines do continue through multiple books, making it worthwhile to read them all in order. We get a bit more fleshing out of Known Space and the kzin in general, and although different authors contribute, the whole thing is generally cohesive. Nothing in here will be a permanent classic (like Ringworld), but they aren't supposed to be. Other sci-fi writers are just taking a light foray into Niven's universe. Bring the series to the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm.... Very Avoidable.....","review":"This one is 1.5 stars....If you have another choice, use it. This book is not really that good. It can be read, but it's really not a lot of fun. I'm kicking myself for even buying it. Especially after I read the first one and didn't like it at all....Larry Niven is a very good author. Jerry Pournelle is also very good. I am not sure what happened in this book.Again, if you have other choices, they are probably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"The first story, a sequel to Cathouse is very good--with plausible action and an interesting theory of why the Neanderthals became extinct.The second story is auful with plot holes non-sensical dialogue and is a fourth-rate rip-off of Casablanca--right down to the pitiful woman who is willing to sleep her way so that her husband and she can get to a better life. Absolutely terrible!Worth it for the first story--don't waste your time with the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered !","review":"I received a garden program recorded off a tv program, not Daniel O'Donnell.

He is able to restrain his impulsive wit and to play this with elegance and dignity. His is not a heavy-weight, craggy reading like Richter's -- probably still my favorite with this sonata -- but one that does not become trivial even as it flows smoothly. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe","review":"This is a high quality product. The shoes are quite comfortable and can take the beating of a big city sidewalks.

Just buy this. You are a Thin Lizzy fan and this is why. The last LP with Eric Bell and it should be had by you. He is a master and why he left is a mystery to me. Check out the solo on \\"The Hero And The Madman\\". You'll be hooked. Phil Lynott is not only a great singer and composer but a very good bass player as well. Very evident on this. Brian Downey is always right on. They are an awesome trio to say the least. \\"Slow Blues\\" and \\"The Rocker\\" are among the best of any Thin Lizzy tracks anywhere. \\"Little Girl In Bloom\\" , \\"Gonna Creep Up On You\\", it just goes on and on. There is only one track I skip. You'll be able to tell which one. Although I love the 4th album \\"Night Life\\" I think it took awhile for the band to gain the momentum lost after this one. I don't think even \\"Fighting\\" was quite as good. It's right up there with \\"Jailbreak\\" if you ask me. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thin lizzy rocks again","review":"Pretty much the ultimate example of Thin Lizzy's genius is THIS album, because it covers so much variety and talent from the band.You have the bluesy, funky rock of \\"Mama Nature Said\\", the cool funky beats and SMOKIN' guitar playin' of \\"The Hero and the Madman\\", and even more funkiness and blues with \\"Slow Blues\\". However, those are NOT your typical blues and funky kind of songs- these are creative in a way that make them distinct to Thin Lizzy's style. NOT ordinary songs!\\"The Rocker\\" has some magnificent guitar playing at the end, \\"Gonna Creep Up on You\\" reminds me of an energetic pop band such as Sweet or Slade, and \\"A Song for While I'm Away\\" just has a very pretty melody.Let's buy this great album, though personally, the first two Thin Lizzy albums are my favorite. I recommend the debut album first because there's something REALLY special about that one! Must be the diversity and creativity. However, this is one fantastic album too."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS ALL MIDI","review":"I own the English version of the game and absolutely love the music. However, they redid the music for the English version. THIS VERSION IS ALL MIDI. You will be very disappointed like I am if you expect the orchestral versions from the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Symphonic Suite But Potentially Worthwhile","review":"Like other fans and reviewers of this item, many are looking for the full orchestral version of the soundtrack composed by Koichi Sugiyama and the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra and were quite disappointed when they realized this is all midis.This is INDEED the soundtrack, however, the item descriptions all across the board are misleading so to get this out of the way YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE SYMPHONIC SUITE. Amazon does sell it for a pretty penny but it is WORTH IT!!That aside, the soundtrack is slightly reminiscent of older Dragon Quest games from the NES installments. THAT was it's original purpose but due to poor marketing unsuspecting buyers got something else. Nonetheless, this item is still worthy of hardcore gamer collections if you really want to fork over the coin. Otherwise, look up \\"Dragon Quest VIII Symphonic Suite\\" on Amazon as they are awesome enough to sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the James Franco Biopic","review":"I purchased this from another site thinking I was paying for a set that contained the 2001 James Dean biopic starring James Franco. Every site you find this set on says that that movie is on this disc set. Well, it's not. So, if you are thinking of buying this because you want the James Franco version, don't. You will be disappointed. Someone seriously screwed up on the description of this set. With that said, however, this is a great set for any Dean fan, with interviews of the people who knew him best and never-before-seen footage of him. I was really looking forward to watching the Franco movie, so I was disappointed with this set for that reason only. I would give it 5 stars if the description matched the set itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT for 1+ year olds","review":"This toy is perfect for my 1 year old great grandson....he loves it and plays with it daily....It is great for developing his grasping and pushing the beads is fun for him...There is one of these in the pediatricians office and he plays with that one all the time...That is where I got the idea to get him o ne for home too!

Just the fact that it is so colorful makes it attractive for little ones, but my favorite thing about it is that it's not too heavy for them to pick up and move a bit, but it's too heavy for them to wing at other kids in the house if they're having a tantrum. Also the wires that the beads run along are incredibly strong and I've seen the older kids in the house leaning on them and they never lose their shape or break. A VERY sturdy and educational product for little ones. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"Bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas. He enjoys playing with it and has actually rediscovered it as of late. Good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"hits and a whole lot of misses","review":"Peter Gabriel tries to be arty but his poor composition skills and squeal vocals get the best of him. Thus, most of his material suffers from lack of good composers- he is really missing the talents of Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford. He also tries to be too funky and \\"womad\\" infusing as many different sounds as possible but not really amounting to anything of substance. Almost a one star rating but the wonderful Solisbury Hill and Games Without Frontiers save this dreadful compilation. It's is a shame that he did not continue along the lines of those two wonderful early tunes. Nice to have Sean Connery as a special guest- or is that Gabriel??? Go back to Genesis 007 !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super CD","review":"An amazing compilation of Peter Gabriel's best recordings ever! I was shaking with anticipation for this CD and I was not let down. 2 CD set, one called \\"Hit\\" one called \\"Miss\\" portraying what I feel is PG's classification of songs he feels were righfully successful and songs he felt should've been, but were never given a chance. Peter Gabriel was one who always walked the fine line between commercial and indie music and his fans were always the beneficiaries. I have worn out these CD's and made copies for both my cars. I absolutely LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great 3cd set, oh wait no...its not","review":"Definitley need a re-issue, with all the songs on it now, & the ones added on the german release, as well as 'Out, Out' from Gremlins & When Your Falling from the Afro Celt collaberation. Theres too many (essential) things missing for this to be a 'definitive collection'. B-sides (soft dog...) would be nice, more live versions-this is box set territory, but that at least, is definitive. Casual listners start here, die-hards buy it. Those in between-write angry letters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's \\"In Your Eyes\\" ??????","review":"Being a Gabriel's fan for a long time, I agree that much of his early work is forgotten in this compilation. But Peter Gabriels's greatest song, a remarkable moment in his career, that highlighted an important scene of a great moive, Cameron Crowe's \\"Say Anything\\", the amazing \\"In You Eyes\\" is, again \\"left behind\\" in this collection. In his first compilation, \\"Shaking the Tree\\". the song was completely forgotten. Now they do it again. If you listen to any live Gabriel CD or watch any of his marvelous 2 DVD shows, \\"In Your Eyes\\" is the last song played, the climax for the presentation. There's absolutely no excuse and I consider an offense to a fan who wants a remastered compilation or to someone who wants to know Peter's work better the absence of this song in the compilation and take 3 stars of my revie just for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please - No More Radio Edits","review":"I was thinking about picking this one up - until I read it is another record company rip-off.Like Forty Licks, the label issues radio edit versions of some songs.I would rather see these companies include one or two less songs on these compilations, so fans can get the full length tracks.Here is a great artist who doesn't need edited versions on packages like this one.Watch the record companies wait 2 or 3 years and then come out with 'New & Improved' Greatest Hits collections with unedited songs from your favorite artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine set yet missing some songs","review":"This is a good place for any Peter Gabriel fan to start with if your looking for one set to complete your collection. A few of my favorite songs of his were not included here. A few reviewers also said the same thing. Think anytime now a 4 disc best of set should come out. Otherwise this is not a bad piece of music for the average fan.Peter J. Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisying but not Comprehensive","review":"The 2 CD Greatest Hits is well worth the money. I've greatly enjoyed it, even though it's very, very different from what I'd thought Peter Gabriel's music would be like. Yes, there are the radio hits of \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Shock the Monkey\\", and \\"In Your Eyes\\" that I bought the collection for originally. But the rest of the more than 2 hours of music is much slower, ambient, and eclectic music. It has proven to be a very good introduction to the vast range of Gabriel's non-radio work. However, as I've gotten into more of his non-radio work, I've come to realize this HIT collection doesn't do it justice. This collection does have a handful of new, rare, or remixed tracks that still make it valuable to avid fans that have his past work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD","review":"This came in new condition and I have enjoyed all of the music on the 2 CD's.

Simple math says - better buy to get HIT. weird.Couldnt be a bigger fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection; why are there different versions?","review":"I enjoyed this collection of Peter Gabriel tunes; especially having the opportunity of gettting some songs and mixes not available on previous album releases.It should be noted that there are 2 versions of this release; 1 in the US and 1 in the UK. Disc 1 is the same for both but disc 2 varies in content. On the UK disc they ADDED \\"D.I.Y.\\" from the 2nd album, \\"No Self Control\\" from the 3rd album, \\"I Have The Touch\\" from Security, \\"Different Drum\\" from the Passion soundtrack, and \\"Washing of the Water\\" from \\"US\\" and it is MISSING \\"I Don't Remember\\", \\"Love To Be Loved\\", \\"Family Snapshot\\" (one of my favorites) and \\"In Your Eyes\\" (What the??)The UK disc can be found at PeterGabriel.comWhy the 2 different versions on the 2nd disc? I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there, but not quite","review":"Peter Gabriel is one of my all-time favorite artists and it's usually his slower songs such as \\"Don't Give Up\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" which I listen most often to. I think some of Peter's slower material are arguably the most powerful \\"ballads\\" ever written. While I very much agree with most of the songs included in the 2-disc set, it's disappointing that two of my favorites aren't, namely \\"Washing of the Water\\" (from \\"Us\\") and the hauntingly beautiful \\"Mercy Street\\" (from \\"So\\"). \\"Mercy Street\\" does appear in \\"Sixteen Golden Greats\\" and the \\"Growing Up Tour\\" DVD, but I think for the person listening to Peter Gabriel for the first time, \\"Mercy Street\\" at least, is a must-have.

While a few chapters and topics are treated well enough most of the content is jumbled and confused and one wonders if the authors in some places actually understand their topics. There are too many good books such as the ORielly books or the Sams book on Web Services to even bother with this book. Skip it and spend your more money on another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed examples, and inaccuracy","review":"This is the first of what promises to be a slew of new books coming out on Web Services. As the first book out I guess it's what you'd expect from a book rushed to press. The examples are frequently flawed. If you're already familiar with most of the technology, or you're willing to read the documentation of the WSTK and various Apache documents along with this book you'll find this book a good primer. However, if you're new don't go for this book. The examples tend to be a mixed jumble flowing from COM, Java, NET and even Perl occasionally with in the same example. If you're planning on using all those technologies (and have them all set up) you might be ok. However, if you just want to build a Java webservice, well this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall Web services intro book","review":"I am totally new to Web services, and know not a lot about XML.

Shame on the DVD producers... That's strange because they had made a really good job with the transfer of the second DVD: Lone Wolf and Cub 2: Baby Cart at the River Styx , which I highly recommend, both in technical and artistic terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can buy his sword but never his honor.","review":"Ogami Itto, the official executioner to the Shogun, is falsely accused of treason and ordered to commit ritual suicide. Yet, this man who holds the harsh code of Bushido above all else, refuses and goes on a quest, a journey, to get revenge. Not only for his lost honor and position but for the murder of his wife.But he is not alone, for his tiny son must take the same path of honor and death. A ronin and his son. Lone Wolf And Cub. Both are for hire.The movie is faithful to the manga because the manga was designed to be easily transfered to the big screen. Actors and actresses were perfect for their parts. Lots of violence, nudity and sex scenes - what more can you want? Runs about 83 minutes and the plot moves well, so you never feel bored or feel like there is dead space. A must for any Samurai library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little things make a difference","review":"People who have read the other reviews already know if this film is for them or not! But I want to give kudos to AnimEigo for a great job on the little things that would be missed by non-Japanese speakers. First - the use of different colors in the subtitles during conversations made it really easy to understand who is saying what! Second - the translation of many of the signs (i.e. the baby carriage banner) helped make sense of what was going on. And last, but not least, the additional translations of martial arts styles (Seagull, etc) and other Japanesecentric terms was nice, even though I knew much of them (i.e. sepuku). None of these makes or breaks the film but having them on the DVD makes the watching that much better! Having seen how good the first DVD was done I have already ordered and preordered the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaden Soldiers","review":"A shortened version of this film, released many years ago, was apparently condemned as a video nasty.

I thought it was great, but to actually find the original Japanese series has been fantastic.If you like martial arts movies with weaponry and great stories and characters this is a must to have. The original Japanese version is far superior to the Shogun Assasin release. I have purchased every one in the series and have yet to be dissappointed in them.Itto Ogami is great with the sword and if your a martial arts movie fan this is for you.Daigoro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracy Anderson is a bore","review":"I guess the exercises Tracy Anderson does in this video are OK, but she looks about as interested in her at-home audience as a topless dancer looks when giving a lap dance to an 80 year old....TA looks like she couldn't care less.The video is BORING! But if you can get past that, I guess it's OK. I will not be ordering any more of her videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't like it","review":"I love the first couple Nickel Creek records, but songs like \\"Helena\\" where Thile brags guys like him never will be alone and other bits of dark, moody lyrics combine with ego just ruin this record. I am not overly found of Thile's odd chords and changes, but with different lyrics they could have at least not been so annoying. I've had this record for a few years and my love for the first two keep me trying it, but I have officially given up. I just can't like it. However Sara's \\"Anthony\\" is a keeper.Want some more music as good Nickel Creek's first two albums? Check out Sean and Sara's solo records. Thile's latest work with the Punch Brothers is even worse than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a second listen","review":"The first listen of Nickel Creek's latest was disappointing. While I enjoyed their second album, it didn't hold the warmth of their debut. \\"Why Should the Fire Die\\" leans away from traditional bluegrass and into a field that is without name. However, a second listen proved me happily wrong. Though the album is still quite progressive and lacks the intimacy that the group has shown they are capable of, there is no denying Nickel Creek's musical talents. The instrumental tracks are particularly outstanding this time around. Though I miss the simple beauty of their original debut, I'll be happy to follow Nickel Creek's journey to new territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all.","review":"I love the Self Titled cd, so I ordered \\"This Side\\" and \\"Why Should the Fire Die\\". This last album is not at all like their others. The main dissapointment was the lyrics. Or lack thereof. I love the poetry of messages of their other songs. This album's songs seem to touch a lot on love, cheating, leaving etc. What happened to the morally upright, good messages they have portrayed in the past?I am going to be selling this cd, can't see myself listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickel Creek is NOT bluegrass!!","review":"Nickel Creek are an acoustic band, not bluegrass. While they do have plenty of bluegrass elements in their music, this is not the genre that they belong to. For those who buy this expecting to hear 'Bela Fleck' or 'Alison Kraus and Union Station', you may be left scratching your head.This album is darn near perfect. I would actually give it a strong 4.5 stars. It's better than \\"This Side\\", and possibly even better than the debut album, although both of those records are brilliant as well. Nickel Creek are always finding new ways to play their instruments to produce tracks that are built upon the familiar NC sound, yet give it a new twist to make it sound unique. Sarah's voice is angelic; I wish she sang more. Overall just a superb effort, and one that will stay in rotation for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is cool stuff !!!","review":"Bored with all the lame rock stuff out there? I saw some television special on this band and they are very interesting. They are talented and play a form of music that nobody else their age does.All of the veteran bluegrass artists really respect them. The mandolin player is treating his instrument like Hendrix did with the guitar. Each member injects their own personality and instrumental proweness into the songs.I LIKE THIS!Best song is \\"Helena\\". It has a nice crescendo and develops into a powerful and emotional song.Keep your eyes open for this band b/c they will be around for a long time.Rock and rollers, try bluegrass...its cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good moments in between snoozes","review":"I think there are fine elements at times on this one, but too much drags. And yes, I'd like more Sarah vocals-- guess we'll have to await her upcoming one. I don't mindsoft textures really, but I think they're treading water, spinning their wheels-- whatever metaphor works to describe it. If they want to explore that, should be listening more to The Tin Hat Trio or Jenny Scheinman, who really explorethose avenues. Too soft pop for no purpose for me this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let The Fire Die","review":"I'm disappointed with Nickel Creek. When I first heard their self titled CD, I had appointed them my official Bluegrass group. You see, I really don't listen to country or bluegrass and I was happy to have this talented group lead me down this road. But I discovered, after buying their second CD, \\"This Side\\", that they were leading me down the wrong road. I kept faith that they would, by their next CD, get back on path, but I see now that they are on an entirely different path and I cannot follow. I'm hurt. I would give this CD less than a star, but I'm not able."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this zero stars, I would.","review":"Ok, Ok, Ok....I get it....the impetus for Chris Thile, and now apparently the Watkins duo is to push the envelope....WAAAAYYYYYY out until it tears.Here's how I mark good songwriting, and good recording: Do I hear the melodies after the cd is stopped playing? Do they stick in my head? Do I remember ANY of it?In this case, maybe one song, the cover of the dylan song. The rest completely and utterly suck. At some point being wierd ceases to sell. What you have here is people buying into wierd, unevenly written, poorly produced music because they think it's intellectual. It's not. It's just so much paint splattered on an audio wall.Chris, hang up the mando and go join \\"Beck's\\" band. You carry the same appeal. You both suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, soooo bad.....","review":"I guess you have to be a poor, uneducated, American caucasian male to like this one. Wow, Americans have such horrible taste. I can imagine a bunch of lame highschool kids listening to this one while on their way to their prom wearing ill-fitting rented tuxedos with dates sporting wrist corsages and hairsprayed bangs. Why would anyone buy this load? I'm bummed that I listened to the sample provided on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review From a Non-Country Fan","review":"I felt compelled to go out and buy this CD after seeing them on the Tonight Show just the other day, and also for being somewhat familiar with the trio for their splendid little lighthouse song. (What was the name of it?) \\"Eclectic\\" is one word you may never hear when describing bluegrass or folk collections, but this group somehow manages to give us just that. The CD is truly a great listen from beginning to end. Nickel Creek has what it takes to grow into a major supergroup if they can continue to hook crossover fans like myself. Album of the year, no question about it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting used to","review":"I eagerly awaited their new CD, and when I first heard it - I was disappointed. It was nothing like their other two. But I have to admit - this CD grows on me more and more. The lyrics are incredible and the trio demonstrates growth and depth with this new work. Helena is my favorite. The darkness and haunting scenario seems all too real. If nothing, Nickle Creek shows their versatility with this CD. I am glad I gave this CD a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best, But Close","review":"I had lost track with Blue Grass for a while. Ran into a friend and he got to talking about this CD. So I had to pick it up. It is a good sound, not the greatest of their efforts -- but it still has a nice sound. Worth the money and a great entry to Nickel Creek to those that don't listen to them yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Genre are they?","review":"I think the technical aspects of the production are tremendous. However I personally did not enjoy listening to the cuts - they left me feeling \\"blue\\" except for a couple of cuts.Mind you, as a bluegrass fan maybe I was expecting more conformance - on the other hand I like many other genre's. I do not like eclectic, new age stuff. So this may be just taste and preference. I do know however that they are skillful and I commend them for artistic expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Any Spark!","review":"Where has our beloved Nickel Creek gone? In their first two albums, Nickel Creek's music was pure exuberance. I loved their modernized bluegrass sound that was totally their own. Why now are they trying to sound like someone else? I think it's great to experiment with your sound and try to improve it, but there are already too many lazy acoustic pop bands. A better way to experiment is like with their track, \\"Should've Known Better\\"--one of my favorite songs. Bring back the inspiration! Fans that have loved Nickel Creek from the beginning will be sorely disappointed with this album which is ironically named, \\"Why should the fire die?!\\" My advice to Nickel Creek. . Stop trying to be Coldplay or even The Beatles and go back to the unique, joyful sound I fell in love with! Hey Alison, who's next?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed","review":"I had the albums \\"Nickelcreek and \\"This Side\\" on an mp3 disc that I recently listened to, and it reminded me how much I like this group. I wanted more. So I ordered \\"Why Should The Fire Die\\". VERY disappointing. It's not at all pleasant to my ears. It brings to mind the worst of the real weird stuff the Beatles occasionally came up with. If Alison Krause's involvement made that much difference, then they need Alison back! I can only hope that this album is a total flop for Nickelcreek so they'll go back to making that fantastic music they're known for. After this album, who knows, maybe the fire will indeed die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Alison back!...","review":"Alison Krauss got me hooked on the new style of bluegrass. A little slower on many tunes...a bit jazzier on some, with great vocals and harmony. When I heard she was producing Nickle Creek, I knew I would give them a listen. I loved the first Nickle Creek CD, especially the \\"Lighthouse's Tale,\\" \\"Out of the Woods,\\" and \\"When you come back down.\\" I bought their second, \\"This Side,\\" without even hearing it, and was disapointed. I listen to the 30 second samples of the third, and thought that they had changed back toward their original direction. I was wrong. When I found \\"Why Should the Fire Die?\\" at a store used, I should've taken that as a hint. Maybe Nickle Creek is like a bluegrass version of Led Zeppelin, staying a fews years ahead of their fans. I wish Sara Watkins would do a solo project, perhaps with a few of the Union Station band to back her up.If you want to hear a group that follows the path that Nickle Creek should have stayed on---try \\"The Greencards.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The good old Nickel Creek is Back","review":"Why Should the Fire Die? is Nickel Creek's 3rd release, and brings back the good music of their self-titled release. Their second release, This Side, had too much singing, and fluffy words. Why Should the Fire Die? incorporates more instrumentals, and more thoughtful lyrics. I am enjoying this CD a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Fire Burns Brighter","review":"Nickel Creek sounds better with every offering. While straying farther from their bluegrass roots (without leaving them totally behind) the band continues to find their own sound. Excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickel Creek: Never Just a Chip Off the Old Block","review":"Once again, Chris Thile, Sara Watkins, and Sean Watkins of the contemporary bluegrass band Nickel Creek have come together to create a flawless and pleasantly surprising compilation of songs ranging from traditional bluegrass instrumentals(Stumptown, Scotch and Chocolate) to broken-hearted love ballads inspired by the early divorce of Thile midway during the recording process(Can't Complain, Anthony, Eveline), hard rock tunes (Best of Luck, Helena) and stereotype-defying gospel (Doubting Thomas). Why Should the Fire Die is the third installment of Nickel Creek's ubiquitous and ever-evolving style of music that never ceases to entertain. In this loyal fan's opinion, Why Should the Fire Die may be the most musically and emotionally mature album yet, and I can only hope for more yet to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"There's not much you can really say about this film. An interesting cast (which includes Euro babe Julie Delpy, Georgina Cates, and Pamela Gidely as a trio of hookers) cannot save this B-\\"drama\\" from low-grade, throw-away trash. \\"The Treat\\" feels like it's definitely lacking something. It's about prostitutes, and the actresses are all wildly attractive: but it's not sexy. It's rather light-hearted in its treatment of hookers: but it comes off as more hokey than fun. Made in 1998, the film is now [for unknown, unexplainable reasons] being released on DVD and VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 cute chics and some cheesey one-liners","review":"Focuses on the lives of 3 hookers in some underground brothel.The plot of this movie is non existant. It's almost like a slice-of-life type film. There are three hookers trying to satisfy every fantasy; the lesbian business woman, one french junkie and a little religious girl. Basically all they do is roleplay with male customers trying to fulfill all their needs.So, if you're looking for a good story line or suspense or drama.......go elsewhere.However, if you're looking for a very light comedy with three hot chics and some cheesey one-liners, look no further. I really enjoyed this film despite everything. It was kind of cutesy, kind of demented and kind of silly. The only downside is no nudity. Eh, oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Whoever made this video blew good money on a horrible plot and second & third string actors. I bought it as a gift, i was embarrassed because it was so bad.Riverdance would have been a better selection..Oh well. My husband normally loves Yancy butler, but in this movie, she's portrayed disrespectfully in ill taste, and must have needed money to buy her weekly bottle of booze...Don't waste your money!Any other video would be a better purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Great Reference","review":"I read this book cover to cover five years ago and have been using it ever since as a reference book. It's a great read if you like an urbane, erudite \\"Oxford (or is it Cambridge?) don\\" style, and Roberts is careful about stating grand theories as though they were incontrovertible fact. All in all, a wonderful comprehensive world history. I'm buying a second copy for my 19 year old nephew who is studying history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but quite a challenge","review":"I found this book quite interesting. It covered everything from the dawn of civilization to the fall of communism, and gave an excellent analysis.I also found this book quite a challenge. I don't consider myself to be of inferior intelligence, and am a graduate of a highly ranked university, but on many occasions I found myself using a dictionary in order to understand some of the vocabulary in the book.This book is not for the faint of heart, nor the high school dropout. However, for those people with a desire for historical knowledge and the willingness to take up a challenge, this book is well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dense to be interesting","review":"Roberts gets two stars for packing the history of the world into a 1000+ pages with great accuracy and few oversites. He covers just about everything, but space limitations mean he must strip out all the interesting details and most analysis of the forces driving events.What's left is a bunch of capsule summaries strung together chronologically. There are no overarching themes or narrative to tie everything together. In short, this book is little better than a low-budget reference volume. It's about as interesting to read cover-to-cover as the encyclopedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding historical overview.","review":"This book is an excellent historical review. It is Eurocentric because Europe has had a monumental influence on the modern world. I do think it has not been well edited. Some sections are as if they had been written by more than one person, and I suspect that is because the editing was done by more than one person. Some sections have extremely complex sentence structures and are very difficult to read while others are almost terse and to the point and very easy to read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and found many concepts that are at interesting odds with other presentations of the same historical periods. Because of the organization, I found it necessary to outline sections of the book for future reference. Probably Mr. Roberts did not intend the book as a general reference book. There are quite a number of interesting concepts put forth without argument, and I would have preferred a few more pages for the presentation of the arguments for those points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information to make it interesting","review":"This book covers a lot of history... being only 1000 pages it still covers the entire history of civilization.Unfortunately, this book tries to cover too much information in too little space to allow for interesting details of the history it covers. Instead of going into detail about the causes of certain events, it basically lists them, one after another in which gets boring somewhat quickly. Many other books on historical events or subjects (most of which are not as broad in scope as this one) are much more entertaining due to the amount of insight that they bring to the subject.It is a fine book if you need a reference for general history, but not if you want to be enlightened about history.Most of what it covers you have already learned in high school. It goes into very little depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"Had this book been called \\"World History From a European point of view\\", I would have given it five stars. Its very well written. But the title is misleading. This book is European History and how it was affected by world events. So many pages are dedicated to the fall of Byzantium, it sounds almost as if the author is trying to defend why the Christians 'lost' the Eastern kingdom to Islam. While almost a good chapter is spent on the intricate branches of Christianity, Lord Buddha is mentioned in the passing. While the entire Indian and Chinese civilations are summarized in about 10 pages, about a 100 are spent on some obscure Frankish kings.History of the World?? I don't think so. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York State Regents Exam : Biology","review":"This book is excellent in helping any high school student rewiew for the NYS Bio regents exam.

I sort of liked the first chapter, but it was all downhill from there. The author makes all these comparisons between the subjects of her chapters, but they're all obvious, and it makes it seem like she's just trying to take up space and talk down to readers--like she's assuming we couldn't draw these very obvious conclusions ourselves.

I think the authors could have kept that information and broadened coverage of other states. I was also disappointed to find fairly thin treatment of very complicated tax matters regarding trusts, Medicaid, and SSI, and of trustees' obligations to file financial reports to state human resources and finance departments. I thought this would be a more comprehensive source for people overseeing special-needs trusts, but it turns out I need to look at other handbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"I bought this because Luca Turin, the Emperor of Scent recommended it:[...]I didn't like the small at all.

I'd seen the film many times before I'd ever read the book; and whereas the film is both tough and tender, the tenderness of the novel by Geoffrey Homes (who penned the sharply-written screenplay as well) is downright poetic--and is surprisingly well-integrated into what is, at heart, a detective novel. All the double-crossing of the book makes it into the film intact, but the film adds a depth to it that leaves you breathless at the conclusion. A cynical, despairing work of art that stands out in the hard-boiled genre for the beauty of its prose and the depth of its tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Wrox book","review":"This book is well written and on a whole well executed. The two sample projects that he walks you through I thought were excellent additions to the book. The author also gives you a brief background of the GNOME project and how it is different from KDE which uses QT.One thing I did not like about this book was the fact he does not give any mention to GTK-- which is the C++ kit or any of the many other languages that can take advantage of GTK beyond acknowledging it's existance. It would have been really nice for this book to have had a chapter on other languages and GTK.Also the chapter on the rapid application development (AKA RAD) tool GLADE was rather skimpy.However if you are a C programmer looking for a good GTK book, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice update to her series except for the photos","review":"As always with her Breyer value guide series, Felicia Browell has done another wonderful job documenting Breyer products and pricing. There are so many hundreds of different mold and color combinations out there and she manages to keep track of them all for us, job well done!The only flaw to this latest edition is the photography. Wherever a horse of medium brown color tone appears, the horse is a bright washed out orange color. I know from owning quite a few of the horses pictured that the book colors are distorted; my own are definitely not orange shades. (I have been collecting for 20 some years).The one thing I would love to see more of is Breyer test color models. She only selects a few to photograph as examples but there are a myriad of these one of a kinds out there.

The first two chapters are dedicated to getting into the guts of COM and don't deal with ATL at all. This book fails to provide useful examples that a new ATL user can extrapolate from to fit their own similar problems, and it appears to assume several years of experience in C++. If you've never seen COM or ATL before, skip chapters 1 and 2 to start and go to chapter 3. Then after you've read 3,4, and 5, go back and read 1 and 2. I realize the info contained in them is important, but it is usually better to start out simple and get more complex, not the other way around.On the other hand, if you are an advanced user, this is a pretty good reference for exactly what is going on under the hood with ATL."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATL is fun","review":"The beginning ATL 3 COM Programming is an excellent book to start with COM.

The author clearly understands the technology, but just as clearly does not know how to communicate that effectively in the written word. The writing is overly verbose ['In the previous discussion we obviously ommitted any reference to a topic that desires more exploration.'] Good writing--esp. technical writing--needs to be clear and to the point. This book is a difficult read, and I gave up after 12 pages.

This book is a perfect example of a photographers guide. He doesn't just talk about techniques and show examples. He actually has all the details involved. Studio setups are illustrated clearly and easily. He also has a photo of himself taking the pictures. He tells you the camera and lens used and you get a real sense of how he uses his camera.There is a section on different cameras including 35 mm, medium format and 4 x 5 large format.

Amazingly, even though these remain some of my all time favorites, Ronstadt just got better and better as a vocalist for three more decades.So here's the deal, this is a best of the early career of one of the finest female vocalist to ever be recorded, and for the price, you can't beat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One","review":"I had to have a bit of Linda on my Fire.

That means there are no tick marks in the progress bar at the bottom of the Kindle. No tick marks = no jumping ahead to the next section with the navigation button. I guess this isn't surprising considering the table of contents is useless; good encoding starts with a good TOC and the ICX follows.But these folks didn't do *any* of it, and for an $18 Kindle edition that's crap.PUBLISHER: Get a grip and make a little effort will you?

It is charming and bright, and my children, when they were young, would love to dance when I put this on. Often this music is presented in a very dry and academic manner: it is refreshing to hear it played with such a great sense of fun: you can imagine a true \\"Renaissance Revel\\". I especially found the anonymous French dances infectiously happy. It is simple music making, and the sounds of some of the instruments may be a bit unfamiliar, and to some, a bit raucous, but done with great skill and verve.

That he gets the help of his doctor by giving his clinic a big check is all the more disgusting. I felt sorry for the boyfriend, who seemed decent enough.

Just horrible.","review":"It's been a few days since I rented this and I still can't get over how horrible it was on so many levels. The plot is just dumb, for one...but in the days since I watched it I'm actually very disturbed by the fact that someone actually made a movie about a guy faking cancer to get attention. I actually liked the main actor in another movie he's in (the one where he plays a guy who ends up dating a guy who is also dating his father). That's why I took a chance on \\"the love patient\\". Very few gay movies are \\"good\\" in the sense that they are well-made or well-written...but this is honestly the first movie in a while that I've seen that made me want to take a shower afterwards.I still can't get over how horrible it was for this guy to fake having cancer and put people through the emotional terrorism of that.

The characters were believable, and I felt like I would've appreciated the story line more if I would've been reading it as a book instead of watching it. The actors, however, couldn't really act all. The main character, Paul, annoyed the hell out of me with that sarcastic smirk he wore throughout almost the entire movie. And (I might sound like a bit of a b-word here, but) I did not find any of the actors remotely attractive (except for maybe Ted)which is kind of important for me when trying to get into a movie. All in all, I couldn't really get into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy production","review":"Script is trite but that isn't the worst part. The jump cuts, lighting, stiff, character acting and sloppy continutity doom this conceptually worthy storyline from the start.

A hastily cranked-out job from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Poorly acted movie","review":"Sometimes bad acting can be forgiven when the movie has some redeeming qualities (like the 4 eating out movies). The premise of Love patient sounded like it could be a funny movie, but right from the open it was just awful. The actors had no chemistry, the acting was bad, the writing was bad. There were almost no funny moments and it was a challenge just to watch it to the end.

Fred MacMurry (My Three Sons) decides three sons is not enough and takes on a whole troop of them - other peoples as he becomes a reluctant scoutmaster. Slowly he throws himself into the idea. As I say, kids my not warm to this Baden-Powell wholesomeness, but who knows, they might surprise you. A very young Kurt Russell plays tough boy that MacMurry wins over.Interesting point: at the end when you see his \\"boys\\" all grown up, take note of William Reynolds as Hoodoo Henderson as a Man (FBI, The Thing That Couldn't Die). He played MacMurray's son in There's Always Tomorrow (1956)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for Families and Scouters","review":"I found out about this movie from my Scoutmaster, it was one of his favorite movies and He was sad that all he owned was an old VHS recording from the Disney Channel \\"Back in the Day\\" I was going to transfer it to DVD when I found this on Amazon.com. A great buy and a great movie. Ordered a copy for myself and I know that he ordered one for himself. I have shared my copy with many friends, all of whom liked it a lot, and a few even whent and bought their own copy. Great Family Film and a Great Perspective on scouting. If you have ever been a scout or support Scouting in any way I Highly recomend buying this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"No widescreen DVD? No purchase!","review":"Sorry, Disney Home Video. If you won't release DVDs with their appropriate widescreen aspect ratio, I won't be buying them.\\"Follow Me, Boys\\" is a good film, but you've given it a very poor DVD release by including only a pan & scan version.I would have thought you might have learned from your mistake with \\"The Absent-Minded Professor\\", which you went back and corrected.At a minimum, you could release both pan & scan AND widescreen on the same DVD or DVD set...PLEASE show some respect for your company's considerable film heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow Me Boys with Fred MacMurray","review":"I first saw this movie in Boston Massachusetts in 1966 with a couple of friends. We were still smiling when we came out of the theater. We had trekked downtown on the subway which was an adventure in itself. On the return trip we didn't watch closely to get the right train and found ourselves going the wrong way at midnight. Instead of getting off at the next stop, we rode to the end of the line and back again to save money! Follow Me Boys is the cutest movie; so well played by the characters. It is a wonderful, clean, humorous family movie that anyone any age would enjoy. We need Fred MacMurray again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but could have been a better dvd.","review":"I saw this movie for the first time at Philmont Scout Ranch in 1984 and it immediately became my favorite movie about Scouting.

One of my favorite Movies of all time (sorry star wars and Lord of the rings ranks lower) This is a must see. I like to show it to boys that have either just joined the CubScout pack and boys that are about to move into Boy Scouts. As someone that has been working with boys in scouting for many years (looking forward to many years to come) this is a movie I always keep handy. You can't watch it to many times and it makes a great reward to gather the boys for a movie night and watch their eyes light up. I don't agree that boys may not find it revelant or interesting we watched it last night with 15 boys piled on top of each other in the living room and barely had a peep out of them except when they all sang along with the theme song. I am now ordering several more copies of the movie for Parents that are wanting to add it to their home collections.

I found it highly entertaining and a great look back to an idealized simpler time. My only complaint with the film would be that the last quarter seems to drag on a bit because of several drastic plot twists that come completely out of left field. But this is a minor flaw to a great film that is suited for the entire family.The DVD itself needs some help. For reasons unknown the film is not presented in it's original aspect ratio and worse, there is a yellow border around the picture while the opening credits are playing. On the plus side, there is a great 11 minute bonus documentary, \\"Looking back With Lem's boys\\" which features interviews with the grown up kids who appeared in the film. Kurt Russell does not appear in it but it's still a great feature"},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow Me Boys","review":"Hollywood productions rarely capture reality, but this Disney movie starring Fred McMurray comes pretty close.

This is a great film for all members of the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warmer","review":"I first saw FOLLOW ME, BOYS on The Disney Channel long ago and looked forward to seeing it again. I initially watched it out of a sense of Duty -- as an admirer of the art of Walt Disney. I was anything but a Boy Scout and expected the film to be syrupy and nauseating, but was surprised to find FOLLOW ME, BOYS to be one of Uncle Walt's warmest and most genuinely sentimental works. The film shares a compelling spirit of real goodness and positive idealism with such Walt Disney classics as POLLYANNA, THOSE CALLOWAYS and OLD YELLER, along with much of their quality and entertainment value. Fred MacMurray is in his element here, giving one of his best performances. The Disney Company should certainly be including widescreen alternates on their DVDs but I was not going to miss this moving film for anything.Rating: 8/10 **** VERY GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took so long","review":"I knew when it was taken off E-bay it was coming. What I want to know is, what took so long for a movie like this to be released on DVD. Did they finally see what the old VHS bids were going for on E-Bay.

However, I realize not all movies were filmed that way, especially decades-old ones. The \\"Follow Me, Boys\\" DVD is presented in the FULLSCREEN aspect ratio of 1.33:1 because that is its original format. It really is a non-issue here. In the meantime, what a true joy it is to see this film again! Let us all join together to implore DISNEY to clear its vaults and re-release all of the older, classic films. They confirm the genius of DISNEY under Walt's guidance, and make one realize how truly GOOD films could be compared with what's available today. Walt knew that an audience would appreciate good values as long as they were served up with some laughter and tears. A wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it all over again!","review":"One of my favorite movies with Fred MacMurray. Kurt Russell is also excellent it shows his potential as an actor.

The quality of the introductory shots must have been done on a 1980's vintage VHS hand held. The film, as said in earlier reviews, is maybe 15 minutes long, and must have been done as a theater promotion, or as something shone on the old CBS Friday Night Movies used to show as filler in the 1960's. I can give you the accurate time, because I have not looked at the disk again due to embarrassment.

Poignant, funny, horrifying and ultimately sobering this book is a gem and a realistic view of what the war in Southeast Asia must have been like. Absoluely amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing","review":"Perhaps I expected too much given the gushing reviews here. I anticipated a book comparable to a Tom Clancy novel, fictional yet very believable and entertaining. Instead, I found a book that attempted to create far too many characters that were poorly developed and not believable, frequently acting completely out of character. Instead of focusing on what I hoped would be the experience of jungle warfare, this book wastes inordinate time on philosophical discussions about the war and on character's love lives (usually quite awkwardly). Although starting off fairly well, it became a burden to read. I generally read every word of even poor books, but found myself skimming through the last half of this book. The ending was illogical and most disappointing. This book should remain out of print. I regret having tracked down a used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth reading","review":"Technically, the book is well-written. Del Vecchio, however, glorifies the war in steroid-fueled adolescent fashion, and actually believes that the torture, rape, and mass murder of over 1 million Vietnamese civilians amounted to a \\"moral war\\".He tells a good story, though, and teenagers in love with guns and the macho culture of military violence will enjoy this book. So will adults who think that the lives of Americans are more valuable than anyone elses."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real leech infested thing","review":"Unlike Tim O'Brien, this book takes a group of grunts and follows them through the jungle into a leech infested valley filled with the enemy. It is a true war story, not just anecdotes of experiences. There is no better in the litany of Vietnam fiction that is of this genre'. Del Vecchio knows how to spin a war yarn and this kept me entranced from start to finish.

It is a beautifully written, gripping, graphic book that captures the horror and madness and random bravery of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewer from Seattle Misguided","review":"The reviewer from Seattle is not sufficiently far from the cradle to know that many adolescents served in ground combat during the Vietnam War. So many American mothers' teenaged sons were, in fact, killed in Vietnam. And, such was the outcry the US Marines were eventually not permitted to accept a 17 year-old recruit without the signatures of both parents.Mr. Del Vecchio did Americans a good service by putting the horror and heartbreak of his war to the printed word for all of us to examine.Del Vecchio's follow-up to 13th Valley, Carry Me Home, proves only too well that his personal experiences were, also, all too real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You.","review":"Dear Mr. Del Vecchio,Bought your great, classic book upon first hardback printing.

There are also two biographical documentaries on the DVD, one about McQueen and one about Jacqueline Bisset, both thrown together with a minimal voice over and very very very little effort into the writing.

She was not taken for a veterinary checkup for 2 years and, when she was finally taken, her dental condition was so bad that she had to have 16 teeth removed. And after an incident that left her hobbling around on 3 legs, her \\"parents\\" were okay with this because she didn't seem to be in pain and delayed veterinary treatment.

This movie is BAD BAD BAD! Horrible acting, stupid story (Prince directed it himself, hey, he can't be good at everything) and outrageously ridiculous dialogue. But a few of the songs aren't bad (Mountains, Girls and Boys, Sometimes it Snows in April) and that's why I'm even giving it ONE star. This is a really dumb tale about Prince and Morris Day's valet Jerome Benton going to France where the former is a gigolo who falls in love. The one thing good I can say about this slop for the hogs is that it's better than the laxative-on-film \\"Graffiti Bridge.\\"But if you want a very expensive frisbee or if you need a target for skeet-shooting, then go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster!","review":"Never watched because it wouldn't play on my laptop.

That says I watched this for the first time just because His Royal Badness was in it. What I found, y'all, was the best B-movie of all time. And what's more, I am firmly convinced that it was consciously produced to be just that. Prince is not being \\"preening\\" or \\"self-stroking\\" any more than usual-in fact I would say that Christopher Tracy is Prince lampooning the more outrageous aspects of his own personality. Yes, the movie is visually stunning. Yes, it is funny. But just as much as the accompanying album, it is a work of genius-insane genius, no doubt, but genius nonetheless. It's like a little time-addled psychedelic trip into the mind of the Artist.

I saw it on tv the other day and couldn't believe how stupid this movie really was! He is a terrible actor as were the other cast in the movie. The story line was stupid and he was just too dramatic and feminine in the movie. What woman would want a man walking around in high heel boots and lacey clothes with his back out? The soundtrack is good but prince either needs to take some acting lessons before he does another movie or he needs to stick to singing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of the Jazz Age","review":"Filmed in color, but processed in black and white, Prince directs and stars in this neat romantic comedy that captures slapstick comedy, old-school con men and the feel of a time when \\"Flappers and Philosophers\\" were all the rage.Prince is Christopher Tracy who - along with sidekick Tricky (Jerome Benton) - is working the ultimate con on an heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas), who will be able to tap into an incredible $50 million inheritance on her 21st birthday. But a strange thing happens to the scheme; Tracy falls in love with her.There is a solid understanding of the classic Hollywood storytelling elements, with the era wonderfully captured in the setting designs and actor's wardrobe. It is a throwback that captures Prince as a historian of film and pop culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"two thumbs up!!!!","review":"I have always been a prince fan and this movie is one of the best i've seen.

The COM Interopability chapter is very good and introduces he obcure Recordset fill and how to use ADOMD from .net!The Transaction chapter is way too small and incomplete. Another flaw is the fact that the book is supposed to cover VB.net and C# but they were sloppy and it is not a 50/50 split. Often they forget the VB.net samples. You would think their editors could count and make sure all examples come in pairs.I think it is a great buy but I hope they get all VB.net examples in 2nd edition and a re-orgnization to be more task oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for critical readers","review":"I have never read a book that is so full of errors.

This CD has a few truly memorable cuts and got lots of play back in the early 70's. Kim Simmonds played a very spirited lead guitar and the gritty gravelly vocals of Chris Youlden defined the group. Louisiana Blues is a particular highlight of the disc. It was even better when performed live at the Fillmore. Awesome album cover too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great British blues","review":"Blue matter the third album from Savoy Brown a talented blues rock group in the sixties blues rock boom.Savoy brown was a superb five piece outfit fronted by the greatKim Simmonds and Lonesome Dave peverett on guitars and vocals.This was their best album after the terrific Raw Sienna.I got this album yesterday and have played it a number of times.I have given it a 4 star rating only because of the less than great sound quality.This album needs a good remastering job.This nice album features great tracks like Train to nowhere,dont turn me from your door,may be wrong,it hurts me too and the excellent Louisiana blues.Highly recommended to fans of blues rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOSTLY DISAPPOINTING...","review":"If you're snooping around for a sample of Savoy Brown, I'd recommend \\"Raw Sienna\\" over this one: better guitar playing and Chris Youlden's vocals are much stronger (possibly because they were recorded better) on \\"R S\\".

Definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Beginning Book","review":"We generally buy this book (and previously Beginning Active Server Pages 2.0) for any new programmers starting on an ASP project. We have used it to train interns and veteran programmers-turned-web-developers alike and both have commented on it's excellent writing and thorough treatment of all relevant topics. The only problem that I have with the book is that some of the code samples tend cause the new developers to think that they should write code for larger projects similarly -- which could be quite a mess. Over all and as a reference, its great. But my suggestion for next time around: improve the code samples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a good book","review":"The explanations of the examples presented in the text were excellent. Very easy to understand and follow.The supposed grammar problems were not a problem to me, possibly because I am not a grammar expert myself. I hardly even noticed any.The one thing about this book that did bother me however, was the order of the content. The chapters on error handling, scripting objects, and ASP components, seemed extremely out of place. These chapters contain information that is not critical to the average ASP developer, yet they come ahead of basic information such as database connectivity. I think that most people want to access a database before they want information about Ad Rotation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately Beginner *Programmer* level","review":"As another reviewer put it 'Little did I know it should have said Activer Server Pages 3.0 for Beginning Programmers (as opposed to ASP beginners).' Also, while some reviews noted the grammer problems, there are also problems with the index, which often points you to the wrong page (the correct page is usually earlier - they must have added pages after the index was written). There is some ASP material of worth but you have to wade through a lot to find it. It also glosses over some ASP features, such as HTMLencode, which while mentioned, is never discussed in any detail. After all the glowing reviews of this book I was really disappointed. The Pro version (which most reviews warn you away from as being too hard) is a better ASP book even if you are new to ASP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book *FOR BEGINNERS*","review":"I would rate this book as a very good starting point for ASP beginners. If you are already an ASP programmer, go for Professional ASP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned: Many pages are scanned images","review":"This book in book format may be good, but in the Kindle format beware that many pages (and ALL of the appendixes) are just scanned images of a text page and not actually scanned and converted to text.On the Kindle you can't search for text that is on these pages and they show up small (like an image) on the screen. You have to zoom the image and even then you can't read some of the pages. And, zooming on the Kindle isn't exactly a fast process.If you are a coder and you get this book as a reference manual, then keep in mind that when you search on a term, that your searches will never find any of the pages that are scanned in as images. For me, this defeats the whole advantage the Kindle version has over the book version.The entire appendixes are scanned images of pages and non-searchable and that's where the ASP syntax reference section is located.I'd avoid this book at least the Kindle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for beginners","review":"I started out knowing absolutely nothing about ASP using VBscript.

The book provides very hard-to-find information, including how to interface with different types of databases (this is harder to find than you'd think) as well as detailed syntax descriptions for VBScript options (another difficult to find item).This is not a book to learn web development! If you don't already have a good grasp of HTML, start somewhere else. If you've taken HTML as far as you can and are ready to learn dynamic content using ASP, this is the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overview to get you up and running","review":"Covers a broad range of topics well enough to get running with VBscript, ASP and ADO. Occasional typos in the text and code but nothing that wasn't fairly obvious. Outstanding deal for a novice. If you are comfortable with VB already a number of chapters can be skipped but remaining chapters are VERY useful - esp. re: ADO. When looking at similar books make sure they are using ADO rather than the older DAO for DB access. Written in a clear, excellent style that is surprisingly homogenous given the number of authors. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the beginner - but where was the editor?","review":"This book very easily gets a beginner up and running with rudimentary ASP examples. My biggest complaint is the lack of editing in this book. Bad writing and grammatical errors were humurous at first...annoying after 700 pages. There is no excuse for publishing a book written this poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Beginning ASP Book Out There!","review":"This book has proved its worth countless times. It has helped me with everything from database connections to VBscript syntax to providing handy code examples. I can't emphasis enough how this book has helped me go from a casual HTML daubler to programming ASP pages in no time. It will probably not offer anything new to an experienced developer, but like most Wrox books, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one hellava good read","review":"I kinda got bored of reading, I found computer books too hard to understand, read or to follow, I needed to do an ASP programming project fast, but I didn't know a damn thing about ASP or why people use it...then this book came along...Although the book is aimed at non-programmers or programmers crossing over to another language, it helps if you know Visual Basic as the ASP coding is primarily VBScript in this book. The wording is clear, concise and to the point. I can understand all of what its trying to say, and more importantly why.So okay, it concentrates on Forms on the first few chapters, at least it's explaining them - rather than saying \\"do it yourself\\".Some of the code has minor errors in them, but I was able to pick them out. I strongly suggest if you want to start ASP programming (whether its for your own site or for a project) you pick up this book (or Begining ASP Databases) as you should be okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"super asp book","review":"Ive read many scripting books and a couple asp books, but none of them broke down the syntax like this one. Most books seem to speak in general terms, giving you ideas of what you CAN do with asp, but not actually giving you enough to learn how. That is not the case with this book and because of the lengthy discussion of detail many have said that this book is too lengthy... well if you dont want a lengthy book then be my guest and go buy 3 others to do the job of this one book.

At first it was just annoying, but then an almost mystical thing happened. After a few weeks, i actually began to look forward to the muezzin's call. This CD is obviously a modern rendition of that most ubiquitous of muslim practices throughout the Islamic world; however,it does capture the variety and solemnity of the \\"call to prayer\\" and perhaps something of the indefatigable spirit of a true \\"submission to God\\". You don't need to be muslim to appreciate this disc; just be sensitive to the fact that if you play this recording too loudly, you might create a bit of a stir as your muslim neighbors might mistake this for a \\"formal call to prayer\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Alternative","review":"I have a hard time getting out of bed.

This clock, however, is made for DEEP sleepers. The first time I experienced the massive shaking, I woke up in a panic. This is such an unpleasant way to wake-up, I often turn the alarm off if I wake up on my own a few minutes before it is set to go off. It does the job, and I know it is there to wake me if I should not wake up on my own, but suddenly I find my own biological clock to be waking me more often than this one.

Luckily, there is a circuit breaker in Singapore homes. I searched for a suitable adaptor but it could not provide sufficient power.

I put it under my mattress by my feet and my husband could feel it. This part is great if that is the only feature you are looking for. I bought (but returned) this clock for its \\"tone\\" feature, which is completely useless for someone with tone deafness. The manufacturer does not indicate the frequency of its tone, which is by the way, all in the high frequency range, just what I cannot hear, at all. My husband says it was very loud. So if you are hearing impaired to low frequencies or just hearing impaired across all frequency ranges this clock would probably be fine. If you have high frequency loss, don't bother unless you only want the 'shake' feature.

Perfect.Had it for little under a month and no once have I overslept. As opposed to oversleeping 3-4 times a week.Cons: The only cons I have for it are completely aesthetic the display is a tad small and it seems as though the actually clock itself is balancing on about half an inch of contact with the night stand.

Hook up was easy, setting time no easier then any other clock. The vibrations through my mattress certainly wake me up, and its not something i can just sleep through. I do not use the audible alarm on this, i tried it when i first got it, and it seemed like it hurt my dogs ears, so i spare them the pain and just use the vibrations, which is more then enough.The reason I gave this clock 4 stars is because i think the vibrator cord is too short. At first I had the clock right next to my bed, which didn't help since right when it went off i would just smack it around until it turned off.I ended up having to put it on the other side of my speaker, a spot i would have to get out of bed to turn off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This alarm clock is everything they said - very loud and guaranteed to wake the dead! If you don't wake up with this, nothing will wake you up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for the college student","review":"As a parent of a very sound sleeper, I was really worried about sending my child (yes he's legally an adult at 18 but indulge me here, I'm having separation anxieties!) off to college for the first time. There is no alarm clock on the market that ever woke him up until I purchased this one. With just the vibrating device alone he wakes up, which is great news for his roommate and those living on his hall. It's perfect to slide under the pillow or mattress (we tried both at home before he moved) and it shakes the bed enough to wake him. I think this product would work perfectly for the hearing impaired! GREAT VALUE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Boom Alarm Clock","review":"I bought this Sonic Boom Alarm Clock to replace the one that wore out. My husband is fairly young and has aprofound hearing loss, so he doesn't hear any alarm except one that vibrates. This particular one works as wellas the one he bought before, which was a step above this one. This particular one is perfectly good thoughbecause he doesn't need any more than the basic sonic vibration. The other one is heavier. This is more lightweight, so its easy if ur traveling. My husband is happy to have this clock, so he doesn't have to worry aboutwaking up on time for work. Im grateful that I don't have to hear a regular alarm go off at 4am in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even wakes up a High School Student!","review":"I bought the Sonic Boom Alarm Clock for my hearing impaired teenager so that she could get herself up for school each day on her own. She has it set on vibrate and it definitely wakes her up and gets her going. We have asked her to turn off the audible alarm because it was so loud the first morning that we thought the house alarm had gone off. The clock arrived on time, well packaged and with instructions that my teen was able to use without a problem. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic boom alarm clock.","review":"110volt and NZ is 250volt but after that was sorted it isan excellent clock.The vibrating disc really wakes you up, so an excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this for my husband because I have been his alarm clock for 10 years ( normal alarms have no affect on him ), and he had to take a business trip. It works wonders, I have him call me each morning, so I know he is awake, and every morning, he calls at the same time because the alarm has done its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't make it work. i've abandoned it to stop loss","review":"i bought this product because vendor states it works with 110v/220v. the 220v option requires extra charge, but i forgot to order it.now i've got the product and then asked for the 220v transformer. they passed me to the british representative of the vendor. the british representative found the adapter for 15 EUR in france (acceptable), but freight was 59 EUR (more than the watch, the freight from us (which is 3 times farther), and the 220v transformer together).the british representative above has a representative in israel, which could receive my transformer with one of their regular parcels, to cut of that exaggerated freight, but in the end did not.even to return the watch back to the states would cost me more than it's price the vendor would give back to me.i'll definitely have to look for a product near me.best regards,alex"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a deep sleeper, and for college.","review":"The Sonic Boom alarm clock has been absolutely amazing for me! I have owned it for just over a year now and am completely satisfied with it. I am an incredibly deep sleeper (I once slept through a smoke alarm going off in my house) and this alarm clock has managed to wake me up. I love the fact that the vibrating attachment can be enabled without an audible alarm sound, which has been great for college. I wanted an alarm that would wake me up while disturbing my roommate as little as possible. While the vibrations are so powerful that they can slightly be heard from the same room, this is much less disturbing for a roommate than a regular alarm clock would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sonic Boom Alarm- this will wake you up!","review":"I bought the basic sonic boom, and it came with the vibrating alert (although I never used that). The alarm is nice and loud- much louder than my panasonic digital alarm clock. It is a good choice if you need something very loud to wake you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but don't buy if you're a chronic snoozer!","review":"Great alarm, does everything as advertised, except all the top buttons are the same, including the one for snooze. In the mornings I'm too out of it to get up and look at the tiny labels on the tiny buttons and end up hitting all of them until the sound stops, which inevitably ends up being the \\"off\\" button (since it's closer to me; alarm won't fit on the other side of the bed) and not the \\"snooze\\" button. It would be perfect if they could make the snooze button bigger, or put it in a different spot. Other than that, it REALLY is loud, and the vibration helps too. In fact, the vibration wakes me up before the alarm most of the time. If you're hard of hearing or can't get your butt out of bed then this alarm is for you! However, if you're a chronic snoozer like me, then I'd shop around and find a model with a better button layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"no hearing aid needed","review":"My Dad is 86 years old and hard of hearing. He wanted something that would wake him up since he is a sound sleeper. Dad loves this alarm clock! He joked that he's not too hard of hearing because he only needs to set the alarm on 7 out of 10 on the loudness scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alarm","review":"Very good alarm. I am surprised to see so many buttons. I wish it is little simpler. It works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great ... until it fails unexpectedly.","review":"While the controls could be a little easier to use, I was thrilled with how well this clock worked. Then the display went bad in less than 6 months of use - making it worthless! Compared to my old clock radio that has been treated poorly over the years and still works, the Sonic Boom had a pretty easy life. I don't understand how the build quality could be so poor.Because I need a solution that wakes me reliably, which it initially did, I'm going to give Sonic Boom one more chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked! The teen boy now gets up on his own!!","review":"It wasn't the loud volume which he doesn't even use; it was the vibration device under his mattress. The whole family appreciates the wonder of this alarm clock. I don't usually post reviews, so you can imagine how great this is! If you have someone in your home who is late for school, oversleeps or is just difficult to get up no matter how many times you try or how loudly the alarm is set, get this clock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaker Alarm is Broken","review":"I bought one of these alarm clocks 4 years ago and was disappointed with the quality. The shaker part of that clock broke after just a few months. I really needed a vibrating alarm, so after reading all the recent reviews, I decided to take another chance on this clock. After just over 2 months, the vibrating portion of the alarm has stopped working. I am past my return window with Amazon, so I am apparently stuck with this clock. When it does work, the clock is great. The problem is that the vibrating portion of the clock is not dependable, and without that the clock is worthless to me. I would pass on this clock and look for something with better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made clock","review":"The clock is contained in a very thin, cheap plastic. The alarm is loud and has sound control. All the settings are on top and the buttons are small; including the snooze button. It's a cheap product certainly not worth $25. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"annoying enough to wake you!","review":"This WILL WAKE YOU UP! I am hearing impaired and am sooo glad I have an alarm clock that will wake me.

What a great feature. All parents need this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, especially with the vibrating pad for under the pillow","review":"We have purchased two of these, about 3 years apart.

The vibrator doesn't last forever (we're on our second one), but Amazon's price for a whole new unit is about the same as the vibrator-only from specialty stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not LOUD!","review":"We got this after reading the great reviews on how loud it was, we are both heavy sleepers and have a hard time waking up. This alarm clock is not loud at all, The alarm, is annoying, but not louder then any ol clock for less then 1/2 this price. The alarm is compariable with my cel phone's alarm. If your a truely a deep sleeper, DO NO BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not what I was expecting","review":"It's a great alarm, but not as loud as I thought it would be. I was hoping to use it as a replacement to my other 4 alarms, but no such luck. I still need to set 5-6 alarms every morning to wake up, so it isn't really enough to do the job for a really heavy sleeper.Before I got it, I was late about once a week, since I've gotten it (a month ago), I've only been late twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying for everyone but me","review":"I bought this alarm based upon the reviews by everyone else. It worked for the first couple weeks and now I just sleep through this too. I am an exceptionally heavy sleeper and am still searching for something that will wake me up. I have it set to 10 and put the disc right under where my head is and I still sleep for over a half an hour with it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I bought this alarm clock in the hope of it being able to wake a very sleepy teenager in the morning.

It has been a great disappointment and certainly not what it is advertised as."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a fantastic hair product!","review":"I read a lot of reviews before purchasing the products (I got shampoo, conditioner and body wash). Many of them mentioned that they dry your hair or skin too much or that they don't lather. First of all, the body wash lathers great. The shampoo does not lather very much because it doesn't have sulfates (which is just FILLER. Does not clean your hair). Also, if you have hard water, which most people do, it's not going to lather as well. However, I find that in spite of all of that, it lathers well enough. I only use a quarter size amount and I have really thick hair. I love that it's cruelty free. It has a faint smell, which is nice because it allows you to wear lotion or perfume without clashing. Also, my hair feels cleaner longer and I don't see my hair drying out after using the conditioner. Fantastic products! And affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squeaky Clean, LITERALLY","review":"I JUST FINISHED WASHING MY HAIR AND MY HAIR WAS LITERALLY SQUEAKING WHEN I RAN MY FINGERS DOWN IT. This shampoo seriously gets whatever is on your hair out!!! I was so curious reading everyone's reviews about it, so I figured to buy the single bottle instead of the pack of 3 that shows up more often when you search for Giovanni products on Amazon.There are no parabens, no dyes, and sulfate free-Is this CLARIFYING SHAMPOO gentle enough to wash with everyday? Yes. The back of the bottle has all the information and it's especially for overly processed, tired, and/or dyed hair.So not only is this a clarifying shampoo, but it can be your regular one also. I'm so freaking glad I bought this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference","review":"I bought the Beginners Guide to Linux Programming and I really liked that book. This book is a very good follow-up, but it doesn't give the reader more programming tips.It covers many topics which makes this book a great reference for anyone who deals with Linux and even other flavors of Unix on a day to day basic. Buy this book if you are looking for a reference book on developing software on Linux that covers advanced topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Kernel Hack","review":"If you are looking for information on hacking the Linux Kernel then this book is not for you. Also it shows a total bias towards GTK/GNOME and PostgreSQL. There are places in the text which shows a complete lack of understanding of the subject under discussion. Information concerning MySQL is at best inaccurate and totally misleading. The treatment of KDE and Qt is very scant. Overall this book falls very short of expectations. It trys to be all things to men but ends up being nothing. Very disappointing indeed"},{"rating":"1","title":"She dont sound black!","review":"Her older stuff kinda worked b/c it was a variety of styles. This dont work becuase she aint black.

Mariah never has been a true soul singer and this album confirms it. She goes through the motions but never connects with the emotions. The songwriting is derivative and unimaginative....copying either current trends or old standards. The last song, cringe-worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New, Unless U like FILLER>","review":"Ok her first single sucks, and I have previewed the rest of her album and was very dissappointed with the entire album, there is nothing new to this album it is just a new version of her later albums.

I remember when Mariah wasn't a cash-in and when she cared about her fans. I remember when Mariah used to be a good POP artist without annoying rapping guests. Oh yeah, I remember. And you crazy fans do too. I'm not going to bother going on about whether Madonna or Mariah is better, because every true person out there knows who's sold more records and is a better and true artist to their fans (and it's not Mariah. Seriously. Go on Wikipedia on the best selling artists document and you'll see Madonna is number four; Mariah number seven.) Futhermore, Mariah is just going really bland now.

Shake it off and Fly like a bird are my 2 favorites off of this cd. It just seemed that every other song began to sound the same as the other one. It was hard to distinguish from one track to another. There are some good ones though.

Tuneless, hip-hop, subwoofer (today's greatest noise pollution curse) thumping, urban, boring, (did I say tuneless?)chord (if there truly are chords) repetitive crap.

Don't waste your money. As a friend I'm telling you this. I just wish someone would of told me this, so take heed. :)If your looking for a good cd, go with Celine Dion's Live in Las Vegas, or Miracle, Celine also has a Miracle cd, dvd, and hard cover color photo album which you should pick up here on Amazon or any good record store.

They must be doing the same thing they did several years ago -- priced the record extremely low and have people from the record company go out and buy copies to give the impression that its big. Mariah has a great voice, but she needs to stick with her early 90's formula -- pop/R&B. She sounds foolish trying to be hip-hop.

Though at times she does revert back to the raspy whisper she used on \\"Charmbraclet\\", for the most part, Mariah's golden voice has returned. On ballads like \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"Mine Again\\", and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", that voice is used to shatter glass with those impossible-to-hit high notes. The 2000s have not been kind to Mimi. Her big movie debut was the biggest joke of the year, she hasn't had a #1 hit since 1999, and she had an extremely publcized mental breakdown that ended her up in the hospital. Not good.

This album is nothing special at all. Mariah used to be good. In the 1990s, she was the best selling female at the time. Celine Dion and Whitney Houston had to stand aside - even Madonna had to stand and watch Carey sell more records. (That's now changed. Madonna has outsold Mariah - ask the Guiness Hit Singles And Albums book.) If you're looking for a better artist than Mariah, go to Celine. She is one of the many Canadian superstars (others include Shania Twain, my personal favourite Daniel Powter and many others). She is Mariah without the annoying hip-hop and the guest rappers standing beside her. The highlights here are the singles, and Say Somethin'. The other tracks don't get my attention much. This is a somewhat average effort, though I've given it one star due to my dissapointment in comparison to other Mariah albums. Mariah has a brilliant voice - she's just not using it in the best way she can"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeew","review":"Oh no!

That much is certain. Mariah has a powerful voice, and it shows. The songs on this cd are all very good, but the cd in general is somewhat disappointing. I really wanted to hear more of her voice, which can be very powerful but, in many songs, is shadowed. I have many of her previous cds, many of which are very good and possibly better than this one, but, all in all, this cd is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"She used to have a good voice, but now shes all about the money. I don't see it, I even liked her album \\"Glitter\\" better than this and IMO it's gone downhill from there. She needs to get her act together, she's riding on the teen croud now and has pretty much lost all of her traditional fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to give it up","review":"My head is pounding after giving this album a spin.

Mariah has had 16 #1s in the US - Madonna has had 12, yadda, yadda, yadda...Mariah has had two UK #1s and Madonna has had 11. That's just two countries.

HER VOICE IS SO STRONG BUT BEAUTIFUL IT'S CRAZY, LIKE I'M HEARING HER FOR THE FIRST TIME IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT HER MUSIC IN THE PAST AND (FOR WHATEVER REASON) WERE DISAPPOINTED REST EASY THIS WILL MAKE UP FOR ALL THAT.

Since the release of 1999's \\"Rainbow\\" her vocals went from powerhouse, knock your socks off to this whisper Janet Jackson crap that is completely beneath her. Time and again I complained that she needed to return to her roots and bring back that big voice everyone was so familar with. Six years later she did just that and that's why this album has sold nearly 2 million copies as of this review. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it's a little too R&B for my taste, however be certain to check out \\"Stay the Night, Circles, and Fly Like a Bird,\\" in addition to \\"We Belong Together.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good!!","review":"Two years ago at this time, Mariah Carey was a joke. Sure, she was huge in the 90's, but then... she was nothing. Mariah Carey has made a huge comeback with her new CD \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\".Featuring the extremely popular hit's \\"It's Like That\\", and \\"We Belong Together\\" (which everyone was humming during the summer), this CD is awesome! Of course, there are some songs better than others. Some songs, I have to admit, are kind of boring (\\"Joy Ride\\"), but most of them are great ballads and feature MC's awesome voice (\\"We Belong Together, \\"Mine Again\\"), and some are just plain fun (\\"One and Only (f/Twista)\\", \\"Get Your Number (f/Nelly\\"), and finally, one very inspirtation track (\\"Fly Like A Bird\\").Overall, this album is great, and probably the #1 Album of the Year.

And since those days, I have been a Mariah fan ever since. I loved every album until I heard Raibow, which to me was not the same voice I feel in love with and may me realized that she's slowly fading away with her astonishing voice. Glitter and Charmbraclet weren't much better and once again, flop albums. But Emancipation is a definate win over me. The ballads are back, the gospel like vocals have returned, and improved songwriting has emegered all over again, like rebirth.If you were a fan until the Butterfly album, then buy this! It is like a Mariah makeover and you know lots of work did go into this album. THe only downer about this album was some of the \\"club\\" tunes, for the most part, they are ok, but it isn't something that put me over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I love this CD so much. I misplaced the original one I bought from Wal-Mart so I purchased another on here. This CD has really great songs and shows Mariah's wonderful vocal talent off.

Unfortunately, she would soon make a decision that is unfortunately all too common in music today: reinvent herself to appeal mainly to the shallow mind. After a series of sub-par albums from the late 90s, \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" was hailed by some publications as \\"her best album in years.\\" Sorry, but not quite. She's in decent vocal form on \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" and a couple of others, but for the most part, she sings in a light feathery tone that sounds too much like many of the faceless posers that inundate today's music world. Plus, none of the songs (especially the ones on which she collaborates with rappers), are as deep and meaningful as anything she did a decade ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire Mariah","review":"Mariah needs to enjoy the success of this album after her last string of flops, cause once people discover how bad this album is they will never be dupped into buying a record from her again. Pushing 40 and she offers nothing new with this record. She also has nothing profound to say! Does this woman ever have an opinion? I really dont know why this album is selling but I guess when you have 10 different versions for sale, its not that hard. Its pure greed if you ask me.

She can't carry a tune with a handle on it. Her songs are all produced by hot \\"current\\" trendy producers with rappers added in. She screams, howles, and does everything else but sing. The Grammy's made a horrible decision to nominate this fat, no talent cow."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Mariah really needs to stop cashing-in on people.At first, I liked this album but since she's released the platinum edition (the FOURTH release of this album) and became a pre-madonna beyatch, i havent liked her.I wish people would see her for who she is.

I dont understand why We Belong Togther is so popular. The song spent over 10 weeks at #1 breaking almost every #1 single she has released. Someone please fill me in. The song is about as average as it can get. We are talking about a typical Jermaine Dupri production, something we hear everyday in today's music. I didnt care for her 1st single and the 3rd single is boring with another typical JD production. I swear this has to be the most overrated album all year. I dont hear anything on here for me to run out and waste money on. Her ballads are oversung and boring as ever. Mariah had a breakdown, whinned and cried about being on top, well congratulations you are here once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"What is all the hype with this album?

There are influences of old and new school r&b/hip hop soul throughout this CD. The ballads are extremely beautiful with strong vocals and simple, singable words, and the hip-hop-flavoured r&b tracks with the rappers are club bangers that were done right this time around, something mariah finally achieved to do after a few failed attempts on Glitter and Charmbracelet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Mariah amaze you with \\"MIMI\\"","review":"This album is full of amazing melodies and Shake It Off it sound like she uses 4 different voices"},{"rating":"1","title":"She has no talent!","review":"This album sounds like her previous, though some producer help her songs to sound a little different, very very little!None of these songs have personality, it's just a commercial album produced to sell and tease people!Don't waste your money and time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MC stands for Miss Copycat","review":"Riding on the coattails of Beyonce's success, this opportunist has copied Beyonce's signature look right down to the very hue of her skin complexion. Man, what a good photo-editing software can't do these days.Also to be noted is the shift from the one-word project titles. Following in the lines of Rainbow, Glitter, and Charmbracelet, this one should rightfully have been called Trash. Though escaping it's pre-determined title, the content certainly lived up to it.The songs are lyrically ill-fated, predictable, and melodically weak. Looking at this singer's (and I use the term loosely)tracking record, this album should fizzle out all together within a month or so. Then there will be the imminent dry-spell period lasting 5-6 years of which there will be numerous flops and failures. But fear not; with the advent of the new Beyonce, she will also ride in the afterglow of this new \\"it\\" girl's success, but at 43 years of age it will prove a tad difficult to pull off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monotonous sleeper album headed for disaster","review":"This is Mariah's worst performance and recording to date. The singing and music tempo is equivalent to a pregnant hog delivering 14 whining piglets. Each of the 14 songs are practically identical in sound and voice. Don't expect to hear exciting fresh high crisp singing and quick beat. It has the distasteful rhythm associated with a street punk hoodlum tapping a Casio keyboard and bobbing his head while stoned out of his mind. I imagine an organ grinder pumping out the same tune over and over while Mariah climbs up and down apartment balconies begging for money with a tin cup. This will be my last impression of her career. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old","review":"I'm not impressed by this album. It seems like a half-fast attempt at a comback. The first single was terrible and bland. It tried to be hooky, but ended being flat and repetitive. She is a talented singer, just not a talented pop/r&b artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just awful.","review":"If you're hoping for the style of music that made Mariah Carey famous, you're going to be tremendously disappointed. It appears that Ms. Carey has forever sacrificed her talents to the wishes of some rap producer somewhere, and settled for song after song of mindless drivel, set to the unoriginal, monotonous beat of a drum machine. There is virtually nothing redeeming or remarkable about this album, and the hoopla you're hearing about it is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the recording studio to sell as many copies of this as possible, before the word gets out about what a stinker it is and people quit buying it.To Mariah Carey I offer this sage bit of advice: fire your rapper managers and producers and go back to singing ballads and happy songs with a peppy beat. Anyone and their brother can rap, and it's a colossal waste of your talent to keep making such drivel as this. Get Walter Afanasieff back on your team and stop trying to prove anything. Sing, dammit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people deaf?","review":"This is another BAD album by a good singer. She needs to get to together with good producers and make some real music.

I don't hate mariah i just think she can do so much better than this crap she puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emancipation of Desperation","review":"Mariah Carey has never been able to sing; her voice sounds like a dog whistle. She sounds a little better on this album than the past two, but still makes Britney Spears look like Aretha Franklin. This album is a desperate attempt to \\"fit in.\\" After all, Mariah needs it. Her most recent tour couldn't even fill up high school gymnasiums and her record company is paying Fox News' Roger Friedman to hype the album. Poor Mariah."},{"rating":"2","title":"MiMi On Top Again","review":"Mariah Carey is back but not for the best. Don't get me wrong I like Mariah Carey and she's one of the better artists out right now but all her singles have been nothing groundbreaking. If not for We Belong Together I seriously dont think Mariah Carey would be anymore popular then she was when she dropped her lead single. It's good to see Mariah on top again but I'd wish she would've recorded quality work instead of some average overproduced redundant Hip-Hop junk to remain relevant with today's atrocious music."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAREY ON","review":"I had never heard of the word Emancipation before this album, and I am glad Mariah is finally emancipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Chapter in her life","review":"Another great album by MIMI....she does not stop makin hits fo the worldMy Scores for the songs1. 9/10...Love the words but the music is a little over filling2. 10/10....A great ballad...it went 2 #13. 8/10...Great female empowerment song4. 6/10...just didnt appeal 2 me5. 9/10...They collaborated for the 2nd time and made another great song6. 6/10...Different subject 2 make a ballad out of7. 10/10...One of my favs. it has confidence and determination8. 10/10..this is my favorite song...the beat goes great with words9. 7/10...Decent but not best10. 8/10..Love its message11. 9/10...my 2nd favorite ballad12. 9/10...dance and r+b, and rap mix...luv it13. 7/10...alright14. 8/10...great end 2 the album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a melody?","review":"This has got to be the most derivative stuff I have ever heard pass for a \\"great album\\".There is not a single memorable melody on the album.

The Neptunes, Jermaine Dupri and Kanye West had a hand in co writing the music on this album but as always, mariah with her sophisticated lyrics and smooth singable melodies and adlibs created a perfect blend of great music for the year.

Not only sing, but sing with a voice more powerful than any -male or female- in the business today. Here, on her comeback effort entitled The Emancipation of Mimi, she overall succeeds to standing applause but loses some points for the overusage of rap and hip-hop artist collaborations. She sounds her best on songs she and only another writer co-wrote as opposed to mixes featuring the likes of Nelly, Twista and Snoop Dog, songs like \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Circles.\\" Tunes like that let her show her amazing five-octave voice to full effect; listen to first single and opening track \\"It's Like That\\" and you could think she's any female R&B singer. Emancipation truly has set Mariah free, and on this record she can make any listener do so too. Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Mariah","review":"I don't know what went wrong on the BET Award Show because Mariah just couldn't get it together. I know she has perfect pitch, thus I'm puzzled. But I digress.The Emancipation of Mimi is evidence that that Mariah is no fluke; she's a muscial force that will be around for years to come. That she was able to create a CD that effectively combines today's hip hop and yesterday's R&B; is amazing. I love every song on the CD. My favorite is Mine Again.It's a welcome change to see someone who was on a downward spiral take control of her life and continue to share and bless us with her God-given talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seamless Through and Through","review":"I've been a Mariah fan for quite some time, and while each album has brought its own gems, this is the most solid record she's done. Despite collaborating with various producers, the overall sound and trackflow is seamless. Mariah lends her songwriting to several genres, but keeps the sound complimentary to the other tracks on the album.Another impressive aspect is the background vocal arrangement. They're often so complex that they're like seperate songs in themselves. Listen closely to \\"Circles.\\"The vocal energy is so high and visceral, that I can't help but groove out everytime I listen, especially to the Ripperton-influenced \\"Stay the Night\\" and \\"I Wish You Knew.\\"This album is great for parties, belting out with, and the songs are going to be incredable live.

Her first song,\\"It's Like That\\" is simple and her voice fits her well, and I like \\"Say Somethin\\" w/Snoop Dogg--it's different and funky, and when I listened to \\"Circles\\", the girl made me cry!! It touched that part of me that I didn't want to come out--it will touch your soul. \\"If you only knew\\" made me cry too...very emotional song. but my favorite hands-down is \\"Joyride\\".

I hope I am beeing helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking News: Album of the Year!!!","review":"Mariah it down for you with this record..She is emancipated. And she is free from control, opression. or the power of another as the defination of emancipation states. So to the review below asking \\"Is she was a rapper\\"? The answer is \\"YES\\" and she also so much more. The fact that Mariah can play with her lyrics and still sing chilling ballads shows how great Mimi is. Mariah's versitale and cannot be clumped into one category..It's across the board domination. Sometimes its not what you say but how you say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"big hit record for 2005","review":"mariah has the best selling album by a female...FOR 2005 not for all time.

One that will let you know she is still here. Mariah has done it, she has proven that she is what real music is all about. Can you deny her voice? Who in mainstream music right now thats hot, compares to Mariah? This CD is nice way better then the previous album. If you are looking to hear from the old Mariah there are a couple of ballads, as well as up tempo songs that get real on you. I like this CD it is hot an most of my friends like it to. Actually no one I know has said they dont like it. COP THIS ONE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"This is all I can confess... Not as brilliant as the previous ones...

It takes time for songs to grow on you, how will you know if you like it by sampling? Anyway, now that I've had time to listen and enjoy, I think this is a great come back for Mariah!! She has some nice dance, love, and inspirational songs on this album and they all are excellent! The only thing we can't do is sing along, cause this girl has a high range. Also, check out BET, they have ran a special with her singing a few old songs and new ones from the Emancipation of Mimi...Buy this cd, you will enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mariah No","review":"I like Mariah's attitude and persona and some of her songs are awesome but this CD was plain awful. Her voice these days is way too breathy and weak. Mariah used to have a moderately powerful Coloratura voice. Now her voice is considerably weaker and the songs she sings are sappy and boring.I personally think that Patti Labelle has a far superior coloratura voice even in her old age. Try listening to her instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"I bought into the hype of this album and was simply let down.

Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Mariah!","review":"These songs are average, but I gave it one star because she's such a cash-in. You can't tell me she's not. You can't tell me that when she travelled 11 places from #15 to #4 this week on the Billboard and when she went 13 places from #47 to #34 in the UK because of the Platinum edition, that she wouldn't have laughed and not said: \\"Haha, you fools. I honestly only released this fourth edition of the album for your money.\\" Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the great comeback everyone says it is.","review":"I'm truly sorry this CD was released and labeled as the comeback of the voice or whatever they chose to call it. Quite honestly this CD is nothing special. The biggest hit \\"We Belong Together\\" sounds like every other song in the category of sappy love songs. Mariah's last good CD was Butterfly, it is all downhill after that CD. Hopefully the next album will be better but until then steer clear of Emancipation... its bad... real bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album but not her best","review":"OK this album rocks the songs in it are just amazing there are no fillers and u won't skip songs her voice is outstanding as always my favorite songs are :1)STAY THE NIGHT2)WE BELONG TOGETHER3)CIRCLES4)JOYRIDE5)GET YOUR NUMBEREven though it's not her best work to date because i really think butterfly it's a masterpiece it's definetly better than charmbracelet and glitter excluding the songs through the rain and lead the way .overall u should buy it u won't regret it the only thing that's missing here it's the typical mariah ballads that i personally love like my all or can't take that away.the album it's really smooth,easy to listen has some old school rnb thing that i really like .buy it support the biggest diva of all time because a woman like this it's only born every 10000 years ...... lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD of 2005","review":"Omg I love Mariah's new cd The Emancipation of Mimi it is truely amazing.

I used to like Mariah very much, and every time that she realeased an album I bought it and I wasn't disappointed until the \\"Glitter\\" album was released, which was a flop for her as well as the movie \\"Glitter\\". The \\"Charmbracelet\\" tha came afterwards gave me an impression that Mariah was back on track, so I ran to the stores to buy \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" as soon as it came out, to my deep disappointment there wasn't a single song I liked on this CD, the beat is rather boring and the lyrics are regular. She doesn't show anymore the full potential of her beautiful voice.If you don't know Mariah Carey's music I recommend you to buy her older albums such as \\"Daydream\\" \\"#1's\\" and \\"The Greatest hits\\"!

She had a very powerful voice but that all ended when she incorporated that hip-hop/rap bullcrap in her songs. The second she had that song with Puff Pappy or whatever his name was, she was out in my book.Another thing, her attitude is so \\"better-than-thou\\". I actually find it funny that her \\"lambs\\" claim she is a better entertainer than Madonna. Mariah is not in Madonna's league! Madonna has reinvented her style time and time again, she didn't hop on any bandwagon for success and doesn't need lame guest appearances on her albums to get attention.Next!

They probably had to pay the very few critics who gave it good reviews. Most hated this album and they were right. Mariah Carey doesn't sing. Instead, she screams and screatches like a little puppy. She has employed various rappers to cover up for her lack of vocal talent. \\"It's Like That\\" might have been a good song had a real vocalist been employed to sing it..not an aging 45 year old washed up has-been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz.......","review":"I also love the old Mariah, but this album is just DULL! Yes, she has gone back to her old sound somewhat. She has also reduced the appearance of the rappers constantly present on Glitter. I'm even glad that she's gotten rid of the silly album titles (Glitter, Charmbracelet?). But overall, this just puts me to sleep! The only songs worth listening to are the two singles!! Like the other negative reviews are saying, I also agree that this sounds just like any other R&B you can hear on the Top 40. It's nothing new, nothing different. As much as I hate to say it, this is Mariah's worst album. It's so bad, it actually makes me like Charmbracelet!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry Mimi but","review":"This album sucks.

If you don't believe me, talk to someone who works at Fox news. People are fuming over there about it and the fact that their \\"entertainment reporter\\" still has a job. Ok..the album..completely disgusting. How does a diva with the greatest voice in musical History turn into anR&B; (...) who sings like a dying elephant? \\"It's Like that,\\" the first flop single, is the most desperate thing any aging diva has ever done. \\"To The Floor\\" is the only good song on the album. Unfortunately, Mariah has to pimp Nelly for this one. She pimps a different rapper on every different song. Poor woman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you guys raving over?","review":"Its most definitely safe to say that Mariah Carey's glory days are officially over! Mariah comes back with the \\"club banga\\" Ciara-influenced \\"Its Like That\\" which didn't make much of a spark as her fans would have hoped. Yeah, peaking at #15 for radio airplay may have been an improvement from what her singles did last time but its nothing to sing about. Her voice sounds whiny & shrieky and the whole album just sounds like B-sides from \\"Charmbracelet\\" & \\"Rainbow\\"...try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"she's good but not as good as Celine Dion","review":"when i heard mariah was coming out with a new album i rushed to the record store to get it.I was very upset with how Glitter, Charm like a bracelette, and the movie bombed, so i was very upset at the low notch things shes been putting out.I put the cd on and i started to cry. it a aweful noise i was hearing.I dont know what to think anymore. she let me down again and again, release after release. everythime i keep saying maybe the next time, maybe the next time. gone are her day dream days. Celine is the new day dream voice, and Celine is a lot sweeter too. So she may be good but i have migrated over to Celine's camp. And Celine's show in las vegas is amazing! Go see it if you get a chance. It will change your life! props to Celine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah - stop torturing yourself and us","review":"I had always been a big fan of Mariah and I love all her albums up to Rainbow but everything pretty much went downhill from there. Since leaving Sony, Mariah tries hard to change her image and become a R&B singer with disasterous results. This album ,which has been hailed as \\"The Return of the Voice\\" is a complete dissapointment. The first single and also first song on the album is not that bad but it would have been even better if someone else like Ashanti or Beyonce had sung it. Mariahs voice doesn't fit. Her voice....another problem. There is no denying it now : She has lost it. On the album, for example in the song \\"Mine Again\\", it screetches and warbles in ways that it almost painful. Mariah do us all a favour: Stop singing and start a family or do something else in your life. Your time as a star is officially over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Mariah's absolute best...","review":"Mariah gives us another album full of amazing tracks. I've been following her since the debut cd in 1990 and this latest one definitely ranks up there as one of her best.Stand out tracks from my first listen would be: Its Like That, We Belong Together, Say Somethin, Get Your Number, Circles, I wish I Knew and Fly Like A Bird.If you've ever liked a Mariah album or track, 'The Emancipation of Mimi' will fit right in with your old favorites.

I also love so lonely part 2 which takes over one and only its sexy and firing u can relate to. the last i will comment on because i love all of them is Fly like a bird. i not a huge fan of gospel music but as Mariah continues to perform it i would love me Mariah is my Messiah. this song shows off her voice and she lets you know she still has it she great and (i wish her well only true mariah fans would know where i got that from) lol she's my best and i will never give her up she impresses me everyday"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emancipation of Pee-Pee","review":"Mariah Carey is a shameless nut-bag whose talent can only be measured by the length of her skirts.

But that's the point, Mariah had to make an alliance with hip hop, r&b... for reviving her faded musical career... But no matter how well this CD sells, her glory moments of her first CD won't come back again. The Emancipation of Mimi is garbage, pure trash. People are blind, Mariah is not innovative. Too many \\"featuring\\" songs... Where's her personal touch, her seal? Almost all her songs sound the same. How can people recognize her as the best selling and most successful female artist of all times? That's a big mistake. Please, count the copies again, then talk. And Mariah, retire please, and take some acting classes. You're such a bad actress, and video-clips need to be believable, for they are short films."},{"rating":"2","title":"To correct the Amazon review","review":"Okay, I like Mariah and this album is great. However, I'm only writing this to correct the mistake made by the Amazon reviewer who describes Mariah as the bestselling female artist of all time. She isn't; it's still Madonna, by quite a distance. According to the OFFICIAL international figures as at the end of 2005, Mariah has sold 220 million records worldwide (albums and singles), whereas Madonna has sold 280 million. It doesn't mean Madonna is better than Mariah, but I think Amazon should try and get their facts straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this album with high hopes. I always loved Mariah Carey's older music. I loved \\"We Belong Together\\" from the moment I heard it on the radio. But then I purchased the album and realized that most of the songs sound the same- making the album slow and boring. I wasn't WOW'd. For some strange reason I can't help but picture a young Michael Jackson singing these songs instead of it being Mariah. Her pitch and tone just sounds completely different in this album. Mariah, what happened? I'm just not that impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just average&a waste of Talent","review":"Mariah Carey has One of the Most Known Musical Instruments in the History of Music Making,but sadly she hasn't gotten the right material to Highlight it Properly. by Now Mariah Carey should have gotten that Minnie Riperton or Deniece Williams Material that I know She could do.the Soul is Missing from much of Her work over time.this album is just ok at best.dime a dozen production that is slick&Polished but has nothing really to do with words&Music. Mariah could have dropped this Album from anywhere between 95-00&I ask what is the difference? the same formula.She might not ever reach the same heights she had back in Her Hey Day in the Early to Mid 90's but at least she should get better Material to showcase Her Instrument way better than this Fast-Food one stop drive thru material She is getting for a Album these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"* Very Mediocre *","review":"Mariah Carey is not at her best with this CD. Her songs all sound the same and sound like every other R&B; song on the market today. I am very upset about this. Mariah has a wonderful voice which she seems unwilling to use the way she used to (unless she can't any longer). This CD is not worth it. There is one catchy song on there (Its Like That) which in actuality isn't as good or doesn't have the depth that any of her previous number 1 hits in the 1990's had.If you like the silly, simple minded, cookie-cutter R&B; that is currently on the airwaves, then you probably will like this ... BUT, if you liked the sultry, high note and smooth style of Mariah in the 1990's watch out! Find some way to listen to this CD before you buy.

It was such a disappointment. I miss the Mariah of \\"Someday\\", \\"Vision\\", \\"Can't Let Go\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", \\"Can't Live\\"... I know that's all so 90's. But that was when she was really good and really special. Now, she sounds like everyone else doing her style of music on the Top 40. That is not the Mariah Carey that I used to like. I'm not sure why artists try that whole reinvention thing. They disappear for awhile and come back reinvented. And their music is never as good. Her vocal quality is still as good. But the composition of the songs was completely unappealing to me. I'm selling it used to recupe some of my money. What a bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential, so much crap...","review":"Mariah is a legend because of the albums she had where she used her voice and her talent. Her sound was strong and clear, not this whispery half-hearted effort she exhibits on her last few albums, this one included. Granted there is a little more of her voice on this album, but it's sparse and still not what she's capable of. Mariah sounds like so many other no-name R&B; singers on this album, and with the strength her voice has it makes it much more painful.Go back to your roots, Mariah. This style isn't flattering."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent, no interest, full of obscenity.","review":"There was not a good thing to hear on this cd. No talent, lackluster vocals and lyrics.

But if you like screaming, then I guess this would be the perfect album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen","review":"I have loved Mariah since 1995, when I heard \\"Fantasy\\". She is the coolest! I kind of lost interest in her after \\"Glitter\\" but I knew my girl wouldn't let me down! This is her 2nd best album (\\"Music Box\\" is the best). The best songs are \\"Stay the Night\\", \\"One and Only\\" and the beaituful \\"Fly Like a Bird\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Carey","review":"This is the only album that could actually rival the quality and production of her debut. In my opinion, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" really surpasses all of her others. Like I said, the only real competition is from her debut. You can hear all of the time and effort that Mariah really put into this one. Vocally, this is one of her best. She absolutely outdoes herself on this one. This collection is more mature and more polished. It's really quite spectacular. This CD should be up for Album of the Year at the Grammys. Very few people could have \\"comeback\\" and delivered on this level. Mariah is truly one of kind, one in a million. Don't miss this album. People will be talking about this one. If you weren't impressed before, it's hard to imagine that you won't be this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah is BAAAAAAAACK!","review":"I am soooo happy that Mariah is back with such an amazing and beautiful album! I was disappointed with \\"Charmbracelet,\\" and Glitter was actullay a bit underrated.But she comes back real strong with this album. For those of you who don't like it on first listen, it quickly grows on you, and you're singing all the songs. Mariah's voice is def. the focus of this album, and it sounds wonderful. I am happy to have an album to once again be able to listen to EVERY song on it and be happy. I haven't been able to do that since Butterfly (with Mariah CDs that is).It is almost impossible to pick some favorites, but if I had too they would be: We Belong Together, Shake it Off, Mine Again, Say Somethin', Stay the Night, Circles, Your Girl, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird.Wonderful is all can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emancipation is Hot Tamale!","review":"Move over Beyonce and J-lo Mimi is back!

I think the best songs on the album are \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"Circles.\\" I love how she belts those notes out. Mariah is back and she's hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is HOT!! Mariah, you're on fire..","review":"I just love Mariah. Her high notes give me the chills. This album shows off her outstanding vocal talent. It's filled with hot collaborations (especially Get Your Number, which is one of my favorite tracks) and slower songs (Joy Ride, Fly Like a Bird) Each track is listenable, this is easily one of the best albums that 2005 has to offer. This is a five star piece of work, I own the CD and have listened several times already. Forget the haters, if you don't own this, you need to pick it up now.Notable tracks: Get Your Number, Circles, Joy Ride, One and Only, To The Floor, Fly Like A Bird (but they are all great, believe me) She starts off the CD with a bang and ends with strength.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mariah At Her Best","review":"We Belong Together is a classic Mariah song. Unfortunately- that and Shake It Off are the only good songs on the CD. I really like Mariah's voice- but she just doesn't do anything interesting with this record. I wish she would take more chances and be more creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD. cheap and can't sing!","review":"Mariah just screams, no singing on this cd!.Songs are so boring and she doesn't stay in the right key!Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad, yuck for Mariah, she's lost it big time on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY BUT I'LL SHAKE IT OFF MY CD TOWER","review":"This cd is horrid! Mariah yes can sing but no can not make a good record after 96 for the life of her it has nothing to offer. It sounds thrown together. It truly is that CD that you get play it and get over it quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand all the hype","review":"I admire Mariah Carey, and I think she has a terrific voice. However, I'm baffled by all the good hype about this album. Every song sounds like the song before.Ms. Carey is a great talent. However, I think she needs to find either a better songwriter, or a producer who can find her better songs.If you listen to this album, you won't find a tune you can sing, hum, or recognize from another.That, in my opinion, is what makes a great singer--someone who can immortalize a song."},{"rating":"1","title":"emancipation from mimi !!","review":"Being a mariah fan, I've enjoyed all her previous albums because they all had something \\"mariah\\" about them. Except \\"Charmbracelet\\" which rather dissappointing but this one takes the cake. The Emancipation of mimi is mariah's emancipation FROM herself to desperately become Ciara/Ashanti/Beyonce. I would recommend their album because it's much better than mariah's. Except \\"we belong together\\" and \\"it's like that\\", there are no other decent songs. The fact is mariah is trying too hard to be \\"in\\" but in vain, and losing herself in the process. It also shows how money can't buy talent. Neptunes,nelly,snoop dog, L.A.reid and Kanye west have all worked on this album but still couldn't make it as good as Beyonce or Ciara's. truly dissappointing. mariah's best album was her \\"BUTTERFLY\\" after that the \\"glitter\\" turns into dust and \\"charmbracelet\\" was a \\"cursebracelet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"This album is Mariah Carey's thirteenth overall in sixteen years. Almost every year since 1990,Carey has put out one album. However,the GLITTER soundtrack and the two-CD GREATEST HITS compilation were released in 2001. This album is Carey's second on the Island label. The first was 2002's CHARMBRACELET. And of course,guest artists include various rap and hip-hop artists such as Jermaine Dupri and Snoop Dogg. Both artists previously collaborated with Carey for her earlier albums such as RAINBOW and CHARMBRACELET. If Carey keeps going with her singing career,she'll take home a Lifetime Achievement award just like Elton John,Billy Joel,Aerosmith,the Bee Gees and the Rolling Stones. This album is great. No fan of R&B,rap or hip-hop should be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this all about publicity stunt?","review":"When it comes to music, people always refer things such as this or that, but does anyone really know how music is emancipated? This album isn't emancipation at all. The tracks \\"I Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" are some tracks I rate 2.5 stars. The others are 0 stars. This album is just for publicity stunt, just for Mariah not to let her fans keep left-checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"She still can't sing!!","review":"It's amazing...15 years in the business and she still sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. She's trying to be all hip and cool, but instead, sounds like some girl who had a nervous breakdown..oops, um, she did. Mariah: you're washed up. Go away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Sellout in Pop Music History","review":"Jewel's last album was a sellout, but at least it is good. Mariah Carey is coming on 50 years old. Pretending that she is a 25 year old just doesn't work on this album. The worst track is \\"We Belong Together\\" in which \\"Mimi\\" overemphasizes each note and squeals like an out of control whale. I am a former \\"lamb\\" and woke up to realize that Mariah Carey doesn't have any true talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Album In History","review":"This album is horrible; Mariah is mentally unstable and has bad acne (have you ever seen her without makeup? Ew) to boot. GO AWAY MARIAH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the full CD. Buy the remixed single only.","review":"I must say, I was very disappointed with this CD. First of all, Mariah's voice sounds (to me) like she has lost those high notes she hit in her 1st. 3 albums. In this album she does try something different & for this I give Mariah a lot of credit. I just don't think this Hip Hop theme really fits Mariah's song writing. For one, Mariah doesn't have any rythm to get into this type of songs. I love the idea of the video to the cover song but it's in slow motion to cover up Mariah's inability to get into it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Like What?","review":"Listening to the emancipated Mariah takes me back to my teeny bopper days of blow pops and bobby socks. Would someone please tell Mimi she is stuck in a time warp. Not to mention, lose that ridiculous gitty smile. It's like that is sooooooo juvenile, We Belong Together drove me away from the CD player. Mariah might land at #1, understandably so, Beyonce is on hiatus and 50 had his run, so what would one expect. It's not likely MIMI will dismount her high horse and face the fact she is \\"current\\" but Ciara, Beyonce, Faith, Amerie, the young ones is what's happening. Give it up Mimi and act your age...you are knocking on 40, grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah, Please stop!","review":"I can't believe how bad this album is. What would make Mariah Carey think that this is an okay album. If she didn't listen to it before they released it she needs to sit down and see what we are going through. It just seems to get worse and worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memo to Ayon","review":"Ayon, you are in fact incorrect when you say that Mariah is the best-selling female artist ever. Madonna is, and you can just check Wikipedia and the Guiness Book of World Records if you do not believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Best album in many years. I listen to Charmbracelet back to back with the new album and what a difference. Honestly there was barely a good song on Charmbracelet and Glitter. She really sounds like she has her grove back here, not just better songs but great vocal delivery (almost sounding like her earlier albums). My only complaint is the switching from ballads to R&B. I never cared so much for her modern R&B, it doesnt sound genuine. Although I liked her earlier R&B songs (80's and early 90's albums). Had she stuck with mostly ballads here, it would have been a potential Grammy award in my opinion. But never the less, this is a great CD and YES it is a comeback! Mariah was almost dead commercially (2 bad CDs) and now the new CD GOLD in 2 weeks, pretty impressive! I hope she doesnt go road shy again, would love to hear it all live!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MARIAH IS BACK AS ALWAYS INNOVATIVE","review":"After reading most of the reviews here I can say this album is really universal. For ones the best songs of the cd are the worst for others, but almost all say the same is an excellent album.My favorite songs are We Belong Together, Stay the Night, Circles, Joy Ride and I wish you knew, but everyone has different favorites.I am very happy for Mariah, she rarely recive the recognition that she deserves, she was the first that innovates the sounds that a lot of singer use now, she is entatly to bad years after all she is human even with that voice.If you want to read a detail description of each song you will find a lot of those here, but the only sure thing you need to know is that THIS CD IS EXCELLENT, SOMETING FOR EVERYONE, ENJOY IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocally Stunning !! Mariah brings the goods.","review":"Mariah has truly bridged the gap with \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" and she takes you on a ride like none other. To put it blountly this album is full of hits. We Belong Together is one of her best songs ever, and songs like Joyride and Fly Like A Bird will make your jaw drop. Aside from the ballads uptempos like Say Something and Get Your Number will have you dancing.. As time passes this album along with her self entitled \\"Mariah Carey\\" album will be two of her biggest classics.. Mimi has already sold over 1 million copies in 4 weeks and is just getting started...Make no mistake that 15 years into an already stellar career Mariah makes you forget about the past and focus on the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"The Mariah I fell in love with as a young teen girl is back! This record is so soulful. I love EVERY track. She gives her all on each and every song. She proves that she is indeed in a league of her own. Who else can out sing Mariah? Who has her range? I say no one can compete with her in the industry right now.The hip hop isn't on over kill which is great! It adds just the right amount of vibe and collabo to make this a truly GREAT record!

Her effortlessly beautiful voice shines throughout the course of these beautiful 14 tracks. From the hit We Belong Together,the hip It's Like That, to the smooth Circles, Mariah's finest hour is displayed. Her talent gorgeously soars in every other single song, none of the tracks included are empty filler like most of what is included in hit CDs nowadays. This CD is highly recommended to Mariah fans and casual music lovers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"mariah is a SISTA hello!","review":"MARIAH is trying to look like beyonce and sold out? whatever man you did know she's half black didn't ya? all I gotta say to that reviewer is that the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice, and this CD is even sweeter, get it today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok some of y'all are crazy!!!","review":"why do I see reviews saying this woman can't sing?are you crazy?Mariah is one of the best singers out there.I saw someone wrote Mariah screams she doesn't sing,no honey that's what you call range and hitting a note.People like Ashanti,Jlo, and some of these other girls wish they could sing like Mariah.Mariah never left.Mariah has been here,but this time everything just happened at the right time.You can't always be on top forever,but I'm glad this cd is doing well because I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mariah","review":"During the early 90's you literally saved the souls of countless boys and girls. Money and success have blinded you now as you seek out a genre' that not only mocks the talent given you but the message you were meant to inspire. This album was tired and old before it even hit the stores. It reeks. Yes, it will be a money maker...but it is awful. Are you happy about that? Where are the inspired lyrics? Where is the inspired vocals? This is trite, mundane and fully entrenched in the stench that mocks your earlier achievements. You have been sinking fast, girl. It is time to re-evaluate the spirituality of your gifts and the amazing things you could be doing without bowing down to the darkness any further. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. And you were massive. You have fallen far...and it is time for you to return to your roots.

TEOM is one of this year's best, as it is slated to be a strong contender for Album of the Year, while WBT has already a sure slot for Record of the Year.

Something you listen to and absorb the words and melody.I use to listen to Mariah when she first came out but quit about 6 years ago and just started picking her up again last year or so.

Yeah the beats are going to tight, some catchy/corny hooks and some sub par lyrics no matter who wrote them. I say the lyrics are sub par because even if Kweli and pharoahe monch wrote for Diddy, you still have to have the delivery and energy of the person who wrote the rhyme. Diddy doesn't have any of the above. To add insult to injury, Diddy also has some of his minions from his everwack record label Bad Boy. Bad Boy as a label died when Biggie did. This is another lack luster release from the bad boy and his crew.

It's what made him, but \\"Last Night\\" firstly should be Keyshia Cole ft Diddy as she basically sang everything, secondly the poor girl probably had a had time singing over his tone deaf rambling in the background ever so often.

I like it, but it's lacking a little something. It's choc full of great artists that sing along with him and it's come at a perfect time considering his record label has just recovered from it's lull by bringing out Danity Kane, Cassie and Young Juc. This is a cd with appeal to non Diddy fans even, purely based on the extensive list of artists. There is Jamie Foxx, Brandy, Mary J Blige, Twista, Big Boi and Christina Aguilera to name a few.To me, the stand out songs are Tell Me, Through The Pain (She Told Me), Special Feeling and Come To Me. The something that is lacking, picks up again from song number 7 (Tell Me) onwards. That's where all the other singers come into it and give it a pop.This cd is worth listening to - it is good - but I think it wouldn't have been all that without a little help from his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diddy is doing it","review":"I enjoy listening to this cd. The different styles of music is intriguing and inviting. Last Night is outstanding...Keisha Coles is sanging that song! Diddy is no rapper, that we can all agree.

I adore artists like Christina Aguilera who managed to crank a good single but the rest of the album is boring. This artist should retire to the background and stay there. Unlike M.C. Hammer he can't dance, his popularity is market/MTV driven and his ghetto songs have no depth. The album has some great production but Diddy's poor rap skills overpower some of the tracks.

I guess I can't get over the fact that Bad Boy will never be the same as it was in the 90s. The talent level has done a 180.. Compare the old days of BB.. BIG, The Lox, Faith, Total, Mase, Puffy, hell even Black Rob.. Though some of them were more talented than others, they all had the production that bad boy came to be known for.Where are the beats and sounds that made Diddy who he is now? They're gone.. Plain and simple. He definitely is never going to be a great hiphop artist, but the least he can do is have PERFECT production on his own album. There are maybe 2 tracks on the whole thing that make you want to nod your head.. that's it.Look at Kanye... to me he isn't the best hip hop artist of today.

As a general format, the authors state their intentions to mold Tolkien's world to their own pet ideas and quote profusely while saying little that convinces. One of the essays even admits that the Buddist parallels it's spent the last few pages proposing are clearly \\"superficial\\" - why waste the print, then? Another oddity here is a collection of quotes by various noted philosophers that have nothing to do with either the themes in LotR, or, in many cases, the topics the essays address. Extremely discouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must read for LOTR fans","review":"\\"If you re a LOTR fan this book is a MUST read. Although we all know that Tolkein never wanted to write an allegory, when someone writes a book that reflects life as well as LOTR does then you cannot help but see the philosophical lessons to be learned.As a fan I always wished for more LOTR books, unfortunately there aren(tm)t any more. So, when you encounter something that is fresh and new concerning the book it is a special treat. In addition to pointing out things about the story that I did not know, as well as highlighting some of Tolkein(tm)s views on the subject, the book does well what it sets out to do. By using LOTR as an example there is a great deal to learn about philosophy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symbolism and philosophical foundations of Middle Earth","review":"Fans of Tolkien and Middle Earth who have more than a passing interest in the topic will relish Lord Of The Rings And Philosophy, a collaboratively compiled compendium by Gregory Bassham and Eric Bronson of seventeen young philosophers who examine the myth, symbolism and philosophical foundations of Middle Earth. Applications to everyday living provide a seasoned assessment of insights on good, evil, freedom and basic issues raised in the course of the Lord of the Rings. The lively tone makes Lord Of The Rings And Philosophy completely accessible to academic scholars and non-specialist general readers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I'll admit that I haven't finished this book, but it's also worth noting that I don't intend to. The essays I've read so far were not very interesting (or, for that matter, very well-written), and I have little hope for the remaining ones. What I had hoped for was a book that would use Tolkien's Trilogy to illustrate philosophical themes. What I got was more like a bunch of writers reviewing the boks in question, and occasionally commenting on some \\"(not-so) deep meaning\\".

The second half is about movies with robots. The only thing that does connect these two separate short documentaries are that of the actor Yul Brunner himself is involved with both through Westworld.This is really nothing more interesting than something you'd probably see on PBS sometime around three in the morning. I can't believe that this is actually a DVD for sale to the public. I'd find only a collection of Palmolive or Charmin bathroom tissue commercials more interesting to own as a DVD than this bore of a documentary.I love the movie \\"Westworld\\" and most all the films of Michael Crichton (except Jurassic Park, I don't know why I can't get into that film), but this documentary (and how it was titled) really made me feel deceived by my remotely candid expectation.

If you enjoy Elizabeth Berg books, you should like this one. The story is told from the viewpoint of a young, imaginative girl. It captures the feeling of life in the 60's and 70's, a time when our world was changing and becoming less innocent. This book takes you back to that time--right between childhood and maturity when we examined and tried to interpret the world around us without completely understanding motivations (but thought that we did). It's what you may mean when you say, \\"If I knew then what I know now...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Symbol of Deceit","review":"It is 1972 in typical suburban America. Politicians in the daily papers include George McGovern, Spiro Agnew, George Wallace and of course Richard Nixon. The Watergate Hotel is on the verge of becoming national symbol of deceit. On an average summer's day in an average middle-class Maryland neighborhood, a 12-year-old boy is brutally murdered. The murder itself is not the story, however. What happens in its aftermath; fear, mistrust, and the tidal wave of tragedy following a little girl's lie, is. Reminiscent of the destruction via perfidious gossip in THE CHILDREN'S HOUR or the Puritanical vigilantes in THE CRUCIBLE. Suzanne Berne transforms the safe haven of this All-American neighborhood into a wasteland of ruined lives. Remorse comes far too late. A clever first novel, certainly symbolic of the times, but hardly an uplifting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"neighborhood full of juvenile sociopaths-in-training","review":"Adolescent protagonist does irreparable harm to neighbor's life by telling lies about him and has the hutzpah to end her story by saying she \\"wishes him well.\\" Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Nowhere Fast","review":"What a sleeper!

J2SE 1.4 features much more far-reaching alterations than J2SE 1.3 featured including an amendment to the Java language specification, and many changes to the runtime environment. This is why this book is so useful to get you started with J2SE 1.4. It covers what's new and what's changed in J2SE 1.4.

It has the right blend of soft colors that make my daughters room the ultimate baby girl room! The best part about it is that it's a classic look that you won't get tired of. I love being in her room because it is so calming and beautiful.I was a little hesitant about buying it because it is a bit more pricy than some of the other bedding sets but nothing else even came close to it and the quality is excellent. It is simply breathtaking and well worth the extra money! I am so pleased with how my daughters room has come together because of this bedding along with the other Wendy Bellissimo items that are in the Vintage Teaberry Collection. I highly recommend this bedding!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"If you're a fan of the original Wendy Bellissimo line, before she sold out and mass produced, you won't be impressed.

I saw this bedding in the store first and thought it was beautiful! My daughter is 4 months old and I haven't found anything I have liked yet because everything is so babysish or too bright or too pastel. I saw this and knew that this was the one I wanted for her room. I thought the colors were perfect, very elegant and tasteful! My only complaint is that I think it is too high priced for Babies R US so that's why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful But,","review":"Unlike some reviewers, I don't question the quality of the fabrics or the colors. This is a beautiful set. The colors and fabric aare awesome, but the blanket is small and thin. It is barely big enough to cover the crib mattress. And it is soooo thin. It is basically two pieces of fabric sewn together with a ruffle. There is not any batting or anything in the middle to give it any substance. It was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way 2 much for the quality","review":"This wasn't my first baby and usually we buy the baby bedding sets for less than $200. When I saw this online I decided to break my rule and purchased the set. What a big mistake. The quality as others have said is not the best and its really sad because this is the most expensive set at Babies R US, and although when I first saw it in a catalog they described it as \\"affordable\\" which for most people it isn't. To pay $300 for just a 4 pc set is rediculous and you can get better deals and better quality by going with Kidsline. Test the quality before you buy, and before you place any of the bedding on your registry or you will regret it later. Its true what they say the colors are much different online and in catalogs than it is in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!!","review":"I love this item... I think It looks beautiful in her room. The only down fall I have with the collection is that I cant seem to find the end table in the picture. I have looked on line for hours at a time and nothing. Why would they put something with collection you cant even find?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I anxiously awaited this bedding. I painted my nursery the palest of pinks according to the description and pictures. I was registered for everything and was so excited - I'd shown everyone and just raved about it. Well, I went to the store to pick it up and almost cried. I wasn't upset over the fabric as some were. It was the colors that upset me. The description indicated pale pink and sage green, however to me, it looks like peach and the drabbest olive green I've ever seen. I understand a 'vintage' look but to me, this was just washed out and dull looking. I'm glad that I didn't order it online and I'm glad that I was able to delete my registry before people purchased items for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but not worth the hassle ....","review":"While I'm happy with the look of the crib set, I wouldn't recommend getting this set if you're interested in everything matching. We ordered all the matching pieces (sheets, curtains, mobile, hamper, etc.) -- it is now almost 8 months later and majority of the items are still not in. We're now stuck with what we have and trying to find something that matches. If and when the stuff comes in my daughter will probably be onto another set of bedding. I won't be ordering any thing from Wendy Lateissimo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly in person","review":"This set is very disappointing-- very low quality. The blanket is coarse and small. Also, the fabric seems very cheap. Not worth the money and not like the quality of the old Wendy Bellissimo sets.Very overpriced for the poor quality.

I can't say enough good things about the quality and design of the product to my friends and family. I wanted to write a quick note about some of the accessories because I read that people are having a tough time getting the accessories.

Just thought this might help those who are wanting items that are unavailable on-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness, was this ugly in the store!","review":"I fell in love with this set online. I was surprised to find it in our local Babies R Us, since I thought you could only purchase it online. Boy, I'm glad I saw it in person. The sage looked so faded compared to the online picture. Even the new ones in the package looked that way. I was really disappointed. And the rose pattern looked like something you would get at the \\"old\\" K-mart ( the way K-mart clothes used to look- for those of us who are old enough to remember). So, it's back to the drawing board for me. I would recommend looking at this in person before you buy it. It may not be exactly what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misjudged product","review":"After reading the other reviews for this product I have to say I disagree with the common rating of one star on this product. As for the coloring that seems to be the problem for some it is VINTAGE ..it says so in the name of the set. So obviously if you like the more traditional bright colors then this set isn't for you. And the fabric isn't rough it is durable unlike most of the other crib sets you find nowdays. That is the main reason I was willing to pay more for it. It is something you can save and use again if need be."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"I've read some of the reviews that said that the quality was poor, but I went to the store to see for myself and I have to disagree. They had this collection displayed on the floor and I was very impressed with the quality. The fabrics were very soft and I really liked the idea that the bumpers were all slipcovered individually. That was a really nice quality detail. I recommend checking the bedding out for yourself before making a decision, but I would highly recommend this set to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Exactly what I wanted.

I am not really a negative person but this was really a truly awful game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating Game","review":"I see some people love this game. I on the other hand, dislike it very much. Mostly because in order to make your city happy, you need money to make the city better. But you run out of money to soon and try to make some adjustments in the taxes and everything, which makes the city unhappy. And while your trying to do all that, the roads keep getting messed up and needing repairs, you have to add more police stations to keep the crime at bay, ect. Plus, if your playing with the crisis', you'll have aliens burning your hard work down, earthquakes, ect. It's just not worth the time. Now if you love a tough challenge and have nothing else you can think of to do, then go right ahead and get it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money. This is unlike the regular Sims game, which is the best PC game ever. I really can't wait for The Sims 2! Save your money for that one! It will be so much better than the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks good, but DON'T buy it!","review":"This game is extremely bad. The only good sim games are the awesome \\"The Sims\\" games. In SimCity, th only way to build homes, hospitals, airports etc... is to use the urban renewal kit! If you build a city useing the regular game it does not build buildings at all! If you choose to make an area of land residential, it does not build homes, it colors the land green! This game is horrible! When you look at your finished city, it is a huge color coded land mass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"im an idiot","review":"I gave the game 5 stars because the game is a very good game, but the problem is..I suck at using computers and I dont know crap about Dos. I thought it would be windows compatable in the sense that it would load like a windows game, but you need to know how to load it with a Dos program. i found a program called Dos box eventually but after a while.. It just isnt as good as sim city 2000 for the macintosh. Im an idiot..I just have buyers remorse...its no slight to the game.

This game truly invents its own style of play by combining elements of a spellcaster game with a twist of RPG. You play a dark sorcerer who desperately escaped a world he destroyed by summoning an evil demon. Shamed but eager to serve the Gods anew, you begin doing missions for 5 Gods. However, there is great animosity between the supreme beings, and eventually the player is forced to pick a side and subsequently destroy all the other Gods but not before finding out that there is a great evil which threatens his new world.The game is somewhat repitive, as each level involves killing enemy wizards in the same fashion, but the new environments, summons, and spells keep the game very playable."},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHH!!","review":"It keeps crashing, I cant even play.

Ricchini's debut seemed to be on that track. It seemed like it was written by a man trying to seperate his sound from Belle and Sebastian and elliot smith. On his sophomore effort it seems Ricchini is struggling to find his unique voice. The songs are catchy and well constructed but are nothing more than grade a replications of better songs. If Bill wants to seperate himself from anyone he must make it a priority to be different.

You ended up laughing, cheering and crying all on the same page.Eve reflects on the similarities between herself and a 9 year old, the sole survivor of a military style execution of the little girl's entire family. All of the principal players are there from the series, but this one draws you in like none of the previous books have done.The mystery is definitely better written, as it keeps you guessing and asking why, through almost the entire book. Roarke is enough to make my husband jealous, and me sighing with wishful dreams.This is one for the devote fans, as JD Robb (Nora Roberts) brings up other characters and other book plots into the story line. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbulent and Touching","review":"The main victim in this tale is a young girl who is so brave and strong and human she pulls on the heartstrings and is the center of this emotional tale. Eve and Roarke each face their own demons while trying to solve this crime and ensure the survivor's safety.As always in Ms. Robb's writing, this story is populated by a colorful cast of characters who are easy to love and some seriously scary bad guys.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and pleasure. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main cast members as they come into play and develop into first-rate characters. This series is additive! This is the third time I've read Survivor and I still love it.Thank you Ms. Robb!Shelley Dawn, author ofDark NightsandSweet, Sweet Jessie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Survivor in Death","review":"J.D.

But I do buy J. D. Robb in hardcover, and typically think it's worth the price. But not this time. The complexity of plot that we've gotten used to is very much missing from this book. Eve is wooden and ugly and ice cold. The other characters such as Roarke and Peabody are absolutely predictable and boring. We have to endure the dream about Eve's father once again. I hesitate to rail on, because I've gotten so much enjoyment from Robb's other books, and surely everyone's entitled to a dud. So I'll just say if you're a J. D. Robb fan, I know you have to read this book. Just save yourself some money and wait until it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"No \\"kid\\"ding.","review":"Okay, we get the picture. Ms. Robb/Roberts has stated that the series would have to end if Eve and Roarke had a child. Apparently, fans must still be clamoring for the blessed event. First we had Mavis getting pregnant rather quickly in her relationship. Now we have Eve rejecting a child in the house, reaffirming that she is not ready to have a child. What else does the author have to do? --a baby for Peabody and McNabb? --Galahad turns out to be a female and has kittens? I think this book suffered a little in the process of making a statement. Eve came across as colder than usual and the action stalled until the end of the book. Now that this is out of the way, perhaps the next installment will be a 5-star winner. By the way--I, too, would like to see a baby for Eve and Roarke before the series ends. There could be some great storylines around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series Going Down Hill","review":"As a rule I will read anything Nora Roberts writes. I loved this series at the start but I am only continuing to read this book to find out why the family was murdered in the first place. Eve needs to lighten up. YES she killed her father. Yes she was abused and still suffers nightmares over the fact. But she has been with Roarke for two years and consulted with Dr. Mira so one would think that past history does not still haunt her 24 hours a day. And why is Eve still such a witch to Sommerset? Does Eve always get to be so hard and rude because of her horrible childhood? The writing at times is so terse - Your my cop. She's mine now, etc that does not ring true and is repeatitive. And where is the romance between Eve and Roarke? I did not like it and I say - let them have a child - maybe that way Eve will soften up and the writing will lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murders in 2059","review":"After what appeared to be an interesting prologue, the next 100 pages lacked excitment; as did much of the rest of the book. Although there are some interesting events, I thought the book did not flow well. Computer searches may be the way crime is fought in the future, but I prefer more foot work in the street. I also thought there could have been less profanity. It was a bit unrealistic the way the author described the vehicles of the future as they cruise on and above the steets of New York City. To use some of Ms. Roberts (J. D. Robb's) words, I would say the this book was not the \\"ult\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"EMOTION STIRRING","review":"I read a lot of books every year.

This music makes me feel like I'm pumped full of Demerol, floating on a cloud in front of a big gay rainbow. My only hope is that no one heard me sampling those clips and assumed I was enjoying them.

What you don't know is that this man can not only rock but he has created a new band with Dan the Automator of Gorillaz fame and together they have created the most rocking new sound to have come out in a long time. From the first listen you will be up on the floor dancing and revelling in Head Automatica. It starts with a band. Litereally, with song called \\"The speed of a yellow bullet\\". By the time you get to \\"Beating heart baby\\" you realize that the vocals of Palumbo blend with Automator's keyboards and percussion in the perfect for rocking, dancing, whatever it is you will be moving your head or tapping your feet. \\"Please please please\\" has hit written all over it. It's so Hollywood.This band will renew your faith in music. Better than anything on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the party begin!!","review":"I like glassjaw but Head Automatica definitely has it going on!!

From the pretentiously melodic guitars to the senseless lyrical obsession with romance gone wrong, they where a good example of why I stopped listening to post-hardcore. I did, however, like Daryl Palumbo's vocals. But they had such soul they seemed out of place in Glassjaw.Head Automatica makes up for this. Much more fun, funky and energetic. There's enough angry music out there. There's not too much music that can be lively and enjoyable without trashy pop-sweetness.

I got the book and knew in 5 minutes that it wasn't what I wanted. In retrospect I realized that the people who recommended the book were both in construction and both lived outside of the United States. If you work in a small company, with little to no infrastructure; where PM practices are primitive at best, I think this book would live up to it's reputation. If you, rather than your organization, are new to PM I would suggest getting James Lewis's Fundamentals of Project Management which Amazon also carries, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alluringly poignant view on death","review":"I found this book to be a potent and moving tale of death, love, and sorrow. Introspective and touching, I recomend this book to anyone who has felt death around them or wishes for the impossible. This tragic story shows that in everything there is hope. I didn't want to read this book at first because I don't like books about vampires, but this book isn't about fanging people, it's about finding what you never even dared to dream for. Yet at the same time it talks of loss and struggling onward. \\"Parting is such sweet sorrow...\\" the final message of The Silver Kiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Kindle Edition","review":"The book is decent enough, but the Kindle edition is plagued with an unacceptable number of typos and errors.

After reading Companions of the Night, by Vivian Vande Velde, I thought I'd give this one a chance. Waste of money. It's overly mushy, it lacks suspense, it's annoying at times and the matter-of-fact considerations about death left me cold. Oh and the word \\"stars\\" is used just a little too repetitively for my taste. It's no thriller, nothing thrills here. And not a spark of sense of humour. OK, I might as well say it: it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"This book was horrible. I bought it with the impression that it was going to be a good read from the reviews but I was mistaken. This book was so short, the author didnt give any time for the story to grow. For example, the romance between Zoe and Simon was just pushed on with one line and not drawn out so it was like...wait did he just kiss her? Didnt they just meet? The author doesnt allow feelings to grow and get you involved in the story. The main character is so selfcenterd and whiny and she complains through the whole book about how things arent always about her. Im not exagerating. The book was very badly written. I would definatly not recomend this to anyone. EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really stretches your imagination.","review":"This book had a kind of twist.

I suppose if you listened to the other reviews you would assume its pretty good. Let me tell you it's not. Most of the reviews written are probably coming from teenage girls. If you like vampires and you think this book can cure your hunger, I urge you to look somewhere else. Perhaps I might reccomend Anne Rice's vampire novels, Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\", and Bram Stoker's original vampire novel \\"Dracula\\". All of those books do what this book does but a thousand times better. The author has absolutely no writing skills and struggles to keep the plot moving. There are whole sections of the book which drag on for ages with nothing happening. You could easily skim the pages and pick up 99% of the story. There isn't much substance. If you're looking for a romantic vampire love story, I urge you to look elsewhere. This book is a trainwreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"I really like Annette Curtis Klause's writing style. I loved the characters and the angst.

Everything I look for in a book. The only thing I really didn't like was the way it ended. It makes Simon look selfish in his decision. I won't say what he did. You have to read the book to find out.

The chapter set up (every other chapter was in the perspective of a different character [Zoe or Simon]) was interesting and was one of the things i liked but the things that i did enjoy were few.

(In other words, the vampire.) Clause takes the world of cliched vampires and molds it into something she can work with, which in the end is more believable than any Bela Lugosi. (Spelling?)

I would say for an adult it is a fairly quick read. The story is great!

I didn't have a card there, but I came by every couple of days and read some pages until I had it finished. I totally recommend this book to anyone. It's a little contrived for you adults out there, but there a special romantic air to it.

Anyway, every time I find the \\"perfect\\" blanket, I snatch it up! This blanket even puts the $66 Petunia Picklebottom blanket to shame. The front of the Vintage Teaberry blanket has a texture almost like a faux rabbit fur, albeit not as long. The reverse side looks like a fine terrycloth but feels as soft as angora.In addition to being beautiful and supremely soft, it washes extremely well too. I think it looks exactly like it did before it was washed minus the spit-up of course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real travesty. Sorry","review":"OK - I'm a huge Pratchett fan, but this book went wrong horribly. It takes the form of two stories which have absolutely nothing to do with each other and finishes with an appaling ending which has no relation to the rest of the book. However, plot aside, this is extremely funny reading as ever - it's just that the story itself isn't up to scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat of a disappointment","review":"Compared to most of his other books, this one is disappointing. Maybe funny to self-depreciating Aussies, to the rest of the world's citizens this book offers little to laugh out loud about.

Better luck next time; we know he CAN do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"There are numerous books in the discworld series that I have enjoyed and some that I loved reading (eg. Hogfather and Guard,Guards). The Lost Continent is not of them. In fact, I have not liked any of the Rincewind novels that I have read. I found this one rather excruciating actually. It was cliched and it was dull. I am surprised by the positive reviews it has received here. Different strokes for different folks I guess. In future I will stick to the guards and the witches."},{"rating":"1","title":"With Any Luck, the Last Rincewind Book","review":"This was the first Pratchett book I read, and my original review is on Amazon; I still stand by it, but have revised my rating downward after reading the rest of the Discworld novels. It is funny in parts and full of pop-culture references, but does not hold together as a story. There isn't much plot, or, rather, there is far too much to pay attention to. Rincewind is not a character in this book so much as an excuse to roam around Australia; the wizards of Unseen University show up, but if you don't already know them, or even if you do, you'll find their characters quite poorly differentiated. _Interesting Times_ and _The Light Fantastic_ are better Rincewind novels, but I would recommend spending your valuable free time reading the the City Watch or Witches Discworld novels instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"Funny in an infantile kind of a way, this book. In other words, Pointless and Silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read","review":"Keep them coming please. I enjoyed this trip to the world down under - or down over, or almost to the edge or wherever it ends up on the Discworld. I enjoyed the language from \\"down under\\". Terry Pratchett is always entertaining and I look forward to his new book Carpe Jugulum which should be out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really quite good","review":"Enjoyable, of course, but slightly sloppier at times than some of his other books. The two plots only come together at the very end (which is annoying), and in a very discreet manner, so as to prevent you from noticing. Still, I laughed harder at bits of this book than I have at any other Pratchett book, so it couldn't have been that bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but slipping","review":"Pratchett's diskworld series is vastly entertaining, but the latest offering is running out of imagination. The plot is bizzare (OK all Pratchett plots are bizzare, but this one is close to random) The main character, Rincewind, doesn't really develop, just more of the same that we've seen before. It seems more like a series of somewhat related short stories (the part about the wizards on the island of the god that doesn't know about sex doesn't seem to have any relevance to the main plot at all)Equal Rites was one of the funniest books I ever read, The Last Continent is set in the same mileau, but just isn't up to Pratchett's earlier standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"sub-par storytelling for once","review":"It is hard to believe that this book comes from the same author whose work has always been characterized by superbly constructed storylines and very witty dialogue. This story, unfortunately, has neither. There are two loosely connected storylines, one centered around Rincewind and containing all the wit and wisdom of a draft script for Crocodile Dundee part IV; the other one starring the wizards of Unseen University that will leave the reader as confused about the point of it all as it does the principal characters.Mr. Pratchett is to be commended for wanting to put out a new Discworld novel each year. But if the spirit for once doesn't move him, we'll gladly wait a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizards! More Wizards!","review":"Even if you take out the entire A plot, which is Rincewind on XXXX, you are still left with a magnificently funny B plot concerning the head faculty of Unseen University and some travels through a spatial distortion in a faculty member's bathroom. The Archchancellor & co. are always very funny, but Pratchett gives them their head in this best-of-all-Discworld-novels (IMHO and that's \\"up to this one\\" because I haven't read any that came after this). The Senior Wrangler finds himself humbled (and more) by the accidental presence of Mrs. Whitlow, the housekeeper. The Bursar is having the time of his life out here, and seems to be a lot more sensible than in recent books. And Ponder Stibbons spends all his time (as usual) trying to make the rest of them see sense.It got a bit confusing at the end, when the two plot lines came together, but then, I don't read Discworld books for plot, only for characterization and escapism. I really loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Worries","review":"It probably is strange to see how some people only give the book 2 stars and find it a big disappointment, while others say it is his best one yet... Terry writes far more than 1 book-a-year which sometimes shows in his work. If you are a die-hard Discworld fan, you can't help noticing that Pratchett is getting less original all the time. But he has to repeat things, because non-Discworld fans have to be able to read the books as well. It is pretty weird to assume everone knows about a world standing on the back of a turtle; these things need to be explained over and over again. BUT in this book Mr. Pratchett doesn't write about most of his 'clichees', but about an entire new continent (XXXX for the fans) and still people (Discworld-fans!!) complain. A bit australianish as the cover says, but still very nice to read.Still no worries eh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"G'Day","review":"As an avid fan of Terry Pratchett I find it hard to give one of his stories a less than glowing report. Unfortunately with the last continent I am faced with either telling the truth or lying to myself that this book is anything more than just OK. I guess as an Australian I will be more picky about detail than other readers who are not as familiar with Australian colloquialisms but as other reviews here have stated the story meanders aimlessly and seems to only exist for the insertion of \\"Ozzie Cliché's\\". Pratchett like any good writer seems to have done a lot of research into his focus topic but missed one vital point that all Australians will see. \\"G'day\\" is only used as a greeting. He has Rincewind and other characters using it as a parting comment. The opposite of \\"G'Day\\" is \\"Ooroo\\" in the classical sense and today of course it is \\"Seeya\\". I apologize to Mr. Pratchett for being such a pedant but hey it's my country right."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIZARDLY WOES","review":"As far as I'm concerned, panning Terry Pratchett is tantamount to blasphemy; I enjoy his writing and have recomended him to others. But \\"The Last Continent\\" was a tremendous disappointment. Rincewind stumbles his way to a plot resolution about five pages before the book concludes, and although this is usually the case his antics throughout the book had nothing to do with said resolution in this instance. The UU wizards are more one-dimensional than usual; with anywhere from six to eight of them involved in each scene it's difficult to identify with a particular one. A bright spot in the tale is the emergence of Ponder Stibbons as a legitimate character. His growth in the story is the only real development we see. \\"The Last Continent\\" is not the author's best effort; check out \\"Small Gods\\", \\"Reaper Man\\", and \\"Men at Arms\\" for true evidence of Pratchett's prowess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst of Discworld","review":"I honestly couldn't believe how bad this book was. Rincewind ismy 2nd favorite Discworld character (Death), but this was nothim.It started out good, with the usual Pratchett \\"I wish I woulda thoughta that\\" imagination. But I don't know, it seemed to me that after the first 50 pages or so ...he was the only one who thought this stuff was funny. I love the DW books with the wizards, too, but these were not them either. There are a few parts where Pratchett just goes on and on and on and on about something that stopped being funny 5 pages ago.Worst of all, the plot is erratic. There are way too many things going on which aren't ever explained. That's not like Pratchett either.A few good jokes (one particular I was in pain laughing so hard), but that's it. Sorry Terry, you missed badly with this one. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really standalone","review":"The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be \\"Moving Pictures\\".Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Didn't Get It","review":"I have read and re-read this book, but I just didn't get a whole lot of enjoyment out of it. Perhaps it is because I am an American and not familiar with Australia? That has to be it, because other than that, I have deeply enjoyed all of the other Pratchett novels and look forward to each publication with bated breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Australians only","review":"I just finished reading all of the Rinsewind novels and this was the only one that I didn't like. It was full of obscure Australian jokes that only an Australian would understand. The plot was often warped in order to make one of these jokes, so if you don't \\"get\\" the joke, all you have is a warped plot. I found an \\"annotation\\" file on the internet that explained these jokes, but jokes are much less funny if you have to have them explained (the annotation file is on the l-space web - do a search on \\"l-space web\\").This book can be safely skipped without missing any of the bigger picture that carries across novels.I've rated this 2 stars, rather than 1, since it IS a Terry Pratchett novel after all, and even poor Terry Pratchett novels are better than the average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent continuation of the Discworld.","review":"As I am a die hard Discworld fan hence my email address I fully enjoyed this book but I was a bit worried about the reemergence of Rincewind as you can only use a character so many times before it becomes monotanous but these doubts were but to rest but a hugely funny book with many characters well known and loved being brought in to keep the tale singing. But with a slightly obscure and confusing story every so often it may lose a reader or two especially if this is their first discworld novel but to those who love discworld carrying on reading it is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love all of the classic Aussie references mad max especially and the vitamins sandwiches.

At long last a superb collection!","review":"This is a book for which I've waited decades, having grown up on the Kubert DC books. Very well made and edited, this collection of DC Tarzan issues would go along quite well on the shelf with DC's Archive books. Whether you are a Tarzan fan or an afficianado of DC's Silver Age, you would do well to check out this book. Of course, if you are a fan of both, I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir, and you have already acquired this wonderful edition Dark Horse has offered us. Buying this was a no brainer, and my only question was why it took so long to get published, when the Manning stuff had already been reprinted years ago. If only those had been released in a volume as beautiful as this! Perhaps it's not too late to get the Horse to release the Hal Foster strips in a similar fashion to this Kubert collection. Are you listening, DH?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient examples to be useful","review":"I use this book as a weight on other books.

I looked at \\"Java in a Nutshell\\" but now you have to buy three books. This book covers JDK 1.3, the javax.swing package, and has hundreds of short examples. The java.io package examples are especially good. The book also has a very good chapter on Java Beans. The index is outstanding. It is 60 pages long and is divided into two parts, a general index and one for classes. Because its only one book, it doesn't cover everything in the J2SE JDK 1.3, but as a reference book that covers the core Java it's great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy Book","review":"I really like this book and find it very useful. This book doesn't claim to be a tutorial, but it's actually a pretty good one. I'm still learning Java, and this book has helped me to learn things that weren't covered in my courses. Unlike many Java books out there, the writing style is very clear. The examples (and there are lots of them) are short enough so you don't get lost when going through them, and yet they are all standalone code so you can run them yourselves. It's a good way to get a feel for what the classes and methods do. The chapter on Java Beans is very good. I thought a Bean was some mysterious thing, but this book explains them very clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's missing?","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. For someone quite experienced with Java it might serve as a good tool for jogging the memory. When you are in the process of discovery it is a very difficult book to use. The index and the table of contents center around classes, not topics. If you don't already know the classes count on wading endlessly back and forth through this book. For the programming I was doing the reference was very incomplete, even regarding the basics. I found references on the Internet to be much more helpful than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging depiction of a future where their government mandated implants secured in every American citizen's body","review":"The Cattle by Greg M. Sarwa is the chilling tale of the \\"Real ID Act of 2005\\" and an engaging not-so-futuristic depiction of a future where their government mandated implants secured in every American citizen's body. Grippingly depicting the intricacies of the \\"Real ID Act\\" and the United States National Identification System, The Cattle carries readers through the entire process as systems are developed and tested in a sense of the \\"Mark of the Beast\\" lore. However, the \\"Mark of the Beast\\" includes a greater agenda than a collectively identifying every person. The Cattle slowly reveals the true intent behind the technology and public policy. The Cattle is very highly recommended reading for its vivid writing and outstanding predictive interpretation of a quite possible American future if we are not diligent in being aware of today's political trends and technological possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big hope. Bigger letdown","review":"I had big hopes for this book. It sounded like it would be a great story. However, it fell flat quickly and never got up.It is obvious that English is not Mr. Sarwa's first language. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but the dialog suffers because of it. To say that the dialog comes across as cheesy would be an understatement. The dialog is just too forced and unnatural.The book is too short and everything happens before you even get a chance to know your characters.I don't know where all these 4 and 5 star reviews came from. Did they read the same book? Maybe I got shipped only half of the book?I think had Mr. Sarwa spent more time on this book it would have been a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"History can be interesting","review":"I ordered this book because the author is my cousin and I found it to be a fascinating account of the early settlers who migrated across country. It gives a lot of insight into the way of life that most of us can only imagine. Our forefathers were very resourceful and life was hard beyond belief. They walked across the Appalachians before wagon roads were built and carved homes from the wilderness while fighting indians and the British. I can only guess at the desperation or was it pioneer spirit that would drive people to take their families across unknown territory and face such dangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"just aight","review":"Donell Jones peaked with his \\"Where I wanna Be \\" Album&that seems a long,long,long time ago now. back then when his cut \\"U know what's up\\" was getting much play Usher his then LaFace Labelmate was in his video like a extra. talk about time changing things? fast forward to now&Donell has this album out which for the most part sounds like a artist just going through the motions to get out of a Contract. not One song stands out here. he is being forced to work with outside writers&Producers&it ain't really him&you can tell. vocally He still is good,but the material leaves alot to be desired on a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is an excellent 4th album from Donell Jones.

Being a big Donell Jones fan I have given some time for some of the songs to grow on me, but that is the problem with this CD---it had to grow on me where all 3 of his previous CD's I took a liking to from the first time hearing it. Usually I take to Donell Jones slow songs in an instant, but with this CD my favorite songs would have to be track 2 and track 5 and those are probably the most up-tempo beats on there....He did an alright job with this CD and anybody who is a Donell Jones fan like me would purchase it to add to the collection.

So I am not going to say whether to buy it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"ain't really feeling this joint","review":"I'm surprised that this CD has gotten so many great reviews. Upon listening to it, it fell flat. I just wasn't feeling none of the songs. It seemed that there was a lot of filler tracks on this album. And the lyrics to the songs weren't that great either. The only song I liked was \\"I'm Gonna Be\\". That song reminds you of something Usher might do and the lyrics and the beat to it were real nice.Maybe it's just me but I really didn't think this CD was great. I like Donnell Jones but this CD by him was a little dissapointing. The album titled \\"Life Goes On\\" is the one to own by DJ. That is one of his best and that CD was good from beginning to end (some real good R&B;). Even though other people like this CD, I really don't recommend it.

This book has a great intro explaining what Microsoft is trying to do for developers with the .NET framework as well as how and where they suggest it should be used.After the first three chapters, I recommend treating this as a reference book and not trying to read straight through the rest. For example there are chapters on migrating to dot net in general, migrating from VB 6 to VB.net, web services, and .NET remoting to name a few.As far as a reference book, it focuses on explaining the bigger picture of how to handle common chores. This is not a detailed reference for the classes in the .NET framework, but the ultimate reference for that is in the .NET SDK or VS.NET help."},{"rating":"1","title":"The filmmakers should be sent to Evil's City!","review":"Evil's City is another badly made shot on video horror film. What makes it worse is the fake morality message that's added to the movie (like it isn't bad enough being a straight forward horror film). What do you get when you cross a balding big lunk, an annoying woman, a teased lesbian scene, three co-ed dorks, a company of fat soldiers, a mob of lame looking zombies, a wannabe gothic acting priest and a balding aussie dressed in black walking thorugh the mountains of California?

It's comfortable to use, looks cool in operation and offers a very, very fast response. I am not a gamer, but wanted a mouse that offered more precise mouse movement and clicking capability. This mouse provides that level of functionality. I've had to rachet down the sensitivity settings for my own personal use. But, you will get use to a higher level of responsiveness after using this mouse for a few days. The performance is dramatic when compared to the much slower mouse I use at work.

It has become my primary gaming mouse. Between adjusting the speed of the pointer on the fly, all the programable buttons, and the very nice response, not to mention it never goes into a hibernate mode (my other mouse will have a brief lag before responding if it sits still too long), this mouse gives you a little bit more of an edge in gaming. It isn't going to suddenly make you a pro, but it is a good piece in the puzzle to become very good. I still use my MS intellimouse for general surfing, but I use the Diamondback exclusively when I game.Pros:-Very sharp looking-Many programable buttons-Nifty features-Works for leftiesCons-Side buttons are inconveniently sized and located-A bit smaller of a mouse than I prefer"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This mouse is very smooth and everything about it is great. Razer used very nice material for the mouse so you get a good feel to it. The shape of the mouse is great [unlike some mouses you find in stores, they have weird shapes to fit your hand]. It comes with a program that allows you to set the sensativity of the mouse [the precision, how fast the pointer moves, and the scrollwheel's speed]. There are 7 buttons, which is amazing. I play lots of fps games and this mouse is def one of the best I've used. It takes some time getting use to it, but that's nothing to worry about. I was expecting for the whole mouse to be glowing [more lcds], but it turns out there's only 2 lcds in the mouse, but that's ok because it still looks good.

It is also customizable. The big draw back is that the mouse is a little too narrow and small. You get more stress on your wrist, because you can't rest it as well on the mouse.

Giorgio, in my humble opinion, crafted the Donna Summer brand of electro-disco from having lived in germany alonsgide those techogeniuses Kraftwerk in the early 70s--and we got \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" and \\"Spring Affair\\" - which were great! A lot of filler on this commercialized disc from Casablanca, who were hawking disco at the time as if it were meth (oops, guess it was).Chase is classic, though.

You can't listen to this music and be depressed. Trust me I tried to be down at work but couldn't help it. The folks at work thought I was going crazy with my small dancing outbusrts!

The range and depth are good for the beginning series that Wrox(The Red Book) puts out. The book progresses so that even a novice web programmer can learn the fundamentals of ASP.NET. However, I was unable to give the book 5 stars due to some lack in details in typos. Even with a few mistakes, (authors are human), the content of the examples is excellent. If you have any problems with an example it's always good to check or post new entries to the book errata section on Wrox's own site. Also, if you are trying to learn all about C# you would be better off purchasing a book that deals only with C#. This book's title gives you exactly what it says and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Wrox Press books.

It introduced ASP.NET well and brought me quickly up to speed. As a reference, however, this book is sorely lacking. There is no definitive list of all the ASP.NET server controls and their properties for instance. There are only a couple examples of SQL Server connectivity, and the configuration chapter is almost dead last - long after many topics and examples which require knowledge of configuration are covered. I frequently felt left in the dust. I think it is a typical problem of Wrox books. With so many authors it is hard for there to be a consistent message and progressive flow. Different authors assume different levels of knowledge when it gets to their section of the book. The result is a jarring experience that often left me feeling left behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"CODE DOES NOT WORK!!","review":"BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE.

That they're all still sharing an apartment together 30 years after Harvey Nash (now Nash Harvey)dumped oldest sister, Adele, on the evening of their engagement is perfect irony. From their setting up empty glass bottles inside their apartment door as an inexpensive burglar alarm to the surprising love lives of each of them, you can't help but fall in love with this unusual family. Nash Harvey is the character you love to hate, who picks up women at the drop of a hat, and has never once committed to anything but his reflection in the mirror. He tries his charms on each of the sisters and the results are hilarious. Great book and wonderful, sassy characters!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my least favorite Lipman book.","review":"It is hard to believe this was written by Elinor Lipman.

I definitely DO NOT recommend it. Try any other Lipman book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much substance","review":"This was the third Elinor Lipman book that I have read this summer and this was the least interesting of the three. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Inn at Lake Devine' and 'The Way Men Act' but was bored with this one.

Since Harvey Nash had no redeeming qualities I found it difficult to care about his character."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"I read the Inn at Lake Devine and loved it.

Even the thoroughly revolting Nash is irresistably slimy. The three sisters are so acutely drawn -- each one has her own clear and definitive personality, yet the tie that binds them together--and brother Richard--is strong and touching. I was moved as often as I laughed out loud at the struggles of the sisters to make connections in their lonely world. My main complaint--as with all Lipman's books--was that the story had to end.

In this title one man comes back almost 30 years later to apologize to the woman he jilted at the alter. His return leads to some comical and touching situations. As I read I thought this poor guy... he really can't help himself.The three Dobbin Sisters live together. They still line up old milk and soda bottles at their front door for an alarm system. But don't let the old habit fool you because when it comes to relationships these ladies are as modern as they come. Adele is the jilted bride of long ago. She works to raise money for the Public Broadcasting Station. Nash is the outlaw groom returning to make amends. He is a man with a weakness beyond his control. The reader will meet Adele's sisters: Kathleen who owns a lingerie shop and Lois who works for the Commonwealth and there is her brother Richard who has yet to marry either.The author has written a mature novel about love, sex, romance and learning the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed!","review":"I had often heard what a wonderful author Elinor Lipman is, so I picked the \\"Ladies Man\\" as my first book by her to read.

Unfortunately, I'll never get those hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I picked up this book drawn to it by its cover and reviews. There was absolutely nothing noteworthy about it. The characters were ridiculous. I cannot understand how anyone could call this book charming or witty.

However, this was an extremely silly, pointless novel. The characters were shallow (especially the male) and totally uninteresting. I kept on reading it and hoping it would improve, but it didn't. What also made it uninteresting was the author's writing style of always using the present tense. I found this annoying after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I didn't quite feel Elinor Lipman got it together here. The plot was, at best, sketchy, the characters were shallow, and the dialog laked much of her usual sparkle. Writing in the present tense was not easy to adjust to, and this took the shine out of the first two chapters until I was able to adjust to it. I have to say, that I struggled a bit. The Ladies' Man was very easy to put down.Maybe the next one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake!","review":"What a nasty piece of work is Elinor Lipman's book - as well as the title character. Why the author thought that a reader would or could care for such an unappealing, slimy toad is beyond me. Oh, I know - an anti-hero! But, if memory serves, an anti-hero should \\"play against\\" positive foils; however, this book is peopled with folks who run the gamut from self-absorbed to whiny. There is not one likable, nay mature, person revealed. (Oh well - maybe the youngest sister and her boyfriend.) It's the story of a liar and his relations and relationships with as sorry a bunch of unappetizing characters to appear in fiction for quite a while. I usually like Lipman's work - hence my purchase of this one.

The reason is simple: Harvey Nash (or Nash Harvey as he later styles himself), the \\"ladies' man\\" of the title, is such an awful bounder you can't help but delight in his story! That is no small authorial feat. This book has made me into a serious Lipman fan. I intend to read all 3 of her other books and eagerly await her next one.

One is that there is no real on/off switch. If you have it plugged in, and the heat dial at minimum, it still heats. That's important to be aware of. It's not your ordinary toaster, which doesn't do anything unless you push down the slider. Second problem is MUCH less important. The clip that's supposed to hold the top and bottom together in storage is totally worthless. Just don't depend on it.That being said, it works very nicely as a panini press. The lid is flexible, and has a heat proof spot where you can tilt it to accomodate the thickness of your panini. The heat dial is generally accurate, so if you follow your instincts or the little cookbook, things turn out well. It's easy to clean up.

I say, once this set is released, and all the fans get their hands on it, that this be taken out of syndication? I mean really, what's the point? It's better without commercials.

I tested this with multiple DVD players which have never given me problems before. If you check other reviews this quality control issue is pretty common with the DVDs from this box set. From what I can tell the quality control on the original season sets is much better.2) Disc 28 was missing and I got two copies of Disc 29 instead.3) The corner of the collector's box was broken/damaged when i received it.4) The discs are spread out through 6 scratch-prone cardboard-like sleeves for each character instead of by Season. Cute, but i don't want to have to open up a damn episode guide and look up the episode number to figure out which season i'm about to watch, while worrying about scratching my DVDs when taking them in and out of the sleeves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched discs won't play without skipping","review":"This set has disc holders made of heavy cardboard that WILL scratch the discs as you take them out and put them back. I just received this set from Amazon today, and the first disc I started watching was scratched and it skipped quite a bit. I'm shipping this back immediately. This packaging is very poorly designed.On a side note, the size of the box is also less than ideal. It's doesn't fit well with other DVDs on a shelf.I'm going to buy the individual seasons separately instead! The individual seasons are properly packaged with slim plastic disc holders. Plus, they are the size of other DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Box Set...","review":"All I have to say is buy the individual seasons. I thought this was going to be a great buy... great price and compact! However, I have not played one disk yet that has not skipped, stopped playing, or returned to the menu in the middle of an episode. I have tried this on multiple DVD players and it does the same thing on every player. I am extremely disappointed with this box set and wish I would have bought the individual seasons.

The colors were faded, the dvds were packed in little plastic bags and it was missing all the extras that the set comes with.BE AWARE WHEN BUYING THESE.

The first release with the special box is sold out through official channels. Sure, you can find copies in the Amazon third party sellers.

I have ordered items in the past via standard shipping, and have generally received them in a timely fashion. That was not the case with this purchase. The description read \\"NEW.\\" However, upon receiving the item, the box was damaged in a corner, all of the disks have imperfections, which leads me to beleive the DVD's were in fact not \\"NEW\\" as listed in the description, and were probably \\"USED.\\" Also, the DVD's skip when played. I order from Amazon quite regularly and this is the only time that I have been completely dissatisfied. I couldn't return the product because there was an all sales final policy in place. What really upsets me is that the purchase was a birthday gift, some gift. I highly recommend purchasing from another seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Series","review":"I received my order ahead of the date stated which was a great surprise as this was a gift item. The details of the product did not do the actual item justice. The series arrived in an excellent collectors box and the 10 seasons are carfully split between the six characters of the show; with each containing a little over two seasons. Each of the character cases has their current picture on the front and their picture during the tv series on the back. In addition, the character cases are hard bound and sturdy with sleeves for each of the cd's appointed to that character. Also included in the series box is a very nice soft cover book of pictures and stories from the show and the characters. This turned out to be an excellent keepsake for a beloved tv series and was full of extras that were unexpected. It is a very nice package and I would highly recommend it to any fan of the Friends Series. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Cheap","review":"There is no guide to tell you which episodes are on which disc. It's cheaply put together.

Second Spin didn't share such enthusiasm and 2 days later, sent the item anyway despite numerous emails. When you consider the fact that I live in Japan and would have to wait a month for it to arrive, you can understand my indifference..The emails I received from the company seemed to be computer generated and served only to placate. I thought of phoning, but no phone number.

So I called amazon and they sent me a new one, but those dvds were just the same as before. So I returned both of them and got my box set elsewhere.

Not to mention the fact that some discs had the end of one season and the begining of the next on it. There should have been some kind of order to the discs, as well as the season number on the discs so that I dont have to calculate disc 20 and what episodes will be on it and what sesaon that may be.

Although in my opinion Toni Braxton's first two albums were great and her last two albums were crap, this is still a nice collection of her work.There are classics from her first album like \\"Breathe Again\\", the live version of \\"Seven Whole Days\\", and her duet with Babyface, \\"Give U My Heart\\". From there it's on to tracks like \\"You're Makin' Me High\\", \\"I Don't Want To\\", and \\"Just Be a Man About It\\". There are also two unreleased songs: \\"Whatchu Need\\" and \\"Little Things\\".Unlike other reviewers, I'm not mad that \\"Spanish Guitar\\" isn't on here because I think that song is dumb. But I think it's obvious that \\"Hit the Freeway\\" is on here only because La Face Records wanted to ensure that there was at least one song from every proper album that Toni did. Anyway, if you're feeling nostalagic about Toni Braxton, then pick this collection up.Anthony Rupert"},{"rating":"1","title":"She sounds like a man!","review":"Toni Braxton is in my opinion the black equivelant of Cher, except not as many gay fans. My mom and sister both love Toni Braxton but I seriously dont see why. She is suited to a gay lounge at best. Un-Break My Heart was totally played out and so was Youre Makin Me High, He Wasnt Man Enough and Breathe Again. The rest really arent hits, just fillers. I am a Neptunes fan so I enjoyed the beats of Hit The Freeway, but the mannish vocals ruined it. There is a reason why Tonis albums are flopping lately: no one wants to hear from her no more.

This, the fifth of the Doc Ford series, comes as quite a shock. It is not only boring, boring, it is utter drivel. Here White seems to have changed his style, his informative passages feel out of place and strained, as indeed is most of the book.Doc Ford is changed, Tomlinson is changed. They come over far more believable and better when in Florida, not in Cuba where this novel is set for the most part.Sanibel Flats is also a Doc Ford novel set out of Florida. I didn't enjoy that one either, but it's not drivel.I think White, in North of Havana, has attempted to elevate his writing onto a higher plain and achieved the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"American propoganda","review":"Although the book , as usual, holds your interest and is geographically well researched.

Although the word hadn't yet entered everyday language when William James published Pragmatism in 1907, the philosopher believed its doctrine had virtually become common sense in twentieth-century America. For James, pragmatism was a specific philosophical alternative to essentialism and foundationalism and argued that ideas are meaningful only insofar as they have practical consequences in concrete human experience; however today pragmatism has come to denote merely a general willingness to compromise principles, even to the point of selfishness or irresponsibility. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Pragmatism is a valuable corrective to modern uses of the word, since the voice that speaks in its pages embodies precisely the opposite values from the pejorative senses the word has acquired.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A disasterous turn for American Thought","review":"The notion that the truth of an idea is contingent upon it's \\"cash value\\" has been one of the more ridiculous turns in the history of thought (thus, by James' own criteria, the idea is \\"false\\"). The premise that human experience is all there is can lead to nothing but such an absurdity. An Aztec Gods existence was \\"true\\", because a belief in such a God kept one from being beheaded. There's cash value for you. Any intelligent college freshman can see right through James' loony theory, until the authority of the professor makes its impression upon them. The earth is round now and it was round when everyone believed it was flat, the \\"cash value\\" of the belief notwithstanding. It should have been titled \\"The Convenience Theory of Belief\\".Given one extra star for at least being well written sophistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth happens to an Idea","review":"I love pragmatism, although I fall under what can only be described as my own blend of the best philosophical points.

As such it is an important book for any philosopher to read. A pity then that that the publication is so poorly published and typeset. It is clear that this book was set using a common word processor and that the user was not even able to control the size of type from one paragraph to the next. The inclusion of capitalisations in text is very distracting and interrupts the flow of the reader, which is further made difficult by the use left aligned text as though this was little more than a typed out draft for a letter. Even common typesetting practices such as allowing sufficient linespacing are absent.

His version of this song is , in my opinion , easily the best of the many versions which I have heard ; I feel that Frank Sinatra's better-known version pales by comparison ! I would admit that the other 17 songs on this CD fail to match \\" Poinciana \\" , but I certainly like \\" Mine and Mine Alone \\" , How Many Stars Have To Shine \\" , \\" Tango Of Roses \\" , and \\" Sudden Fear \\", and the musical arrangements on all the songs are interesting , intricate and very redolent of the early to mid 1950s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hum-able Beginnings","review":"What a happy surprise! These very very early recordings of the very young Steve Lawrence are a revelation.Every song--many unknown to most--is wonderfully sung and arranged, but there's magic afoot: you'll hear always at the center of each selection the sonorous warm masculine tone that matured into one of the greatest singers of his time-- who years later recorded one of the very finest classic male vocal albums--\\"Steve Lawrence Sings of Love and Sad Young Men.\\"But here you'll hear young Mr. Lawrence trying his early wings--with influences and inflections from Tony Martin and Johnny Ray and Bing Crosby.

This book is not a primer on COM, but the author does a good job of covering the basics from a VB perspective. This book is a very practical hands-on look at the MTS explorer, development for the MTS environment, and MTS debugging. The chapter on debugging MTS is the best I have ever seen -- he points out the different ways of using VB to debug and the pitfalls, plus ways to debug using VC++ when VB doesn't do the job! This book is more for the intermediate to expert developer, but a beginner to MTS should come up to speed quickly.What can I say; this book is excellent!

As a driving force for new music in the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, they've been invaluable in commissioning, performing and recording new works. But when they try to play the great music of old, they reveal themselves to be a below-average ensemble. Such is the case here with their Bartok 3, arguably the best of the composers' six quartets. Kronos' anemic sound is combined here with occasionally vague rhythm, utter lack of dynamic contrast and single-color playing, and the result is something of a joke, especially in comparison with some of the great recordings by groups such as the Emerson, Tokyo, and Takacs quartets.The other works on the disc are weak and easily forgettable (including the odd, somewhat cheesy Johnston arrangement), though the Volans is mildly entertaining. In short, don't waste your time or money on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"white man go away","review":"I am soooooo happy that there are sooooo many music types that can offer their opinions.I think this sight needs to prequalify submissions based upon age/occupation/salary and if anyone has ever given a sneeze about their opinion.I suppose you all reviewers would dislike the theme to Mule Train---hey it was hot in that desert---give em a break.no hair"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oval Sit n Spin = BAD!!!!","review":"Whoever thought that an oval sit n spin would be a good idea didn't try it out!

You have to sit on the two ends with the stars. When my five year old tries to use this Dora sit n spin, she slides off of the ends. Also, she complains that it doesn't go as fast as her round sit n spin. You can see why. The spinning is odd because of the shape, and you can't get a consistent speed going.

This is not like the hard plastic, easy to spin sit and spins that I remember (as a child of the late 70's). This is a cheaply made piece of junk that even my easy to please 3 year old finds uninteresting and boring. The part the child holds on to (the pink part w/ Dora's face on in) feels like it's going to break off. It gives when you try and spin, so your child can't really spin that fast on it.

I can see it as a movie with Harrison Ford - of course - and its even left open for a sequel.A plot started in 1973 reaches its goal with a presidential election. And it looks as if its going to suceed. I won't go into details on the plot. Let's just say, I hope it stays fiction.The suspense builds and reaches the point you can't put the book down. It's a race against time with the future of our country hanging in the balance.

Grossman's first novel is fast-paced, gripping and well-researched, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of weaponry, military and police procedures, electoral politics, Islamic legends and architecture, even the streets and stores of such disparate cities as Washington, Tripoli, and Boston. In the end, while an immediate crisis is resolved, there are enough loose ends dangling that one is eager to move on to the next book in the series.

The book was more of using the API's. But unfortunately the examples are not very concise and clear.

Virtually every previous work on the war, including my own, focuses primarily on the years up to and including 1998; Sorley looks at the years from 1998 through the end, and shows a picture rather different than the conventional one. Many writers and officials will resent this book, because it turns their own positions on end, but they can't honestly refute the facts. It is a shame that we could not have had this book twenty years ago, but it probably could not have been written before now. Adding to the brilliance of Sorley's research and interpretation is a sparkling writing style that makes the book a pleasure to read. It is a must for anyone who really wants to know how the war ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the point, candid analysis","review":"Having been there,A Better War provides comfort and a degree of satisfaction that many of us have sought for three decades. It should be prescribed for many veterans of the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarrassing Book of Historical Wishes, Not History","review":"The author is clearly heavily biased in his opinions, causing him to create a book of unsubstantiated conclusions surrounding his hero, General Creighton Abrams. Many -- perhaps most -- of his revolutionary conclusions are completely unreferenced, even though he claims he could footnote every sentence. Given this, is the author deliberately deceptive, or just incompetent?Since the author's conclusions are so radically different than the consensus of dozens of highly respected writers, it becomes the case of \\"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\\" This the author clearly does not provide, and his gushing admiration of Abrams openly exposes his biases and complete lack of objectivity.Do not read this book if you want the truth about the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, repetitive 'history'","review":"Better titled \\"The Creighton Abrams Hagiography Project\\", this book makes it's only worthwhile points in the first chapters -- 'clear and hold' is a good idea and that good intelligence information is something to aim at. Other than that, this piece of garbage jumps around from topic to topic, and has the added annoyance of reams of italicized words to give emphasis to Abrams' incessant, profane bloviating. I am second to none in my appreciation of Abrams' abilities and accomplishments, but calling this a 'history' is like calling a Big Mac haute cuisine."},{"rating":"1","title":"history or hagiography?","review":"A Better War is not history but a hagiography of Gen. Creighton Abrams, who apparently could do no wrong. It is \\"history\\" as seen by the American mission in Saigon, with little attention paid to much else and what appears to be a deliberate attempt by the author to ignore unpleasant facts, such as the political pressures in the U.S. to withdraw and the appalling casualties sustained by the South Vietnamese in the Laotian invasion of 1971. The book seems largely based on tape recordings of Gen. Abrams, some of which border on the incoherent or at least the irrelevant, and which are quoted verbatim far beyond any reasonable limit - a good historian would have summed them up and quoted only what was significant regarding a given point.History? Sure, if your idea of a history of the Civil War would be Jefferson Davis' memoirs.(For credibility's sake, I spent two tours in Vietnam as an infantryman with the 1st Air Cavalry Division.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old wine in a new bottle","review":"Using new evidence from the Abrams papers, but failing to examine massive recent declassifications of Nixon's and others' papers and tapes, including Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese documents and accounts, Sorley essentially restates the mythical stab-in-the-back theory; namely, that the antiwar movement and the politicians betrayed a victorious army. Readers need to read Kimball's Nixon's Vietnam War and The Vietnam War Files; David Elliott's The Vietnamese War; Kenton Clymer's The United States and Cambodia; Luu Van Loi and Nguyen Anh Vu's Le Duc Tho-Kissinger Negotiations; and Ang Chen Guan's Ending the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, indeed, the title describes it!","review":"I took Filth with me on an excursion to Italy & it filled in the gaps between sight seeing & all that touristy stuff quite well. Very compelling, I think I killed around 200 pages just in Tuscany alone! Robertson most be the most despicable character in modern literature since Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Read this one only after you've finished Trainspotting, which will give you a better perspective. Anyone planning to do a study on 90s literature should read everything by Welsh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put Filth down despite it causing a migrane","review":"Filth is on par with Crime and Punishment for probing the soul of a doer of evil acts. At times it made me sweat and caused my head to pound. I simply could not believe how bad it was getting near the end. For a while I imagined some sort of salvation for Bruce Robertson was forthcoming. Then the tapeworm returned and I new there was no hope. I think it would have been better if Welsh made Robbo a Rangers fan instead of a Hearts supporter. Then he would have been really easy to dislike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm.....","review":"The reactionary revolting that Welsh inflicts upon you, is about all there is to this book. Many pages could have been spared on the way to the conclusion, which was excellent in itself, but far too late into the book. Still, a good book with its amiable Tapeworm and an infected scrotum, with reams and reams of masturbatory narrative. Also, there is obviously deeper interpretation, reflecting on corruption, social behaviour in the Nineties, palpable desperation and all that kind of jazz, but really, purely and simply, it's revolting. And even that wears off after a while. But still, read it. The Scottish dialect is no problem whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nasty all right.","review":"I tried to explain this book to a friend of mine and found one sentence to sum it all up: \\"It's about a cop who is so dirty and so unreedemable, that the tapeworm living in his gut is a more likeable character.\\" Some people will have a hard time reading a story with a completely detestable protagonist (does that even apply, or was the tapeworm the real protagonist?), but I couldn't put it down. Ultimately it's about a cop you'll love to hate, which will come easier to some than others. A thick skin, strong stomach and a patience for thick dialects might be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Filth\\" is fantastic!","review":"This book blows the mind!

That's all you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should not have been published","review":"Welsh and his publishers are abusing an initial literary success to lever their own financial gain without giving the reader any new understanding of the complexities of a tormented life. The final images of this book do not justify the \\"filth\\" that Welsh has collected from some very \\"smutty\\" sources and forced on the reader. This book is not modern liturature. It is only a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book","review":"I gave it one star cos ... hmm, i don't know, i guess it stands out from all the others though doesn't it?

He's really done it this time. Some of the characters' exploits may seem extreme, but the accuracy of the dialogue makes them totally credible.Can't wait for the film, especially the 'home video' scene at Hector the farmers.This book doesn't seem to have a point (not that I can see anyway) other than drugs are bad for you and that you should always wash between your legs. However it doesn't really matter. The set pieces and dialogue are so strong that there is no point in tacking on a contrived plot or pretentious storyline. Other authors would do well to follow his example."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"This is the funniest book I've read in a long time. Move over Martin Amis & Bret Easton Ellis: this is filth at its pictish best. The novel's hero, Bruce Robertson, is an endearing yet wonderfully amoral colossus who bestrides a dying Caledonian culture. Surely the novel of the millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deft Craft Sometimes Can't Support Story","review":"A grimy, encrusted, disturbing, unflinching examination of uniquely male psychoses. Welsh's strengths are on display: a unique syntactic structure that will have you hearing the copy in a perfect Scottish accent, a fearless storyteller's eye and an imagination that reaches far out into darkness most of us turn from in our daily lives.The story is a bombastic bullet train and, while it rocks and rockets along thrillingly, occasionally the pylons of character and language creak under the weight of increasingly soap opera-y turns. The wheels slip from the rails, but happily, there is no full derailment.Recommended for fans of: Palahniuk, Ellis, Huston, McCarthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad lieutenaut","review":"This is a funny book. It's also the most difficult to read since Maribou Stork Nightmares. Welsh uses more tricks and interruptions in this book than in most. You never forget that you are reading a book. Welsh is known for his good taste in music and occasional DJing himself. In this book the main character likes so much bad music like Phil Collins, Michael Bolton, and hair metal. It reminds me of American Psycho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welsh one of the best writers ever!","review":"Irvine Welsh is one of my favorite all-time authors ever! He writes in Scots dialect & its as if you can hear the characters come to life in your head as you read. Their voices become distinct and their deeds are scandalously delightful. Any hedonist will relish in Welsh's works. Roddy Doyle is my other favorite author and I'm sure those who enjoy Welsh's style will also love Doyle's writing not only for the stories and gallows humor, but also because he writes in Irish dialect the way Wesh writes in Scots. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling stuff","review":"A very strong novel with all of the usual Welsh character peculiarities. Not for the faint hearted, but Welsh fans will love it. A little bit more together than his other works (appart from Trainspotting) with a reasonably linear plot that never fails to shock. Also, it is easier to read, the accented text is not as tricky. Well worth reading but probably not as compelling as his previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushingly Boring","review":"This is the last Irvine Welsh book I will buy, having bought several.

I vote the worm as the most interesting character in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It earned it's title","review":"I did feel \\"filthy\\" after reading this book. For one, it was difficult to read due to Scottish slang, but once you got past that, all the rest of the words were fowl.

Skip this one.....there are too many good books in the world to waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Read. Hard to understand.","review":"I bought this book because it sounded very interesting. A cop living his life in depravity while still maintaining his career. I know the author had written Trainspotting and I enjoyed that movie. But thats the problem. If I would have read Trainspotting I probably would have put the book down after 20 pages like I did with Filth. Nothing against the author or the book itself I just could not understand there use of the english language. For those who have seen Trainspotting try to imagine reading it instead of watching it and try to understand the slang words and that cockney dialect in written form. I just couldn't read a novel that I couldn't understand. Filth does sound like it would make a good movie though."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASP Data","review":"As a reviewer for this book I have read the book from cover to cover. The strong point about this book is that it covers many different aspects of data access. If you are somewhat new to ASP this book will show the ropes on ADO, XML and how to mix data from many different sources. If you are an experienced developer this book covers many areas that will interest you - data warehousing, the use of several different DB other than the very familiar SQL Server and non-realtional data sources.

This book is written in very clear and simple terms, providing the reader/rider guidance on what is natural and beautiful no matter what level of their riding. The concepts apply to lower level as well as grand prix riders. The notion that what is natural, and beautiful can also be correct is a notion that has been lost on many riders and authors.

It is really great to be able to see how the story was originally intended. The subtitles for the Gatchaman episodes are great and MUCH BETTER than a Gatchaman DVD i was able to get off of EBay!! Defintely get these first so you have some of idea of what the characters names really are before you buy any Gatchaman DVD's.For those who complained that there were eps missing, they were not BofP eps that were missing. The eps are numbered based on the corresponding Gatchaman eps. Unfortunately, of the 105 Gatchaman eps, only 85 were made into BotP, so the numbers skip when there is no corresponding BotP episode. But don't worry, you're not missing any BotP eps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanitized, but good.","review":"BOTP was one of my favourite cartoons as a child. Unfortunatly pricing and a lack of cohesive packaging turned me off to the idea of purchasing this series. But now everything is coming together at the same time, a great price and a compact size and a good quantity of episodes (14) made this collection very hard to resist. And it includes two episodes that were etched in my mind THE GALAXY GIRLS and THE FIERCE FLOWERS. As an adult the americanization of the series is very annoying, adding an insipid R2D2 knockoff as a narrator and having people say things like \\"the REMOTE CONTROLLED planes have been destroyed\\" over and over is just very lame, WE GET IT NO ONE DIES EVER!!!

It installed just fine. The main problem, is that once it is installed, it is not playable. A patch is required to get anywhere past the \\"party formation\\" page an any Mac OS X. Said patch, is no longer available for Macs and MacPlay apparently no longer even recognizes the game. It is listed no where on their website. The technical support link listed in the game instruction manual no longer exists; this just links right back to MacPlay's homesite. I'm sure the game is very fun to play; I'll just never know. But I now have two new coasters.Please don't make my mistake; don't waste your time or money on this worthless piece of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference with examples","review":"Finally, a book I have been looking for; a readable reference with solid examples. Does a great job on the namespaces it covers. Looking forward to similiar books to cover additional namespaces. This is not a tutorial. Gets straight to the point and provides you with the information you need to use a class and its associated methods and properties. Provides just enough background to provide context for the namespaces referenced. If you are interested in a reference that show you what namespace to use for a particular purpose and concisely shows you how to use the namespace, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to the REAL programmers reference books?","review":"I'm afraid I'll have to call this book a failure. I feel that if I buy a \\"programmers reference\\" book it should be just that.

It seems like the authors don't even understand the material. Paragraphs are copied (very obviously) from the .NET framework reference, portions are marked \\"unavailable at the time of writing\\" (check the System.Web.Services.Description namespace), and the English is, in a nutshell... bad. The only good content seems to have been copied from \\"Professional ASP.NET\\" (a much better book, although with its own problems), and there are blatant omissions of important information which render some of the more technical class reference essentially useless.If you want this book, just print out the .NET class library reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for starting .net","review":"This book tricked me into believing that all the code was going to be in c# and vb.net. The first two chapters had examples in both languages. Then, as soon as you hit Chapter 3, it drops the dual language examples. As a Java developer having to do a .net project quickly, I would NOT recommend this book. I guess I'll try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laswell is Phatness Personified","review":"The first thing I heard from Bill Laswell was his work with Buckethead on the album Colma. I just really liked the ambient bass guitar sound that he creates. The mixture of dub reggae with awesome soundscape-creating vocals and horns on this album is well worth a listen for anyone who likes music. If you listen to anything from Bob Marley to Pink Floyd, or if you just like to chill out to some really tight grooves, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Dub","review":"This was my first shot at trying to find dub music that I like.

There is nothing interesting on the CD except the duet with Andre 3000 Kelis could never really sing well but I thought she would use her charm and ability to carry the CD which she did not. The cd reminds me of an appolonia show. Shes trying to be this X rated sex kitten and its really cheesy. None of the songs have any real meaning or catch.

I've been a fan since her very good debut \\"Kaleidoscope\\" a few years ago, and never understood why her excellent \\"Wanderland\\" CD was never released in the US. \\"Tasty\\" is her most provocative and erotic release yet, showcasing a confident young woman not afraid to either explore her sexuality or experiment with her sound. A few highlights include the funky opening track \\"Trick Me\\", the entrancing single \\"Milkshake\\", the explicit \\"In Public\\" (featuring her fiance Nas) and the trippy \\"Millionaire\\" (a duet with Outkast's Andrew 3000).

I had read good reviews and finally decided to buy it.I admit that a few songs are catchy: 'Trick Me,' 'Milkshake' (of course...), and Glow. The rest of the album is nothing special, nothing crucial. Perhaps the reason I was so disappointed in this album is because I've been hearing a little bit too much from The Neptunes.Although this album possesses many of the qualities \\"Kaleidoscope\\" did (music, beats, etc.) I think that the lyrics aren't at the same level, I feel like it's a step down from where she was headed. JUST MY OPINION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Beats=boredom","review":"If this is meant to be one of the best r'b/hip hop albums of the year then the genre is in urgent need of some help. Listening to the album there are not very many of the songs that standout. It could also be guilty of putting even the most vigilant kelis fan to sleep as all the songs have a similar beat to them. Standout songs if you could call them that would be 'attention' and 'millionaire' as well as the released singles although I doubt without andre 3000 featured this song would barely get a listen.A very dissapointing effort after loving milkshake and trick me the rest of the album doesn't live up to the standards of the singles and anyone expecting to get such kick ass songs on the rest of the album will be sadly mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is really like a milkshake...","review":"you know, like those superthick ones you can get at McDonalds. The album begins with promise with the intro, \\"Trick Me,\\" and \\"Milkshake.\\" The album starts to be depressing when \\"Keep It Down\\" starts but stops briefly with \\"Flashback\\" (a song originally on Wanderland, a better album than this one). The album returns to its depression with \\"Protect My Heart\\" and never lets go. Strictly for the TRL generation and not for people seeking alternatives to commercial hip/hop and R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what we've been waiting for!","review":"included lots of good songs, but this one is going better. If you like awesome beats and funky samples mixed with good hooks you'll love this, The Neptunes are ofcourse behind the music once again. \\"Milkshake\\" is almost on top of the charts and that's only one of the many good sogs here. Others are \\"Flashback\\" \\"Protect my heart\\" and \\"Millionaire\\" With Andree of Outkast. \\"In Public\\" she'll teams up with suberb rapper Nas, and Raphael Sadiq appears on \\"Attention\\" and Glow\\".

Kelis isn't your typical urban female artist lamenting the loss of her man, though her love of men is a focal point of many of her songs which ooze sex and sensuality. And a goodly number of the opposite sex, like Andre 3000 and Nas, guest or produce. Kelis does best when hitting the club beats on the album, such as the spagetti-western themed \\"Trick Me\\" or the vacillating rock and groove of \\"Keep It Down.\\" Around the middle, the experience gets a little weighted down with some slower numbers, but overall \\"Tasty\\" is a worthwhile listen. Give it a chance...you won't want to spit it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"i hater ivy","review":"I think that ivy is a complete deuche bag.

Later i downloaded the second album, Wanderland, loved it so i bought that one too.So, with this reputation I just assumed Tasty would be a banger as well, especially after hearing and liking Milkshake. I went and bought it without hearing it first.It turns out Milkshake is like the only song on the whole album that i like. I don't know what happened with Kelis, but if you are going off of how her earlier CDs sounded then you might be as disappointed as me.I learned my lesson, from now on I'm downloading albums for free before i buy them.Hey, at least I got the hot pics of Kelis in Tasty, but they aren't worth $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daaang........","review":"Tasty is one of her best albums. The other two were great and she keeps out doing her last album. This album is great. There is not one song that you can skip on the cd. I listened to it all the way. This is one of the hottest cds out this year. I have grown to love Kelis even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This CD is not typical female R&B run of the mill blah. It has a Outkast feel with edgy hook crazy songs. Trick Me is insanely addictive. Her rapping isn't bad either. Milkshake while campy and repetitive is a infamous classic. Keep It Down has some rock to it that you never hear on a R&B CD. If you are looking for Beyonce type ballads or Pussycat Dolls tease-the-boys songs, then stay away. But if you want something with a different flavor, then try Kelis."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is This?","review":"This is just crap, bulls**t.

Other than that, this CD ain't worth buyin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Am I the only person that's EXTREMELY annoyed with this girl?

At all."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY MILSHAKE BRINGS ALL THAT I HAVE!","review":"I Don't get it?, many people say MILKSHAKE was a disposable single, and that the album was way much better than the leading single?, well maybe MILKSHAKE was a pop crossover that only time will tell if it's a classic or not, but at least was a hit and one of those songs that goes through your brain and sticks in it, but I have heard this lame album a thousand times from begginning to end, and I don't have another favorite, only tracks that I personally hate like IN PUBLIC, PROTECT MY HEART, the only song that I could consider the next single would be TRICK ME, but the album it's really boring and without personality, so sad, because I can tell Kelis is talented, but this album remind us, why there was SINGLES, so you don't have to buy the whole garbage. This album is not good.

While Six Marimbas is still classic minimalism (a necessary re-scoring of Six Pianos), Sextet is one of the most remarkable pieces of the last fifteen years. The piece more successfully integrates minimalist technique to the mainstream language of classical music, especially in the Third Movement. It also accomplishes a rare feat with percussion instruments: notes are given length, especially in the bowed vibraphone. The liner notes further explain Reich's composition ideas, but that isn't essential to enjoying the piece. Overall, Sextet successfully unites several academic ideas to produce beautiful sounding music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Book","review":"Through the travelogue format Kaplan presents a sobering look at contemporary America and highlights trends which are sobering.

It had interesting bits of travel through America, but the main premise, that City-States and Regions will grow and the powerful Federal government will shrink does not ring true.

Taken as a composite, Kaplan's writing in this volume rings very true. While not a major part of the book, the first and last chapters regarding the US military and its evolving role seem especially pertinent. Here's hoping that when the paperback version is published that many more people read and ponder An Empire Wilderness. There are important lessons in Kaplan's observations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negative reviewers are hilarious","review":"Kaplan writes what he sees and hears.

Having read his excerpts from this book, which served as two cover stories for The Atlantic, I was eager to read his work. The in depth reporting he does, is so challenging to the conventional view that it's worth reading even if you do not agree with his premise. I would in general consider myself well to the right of Kaplan's apparent politics, and yet I found myself agreeing that the current trends he outlines do present major obstacles for this nation.The portion of the book focussing on the US military, and its challenges - as described from Ft. Leavenworth, are worth picking up the book for alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Overtaken by Events","review":"Events, namely one big one (9/11), have pretty much overtaken this book, copyrighted 1998, rendering most of the sociological observations academic or even dated, leaving only a travelogue, albeit a very good one. The message I got from this book is that the U.S. is morphing from a nation-state into something new and hertofore unseen -- a North American entity without borders, an entity with a smaller government concerned mostly with military, environment and protecting the less fortunate among us. Maybe that's how things looked in 1998, but 9/11 presented a paradigm shift and I suspect that Kaplan, writing the same book today, eight years later, might revise some of his observations. In any case, I like Kaplan's books. They are the thinking man's travelogues and whether here or in some third world country, his interactions with the people he encounters are stimulting, educational and fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anglo suprematist crap","review":"The pages that this pseudo historian devotes to the Hispanic heritage in Mexico and the United States denote that he is not only a racist, but an ignorant.

If you want to program JSP pages, download the JSP spec from java.sun.com.If you want to do something else, buy other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"servlets w/out databases","review":"the only way to get source code for the examples in this book is to download it from their web site. no problem, except that they don't offer the source code for all the examples, because the database examples don't work. there are no drivers, and there is no explanation of where to get them. don't count on this book to help you get connected to a database from a java servlet. it won't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious developers.","review":"I would reccomend this book only to people who are new to Java Programming and want an overall treatise with something on everything possible server side. But for those who are already in this field for a while and want to build on their knowledge this book would be a big disappointment. The other main drawback of this book is its bulkiness.This book does cover some of the topics like servlets in detail good enough for a serious programmer but most of the other topics introduced are not exhaustive enough for a serious developer.To sum it up, rather buy books on individual topics and build a solid base than adorn your bookself with fancy Wrox books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok as an overview but too bulky","review":"I guess I shouldn't expect a book written by 12 different people to be too cohesive but this book was very disjointed. They tried to cover too many topics with varying levels of depth so while this may have been a good book were it intended to be an overview of the technologies, it ends up uneven with topic coverage quality ranging from average to poor. The case studies and plethora of appendixes mostly bulked up the book rather than adding value."},{"rating":"1","title":"One book won't do any justice","review":"If one expects to find sufficient information in one book to get started (I mean to do professional programming and not the \\"HelloWorlds\\") in servlets, EJB's, JSP and rest of J2EE architecture, then one has to search really hard. Rather one should buy at least 3-4 books to do any justice to any of these topics. Some of them are the usual suspects - Java Servlet Programming, Enterprise JavaBeans, Advanced Java 2, etc. This book might be useful for servlet programming and not much else in my opinion. I was \\"convinced\\" by earlier positive reviews on this book to buy it and was disappointed. So take any review including this with pinch of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack of all ... master of none","review":"The authors have tried to cover most of Java enterprisetechnologies in a single book . Couldnt do justice to any of them.JSP coverage is minimal and inadequate . Professional programmers mustlook for books specialising on this topics: I am listing some of them here.*Java Servlet programming By Jason Hunter*Enterprise Java beans By Richard Monson-Haefel*Java XML programming - Wrox press*Professional Javaserver pages - wrox press...There are umpteen good books on XML/XSL basics . Please do not waste your money on this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a great book.","review":"If you're the kind of person that can look at code samples and a few paragraphs of explanation, and say \\"oh yeah\\" (and you don't need to be handheld through the process of writing code) this book is for you. Granted, it doesn't go into deep deep detail for all topics, but that information is in the java specification documents for free if you need it. The book has a kind of buffet style of information, you can jump around to each chapter to find out what you need.Overall its a great book for a developer who's at an intermediate to senior level, and doesn't need to write \\"hello world\\" examples for everything they learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"From programmers to publishers","review":"To achieve \\"time-to-market\\" get as many programmers as possible to digest everything Java server related, request authors to include lots of code and sell the book as advanced and timely. Include APIs to make it look big. And here you have it: a waste of time and resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized with examples that don't work","review":"This is one of the worst books I have purchased on the subject - definitely not up to WROX's usual standards. I have yet to find an example that works mostly due to poor documentation on how their development environment was setup. The ideas presented would be great if better developed, but most (incl. XML programming) are too cryptic or limited in scope to be of much real world use. It's loaded with buzz words but not much meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious developers","review":"I would reccomend this book only to people who are new to Java Programming and want an overall treatise with something on everything possible server side.

Nevertheless, I would not recommend this book for Java beginners (buy Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel).The example are quite sufficient and very easy to follow. It contains good examples and its code are well explained. The coverage of this book towards Server Side programming is perfect!The only downside is the printing; I think it is too cluttered.I thank the authors for your hard effort in compiling this great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only recommendable for the Servlets part","review":"The chapters by Andrew Patzer about Servlets are well written and informative, so the book starts promising. However the quality of the rest of the book rates between reasonably good, mediocre and very bad. I my opinion the worst of all is the the chapter on smart servlets, where I wonder if the authors really know about what they are talking. The appendices on the various APIs are close to useless. That the book is badly designed with horrible typography does not really contribute to a good impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete mess, or \\"a mess-complete{","review":"This was a great idea for a book, but wow, could really have used a few writers and an editor on this project. It's so badly organized, badly written, badly punctuated, and so full of typos, that it's really hard to understand. Chapter 23 on EJB's will really make your head spin.WROX books are written by programmers and you really see the the down side of that approach here.If you want to understand Java2 Server Side programming, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to Java","review":"This a good book to get ramped up on Java. The chapters can be a bit lengthy but the examples are very clear and well explained. The language is simple and all the Java concepts are discussed in detail.However, this book on its own is not sufficient. It does list out the complete JDK 1.2 API and I find myself having to refer to Sun's java site to get the complete API specifications.But overall, I'd still recommend this book to others wanting to dive into the world of Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for server-side programming","review":"Java is becoming a very good programming language for server-side software. This book encompasses almost all that fits for designing server-side software. Beginning with servlets, it covers all the other technologies such as JSP, EJB, CORBA, JNDI, JDBC etc..A good book for all who know Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, comprehensive resource","review":"As a professional server-side developer, I found this book to be well written in almost all parts, and very thorough. It's difficult to provide so much information in a book covering so many topics, but this one does a great job. I recently gave a poor rating to another wide scoop book (Red Hat Linux The Complete Reference) because it lacked any details at all. If you are serious about learing the various topics, this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of subjects, none in depth...","review":"This book covers a lot of the technologies of Server-side Java application development. However, it doesn't cover them in depth to make this book the reference in any of these technologies. Another drawback, is the work and difficulty involved in setting up the software products necessary to replicate the environment used in the book, which is not covered at all in it.Buy this book only if you're trying to get a single one-shop coverage of these topics. Don't buy it if you're looking for comprehensive coverage of Server-side Java technology (actually, you'll need several different books for that)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooler and lighter","review":"Purchased this fan clutch to replace my OEM Lexus fan clutch. It is actually smaller and lighter than the stock OEM clutch so you get some good weight saving factor and less rotational weight, because the fan clutch spins with the fan blades. The only thing is the bolts that comes with the clutch are very cheap! One of them striped on me during the install. So I had to go to the hardware store and purchased new bolts washers and nuts and installed securely that way. Overall the clutch itself works great and keeps my car cool again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looks.. Terrible Execution","review":"Great looks on this coffee pot with interesting angles and clean-lined stainless not common to this price range. However, carafe is major downfall. The thin walled carafe will not shatter like similar glass designs, but is uncomfortable and drippy while pouring. Also, the poorly constructed handle is attached with screws and cheap plastic. Consequently, the handle separated from my carafe within 40 uses. Strongly not recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to the last drop?","review":"This coffemaker was good until I cleaned it. It now dribbles coffee from the seal when you pour.Messy, Messy, Messy!

When i received it there was already a plastic piece broken off and when i put water in it all came out the bottom. I returned it the next day wishing i had listened to the negative reviews. There is a reason why its priced so cheap, because it is cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy","review":"This coffee maker does not have an automatic shut off mechanism, it only shuts off after 2 hours if you program it to come on automatically.

One lasted but 1 day. Just died. The other 2 are still working but don't get the water very hot. It is also very difficult to see whether the on/off light is lit. Water also pours out of the back if you put the water in too fast or over fill it, making quite a mess. Defintiely not even worth the $9.95 + shipping sale price. \\"Sounds too good to be true . . .\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"A good example of \\"if the (sale) price looks too good to be true, it probably is.\\" What a disappointment. Due to a hard-to-believe engineering oversight, there is insufficient clearance between the pause-and-serve valve and the carafe's lid. The valve, therefore, does not open enough to allow the coffee to exit the basket. Our first use resulted in quite a mess. Subsequent use has therefore required a shim-like device (plastic spoon, craft stick, etc.) to be inserted between the lid and the valve. Recommendation: spend a little more. Buy another coffeemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two times the hassle","review":"I received the coffee maker, and after about 4 uses the digital display would no longer show and the machine would not function.

And it's not easy to take the machine in and out of the case. If you want something to protect the device and are willing to open the case as you would a book - this will work for you. I couldn't attach the USB sync cable although there is a hole for it. The IR port is exposed if you use that (I do for some printing). Frankly, I prefer a clip on holster type carrier and this case cannot do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but is a little small","review":"Got the case about 2 weeks ago, and was surprised with just how small it was. not too much bigger than the actual iPAQ. Does have a really cool clip inside that holds youe 'naked' iPAQ without needing any velcro, but there is not much room for anything else. I have the CF sleeve, CF modem, CF ethernet card, and multiple memory cards, but there is not any room for but 1 or 2 of the CF memory cards in the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks alot.","review":"This case is way too small for anything.

I installed 7 total in daisy chain, hardwired to a switch on the wall about a month ago. I especially like the light it reflects off my countertops, and the low profile design. With a general knowledge of electrical and no fear of cutting into the walls, installation is straightforward if well planned. I think it'll look even better when we get the backsplash up! I'm not giving it five stars because I haven't yet decided or determined how I lost a 'new' light so quickly. I did buy these a few years ago and from multiple sources on clearance. Besides sitting for so long, I also tripped the electrical circuit in front of this unit when installing, and it's the first in the chain off the switch.

I have not really delved much in 'Jewish Mysticism' and am no expert on the subject. But from looking at the Translation and especially the Notes I have that sense that this is a first- class scholarly rendition of the work.

The Cowell is a classic and very early pattern piece with a virtuosic Xylophone part and the wonderful sound of eight ricebowls played in a pattern (with chopsticks).

However, if you already have a lot of Wrox \\"professional\\" titles, such as \\"Professional JSP\\" or \\"Professional XML\\", stay away. This book just repeats excerpts from those, and is more confusing because it doesn't contain all the information.

That was in '88--pre internet and had tried to find recordings by the Trio. A couple of years ago, I came across this CD and recognized members of the Trio Bulgarka in the credits. I listened to this recording over and over and found it to be haunting, poetic and satisfying (except, of course the length of the recording--at 20+ min. it's really short). The most engaging tracks being Kalimakou Denkou (a funeral lament) and Polegnala e Todora (a love song) bring on a sort of happy melancholy that can, at once, put a smile on your face and a bring a tear to your eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"As seen on TV","review":"Their music was recently featured on the HBO show Carnivale.

In fact, as a fan of one of the most innovative guitarists (rock and otherwise) of all time, I found out about \\"Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares\\" from reading an interview with Beck in a \\"Guitar Player\\" magazine where he had nothing but the utmost praise for the choir.But my favorite piece is \\"Kalimankou Denkou\\" (just try fighting back the tears sometimes, if you listen to this one alone!)

First of all, there are some things which are errononous -- ie: just about all of the Accessibility coverage (quite an important new feature) -- some of the things it tells you to do won't work. That piece of code is for something entirely different, not checking accessibility. Secondly, some of what is said about video is not correct as well. Finally - some of the tutorials are not completed -- it says they will be in a \\"later chapter\\" - but this doesn't seem to occur.

And the concept is powerful. The Kronos quartet pairs with prerecorded sounds of steam engines to compare the composer's early love of trains with the trains in Europe taking Jews to the gas chamber. Powerful idea. But for me, minimalism just doesn't have the dramatic oomph to deal with the subject matter and so the piece feels like an \\"idea\\" rather than an emotional response to the holocaust. The second work on the disc, Electric Counterpoint, also seems to be treading water. The material doesn't feel much different from Reich's more ground breaking work of the early 60s and 70s.All and all, for me this is a disappointing recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"not his best but worth a listen","review":"Steve Reich can be undigestable at times and not the easiest of composers to listen to, it's as if your listening to a record with the needle sticking to the groove with very little developement...so it's safe to say that you certainly have to be in a certain mood to appreciate this kind of music but it does have it's rewards. The c.d is divided up into two sections, \\"Different Trains\\" with the Kronos Quartet as good as usual. The momentum of the music depicts the progression of trains through out America and Europe and what they represent, human voices reciting historical dates.The second work on the disc \\"Electric Counterpoint\\" almost seems as though it doesn't belong on the same disc but it's in my opinion the diamond in the rough. I have been a Pat Metheny fan long before Steve Reich and it's the main driving point in owning the disc, brilliant guitar playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping, no problems","review":"Wanted to hear Reich's original Electric Counterpoint fast III, and I got it :) Did not disappoint.

Its one of Reich's best, but it's actually not very minimalist for him, which may be why I like it. Of course, Kronos does an excellent job. Electric Counterpoint is pleasant for about a movement or so, but in the end it comes across as thin and dull compared to Different Trains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical work","review":"Reich often provides his listeners an inward journey, but this journey on different trains tells a story. The liner notes tell of his riding trains in the United States back and forth between family and parallels the events happening in Europe during World War II. It is strongly affective.Too, the Pat Metheny performance on this work is lyrical, and though I was first a Reich fan before I fell for Metheny's work, I think that Pat has imparted some wisdom for Steve in changing this work to be more \\"idiomatic\\" of the soul of the guitar.One of my favorite Reich albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Read.

It's hardly \\"Impossible\\" thinking, and nothing ground breaking.Instead of this reading, I would much recommend any self help book, or any book under \\"creativity\\" (\\"Cracking Creativity\\" by Michael Michalko is a good one) would be more insightfull.Very dissappointing book, especially with such a seemingly dramatic title.

If you have the misfortune to read Room-Mating Season, you will find yourself waiting throughout the entire story for the hollow and shallow characters to develop and for the plot to pick up pace. Unbelievably the author takes the reader through decades of four women's lives who never learn any signifigant life lessons or grow past the maturity level they possessed at age 23. The overuse of the word \\"albeit\\" made me want to scream and I am amazed that I even finished this garbage. My only solace is that I checked it out from the library and didn't waste anything more than time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book started out with some promise, however the character development never fully pans out. Unfortunately the characters remain EXACTLY the same over a forty year span. They think nothing of their extramarital affairs, and remain shallow and generally unlikable. It seems Jaffe should not have tried to span so many years. I finished the book, only because I felt I should after reading half of it. I always finish a book when I start reading, but this one was a struggle. I really just didn't care anymore.

I adore Class Reunion, and have just finished The Road Taken, which was one of the best books I have ever read.Having said that, I looked forward to this newest novel and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It did not live up to my expectations. The characters are shallow and self centered. I never understood them, or their reasons for making the selfish choices that they made. I cannot even fathom why they would remain friends after sharing an apartment for a short time. I didn't care for any of them or what happened to them. There is one character who dies and we never really get to know her, For some reason, these women who have no morals, think about her from time to time.I feel cheated because I know Ms. Jaffe is capable of better writing than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Rona Jaffe ever","review":"Rona Jaffe has written many interesting books over the years. The latest Jaffe novel is more of a disappointment then a joy. In the opening chapters, the reader is introduced to four room-mates. Leigh, who wants to be an agent. Cady, the schoolteacher in love with a student's father. Stewardess Vanessa, the eldest of the pack. Oddball Susan, who shocks and disgusts her room-mates by exercising nude. And finally Charlie, the sweet \\"house mascot\\" of the bunch.Tragedy strikes the group over the passing years, but even with the upheaval caused, the characters failed to capture the imagination.

At the beginning of this book, I found the three main characters -- Leigh, Vanessa and Cady -- to be young, naive, selfish and foolish.

(Leigh is the only possible exception, as her personality putters to \\"boring\\" and stops there.)Had there been a single redeeming value in Vanessa or Cady, I'd have clung to it and given the book 3 stars. But more and more, I found myself wanting to knock their heads together. I read it through until the end to find out if they would experience a life-changing epiphany that would make them worthy of several hundred pieces of paper, but alas, no.

However, there is a fantastic ingredient guide, which lists all of the drinks and the ingredients they include in a convenient table. This makes it simple to find the drinks we can mix from our liquor cabinet. With other books, I am frequently frustrated by flipping through drink after drink that requires some exotic liquor I don't have.There is perhaps a slant in the book toward strongly alcoholic drinks--not many \\"girly\\" drinks where you can barely taste the alcohol.

It starts somewhere close to the beginning by introducing the basics of web development using the Visual Interdev environment, and progresses to explain how to use COM objects to make your site more robust and responsive. The book is a good example of the Wrox Press \\"Microsoft Technologies\\" approach, and gives a thorough understanding of not just the Visual Interdev product, but also of the many technologies used in a professional web site, namely ASP, VBScript, JavaScript, databases, and COM. I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn this excellent product - it is well written and does not bog you down with unnecessary detail. It is clear, precise, and to the point.

What this book relies upon is not as much as swords and spells.. rather it dwells in more emotion and honour. The parts where Caramon and Raistlin remembers their old days just adds to the sympathy you have for Raistlin. I bet Raistlin if given the choice would have given up everything he has to go back to the times before the Chronicles. The tie in on how the history is repeated with Rasitlin as Fisdantilus and Crysania with Caramon as their counterparts in the history makes is greatly planned and written.

I would definitely recommend this book, and this trilogy and the DL chronicles. They all were wonderful books. I really liked how hickmen and weis brought out the human side of raistlin. i never really understood how every one loved raistlin until i read this book. and now i'm one of them, but i also think that raistlin could have been kinder to his twin. but no, he even would have allowed the dark dwarves to take caramon's head. but now caramon learned the truth about raistlin and can go home and be a loving husband to tika.(hopefully)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Book","review":"What this book relies upon is not as much as swords and spells.. rather it dwells in more emotion and honour. The parts where Caramon and Raistlin remembers their old days just adds to the sympathy you have for Raistlin. I bet Raistlin if given the choice would have given up everything he has to go back to the times before the Chronicles. The tie in on how the history is repeated with Rasitlin as Fisdantilus and Crysania with Caramon as their counterparts in the history makes is greatly planned and written.Anohter greatly written book is The Price of Immortality. I have seen it recommended several times and have to agree that it will be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book was SWEEEEET! Raistlin Kicks All!","review":"This book was awesome. It had to do with Raistlin and Raistlin is the best character in anything I've ever read. He may be evil but he is good deep down inside. He was laughing when Caramon got stuck in the rabbit trap that shows he is good. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. I've already read \\"The Soulforge\\", \\"Brothers in Arms\\", All the Chronicles, and the Dark Elf Trilogy. I am currently stuck on Raistlin. He is so cool. I have to find some more nbooks with him in them. C ya all the rAistlin Fans.

It is his first obsession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crumb in poetic and eerilie beautiful mood","review":"Those who know US composer George Crumb mainly from the terrifying musings of 'Black Angels' (made semi-famous by the Kronos Quartet) will probably be surprised by the haunting beauty of 'Ancient Voices'. Based on texts from Lorca, the rich but sparing instrumentation is complemented by evocative, floating soprano - sometimes sung into the piano to create an eerie, mystical ambient. My first exposure was at London's Roundhouse in 1976, where even the background rumbling of trains couldn't sublimate the extraordinary lure of Crumb's sound world. Truly gorgeous and thoughtfully composed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"The CD arrived in a matter of days, great service considering the holidays.

One third of this album's material(5 of 15 tracks) was recycled for OTR(single versions appear on OTR-not counting the title track). Disco fans were strutting their stuff on discotheque floors with the title track,HOT STUFF,DIM ALL THE LIGHTS,SUNSET PEOPLE and OUR LOVE and others.

The musicians sound very amature, out of tune, rhythmically dull, boring & uninspired, not together; I would characterize the playing as \\"cruddy\\", to be polite.but often non-musicians don't notice or care about things like this,...so if you are a freaked-out bridal party with no other ideas at the last minute, a tin ear and no musical sense at all, then by all means buy this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"An highly informative and amusing read","review":"A \`How to' for Entrepreneurship research. The book provides a comprehensive treatment of entrepreneurship research methods - good, bad and ugly.

Its an entirely different product.If you are interested in what -could have been- had Copland not been scrapped, this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copland Review Very Informative","review":"I know why many of the reviewers gave the book only one or two stars. They were disappointed in that it had nothing to do with the actual product MacOS 8, but instead deals with the vaporware product also known as Copland.As far as it's review of Copland is concerned it is a very interesting book. I wish there was some more detail in regards to some of the low level stuff (such as task scheduling etc.). The book however provided a very interesting view of how Apple was going to try and transition between it's then current OS and a new \\"modern\\" OS. The level of detail is high enough to be informative, yet technical enough to provide potential developers with some understanding of how to (re)design their software to work under MacOS 8 Copland.My hats off to the author, even though it turned out to be a waist of paper from a productivity standpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional VB.NET","review":"Good book if you want to find how to apply VB.NET in different areas.

Recently all their books seem to be taking a dive. What I don't like about this book is that I'm already past page 100 and *still* all the coding was for a \\"Hello World\\" app. The book goes into topics that could be presented much later, such as the code that is automatically generated when creating a Windows application. I am still reading the book, but tomorrow am going to pick up Deitel's VB.NET book which, from looking at the table of contents, is how a book like this should be organized. Frankly, I can't believe how poor this book is, and I will think twice (or read more carefully in the bookstore) before buying any Wrox book in the future.

I keep trying to use this book and it keeps leaving me short. Sometimes in the examples the author tells you to do something obscure but then he doesn't tell you how to do it. The coverage lacks depth and detail.I am an experienced VB programmer but I got this book to help me convert to .Net. It has been a big disappointment. Some of the topics I needed help with were not covered.

Another quality Wrox title!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining continuance of story","review":"I won't go into details of the plot, others have already done so. Suffice it to say I enjoyed this addition to the Candace Steele story, although I was irritated by her continuing to deny Ash, despite his obvious love for her. *shrug* Of course, who is to say how one would react, but I was VERY angry at her continuing to blame him for \\"attacking her in the elevator in San Francisco\\" when her flashbacks in the first book CLEARLY show that she asked for him to turn her, then changed her mind at exactly the last minute. To put this into understandable terms: think if it had been actual intercourse, instead of him turning her into a vampire. She lets him get RIGHT to the brink, then says nope changed my mind, get off and later yells rape. THAT is exactly the situation in a nutshell and that drives me MAD. But otherwise, I did enjoy the book - lots of action, great mystery, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OK Series","review":"I wasn't sure I was going to like this series or not. I read the reviews for the first book, and they weren't great, but, I enjpoyed it. This book was even better, an I really enjoyed it. I am not sure ,yet,if the series is a keeper or not. I will wait for the last book. What I DO really like is how fast all three books are coming out. No one year-or more-wait for the next book in a series to come out. I HATE that. I get so into a book, then BAM, I find out the next book won't be out for a year (or more) It breaks my heart! This, I hope, other authors will see, and start doing also.

Gorham hardly touches on Brittain's pacifism, and her book ends in 1940, thirty years before Brittain's death. For a very readable and authoritative biography of Vera Brittain, try Vera Brittain: A Life by Paul Berry (Vera Brittain's friend) and Mark Bostridge (a young biographer)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"I have been studying Vera Brittain for my final year coursework and found the authorised life by Berry and Bostridge (1995) a good deal more authoritative, readable and enjoyable than Gorham's study. Gorham is inaccurate and weighed down by out of date theory. Susan Kingsley Kent clearly hadn't read the authorised biography when she recommended Ms Gorhams' book. After Testament of Youth itself, I would strongly urge readers interested in Brittain to buy the Bostridge-Berry biograhy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"While I admire the author's sincerity, I found the writing to be bogged down with righteousness and preachiness. His writing relies more on quotes than speaking from the heart. I thought the exercises were useful and wished there were more of them. I had hoped for a much deeper and more personal exploration into my own Shadow."},{"rating":"2","title":"expands and illuminates the shadow concept","review":"Okay, I admit when I learned of the author's Catholic past, Jungian perspective and Buddhist practice, I was all ready to love his writing from the start.Richo did not disappoint. His style is scholarly, yet very warm and immanently readable! I had dipped into this subject of \\"befriending the shadow\\" years ago, with a great book called No Enemies Within by Donna Markova.Richo's book takes it all further, providing exercises at the end of each chapter to help the reader contemplate and practice facing the personal shadow. He makes the cardinal point that all those neglected corners of ourselves, both positve and negative, have the power to make us more complete and compassionate humans. However, all the navel gazing in the world avails us of little, unless it enables us to become an active agent of good in the world.I highly recommend this little gem of a book.

But nothing prepared me for the true disaster. No, not the comet hitting the earth, rather the disaster of really bad writing. Some reviewers prepared me for slow action during the first part of the novel. But slow is not the word. The story moved along at the pace of a snail that is walking in it's sleep. My eyes kept trying to close from boredom. I can't even put together a well laid out review because I am already bored again. The conversations amongst the characters were so over the top as to be parodies. I thought I was reading a script for a daytime soap. If it were possible to have one wish, I would ask for the time back I wasted reading this book. UUGGHH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I found this to be a tedious read with shallow cardboard characters. Definitely not on par with Niven's other works (Tales of Known Space series.) If you want an entertaining and thought-provoking post-apocalyptic novel, try Alas Babylon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought this book interested in reading about how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world. Instead I read a soap opera. As one reviewer wrote, the first 200 pages are spent introducing the characters and what a boring 200 pages they are. Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there. Instead of outlining how resourceful some of the characters are in order to survive, the authors are preoccupied with race and sex (more characters than you can believe are more worried about sex than where they are going to get their next meal). If you would like to read a good post-apocalypse book take a look at Alas, Babylon. A little dated (cold war) but a much better read than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Democracy is dispensable? Get this at the library.","review":"There is a lot to like about this book; it's a smart treatment of the subject matter. I found it entertaining at the beginning, though my ability to care about the characters or even the fate of the earth eroded to nothing by the end.Racism and sexism can be portrayed without implying that the reader should agree with racist and sexist attitudes. However, I'm afraid nothing in this narrative actually suggests that one should regard either its vile depiction of black people or its characters' paternalist attitudes with a critical eye.Also, the characters reinvent feudalism/monarchy without any apparent regret or even self-awareness, so the message seems to be that preserving democracy is not important to saving civilization.If you must pay money for it, get a used copy, and be prepared to hold your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read","review":"Seriously. First it is so incredibly dated. But I can only fault myself for that as I didn't check the publication date and thought it was a fairly recent book. The worst type of being dated. It was dated in the '70s. Other than that it is INCREDIBLY BORING. Just incredibly boring. It really just became a scan read. But to back up my poor review I will just put down one plot hole. The writer's description of the damage of the comet hit was just too much. NOTHING would have survived that. Than add 50 nuclear weapons fired at China by Russia and then 50 or so nuclear weapons fired at Russia from China. I'm just getting angry writing this review...that's how horrible an disappointing this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"Written back in 1977, this book was all of he '70's disaster movies wrapped into one long and boring novel. The only thing missing was OJ Simpson in a security guard uniform! It was a struggle just trying to get past the first 200 pages or so, that's how long it took the authors to introduce all of the characters in this book. When the comet hit it didn't get any better....only worse! After suffering through a little more than half way through this slow paced disaster I just skimmed ahead and finally put it down for good. If your looking for a good post apocalyptic book pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it \\"0\\" stars?","review":"You know a book is bad when EVERYONE in your book club, regardless of political, spiritual or social background unanimously hated it! (With the exception of the person who picked the book, who is now believed to have some mental defect). The only positive thing we could agree on was that the \\"concept\\" was good... but that was it. It had waaaaay to many characters, the writing was confusing, no doubt due to the fact that there are 2 authors, most of the storylines are completely ridiculous, and by the end you wish everyone had just died upon impact. No one was worthy of survival.The story takes place right where I live, so from a personal perspective I could appreciate the location, I knew where the towns and freeways were, but beyond that I have nothing but contempt for this book. It is now just hours of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good End of Civilization Read","review":"Picture the movie Armageddon set in the 70's. But instead of blowing the asteroid (comet in the book) up, it hits. The desription of the devestation of southern California is obviously well thought out and described. Also the authors do a good job with what would happen to people immediately after the destruction of civilization. (grouping together, canibalism etc.) I wish more was written about what happens in other parts of the country and world though, the entire book is set in California. If you liked Swan Song by Robert McCammon (McGammon?) Or The Stand you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of the world apocalypse....eventually","review":"I read this book years ago. I can't understand the \\"rave\\" reviews.

Then all the apocalyptic stuff finally occurs, but by then I was too bored to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Fudge Sundae Falls on a Tuesdae","review":"A very good 'end of the world' novel. In this case the cause is a comet which hits the earth, causing massive tsunamis, earthquakes, and huuricanes. The comet also will change the earth's climate, causing a new ice-age.The book concentrates on a number of disparate individuals from southern California, before and after the disaster. Fortunately pockets of order do survive, but will they be able survive roving gangs, and the coming winter? Much of the compelling storytelling comes from examining how different people cope when civilization collapses and anarchy rules. Depressing reading when one realises how fragile our modern world is and how easily humanity can descend back into barbarism."},{"rating":"2","title":"We should never lose hope.","review":"This is a great book people. If you're looking for something different, something that after you've read it your world and values change for a week or two, this is that book. We've all seen the 90's asteroid, end of the world movies and how they are somewhat lacking in taste and depth. Well, don't expect anything but the best from this work. This pair of authors carefully put together a tapestry of lives that run together to form a complete world. The tattered remains after civilization is ended is deeply described and how those lives cling to the tatters in hope of a new beginning.We should never lose hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A child of the 70s...","review":"I grew up in the 70s, and the book pretty much nails the culture back then.

I read this book originally 25 years ago and recalled it fondly enough to download it again on my Kindle. Reading it again with the experience of witnessing the LA riots and the hell that was the Katrina disaster I saw the book in an entirely different light. 25 years ago I read the book as pure science fiction and an enjoyable read, I now see it as a not so farfetched expose on the inhumanity that can and does occur in the absence of the rule of law in any disaster situation much less an apocalypse.The book is dated in terminology and the societal prejudices of the 1970's and is a bit slow getting going as the authors introduce the reader to a rather large cast of characters leading up to \\"Hammer Fall\\". But from there on it's a roller-coaster ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This is a very good book for those that enjoy \\"end of civilization\\" books. A must add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This book is by far my favorite contemporary novel. It's a classic and a metaphor for what we are going through now. All the main characters of our contemporary drama are here...environmentalists, feminists, techno geeks etc. It's way ahead of it's time and was written at the beginning of this present era. It's true the novel starts slow because of introducing the characters, but even that is enjoyable if you read it again and I've read it five times. My favorite scene is the surfers catching the tidal wave off Santa Monica. What a hoot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle are now my favorite authors!","review":"The first book I read by these authors and the best so far. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. It protrays an unusual view on how society would run if a major disaster occured. While reading, I found myself gripping the book so tight my knuckles began to ache. It was exciting and suspenseful all the way through. You're put into the story and feel the urgency of certain situations. I'd recommend this book to anyone with a taste for adventure and suspense. I'm now addicted to the books that Niven and Pournelle write together.

LH gives good treatment to the thought processes of people both before and after the impact, and gives a realistic depiction of what people would probably do in the days following this disaster. LH does hard science and soft science equally well and ties all the storylines together at the end in a tidy fashion. I have been aware of this book for years, but did not buy it because movie treatment of this topic had been so weak. I finally picked the book up after Amazon adjusted my recommendations based on my purchase of \\"I am Legend,\\" another book better than any movie using it as a base. I give LH the maximum rating because it doesn't pull punches when it comes to the tough choices people would have to make in the scenarios set forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"I just loved this story.

Everyone heads to the hills--and one of the hills they are headed to is the same small town in the foothills where I live today. It was so much fun to read about places that I know--though some things have changed since this book was written.I'm sure if the real thing happened, people would act very much like they do in this book.For those of you who love thrillers that are actually possible, then you should read Lucifer's Hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodic and Boring","review":"The 2 stars are solely for the bits in italics and the part where the comet actually hit. The rest of book was shallow and episodic. Without giving away details of the plot (for anyone who wishes to read it), I'll simply say that the tale would have benefited from fewer characters and a simplified plot. There were too many elements in the post-comet strike world which prevented the author from deepening the characters of the people involved. I was quickly bored, and it became matter of will to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it.","review":"The premise was interesting, and reminded me of the movies Armaggedon and Deep Impact, because they are very much alike.

It is so tedious and so boring the author really must have had to work at it. I actually placed a marker at 200 pages so I could encourage myself that I didn't have that far to go. I am proud to say that I made it, so now I'm ready to actually enjoy the book! I probably have no business rating it yet, but I'll come back after I'm done and update the review.Okay, I've finished the book and it's actually much better than I rated it when I began. I'll have to rewrite the review because it will not let me update the star-rating, to which I now give the book 4 stars.

However, this interest does not sustain, especially through the poorly written pages. The characters are flat, difficult to decipher, and terribly written. The novel is an exceptionally slow read due to the wooden dialogue and disjointed characters and action sequences. The concept and science in the story are bafflingly believable, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of civilization, or rather California","review":"I'm not thrilled with this book. It sounds like the script for a mindless blockbuster movie with no philosophical depth. Most of the \\"heroes\\" are simply people who luck out, find a way to survive, and are too greedy to share it with anybody else, who get cast as \\"the villains\\". And it's hilarious that damage to the coasts is equated with the end of civilization; don't they realize that most of the U.S. (the \\"flyover states\\") would still be there? The only really impressive scene is the one with the honest jail warden who realizes that his prisoners are helpless and has to decide on his own which ones deserve freedom or death."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I expected great things from this book; however, it's pretty dated.

The book was a crashing bore, an umpteenth rehash of an extremely tired motif, and--a la Stephen King (and I don't mean so flatteringly)--an evident attempt to kill as many trees and expend as much ink as possible. We get well past page 300 before the first hint of significant sci-fi action (as opposed to random sex and violence) crops up. I lost interest shortly thereafter: I believe that 375 pages or so are more than enough to invest in a quest for something to merit further reading. Nope.

No more taxes! Also 'We have to rebuild society, but let's talk about this fine piece of CRYSTAL first.') Try for a better Doomsday novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"racist depictions of blacks spoil this book","review":"Lucifer's Hammer begins as an entertaining book -The parts about the comet striking the earth,and how almost everything is wiped out holdsthe reader's attention - But then, what towe get? A group of black people who aredepicted as CANNIBALS...- and led by a deranged whiteman, at that! Even here, black people can't acton their own! Not only that, by the end ofthe book, they end up being forced into slaveryand beaten into submission by some sadisticRussian character - and this is something Ishould accept? - As a black reader, I foundthis grossly offensive - no matter how inter-esting the rest of the book might me. thesesections of it make the entire thing unaccept-able (By the way, it was years ago when I firstread this book, and I can still remember howoffensive it was, and still is!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It bored me","review":"I thought I would love Lucifer's Hammer, but I was very disappointed. I loved Footfall so I thought I would like this as well. I gave up on it after 300 pages.It was boring to me. It seemed like scenes dragged out forever, and even the comet hitting seemed boring. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters. They just seemed to wooden for me.I cant recommend Lucifer's Hammer. It was a big bore to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encouraging how many saw this for the dreck it was","review":"This is movie of the week, soap opera, bestseller schlock written by plodding, prosaic hacks for zombie readers who want to read about what they already know.Every character, every scene, every word of dialog in this glop of schmaltz you've seen before. Nothing here will surprise you or shock you with freshness or originality. That's why it's popular.That so many recognize it for what it is encourages me.If you do want to read sci fi that is apocalyptic, fresh, shocking and inspiring of awe, read thisHer Smoke Rose Up Foreverby James Tiptree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucifer's Hammer - Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Lucifer's Hammer is full of stereotypical characters, superficial dialogue, dated references and a meandering plot. Readers must plow through 150 pages of this tripe before the comet hits Earth while trying to keep track of literally dozens of minor characters' names and sub plots that Niven introduces every few pages. Post comet story telling is no better. I found myself never able to empathize with the characters' plights since none of them are believable. Do yourself and your wallet a favor - don't buy Lucifer's Hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which one's family was murdered by environmentalists?","review":"I read this quite a few years ago, skimmed Fallen Angel, and began to wonder, which one's family had been killed by environmentalists?Really, in both books evil environmentalists are out to destroy society, in this book, using cannabalism to bind people together and bend them to their will. Who new recycling was the gateway behavior for cannabalism?!?I give it a 'meh', if you want to read it, find it used in paperback for a buck, or check your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read!","review":"Niven and Pournelle are two of my favorites.

Superior writing, story, and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"doomsday preparations check list","review":"Loved this book. In fact, this is the 3rd time that I have bought it as everyone who borrows it keeps it for their own library. The plot line falls under the \\"what if\\" catagory. Suppose a giant comet hits the earth, what skills will suddenly become essential? It is a captivating read from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucifer's Hammer: Most exciting book!","review":"Lucifer's Hammer is one of the finest \\"post disaster\\" novels I have ever read. If you've ever wondered what could happen after a disaster that removes most of the population and all of the services that were there prior to the disaster, then this is the book. Who survives? How do people survive (those that do), and how does one survive without food, electricity, transportation, Government services (no police or emergency help), and many other things. How does one start at a beginning? This book tells you how some people did, and the problems they had getting it done. I had to recently buy another copy since my original book wore out and fell apartLucifer's Hammer. This book should have been made into a movie. In today's world, this book could be a \\"how to\\" manual.Niven and Pournelle certainly created a masterpiece.Lou Plank"},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling look at the destruction of our world.","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved this book, the character development and description of the destroyed world is amazing. The only problem with this book, and it's not the author's problem, is that it's a bit dated. Many times while I was reading it I had to stop and remind myself what the world was like when this book was written. If one can get pass the predijuces and the low-tech, out-dated science, one will find this book is excellent and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding example of the genre","review":"If you've not yet encountered Jerry Pournelle's writing you're in for a real treat.

You will finish off the \\"book\\" in record time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucifer's Hammer","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago. Scared me to death. Even after all these years I could never forget about it, so I sought and found it on Amazon. Yeah!!!! The book arrived well within the purchase date and in exceptional order for a book written in 1977. I was impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postapocolyptic hope","review":"I like Niven's vision where some people actually have plans for surviving an apocalypse, and he details how it might actually work. I also think he presents a more hopeful picture of survivors of a catastrophe than many do. Not everyone wants to see the complete collapse of the civiized world, but some think it is worth trying to hold onto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a bit long","review":"Good apocalypse story. I would not have minded a bit more shooting. I reread this book every twenty years or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring junk","review":"I gave this one star just because you can not give zero stars.the writing is stunted and changes tense on the fly. Sometimes you can not tell the author has changed who is speaking or thinking.

Money in the toilet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BOOK/BAD BOOK","review":"The book itself is great, I have read it before. But the actual book is a mess. Every time I turn the page it falls off in my hand. I have a \\"bookfull\\" of loose pages!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Put This One Down","review":"Part way through this book, there's a gruesome description of the murder/mutilation of a young woman that really made me sick. I literally threw the book in the trash and haven't read another Niven/Pournelle book since. My loss, I suppose, because I really enjoyed their stories, but enough is enough.Don't know if they ever fit into this story anything about humans having sex with aliens. That seems to crop up in a number of their collaborations. I wonder why.Anyway, I'm not squeamish, but there's enough graphic violence on the evening news. I don't need to read it in my recreational reading. For what it's worth, I had to put down Michener's The Source for the same reason: too much violence, and victimization of women at the hands of men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start at 25%","review":"Lucifer's Hammer is a great and easy apocalyptic read. Kind of sorry it was set in the 70s, but once the comet hits, does it really matter? Do yourself a favor though and start reading at around 25% or skip ahead liberally when you feel boredom induced sleep encroaching. The book is over 600 pages long so you still get your money's worth, but you don't have to suffer through the interminable back stories of every character that makes even a passing appearance. Once hammer falls, it starts rocking. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, lots of good insight into human nature.","review":"This book takes a while to get started, but once it does you can't put it down. This story is one you will remember for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they'd make it into a movie!!!!","review":"A great read. Similar in style to the writing of Stephen King from the perspective of intertwining many characters from diverse backgrounds into the plot.It really made me think about survival should an event of this magnitude occur. It is a fine end of the world story, again, similar to The Stand, by Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite novels","review":"I never read books more than once, but I have read \\"Lucifer\\" three times. A riveting story of the end of civilization as we know it, due to a comet's impact with the earth. The story of a group of very few survivors in Southern California... how they stay alive and try to rebuild a normal life. Great characters and plot. Exciting, suspenseful, with a satisfying ending. My highest recommendation. You don't have to be a science fiction fan to love this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I have read other books about survival after a catastrophe, but this one I didn't like too much. They needed to have more tell and less show, more politics and less sex/relationships, more guts and gore and less character development. Suffice to say, this wasn't The Stand, wasn't One Second After, wasn't even The Patriot which manages to have a fascinating story in spite of it reading like Popular Mechanics.One more thing, the reviewers who complained about racism are wrong. The topic of race was handled fairly because it showed that racism can and does exist from ghetto blacks against whites, and from some whites against blacks. The Stronghold itself wasn't racist and nobody was kept out due to race."},{"rating":"2","title":"best end of the world scenario/terrible and true","review":"we had read this book a long time ago. It sticks in your mind because of it's ruthless truthfullness - people are animals when frightened. The book makes you scared for our race. this is not a hollywood soft pedal book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please direct people in bookstores to other disaster novels.","review":"WAY too outdated. The book is all 70's, and glorifies sex. The characters are believable, I suppose, but half of them die anyway. Starts out boring, then finally gets a heartbeat, but then you have to cover it with a sheet. Unrealistic after the comet's impact.Some people thought 'Deep Impact' was a bad movie because it stayed directly within the United States. 'Lucifer's Hammer' doesn't take a step beyond Los Angeles, except when telling of space scenes or the comet's destruction.Don't buy this book. There are better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhhhhh","review":"Senselessly gory, unrealistic timeline and overall WAY overrated. if you are trapped in a hurricane or something and this is around, it is worth a trun thru. But don't go out of your way to get it.I am a fan of this genre of book, but was very disappointed in the story. It just wasn't any good. Like a flat coke. Alas Babylon is a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated, but Interesting","review":"This book tells the tale of how events might unfold after a catastrophic comet impact takes place. While saddled with some standard clichees of the genre (such as two-dimensional characters), it does contain a fascinating view of what life on Earth might be like after such an event. Originally published in 1977, much of the technological trappings are dated, but it's still a well-written page turner of a story.Some of the discussion of race in this book is definitely pre-PC, and left me a bit taken aback, but overall it's a worthwhile read for fans of sci-fi genre fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good end-of-the-world fiction.","review":"The authors start out with multiple threads and by late in the book has woven them together into a single plotline. The best part of the book are the occaisional bits of humor. I did feel some empathy for the male and female leads and in any book I read, this is a good sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I think this was an excellent look at a post-apocalyptic world. I can see influence here for many works that came later, including The Postman. Dated technology but it does not change the story much and it has aged remarkably well, which is the hallmark of great SciFi. I think the female characters are not very well developed, as I saw also in their other team-ups, but it is a minor issue and SciFi from this era was more idea driven than character driven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, PA requirement.","review":"Its a good book. If you are a Post Apocalyptic fan it is required reading. It is one of the 20ish PA books that form the core of the PA genre. Look through the discussion boards on PA books and you'll see Lucifer's Hammer is always there.Spoiler Alert:All while I was reading it I kept thinking that it was a cross between The Road, One Second After and Earth Abides. The author many times speaks of banning people to \\"the road\\" from the Stronghold. I have to think the this could be where The Road author got his title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Sure it looks really cool to have a color stylus, but you could spend that same money on an even better program or game.

The first bag broke 4 miles into it's first ride. Amazon warrentied. The second one broke 3 months afterwards. Both broke along the clip area of the top of the bag. Really bad design.In the past, I have loved Topeak products, but not with this product. Seems the clip cannot withstand a load of a tube, plastic tire tools, a hex wrench and a CO2 cartridge.Bought an Eleven81 bag with the clip to replace the product and have been very happy. The clip mounts easily, and is stout! Simple mounting with hex screw and has a metal backing where it attaches to the seat. Good quality bag as well. Where the Topeak would rub my legs from under the seat, the Eleven81 does not. The only difference I have found is that the Topeak has a net area on the fold our area of the zipper and the Eleven81 does not.Buy the Eleven81. Don't buy the Topeak."},{"rating":"1","title":"item is poor quality do not buy","review":"the pack is large and can fit a lot in it but the weight is too much and the two thin strips of plastic that hold all the weight break. the first time i bought the pouch it broke after about 2 miles the second one lasted about a week, amazon was very good and replaced the first and gave me my money back on the second but i would recommend you do not waste your time and just go with the Velcro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design but poor quality","review":"This is a handsom bag design with great features such as quick release clip, integral reflector strip and rear light attachment which unfortunately had THREE things break on the bag within the first 2 months using it. First the fixer (quick release clip) broke while I was snapping the bag on the bike. After returning it, the guys at the bike shop replaced it no charge but soon the zipper broke off on it's own while I was riding. That was annoying, but was able to open and close the bag with my finger nail. Now, today while I was riding I heard a noise at my back tire and turned around to see the bag was caught in the rear fork because the second, replaced fixer BROKE AGAIN! I didn't overload the bag at all- just my house key and wallet with room to spare.I can't believe so many things can break on a simple bag all by themselves without trauma. I liked the design, but unfortunately will not be buying another Topeak bag again."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BAG.

THE IDEA IS GOOD, BUT THE FIT IS BAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and useful product","review":"This Aero Wedge Pack is fantastic to hold your wallet, keys, innertube, tools or anything else you need while you're out biking. The quick release works great as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topeak ad misleading","review":"I bought this bag because the picture showed the pack attaching with the fixer to the upright (diagonal) part of the rails. When the product arrived, I saw that the fixer only attaches to the horizontal part of the rails. The picture is misleading, and neither Topeak nor the seller took responsibility for the irresponsible and misleading advertising. Topeak's customer service not only was unhelpful, they gave me wrong advice, and the seller demands a 15% restocking fee if I return it. So be very careful if you order this, make sure it will work for your saddle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bicycle Under Seat Pouch","review":"It attached very easily and gives me expandable room to store those small items that I would otherwise need to keep in my pockets!

I found myself thinking a lot about someone I knew in high school at the beginning of the story, and then more and more about myself and about high school in general and how people try or refuse to try to fit in. I also liked that Victoria, too, needed to find herself. I liked that her parents were nice people, neither of them villains. It seems like that happens a lot in fiction these days. And Max's comment about finding it easy to make friends, but not necessarily keep them was very intriguing. He was such a great character! So alive that I can't forget about him even now that the book is closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved this book!!","review":"this book was so good i read it in under a day. well it starts with egg. egg is a teenager who is afrid of her own self so goes by an alter ego from her favorite movie. then egg starts to fall for max who is dating nelly. even though max is her only friend (well other then the sci-fi club) he blows her off for nelly. when egg is freed up she starts to be herself once she sees what egg is like in person. i dont want to wronen the ending so you should read it for her self. and remember her mom is an atress and her dad is a special affets man. also take note that Egg-Victroia is a loner with no real close friends.i really related to this book!READ IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-individuality morality play","review":"book starts out sympathetic to the loner's perspective, then three quarters through does an about face and tells us the main character is \\"a big baby who can't stop being angry\\". obviously it's not constructive to walk around with the attitude that you're better than everyone, but neither is pushing the idea that if you don't fit in with your peers the problem must be you and you should change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seem like what the back says","review":"I picked up this book in a bookstore since I like the tough, hard to reach characters and read about randomly maybe twenty pages before putting it down in disgust.It wasn't because the story or writing was so horrid. But Egg is a sixteen year old girl and manages to get drunk, swears maybe ten times (I'm probably off, but not by much) in one chapter and did not seem a very respectable sixteen year old but more like a rebel. In the first chapter when she meets Max, she debates about whether Max smells nice or smells bad before deciding that Max smells bad. Just the way it was worded made me think that she was not as boy proof as the author makes her out to be. and gave a very strong impression of being a stupid book.It might be a perfectly fine book, but it is not something that I would ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality Furniture","review":"EXCELLENT value for the money. I bought one of these a while back for my All-In-One, and have just purchased a second one for my old HP6P Laserjet workhorse. Both arrived in perfect condition encased in styrofoam with all necessary hardware and assembly instructions included. Very easy to assemble, solid, sturdy, and beautifully finished.

This book tells the story of one man and his family through his letters back home and the letters sent to him while on his travels. It is not the story of a man who came back rich with fun stories to tell. It is the real story of a man who risked much, wrote about it extensively, and returned with little to show for it.GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the Gold Rush","review":"No other book takes you on the nineteenth century California Gold Rush experience as realistically, together with such good documentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb early music","review":"This has been one of my favorite albums since I discovered it, over ten years ago - deeply moving emotionally, and also exciting, invigorating and eye-opening musically, at least for me. I'd never heard music like this, and it changed my ideas and interests regarding 'classical' music.It should also be of interest to fans of things medieval and of fantasy literature, since this is truly what music sounded like back then I think.Another reviewer mentioned 'Carmina Burana' - Carl Orff's work is of course not part of this album, but I suppose Orff may have been influenced by this kind of music.The info on Amazon is woefully muddled. The performer for this album should be Ensemble Alcatraz, and a search under that name should find by this album and Danse Royale credited to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good rendition of the Cantigas","review":"This is a pretty sparse rendition of some of the Cantigas, one of the more no-frills performances I have heard. It is superbly performed, make no mistake about it, but it is something of an acquired taste. This album lacks the rich textures found in \\"Danse Royale,\\" Ensemble Alcatraz' subsequent album.This is a good album, but because of my personal tastes, it stays on the shelf more than other early music CDs I own. It is strictly a matter of personal taste, so I encourage you to see if this CD appeals to your tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much nudity and crude language","review":"This game has great, action-filled play.

Almost immediately they were shattered as the story line moved from slow and jerky to boring and jerky. The concepts for the virtual world and the computer game the priest is testing for his friend are way out of date. The game is one step above \\"Zork\\" in complexity and a lightning strike sets up the whole fiasco. It would make a poor Disney movie screenplay for the 80's. One or more of the Mouseketeers would have been key actors in the plot line.I achingly finished the story just to be done with it. It would make a good read \\"maybe\\" for early teens.

Then take this mixture and drop it in a pint of warm London lager. The taste should remind you slightly of vintage Fall. But make no mistake, it is its own drink!

The book is the most comprehensive book on deer hunting, equipment, strategy, clothing, gun choice, survival and (basic) first aid. Well written, enjoyable reading style. Clearly written by someone who loved the sport and is a great teacher. I've bought 4 copies for Christmas presents. Great book, great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BORING","review":"This is a great book - it explains the concepts quite well, for a person like me, with a PHP background. However, it's incredibly boring. The first 250 pages of the book is dedicated to many small hello-world-style examples of code, which really doesn't explain why or where one should really use enumerations, structs and stuff - I would have preffered to be walked through larger, real-life applications instead. Don't get me wrong - this book is great for looking up stuff, but as a beginner, it's better to complement it with a more hands-on approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful but sloppy","review":"This book has very good intentions and covers things in a good solid order, BUT, the mistakes are just plain sloppy. Please don't tell me this book was seriously edited, because you can tell immediately that it was not. If I wrote documentation at work as sloppy as this book was written, I'd be in trouble. On the flip side, the excercises were very helpful, and the authors do a decent job simplifying the topics enough for beginners to grasp them. However, true beginners should start with C# for Dummies. I hope the second edition really cleans things up though. Wrox should allow for mail-in rebates when second editions come out so quick. I'm sure many of us would be happy to tear off the back cover of the first editions and send it in for a check in return!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very NOT GOOD book to enter C#","review":"I've read a book of Wrox \\"Beginning Visual Basic\\". The author was very detail and organize (Peter Wright) that I decide to get another one from Wrox.I made a bad choice. The Beginning C# made me confuse with the messy context and explaination. The examples are not explain in detail at all. I had a hard time following the example because as a beginner in C#, I need to know what code to go where, and what does this line means. This book does a very bad job of that.I feel very frustrated that I decide to put this message to help new reader who plan on buying this book. Good day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best C# book in the world","review":"This is one of the worst beginning level C# books out there. Not that its content is bad - indeed I do like the card game example that is presented towards the middle of the book. I've enjoyed playing with that. However, [in my opinion] from Chapter 12 onwards, it is obvious that many authors were involved in the book as the structure and quality of these chapters vary considerably. Also there are areas where two different authors repeat very basic information such as offering screenshots of the Visual Studio C# project wizards. You can assume that by Chapter 18 or so, the users can create Visual C# projects. [In my opinion] It seems that those who put the book together did not make much of an effort to modify the later chapters of the book so that they did not look like a series of random chapters from different authors...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I have stayed in a book store for half an hour to scanning the content of the book.However I find that the authors only explain the C# concept a little bit.The authors only spent about 350 pages to explain the concept, then they start to teach how to use Visual C# !As a result, I have bought Programming C#(2nd Edition) instead.I think this book is suitable for immediate developer.(This is my first review in Amazon, although I am one of the customers since 3 years ago.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"really handy device","review":"The One Way Multi Gauge is a very useful item to have about the shop.

I wondered what marvel awaited me. I do not expect the fans of this text to agree with me, but I found the text so childish and the writing so poor that I actual laughed. The story seemed more like a fairytale for pent-up teenagers than a serious plot for adults. The language was so weak at other times that it was painful. Here is an example: \\"People who live along the banks can open their windows on it, unlike the people who live along the banks of the polluted Old River, who have to use the filtered airconditioning even in winter.\\" Still, the power of the central mythic relationship and its melodramatic pathos seems more than enough compensation for those who can bear this abuse of language."},{"rating":"1","title":"melodramatic and kinda lame","review":"Premise is great - some images and ideas are great, actual story falls very short. Jane is whiny, and the story is repetitive to a fault. I found it to be tedious in the extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Ideas & Gorgeous Prose Make This Testament To Love","review":"So Perfect. This is more than a love story, but also the story of a young woman's journey to independence. Set in a post-apocalyptic land, Jane, the daughter of a wealthy & controlling woman, purchases a robot that is so totally lifelike she falls in love with him. The limits and nature of love are tested through their ensuing relationship, revealing its transformative powers. Lee has managed to make what seems a trite subject so real and beautiful that I was sobbing by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"From my distant childhood","review":"Oddly enough, I seem to recall reading this book earlier than the mid-80's...was it published before then? My friend Shana and I read it, and found it to be wonderfully inspiring and insightful. The strength of the main characters, and realism of the cruelty of many others, made it very intensely touching. It's the kind of book you want someone to make a movie of, but you know that if they did, they would foolishly change the ending to be more like Hollywood. A classic, which I would like to find a copy of, to pass on to my now-teenage nieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing !","review":"When one of my best friends handed me this out-of-print book I sort of sneered at the title, thinking it would hardly be worth my time. What I opened, instead, was an incredibly captivating tale of a young woman I could relate to. I couldn't put it down and stayed up all night finishing. After I was done, I was awe struck. Tanith Lee is such a wonderfully brialliant writer, yet I can compare her work to no other writer I have ever encountered. I implore you to try this book on for yourself, and hear an absolutely stunning love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I only bought this book because of the amazing reviews it got and because it was by one of my favorite authors, Tanith Lee. I had absalutely no interest in reading it, I thought the plot was going to be horrible. A girl falling in love with a robot? Please. But then I started reading.It was amazing. I even cried at one point in the book, something no book has ever made me do. This beautiful and touching story reveals that love is more than something human. Like the story's protagonist, Jane, I too have fallen for something that supposedly one cannot fall in love with. I have fallen in love with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Silver!","review":"I first read this book when I was a teenager, and then stupidly lent it to someone, never to see it again. After many years of attempting to get a copy, I found that it had finally been re-released. READ THIS BOOK. It's a beautiful, beautiful story. It still makes me cry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorite Books","review":"Tanith Lee is gifted at crafting detailed worlds and rich characters, and \\"The Silver Metal Lover\\" does not disappoint. On the surface, this is a book about a teenage girl falling in love for the first time and gaining a sense of self she could never develop while standing in her mother's shadow - and it's riveting. But beneath this, the book offers some incredible insights into a world that has become so technologically advanced there's little need for a working class... even though that working class still exists. All the political and sociological turmoil simmers in the distant background, though, letting the romance between Jane and Silver take center stage. I've read this book so many times my poor mass market paperback is crumbling (fingers crossed that we'll see a Kindle version soon!) - this book is one of my all time favorites. (Jennifer Quintenz, author ofThrall (Daughters Of Lilith))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely story that leaves you wanting so much more.","review":"I waited a long time before picking this book up. I wish I hadn't! Jane's story of discovering herself is sad and yet also hopeful. You walk away from the book with a feeling that it isn't the end of the story, not by a long shot.Jane grew up the sheltered daughter of a rich woman. Her friends are not the best, but Jane tries. Attending a interview with a friend, she meets Silver, and her world is never really the same. At first Jane's disturbed by how much Silver is like a human. Then she falls in love and she does everything she can to be with him.This story is sweet and heartfelt. One of Tanith Lee's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding thriller! Current events, character, and action","review":"I tripped over this thriller in Heathrow Airport and got hooked on Campbell Armstrong. It is rare to find a book that balances gripping action, three dimensional characters and immersion in current events.

Instead of categorizing the items pictured by the companies who produced them, they are set up by the production year, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, etc! There is an index in the back but it's rather confusing and who wants to spend time flipping back and forth! Definitely NOT a user friendly book. I suppose you have to take different areas of the country into consideration but I've found the prices are totally unrealistic. Makes me wonder if Mr. Chipman is wanting to sell his collection!

What I really can't figure out is who in the heLL would want to pawn this horrible stuff off on other people? If they have heard it, I guarantee they won't want a copy.

The tracks are good and I like the rawer sound that they have. The use of the word f*ck is very apparent in the album so if you like a little bit of cleaner music stay away,but I think the language works. Its kind of like listening to a rock version of the Geto Boys, old school Doggystyle Snoop or NWA. Overall, if you own Broke and hated Blackout then buy this. If your new to the group then get Broke first. My favorite tracks are \\"Represent\\", and \\"the box\\". Out of the 14 songs on the album (yes there is a hidden track that is awesome)3 I really couldnt stand:The truth, chicken, and Not ded yet. Other than those the CD is pretty good.

Just because you can write nursury rhymes and throw down beats on a drum with bass and guitar does not make you a tight group. These guys are horrible, and this album reconfirms it. Many reviewers are stating that their vocalist sounds like a whiny baby on this album. Well what did he sound like on their previous albums? He has always sounded like a baby who cannot rap or sing! He was horrid On Methods of Mayhem and horrid in Hed(PE). This band sucks and is for NU-Metal fans only(basically kids who hate their parents for some odd reason or another and just love to be overall angry at the world because they cannot face the fact that they suck).Do not buy this album.

The singer sounds like Fred Durst (NOT a compliment) the guitar work is laughable at best same goes for the drummer. How is this offensive, well unless you are offended by complete and total immaturity don't worry it won't. That leads me to another point, what IS offensive? Well, if your above the age of 12 and no longer find people saying \\"f*ck\\" talking about weed or getting drunk it isn't offensive.

But if anyone would actually listen to what they are saying they would realize that the band.. doesn't really care what anyone thinks. that is WHY this cd is so vulgar. If they cared about what other people thought than I guess they would still be making their watered down stuff eh? They are coming back, rebeling against mainstream.. and personally I find that admirable.

I don't mind a lot of cursing in music at all and songs about illicit activities, but these guys are so lyrically and musically impaired, it's just plain retarded. Every song, really on all their albums relates to doing chicks or getting messed up, and on this album they randomly throw in, \\"We're so punk rock\\" pretty much in all the songs, which actually was amusing.Once you've heard one song by (hed) pe, you've heard them all and soon realize how bad these guys are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke was great, this is Broke Ass","review":"I have been listening to hed pe for a long time and have even seen them live.

Hopefully , their next cd, if they can get a deal, will be alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with George..","review":"Boy oh boy. What the hell happened HED? Keep your day jobs cause with an album like this you're going no where. I feel embarrassed to listen to this album in my car with the windows down for the pathetic and vulgar lyrics.

This c.d. is just pure crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is some of the most horrible, uninspired 'music' I have ever listened to.","review":"Honestly, listen to the lyrics and try not to be ashamed to be an American (or if you're not from the US, then try not to hate Americans any more than you already do). It's pathetic, really. Even if they didn't use derogatory slang like f*g, f*gg*t, and all the various uses of f*ck, OR have 20 references to having sex with teenagers in every song, this CD would still be trash.To put things in perspective, I listen to all kinds of music and I'm NOT Christian or against cursing; still, there is just nothing here to make it worthwhile to listen to. It's immature, it's bland, it's just plain crap. Steer clear, I have no idea why a label even released this."},{"rating":"2","title":"blackout sucked","review":"hey for that guy who said blackout was an awesome cd doesnt know hed pe. this cd is hed pe. check out broke. their cd before blackout. it was dirty and rappy and a hell of a lot better than blackout. if your a real hed fan you already know that. blackout is a horrible cd from hed pe. i admit i havent heard this whole cd but from what i hear its even more raw than broke. i just wanted to say that guy who think blackout is how hed pe should sound. thank you for your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give a zero star rating I would","review":"I wasn't that familiar with Hed PE till ' Blackout'.......LOVED IT......... then I bought 'Broke' and that one rocked.

Other Side). So WTF is with this CD? I wanna know. It doesn't hold up to anything they prepared most of their fans for. If you like Limp Bizkit (like others have said) you'll like this album, but if you like Broke and Blackout, there is a good chance you won't like this album. The lyrics are immature and uninspiring for even the youngest rapper/rocker. It just seems as though they didn't care what they were doing this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD...but Jahred needs therapy!!","review":"First off, if you are easly offended, stay far far away from this CD!! Jehred goes off the deep end with his lyrics. Covering everything carnal and narcotic, Jehred needs jesus!! If this doesn't offend you, buy this CD. The last CD, Blackout, sucked to me. Too diluted, too radio friendly, too boring. Especally after Broke, which was great! This time, most of the band has been replaced. From what I can tell from a couple of the songs, Jehred felt that he lost control and felt like he had become a \\"sell-out\\". Blackout does sound like that was the case. This band is more focused, and more aggressive. Some songs sound like a metal version of \\"Crunk\\" music, Raise Hell in particular. Do not let your kids here this, it's definitely grown-folk music. Amerikan Beauty will piss some people off, but you're talkin to a Body Count fan, so nothing rattles me. The blend of hip-hop, metal, and punk is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen here?","review":"Alright, these guys have the potential of releasing some excellent pieces of work, i.e. Broke, Blackout. Both of those albums are unforgettable. Then came Only in Amerika. It's just laced with bad music and childish and vulger lyrics.

Cast amid competing agents, a jaded general, a Catholic Bishop, Buddhist monks, a beautiful Vietnamese woman, an alluring Southern belle and more, he strives to keep afloat of turbulent events as the assassination of President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother lead to full-scale war.

There are some minor dicrepancy in the some of the earlier code. I went back and checked the code in 7 again and the download code will not work and the code described would have to be modified in order to work. I consider this an egregious error on the part of the publisher and authors, especially since they've had more than 2 years to correct the mistake. I did find some of the information in some of the other chapters useful, but when sections are this bad, I begin to question everything else. I also examined wrox web site and found it humourous that the only errata given for a 2 year old book is only 8 days old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where","review":"I am sure this is a good book, but I have had a couple of questions that I cant find the answers to.

There's barely enough room to slide on a standard grip. To fit brake levers requires cutting down the grip a bit and forget about bar mounted shift levers. It's the wrong shape, not enough sweep, for inverse levers or bar end shifters so that's not really an option; stem shifters would almost make this bar usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious - highly recommended","review":"First off, this was truly a fun game. We bought this game for a game night (party) made up of 5 couples, we mixed the teams so that no couple was on the same team but did NOT do boys V girls. This worked really well.Technically, you need to read the instructions to get the scoring right. If you do this the game flows nicely. Also, make sure you invite like-minded people to play - not for the faint of heart, although how saucy it gets depends on the participants. You'll soon figure out who's mind is in the gutter!We were all in stitches from start to finish, this is the funniest game I have ever played!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I used this game as after dinner party entertainment. Their scoring system is kinda silly so I just got a white board and which ever team made it to 20 first wins. Players get to choose between question 1, 2, or 3 on the card but if their team guesses correctly before the hour glass runs out they get 1, 2, or 3 points respectively. Some of the saying are pretty dirty but people have a choice of the three and it does lead to a lot of laughs. Highly recommended for mature adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This game is not what I expected. Based on the title and the reviews, I thought it would be a \\"dirty\\" game of charades to play with adults. The scoring is weird and the words are really hard. I didn't find anything raunchy as some previous reviewers did. My issues lie more with the things you have to act. I can understand \\"Knee high boot\\" and \\"Getting to first base\\" but how in the heck do you act out \\"Exploring Uranus with a telescope?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that fun","review":"We played with a group of close friends (mid 30s). The game was not that fun. The phrases you were trying to get your team mates to guess were often too specific. It provided a few laughs, but overall was not worth it.

I was excited to receive it but extremely disappointed when I started reading the manual and saw that you can only format this drive in FAT32 format. The main problem with FAT32 is that files are limited to 4GB in size. If you format the drive to anything else, it becomes a read-only drive. This is a huge problem for me, I wanted this drive to store video files between multiple machines on my network. My video files are routinely larger than 4GB so unfortunately I have to box it back up and ship it back. What a waste of time, I wish they stated this extremely important restriction online where people could see it.

I do like the digital tuner on this item, easier than many of the models with the old dial tuner. Also, this model has bass boost, as well as channel lock, so it doesn't play a bunch of white noise changing channels.

The characters are horrible. Striker is nothing beyond the typical cocky/unrealistically competent hero you find in far too many mangas. The villain has no motivations besides being crazy, and the Russian guy is such a shallow stereotype I couldn't decide weather to laugh or cry. The art is also pretty subpar. On the rare occasion the panels aren't too dark to make out and the action is clear enough that I can tell what's going on, I found characters that would look poorly drawn in a rugrats cartoon.
