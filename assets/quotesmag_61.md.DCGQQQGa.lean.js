We saw the Molly movie when it was on Disney but this was our first time seeing Samantha & Felicity. I honestly didnt think the Felicity movie would be very intersting, being about colonial williamsburg and all but it was a good movie and my daughter LOVES it. Its her favorite now and she watches it over and over. Samantha is also very good and reminds me a bit of Shirley Temples The Littlest Princess. These movies are great because they are clean/decent you dont have to worry about anything bad or language etc and they are done beautifuly. We cant wait for the KIT movie to come out later this year and hope that American Girl continues to put out more movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Family Movies!","review":"We originally rented these movies through Netflix as I'm selective about the DVDs I wish to purchase.

These movies just dissapointed me. I mean it ruined the charm of the book and the play-pretend doll. I think young girls should use there imagination about these things instead of seeing it on TV. Also, the coolest part of American Girl is the books, kids will sstop reading them and just say \\" I'll just watch the movie\\" We really should encourage them to read and not watch! This ruins all of American Girl and please lets savor the old fashion charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"well told stories","review":"My daughter absolutely loves all things American Girl. These movies are well done- good production value, known actors etc. The one thing I will say is that each of them has some parts that are sad and suspenseful, and some of my daughter's more sensitive friends were upset by them. They all have happy endings, but if your child is easily upset or saddened I'd preview before you let them watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe for the whole family","review":"The movies are great!

I didn't see the show until they were reruns in the early 70's but absolutely fell in love with the show. The Monkees and Batman were my favorite 60's TV shows. Everything is awesome about the set but I agree with other reviewers that the 5.1 sound isn't that great. I still use it because it seems more complete to me but you can be the judge. Definitely don't let that deter you from buying this. I also wish that there would be a Play All feature but oh well. And each time you choose an episode, you have to decide in 2.0 or 5.1. Just little nick picks if you're wanting to watch many. This is well worth it and the convenient small box should be the wave of the future for box sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It was just what i was expecting!

I enjoy this product, and definatly recomend it. It's the quality is amazing, the shipping is fast, and this company seems to be very reliable. Did I leave anything out? Well, I definatly recomend this product, and if I need a movie in the future, this company is definatly going to be one I check out! (btw, the second season is good... But the first is even better!

Our set is in great shape so if I need a gallon of gas someday...Anyway, if you really want either of these seasons get the first. Way better. The second is not very good, though there is an episode with Frank Zappa and Tim Buckley, whose brilliant son, Jeff, is gone.

Look for \\"3rd Generation\\" if you want the one that has the curved side that fits well in your hand, and makes it easier to crush cloves to get the skin off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time saving device!","review":"I was skeptical about using this item for dicing garlic, but I quickly found out it couldn't be easier. As a guy, I can put in 4 full cloves and start grinding down with ease. Its not necessary to cut the cloves in half, but it makes it easier. 10 or 15 seconds later I have more then enough minced garlic! Keep going to make it smaller and smaller. It's one of the tools in the kitchen which enables you to spontaneously use more garlic as necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gadget","review":"I love this thing. I used to chop up my garlic because I don't like how it comes out with a microplane, but this makes the consistency just right. I plan on buying a bunch of these to hand out as gifts to some friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient, but not perfect","review":"This makes dicing garlic really easy -- just throw a few cloves in and twist! The hard part is getting the little bits out afterwards. Sometimes they get stuck between each of the blades, and you have to use something like a knife or a toothpick to pick them out. It's a bit annoying, but the device is still pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Garlic Twist","review":"I love garlic but hate to chop it up.

We use a lot of garlic & mincing has always been a nightmare. So many recipes call for it - now it's a breeze! A bit difficult to scrape out completely without waste, but a minor inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate garlic presses.","review":"What more can I say. I've always been bothered by garlic presses, they never seem to do a good job, and you lose a lot of flavor since the juices are squeezed out and then you wind up with a bunch of pulp stuck in the press that you can't get out.Anyway, this thing is great. Whack the garlic with it (it has a nice heft to it), pop in the garlic, twist and toss it is a pan of olive oil. Best garlic device I've ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great little wrist strengthener","review":"It's all plastic--no metal blades. Plastic is not the ideal for a slicing device. A large clove of garlic needs to be cut into 6-8 pieces and do only 2 cloves at a time. Even then, twisting this thing to mash the garlic (it does not chop or dice) is a physical challenge. (OK, I'm over 60, but I can still lift a glass of wine!) I really don't see this device as part of my cooking routine, there are much easier ways to get pressed-equivalent garlic (like in a garlic press). The one upside is that it is very easy to clean, compared to a garlic press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use.","review":"Don't let the picture fool you. When you are done crushing the garlic it is all over the inside of the device and very difficult to get out. It seems as if you are wasting a lot of garlic that you don't get out. If you attempt to crush more than one clove at a time it is very hard to get started. Also, your fingers will fall off if you have to get a lot of crushed garlic. This is only good for a small amount, but then again, you have to crush 4 cloves to get a useable amount of 2. There are better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twist that garlic!","review":"This was an impulse purchase, but I use it almost every day. Smash the cloves with the cover to remove the skins, then drop the cloves (I've used up to five) into the container and slowly lower and twist the cover. The garlic gets shredded and pushed into two little triangles for easy use.The first time I used it, I had wet hands and had trouble doing the twisting, but after a couple of tries, I was loving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad experience","review":"I had a bad experience with this company (Buzz Electronics US.

It is far too small to fit more than a few petite cloves and it is way to small to handle even a single medium sized one.

This book had the the P.I. tackling two mysteries at the same time. Looking for a disreputable writer missing for over 9 months and tailing a congressman in search of his indiscretions had Gunner at his wit's end, but each plot had it's own twists and turns, and there was no way to guess each ending. Believe me, I tried! It is so hard sometimes to settle down with a good mystery, because in order for the story to work, the detective must be familiar and accessable to the reader. With this P.I., it was no problem. If you are a fan of Walter Mosley's Easy Rollins or Valerie Wilson Wesley's Tamara Hayle, then this guy is for you. Good Work, Mr. Haywood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be overlooked","review":"This is the first book by this author that I read and I was not disappointed.

The subjects covered in the book include the loss of someone with whom you had a difficult or abusive relationships, the relief felt by primary caregivers when the person they were caring for dies, and how to resolve issues you may have had with a dead person.The book deals a lot more with the relief often felt after a long illness than other topics, and it seems to focus on husband-wife dynamics more than anything else. I wish they had explored some other types of relationships, like parent-child, more, and I recommend another book in addition for children grieving a difficult parent, but the book was very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Losses Not Covered","review":"This book was very interesting and held some useful information. However, a large amount of the lessons and information pertained to the authors' personal stories and the issues dealing with marital partners, former and present. I would have liked to had a little more information on dealing with the losses of parents, siblings, friends, etc., with whom people have a bad relationship and how the survivors deal with those losses. But I do recommend the book if for no other reason than it says out loud what many people are afraid to say - that often times death is a relief to those left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Wash","review":"This product did an excellent job on my Lexus.

The cockpit explanations are fair, you can do better by buying Cougar or AeroGal for these models.

What I really appreciate about this book are the excellent figures and comprehensive summary tables; these are thoughtfully made and help solidify concepts and/or \\"big picture\\" ideas.

This was by far the worst book in the series of Jason X and Friday the 13th books. For the most part the two series have been good, but this installment in the Jason X series has certainly turned me off from reading further entries into this series. Jump over the Friday the 13th books, they're by far better. The Jason X movie was a somewhat interesting concept that has been completely run into the ground by these books. I'd go into the plot and give a synopsis, but there was no intergring plot and the synopsis is as follows: this book is bad. Not the 80's \\"bad\\" is cool, but the practical \\"bad\\" as in this book just plain sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"I love all things even half-related to Friday the 13th, and have so far enjoyed the \\"Jason X\\" series of books, but this was the absolute worst book I have even read. I'll spare you the details, but will tell you this: Stay away from this drivel at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Jason purists - this is an intellectual horror story!","review":"If you're looking for just slasher gore and the usual horror-movie thrill, you're not going to like this book - that's what I gather from reading other reviews. If, on the other hand, you like a Dickens-esque story frame, with lots of character description and background, leading up to the action and story's conclusion, the plot and storyline become quickly apparent. Even better if you can pick up on, and like, the author's quirky ancedotes and allusions to time periods both past and present. This is an intellectual horror story, so if slasher gore is solely what you crave, I suggest you look elsewhere. If you have the mind to be pleasantly surprised by this author's clever turn of phrase and semi-autobiographical write-ins, then you'll find this story to be right up your alley. I found it be be quite enjoyable and well worth my time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the plants (i.e. the first two reviews)!!!!","review":"By far, the worst book of the Jason X series. Hell, it may even be one the worst books ever published. It's hard to put into words how incoherent this book actually is (but I'll try anyway). If you strung random words and phrases together in sentences, the end result would sound like a typical passage from Jason X: Death Moon. Go ahead, try it. Yes, it's that bad. So, in conclusion, if you enjoy incoherent prose, piss-poor attempts at \\"cyberpunk\\" imagery, and a general sense of being ripped-off, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few words to describe how bad...","review":"I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book. It is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and \\"created\\" a book. I could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEGO Droids Battle Pack","review":"The price was good.

That said, I think it's a cool set. It comes with a droid speeder, with some clear bricks because they're not supposed to be there. There is a hatch, witch I told you about, that keeps the droid on lookout. The lightsaber peice(x4)is in here.(I also saw it in Indy one). Super Battle droids,(siver-ish gray), are a nice exclusive.

I've had it for quite some time now. It doesn't seem to leak grease all over the place, which is a huge benefit (and a huge problem with most grease guns). The connector stays on tight, which can be annoying at times but you can loosen it and it seems to pump a consistent and reasonable quantity of grease per pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not load","review":"Today, I attempted to use this grease gun for the first time since I purchased it earlier this year. I followed the loading instructions as written but was unable to reinsert the follower back into the cylinder after a tube of grease was inserted. The reason for the difficulty was that the follower spring became all distorted when compressed. It seems to me that the spring should compress uniformly into a nice neat coil. Right now the grease gun is setting beside my trash can waiting for pickup next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Car Kit Instead","review":"The home docking station cuts off the FM tuner capability enough to render that feature useless to transmit to other FM radios in the house.

Of course this is the kind of book people don't really buy for the dialogue...Having that in mind, the pictures have to do the job, which is not the case here. The drawing is primary, not even high-school-sketching-on the back of your notebook quality.

Stone sold his soul and lived a long and fruitful life, the devil not bothering him at all due to the promised eventual payoff.Came time for the payoff, Jabez Stone hired the F. Lee Bailey of the time, silver toungued orator Daniel Webster. The jury was picked by the Devil, no voir dire there. And Webster started his talk. It's good reading today if you can find it.I have searched hard for a Complete Works of Benet, prose and poetry. His ouevre is not so great that it should be difficult to do. There are many other good stories in there, Johnny Pye and the Fool Killer, By the Waters of Babylon, and poems, too, John Brown's Body of course, but How Hillbilly Jim Won The Georgia Fiddler's Contest, too, and a host of others.

In fact this is the only fiction novel I have ever not finished. I've read hundreds. It does start off interesting as other have said, but everything from the prose to the plot falls apart during the middle.The banter with the main characters wife gets very old...

Well done Mister Heinlein.This book? In a word--UGH! The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next. Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining. Sometimes it is none of those. And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book. Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300. And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid. Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.Bottom line: Do not recommend. But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the possibilities","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who note that this should not be your first Heinlen book. With that said, this and many of his books are about the possibilities we all forget about as we grow older. The title of the book comes from a particular scene in the book when the main character learns a little more about the cat, Pixel. It seems Pixel can walk through walls because he doesn't know you can't! If only we all approached life without those preconceived notions about what we can or can't do! This reminder makes this one of my favorite Heinlen books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Can't Get It Up","review":"As a boy, the new Boy Scout \\"Boy's Life\\" magazine with a Heinlein story was a red letter day in my life. By age 12, I had read everything in my local library by the \\"Dean\\" and convinced my mother to get her library card so I could check the adult Heinlein books out till I was old enough to get my own card.By my 20's I was reading some of Heinlein's classics for the 4th or 5th time.Then I bought \\"Cat\\". It was the first book I've ever thrown in the trash unfinished.I'd noticed a tendency of Heinlein to get more and more sexually explicit in his books and figured it was the \\"007\\" effect, more public demand for those type books and the sexual revolution. In \\"Cat\\", the explicitness was more \\"I can't do this stuff anymore so let me share my fantasies with you.\\"Since then, I look back in regret at the loss of a great hard science writer of fiction to the old man that wrote sexual fantacy in the league of \\"Barbarella.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I was loaned this book by a friend who raved about it. I read it while sick and bed and ended up preferring to stare at a wall. \\"This is not a book to be put down lightly, but to be thrown with great force...\\" RAH's vision of the future is fascinating, but for that I would rather read William Gibson. From the implausible plot to the unnatural (read silly) dialog, I was irratated from the 5th page. As highly as RAH is praised as a writer one would think his characters would be more believable. His female character (whatever her name was) is completely false, obviously written by a man. The dialog between the two main characters is completely fatuous. I wouldn't even recommend this book to a 13 year old boy (the only audience who may find this poorly-conceived, horribly-written waste of trees entertaining)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good value","review":"Robert Heinlein has written lots of very good books. I have read all of them. This is simply not one of them. It's value is to provide data on his decline as an author. His last few books are simply not good value (except to his bank account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Heinlein's best","review":"I am a fan of Heinlein's books and normally have nothing but praise for his writing as well as his expressed philosophy. \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\" are perfect examples of what I mean, both in style as well as philosophy. \\"Cat\\" starts out well enough, promising to be a sequel to \\"Moon\\" in style and storyline. But then Heinlein goes astray. His dialog tends to get lost in meaningless, erudite chatter that does nothing but camouflage the action. The plot has many loose ends that are never explained or tied into the story. The motivation of his characters is weak or non-existent and he gets lost in his late-years philosophy of \\"free sex with everyone and shame for none\\". By the end of the book, I was asking myself why I had read it - or at least finished it. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandmaster produces rotten step-child","review":"Stranger in a Strange Land was one of the best books I have ever read, so I was eager to try another Heinlein book. To compare that novel with The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, would be like comparing the movie Taxi Driver to a bad made for tv special. I was offended at the dialog. I don't have anything against an author's predisposition with giving all the women spankings, or talking about their \\"crinkled areolas\\", but the delivery of all the protagonist's dialog was trite and unnatural. The first half of the book moves along nicely. Lot's of adventure and near scrapes from antagonists abound. Then confusion sets in. The numerous aliases used by several characters, combined with a derailed plot, totally jumps the shark midway through. I was dismayed when finishing the book, and checked the reviews on Amazon to see if there wasn't something wrong with me. Apparently, I am not the only one disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature, this is not...","review":"I admit, I'm a fan of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND and FRIDAY. That's about it. TIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE falls as a guilty pleasure. But this isn't good literature, it is not good science-fiction literature, and it's one bad book. The plot actually does start out promising. At first it seems to be a murder mystery that has more than 1 implication to the rest of the world. Then Heinlein looses it. He goes back to ...THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST ... So from that point forward the plot just goes downhill, nonsensical, want-to-be symbolical but just fall short dime store novel. I really had high hopes for it as it DOES START OUT WELL but toward the middle and end it just makes one wonder if Heinlein's faculties were all there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am looking an ebook, not an audio book.","review":"My search criteria does mention audio book or audible.com and yet I am being given \\"recommendation\\" for an Audible.com product.I want to READ Heinlein, not listen to him. How do I block all offerings of audio books and mention of Audible.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put the book in Kindle format.","review":"You know, I enjoy reading. I do NOT enjoy being read to, because I am not two years old any more. I'm sure this audio book is probably great for people who enjoy that sort of thing, and Heinlein is a fantastic author (although if you are new to him I certainly wouldn't start with this book). What I want is the printed word in a readable electronic format. Are you listening, Kindle people? I don't enjoy being read to and I will not buy this audio book to play on my Kindle device. If you are producing audio books instead of electronic print books to get me to spend more money, I'm here to tell you it isn't going to work! Print the damn book in a Kindle format and I will buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"title misleading","review":"there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was \\"well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future\\" it was too focused on that ...I liked \\"Stranger In a Strange Land\\" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking to the reader,","review":"I am a great lover of the words of Heinlein. But this book has got to be one of his worst. While it has some very interesting quantum physics threads, and some interesting character as aware entity moments, it does not hold together. The relationships of the main character and his children (near the end of the book) are confusing and more explicit than needed/wanted. The 'mysteries' the main character was trying to solve fell apart like wet tissue paper. I was dissapointed that the ending did not allow resolution of many issues the book tried to explore. What was heinlein thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinlein the ideologue overwhelms Heinlein the storyteller","review":"This book shares much in common with \\"Number of the Beast\\". Both begin with the hero pursued by unidentified nasties. He quickly acquires a loving but mysterious wife, then runs for his life for a couple of hundred pages, with you turning pages quickly to see how it turns out. Then it gets weird.Heinlein's love late in his life of multipersonality soliphism (we made the universe up between us.) overwhelms the story and plot, characterization, and everything else just dissolve. Lots of potential wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple chapters short of being a good book","review":"After reading this, I am still not impressed by Heinlein's work. Perhaps his earlier works were better and I will read those to give him a fair shake. The first two sections of the book was very well written - interesting characters and good plot movement. The last section was too much of a family reunion - lots of hugging and talking but nothing else. Since I haven't read his earlier works, I wasn't impressed with the reappearance of his older characters. Also I think my copy of the is missing a few pages at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time and paper","review":"I agree with several other reviewers here that the first half of the book was entertaining but the ending is so boring as to seem irrevelant. Some great books such as 2001 have endings that leave you scratching your head but this does not detract from the whole. This book was so bad that i threw it away after having read 350 out of 388 pages. I simply did'nt care what happened and this is one of the few times i feel cheated by wasting my time reading a book. If I were on a deserted island and this was the only book available I think I find a better use for it than bothering to finish the last 38 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy Sci-Fi?","review":"No spoilers! Our protagonist happens to be a writer. And he expounds on what ít's like to be a writer. In 2 of these passages, Heinlein is quite funny about the craft of writing. However, the rest of the book is pretty dreadful. Instead, read The Puppet Masters or Starship Troopers - both are quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite sci-fi works","review":"This was the book that made me want to read ALL of Heinlein's works (some of the subjects in this book are featured in other novels as well). I found it to be a nice blend of action, plot, commentary on the world in which WE live, and unbelievable technology; to me, these things are what make up good sci-fi. The narrative character is well-crafted and dynamic. The other lead character seems a little flat, but she is still quite interesting. I first read this book as an adolescent, and as an avid sci-fi fan. I loved it. I recently re-read it after not reading much in the sci-fi genre for a few years, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I'm also a sucker for little, profound quotes from historical figures, and this book is chock full of them. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Heinlein, or for that matter, sci-fi/fantasy in general. Do not read it lightly, however; some of the twists can get away from you if you don't pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"This book is terrible. RaH takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into...well, I don't quite know what. Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain. I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake. It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Start, but A Let-Down in the End","review":"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls starts out well. For the first two-thirds of the book it is a sequel to The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress, Heinlein's best post-1960 work. But, in the end, it turns into a sequel to The Number of the Beast, a rather weak book. It would have been nice if Heinlein had resisted the tempation to end the book the way he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still trying to figure it out...","review":"The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery. Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"Avoid this one.. the first 200 pages are great; page turner, lots of suspense & fun. After that, Heinlein starts trotting out popular characters from his more successful books (& they have no place in this novel!!) The last section of the novel is one giant committee meeting, essentially. And committtee meetings are boring enough in real life, do we really need to read about them in a sci-fi book? For over 100 pages? Finally, the last section & ending do absolutely NOTHING to resolve the set up of the first 200 pages. Yuck. I felt cheated after (struggling) to finnish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a RAH fan: This book SUCKS","review":"I'm a big fan of RAH, but this book just sucks. I would rather cut off my own head with a spoon than read this book again. It's a great book though if you want to read about an old man's fantasies of having sex with teenage girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad","review":"I read some of the reviews - wasn't sure about buying this book. I like Heinlein, have read his books over and over for years, but haven't read this one up to now. What tipped the scale was the hint that the book would continue the story of Adam Selene/Mike from the Moon is a Harsh Mistress which is one of the best Heinleins.However, this book doesn't actually have a story. It's one long chase scene with lots of boring derring-do. Also pages and pages and pages of Nick and Nora Charles style conversations with no content, just quip quip quip. And they talk about sex and have sex constantly, but still it's boring. The guy can't write about love and sex with any conviction. Makes you wonder if he ever actually had sex himself.And the final disappointment - almost no explanation of Mike the computer except to mention his name as the reason for all the derring-do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, worse ending.","review":"What a terrible book. I was going to give it two stars until I read the last few pages. Atrocious ending, topping off a terrible book.The only thing I liked about it were some of the ideas in it, mostly from the final third of the book, but the writing was painfully, distractingly bad, the plot was formulaic, and the entire project reeked of sexist, arrogant narcissism... A few interesting ideas can't save a book from so much crap.

A handful of local LEO's I associate with questioned the security of my weapon due to not having a noticeable retention system. I challenged them to reach over and draw my gun...none could pull it on the first try. The holster cant and retention design makes it near impossible for anyone but the person carrying the gun to remove it. It did take a little practice to get the draw angle and snatch down, but pulls very easily after some practice and breaking in. It should also be noted that the holster is designed to be worn with a belt. The paddle design requires a belt to set the compression hold against the hip. All in all a great holster for the price.

Same featured tripods are available from other brands for $8. Are you ready to pay 3x more just for the \\"SONY\\" brand on it?2. The swivel head construction is very bad, there's no lock in horisontal position and there's no bubble level either, so, unless your camera has digital gauge, you will never get perfectly aligned setup, so all your photos will be distorted.I'm not going to mention how shaky and flimsy this tripod is. The manufacturer was overly optimistic, when claiming that this can hold cameras up to 2lbs in weight. Even with 1 lbs camera, when you just depress the shutter button, camera shakes so badly, makes usage of tripod useless!Verdict: You can get same for 3x lower price, or you can get 3x better one for the same price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bambi","review":"This tripod reminds of a line from the movie Bambi, \\"Kind of wobbly, are you?\\".

It is actually the tripod for the handycam or cybershot, which means that it cannot hold any real weight. I liked this item for its extremely small folding size, making it easy to fit in my suitcase for traveling, but unfortunately it will not work for me. It is a little flimsy as well, so if you are thinking of putting a larger camera on it, I would pass.

This thing is light! I attached a Canon EOS T4i to the mount and took a number of pictures of my home. This is a good buy because it has three extension settings. Fully retracted this is a table-top tripod. Fully extended it is NOT eye level but it is of sufficient height. I have a travel backpack for my camera and this folds and attaches to the backpack with ease. I looked at BestBuy for other tripods and they were all heavy or limited in use; for the money this is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Easy to Setup and compact enough to carry all day!!!","review":"The clamps that let the legs out work perfectly.

Old one broke so I couldn't film the New Year's blast we had.This thing is also very compact, comes in a carrying case and takes up very little room. I may be confusing this one with another but I thought it was supposed to be higher off the ground. About four feet, maybe a bit more, but still high enough to do the job. I highly recommend this tripod to anyone wanting one to carry around, or just use at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"We have had this for a couple of years now. Well made product. Folds and opens fast with no danger of hurting your fingers. Can be easily put in a backpack when folded.

Keeps dog occupied.","review":"My dog loves this toy - even more than he loves the hide-a-squirrel, which he was obsessed with. The eggs are tightly packed into the platypus so it takes him a while to get them all out. He loves to play with the eggs on their own too, especially fetch - he goes nuts! And it comes with 2 extra eggs, which is great.The one downside is that because the opening is rather small, he's stretched it out a bit and the material is thinning around the belly of the stuffed animal. However, the construction is very well stitched and it's still holding strong at the opening. While I think the toy will last a while, I don't think it is as sturdy as the hide-a-squirrel. But my dog loves it so much that I would definitely repurchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Platypus with eggs","review":"I have bought egg babies before for my dogs.

I don't notice the squeaking, but my friends think it is annoying. It isn't a loud squeaker in my opinion.

My Cairn puppy gets bored easily & likes to \\"work\\" for his rewards. Since the eggs won't squeak as well inside the baby, he has to concentrate on removing them. As an added challenge, we hide dry dog food, treats & cheerios underneath the eggs & this keeps him occupied for about 10 minutes: that's kind of a record for him. Sometimes we hide a chew toy inside which makes chewing on said toy even more fun when he removes it. Since one of his many skills does not yet include \\"surgery\\", can't say how this toy would hold up. But for just plain chasing, digging & running around with it in your mouth, this is a fun toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kept the dogs busy for an hour","review":"Both Mac and Katie enjoy this toy.... they initially spent a wonderful hour of quiet, other than the squeaking as they got each egg out.

She will carry eggs in her mouth (2 or 3 at the time), she will play and squik, she will fetch them, she will put them under furniture and then wants me to take them out... Soft toys are much better for the mouth and teeth than hard tennis balls, so I am very satisfied with this toy. THe opening was a little tight, so it took her over a month to learn how to take the ball out, and how to pull it without pulling the entiere toy, but now she can take out 3 balls within minutes. I assume it improved her skills. The bad: each egg sounds and feels a little different, not sure why, some feel more durable than others. They could be a little more durable one broke open after 1 day, 1 was fixed, 3 are good, with visible signs of wear, but they are still holding up after 2.5 months. Definitively 5 stars considering it's a favorite and it lasted 2.5 months.

I had to show my dog how to do it about 5 times before she got it, but once she got it...she got it!!! I actually wish I hadn't shown her so many times and let her figure it out a bit on her own. If you have a chewer/destroyer like I do, once those eggs are out, they don't last long. It's good that it comes with back-up eggs. I found a great alternative to the eggs. If you buy medium kong balls, you can fit 2 inside the animal. My dog likes these better because the whole ball is a sqeaker (not those cheap plastic ones in the egg and most dog toys). They also hold up much, much better than the eggs. In addition, the fit is a bit tighter so it makes it slightly more challanging for the dog. The opening in the stuffed animal really holds up (surprisingly). My dog has been going strong with this toy ALL day long.

The eggs are made of extremely thin material compared to the squirrels.I got the shark and I don't know if it's just the shark but the elastic opening is way too small. It's hard for me to even put the eggs in. Now we are left with a useless shark and one egg, which she does enjoy but I have to take it away whenever my Cairn terrier starts biting it too hard.

Grunting hedgehogs are perfectly acceptable, but a squeaking one, no. She pretty much ignored it until one day I pulled out one of the eggs and put in a babble ball, and it was a whole new ball game. Because she couldn't figure out that going in through the opening at the bottom was the path of least resistance, she decided to go in from the top. It took her about 1 month to almost totally denude this toy of any fur from the ears back. Remarkably though, she hasn't torn through. I'm pretty impressed by that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like this but","review":"Our BC had some trouble getting the eggs out. She ended up having to remove some stitches and then coming to me worried that she had ripped it too much (she's a BC and yes, she did tell me she needed her toy fixed). I reinforced it but this is the first Kyjen or egg baby product I've had to do this with (and we have many others). So I like it, the pup likes it, but she was very worried and I hope since this is the most recent egg baby, that their newer products last as long as their older ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Platypus","review":"My Schnauzer Poodle mix really likes this toy. Usually he destroys animals going for the eyes first and systematically removing each body part! This platypus has lasted since Christmas without a single hole in it, and not because my dog is not playing with it. For some reason he treats it like it is his baby by carrying it around and gently biting at it. Pretty cute! My only complaint: The hole in the bottom for the eggs is not large enough to get the \\"eggs\\" in and out of. I can barely get them in and out let alone expect my dog to figure it out. So, not really perfect, but hey, he loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for large breeds!","review":"I bought this for my very large American Bulldog because he loves anything with a squeaker in it. He immediately took out all the squeakers and played with all of them. I never thought in a million years this could be harmful. The next morning, I woke up to hearing him throw up. I went and checked on him and sure enough, he had thrown up an ENTIRE egg. I had no idea that he could even swallow something that large! Luckily he threw it up and didn't choke on it. I immediately had to throw the toy away. I have definitely learned my lesson with giving him small chew toys.

My Carolina Dog that's almost a year old went through this two in about 2 minutes. Since it has stuffing inside, he can no longer use it.

Luckily there were some spares included but I doubt they will last long either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up","review":"This toy lasted about 20 seconds before my lab mix ripped off one of its legs/feet. Our puppy still liked to play with it, so we kept it around. We tried to keep it out of the big dog's reach, though, since we knew that it wouldn't last long otherwise. After turning my back for about 3 minutes, our big dog had found the toy and swallowed part of one of the feet = stress! I definitely believe in supervised play, but this toy requires total focus to prevent it from becoming a hazard for any dog capable of chewing off pretty poorly attached limbs.

She drags Fritzi all over the house and loves to run around with the \\"babies\\" or eggs or whatever they are. The \\"babies\\" have squeakers in them which she loves. The funniest thing to us about Fritzi is the expression on her face--her lips are in a frown as if she knows what she's in for.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes historical fiction, but don't expect a romanticized version of this period of history. Also recommended, Jones's Aunt Hagars Children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time and thinking...","review":"Jones uses an interesting writing style to portray the not widely known circumstances of slaveowning free blacks. His characterizations are strong and the reader is compelled to consider what thought process (and abandonment of ethics) a human being might undergo in order to enslave his or her own kind. The questions raised by Mr. Jones' story, which is apparently well researched, are fundamental to those who question how (or whether) the human race is evolving ethically. Some may find the persistent flashbacks and flash forwards disconcerting but Mr. Jones' book is so interesting and thought provoking that one realizes that the writing style is integral to this reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Book to Read","review":"This book is one of the most poorly constructed books I have ever read.

Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissent from all the accolades....","review":"First of all, I'll admit I gave up after 100 pages, but I think that's a fair trial. I suppose I see what Jones is trying to do with his incessant time traveling--show the historic and personal effects of slavery as an institutional network that traversed the \\"known world\\" across time and space. Or at least that's what I think he's trying to do. This may be an interesting and creative approach (the two stars are for effort), but extremely uninspiring and uninvolving--and very annoying--in its execution. Vonnegut did it better in \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\". \\"The Known World\\" is yet another book that impresses critics and wins awards with its high-concept literary pyrotechnics, but has no story and no people that really capture one's imagination. It has, one will excuse the expression, very little soul. The book left me cold.

What is true is that you as the reader cannot be an average reader looking for a perfectly linear plot - he might mention something or someone on page 13 and your attention/retention span has to be long enough to remember that reference ten pages later. This book is quite simply, rich. It's one of those books that \\"pulls you in\\" and makes you forget your surroundings, your commute, the nasty guy sitting next to you on the bus, where your stop is...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Known World","review":"Wow. I think this novel is what you would call a \\"tour de force\\". It's a truly compelling story and I have never read anything like it. The characters are very complex, no one is all \\"good\\" or all \\"bad\\" just shades of grey, like in real life.There are a lot of characters to remember, but if you don't worry too much about keeping track, you notice that the author is very skilled at refreshing your memory. It all falls into place. If you forget a character, he tells you something about that person to remind you. I never felt lost while I was reading it.

We are a group of college educated professionals -- many with masters degrees -- and to a person, we can't fathom why this book received so many accolades. The author obviously spent a great deal of time researching the subject, but it appeared that he wanted to use every fact he found just for the sake of using it. The result was a confusing montage of disjointed storylines based on facts the author uncovered. Add shifting timelines and sentences that seemed to ramble on forever, and the result was this was the first book that no one in the book club finished reading. We decided that the author is probably a fine short story writer but lacking in the technique that makes a good novelist. This book was a disappointment to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"waters down the pullitzer price","review":"With this book winning the pullitzer in 2004 and the premise being a freed slave who goes onto own slaves of his own, I anticipated a deep and complex novel with a moral conundrum spliced in. Instead, the book tried too hard in its scope and was watered down with so many characters that you never figure out until the end that there isn't even a \\"main character\\" at all. You can tell the author even knew there was too many characters because he constantly reminds you who the characters are by repeating who's related to whom and reiterating what there role is. You're given so much info on secondary characters with fleshed-out back stories only to figure out it plays no part of the story at all. After completing the book , I felt like somebody was just droning on about a series of people only to forget what the point of the story was."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Known World","review":"Although I appreciate Mr. Jones' efforts in his novel, \\"The Known World\\" I found the book to be disjointed and confusing. I felt he had too many characters and the lack of a linear storyline didn't help matters. One of my friends, with whom I have an on-line book club with, suggested that Mr. Jones could have done a series as opposed to a single novel. We were particularly interested in the female characters; perhaps focusing on a smaller group of people, such as Fern Elston and her students, would have been more interesting. I thought the story premise was excellent, but we never did learn why Henry bought slaves, after having been one himself, or what he thought about it. Mr. Jones is an excellent writer with vivid character portrayals, but much got lost in the translation. This novel could have been so much more and it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up on it.","review":"I was aware before I started this book that free African-Americans were slave owners in the days preceding the civil war so this was not really a revelation. I read books all of the time and I rarely quit on one but I gave up on this one.

I would be curious to know exactly why the Pulitzer committee would pick this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated! Another Pulitzer PC Sellout","review":"\\"The Known World\\" got a Pulitzer and good reviews, so I bought it.

And some of my best friends are humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!","review":"I have read the previous reviews and can't for the life of me figure what book everyone else read. To even put E.J.'s name in the same sentence with Toni Morrison is a crime. The book has absolutely nothing positive about. I live in Washington and have sworn that if I ever meet the author I will insist on my money back. Pulitzer? MacArthur grant?..this book is no more than a MARKETING MASTERPIECE and not worth the paper it's printed on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd looking","review":"The pages are not even cuted; some are larger and ame are slightly smaller.looks old, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't have to read this trash","review":"Blacks owning blacks in pre-civil war America.It's sick...somewhere between porn and child abuse.The major prejudice behind black slavery was that blacks were subhuman.A book by a black man that is admittedly well written and researchedthat shows an amorality in blacks is not a gray area.I tried to get into it, but his characterizations are just too unrealistic.These people were debased and evil in their behavior.Let's write a book that excuses that? The book exploits the worst inhuman nature, then you've got a mostly white liberalliterary establishment giving it a prize?It's trash and the author should have had enough social conscienceor respect for his own culture to know it.My reaction is disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading such rave reviews, I found that I was totally disappointed. The only interesting fact was that black people also owned slaves.I found it very hard to find and keep up with a storyline. There was too much jumping back and forth in time from different characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost","review":"I was lost from the beginning. This style of writing doesn't work with me. I gave up half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it a try","review":"Books can be a tremendous waste of time, or a doorway to another dimension. I do not read entire books to wait for them to get good. If a book stinks at fifty pages, I stop, as I did with the Known World. Look at all the bad reviews of this book; they all say the same thing. The author introduces very many characters that are just glossed over. There is no penetrating analysis of thought processes, there is only brief description of events, making for a jumbled, slow, boring, and confusing read. Life is simply too short to read entire books like this that are written excruciatingly badly. Not worthy of a Pulitzer. Not worthy of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Narrative","review":"I was excited to begin reading this book, but have had so much trouble getting into it that I don't think I'll finish it. I rarely begin a book that I don't read to the end, so quitting was a major decision for me. The narrative is disjointed and I find myself constantly confused regarding characters and the chronology. What a shame, as I think the subject is interesting and important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, From Start to Finish","review":"After almost a month, I finally was able to finish this novel. Except for occasional moments of intrigue, interspersed with episodes that evoked outrage, the plot just plodded along, and none of the characters, other than the institution of slavery itself, ever came to life.Moreover, the writing style was stilted and archaic, and the ending, which was supposed to pull everything together, did not fulfill its advertised promise. In fact, the conclusion was particularly disappointing, except that it brought an end to my mind-numbing boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"With a gold encircled \\"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize\\" on the jacket cover, I was all set to be whisked away to \\"The Known World\\"... but instead, ended up in my own world; mind wandering and unable to follow the story line. I also had to re-read sections to keep the characters straight. That's too much like home work for this reader. I found \\"The Known World\\" boring and I put it down half way through, something I rarely do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soaring Piece of Fiction","review":"I finished reading The Known World yesterday, and it is still on my mind. Without a doubt it ranks as one of the most brilliant pieces of fiction I have had the pleasure of reading. Other than Morrison's Beloved, I do not think that there is another novel in the American literary canon that touches on the heart of slavery, and what it did to individuals who lived under this inhumane institution. Some of the reviews have said that it is a difficult read and hard to follow, but I guess as a teacher I feel that is often what good literature is. It makes us struggle and think about what is written in order to move us to a better understanding of human nature. Life is not linear and neither is Jones' story, but for those who finish it they cannot help but be transformed in terms of the way they look at slavery and the horrors it wrought on the American psyche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Beyond Endurance","review":"I finished Chapter 1 and found that I had \\"met\\" dozens of characters and hop-scotched among several decades of parents and progeny. I should have made notes. No, I shouldn't have. That's not how I want to read fiction, no way, no how.A lot of \\"reviewers\\" like the book. I did not and didn't start Chapter 2. The local library can have my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to follow","review":"I did not find this to be an enjoyable read at all. The story was very hard to follow and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure fiction","review":"Jones has admitted that he did not do any research for this book. He must have researched slavery or at least learned a little about it at some point, but basically he's taking a very sad event in black history and completing fabricating a story. The places and people aren't real, even the \\"historians\\" he mentions are fabrications. As a novel, this is not a bad book but as a look at one element of the story of American slavery, this novel does nothing to contribute to our understanding. Fictionalizing slavery can be done well but if the author doesn't research the topic, the reader cannot see it as a book about slavery but as a novel about people who are dropped into a slavery setting. There's a huge difference and it's a shame that the difference isn't made clear in an author's note at the start of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tedious. Don't expect to be entertained.","review":"I can't believe this book won the Pulitzer prize. The premise is interesting but far from what really happened. I think Jones could have done a much better job given his creativity. There are way too many characters in the book (there is a summary of all the names in the book at then end which is very useful for refernce). Because of the different characters, the reader is unable to connect with any one of them. The writing is okay.From a historical standpoint it is not of much use since nothing close to what Jones describes really happened. On the positive side, he does paint a nice picture of life during those times and I also appreciated his creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar.","review":"Gritty, insightful account of former slaves owning slaves in antebellum Virginia. Breathtaking prose and deeply moving character development. Hands down the most compelling book I've read in the past several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because slaves had bad English doesn't mean they can't think","review":"I actually have not finished this book, but I believe I am going to give up. I've read about 150 pages, and really am not curious about what happens to any of the people. The characters don't have much depth. The author has them act like he makes them speak English--poorly and incompletely--a bit puzzling. As a historical novel set in the time of slavery, I think it may have some value, as the life of some slaves is probably depicted fairly accurately. But people come and go and you don't get to know them in depth at all. If I feel that I should revise this review in case curiosity wins out, I will. I really think there are many more engaging novels out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I listened to the audiobook and loved it. This book expanded my perspective on race and interpersonal relationships. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"Not only is the subject matter \\"just what children of slave masters\\" ordered, it is profoundly slow and boring. I love the jacket cover, that was the reason I gave it 1 star but that alone did not prevent me from taking it back to the store for a full refund!Condi Rice and Clarence Thomas will probably write the paperback version's introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Odd Cover?","review":"I own this book and I'm looking forward to reading it, so don't take this review as negative criticism, but the one thing I find odd about it, is that it has the same Eudora Welty photograph as used on the Vintage International edition of Faulkner's \\"Go Down, Moses\\". How could the editor or publisher miss this? Couldn't they have found another photo to use?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure I will finish","review":"The sentences in this book are the longest sentences I have ever read. I feel like I am reading a rough draft rather than an edited book. Clumsy writing. I drew a map to keep track of the characters but still found it impossible to track the time line. The same statements are repeated over and over in this book. I keep going to back to find where I just read the same thing. The story had promise but the writing ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"Too many chracters and sliding back and forth in time without reason are contributions to this book's failure. Mr Jones clearly know his history, but injects census or historical data just to be a smarty pants. There is no plot. It's like listening to the ramblings of a crazy aunt, mundane events are told out of order endlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"There were some interesting facts about slavery and it was a good premise for a book. However, there were way too many characters and since they were not fleshed out it became confusing as to who was who. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Novel about a little-studied aspect of history","review":"There have been many books written about the slave experience but, to my knowledge, none that explores with such sensitivity the relationship between African American slave-holders and their African American slaves. The book traces the stories of a family of slave owners, their neighbors and friends, and the slaves whose lives are in their hands. In addition, this incredibly well-researched novel presents a vivid picture of the casual and brutal violence that was part of a society where the majority of its members were legally considered Property.This is not an easy book to read, because there are parts of our history that it is more comfortable to gloss over, or to forget. \\"The Known World\\" contributes to the essential task of remembering, and honoring the courageous men and women whose emancipation was written with fear and blood and pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like listening to jazz","review":"I waded into The Known World not knowing what to expect. I was unfamiliar with Mr. Jones or any of his previous work, more attracted to the book by Eudora Welty's photograph on the cover than anything else.At first I was overwhelmed by the steady ping ping pinging of detail and rapid introduction of one character after another, then surprised to realize the vibrant visual power of Mr. Jones' very unique writing style. Like jazz, The Known World carries you along in strange and unexpected ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Known World","review":"I was so caught up in \\"The Known World\\" that I read it in two sittings. I had thought myself quite educated in matters concerning slavery in the U.S. before and during the Civil War. The book reveals to me that freed black persons owned slaves in the South, while I had thought that happened only in the northeaster part of the U.S. A captivating story, indeed. Mollie F. Howard El Paso Tx"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful Pulitzer winner","review":"This novel, set in a fictional county in Central Virginia twenty years before the beginning of the Civil War, is about Henry and Caldonia Townsend and the slaves they owned. Jones does a masterful job weaving together the stories of Henry's life as a slave, then freed; Caldonia's life after his death, and the lives of various people owned by the Townsends. Jones won the Pulitzer in 2004 for this book, and rightly so; it's a powerful book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not an easy read","review":"I must say I really enjoyed reading The Known World. It was not a fast easy read by any means. There are tons of character introductions in the beginning of the book. It can get kindof confusing. There is a character list in the back of the book so that helps. The story however is really different as it deals with the consequences and complexities of slavery whether slave or white. It shows us how society as a whole is affected by the institution of slavery. It does not just draw on the slaves themselves or put it into a perspective that we are used to seeing and hearing. This book will enlighten you on the institution of slavery in a different cultural sense.I would not reccomend this book to just anybody. Its reading style is somewhat different and it takes significant interest to make it all the way through it. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"I have come to agree with those who are wondering where all the accolades came from. There is not a character in this book, that one grows attached to. I will say I enjoyed the style of the book, very non-linear. He obviously fooled those who thought he did massive research, he has said in interviews, he did NONE!! That is an obvious nod to great writing and hence the two stars. Still wondering what was the motivation for Henry to go on and keep acquiring slaves??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable.","review":"I am a German, who lived in Charlotte North Carolina for about 10 years. While English is obviously not my native language, I enjoyed the language and the style immensely. I felt, it reflected the South perfectly. The \\"plot\\" also seems to reflect the laid back South of years gone by, where nobody is in any big hurry, and things just leasurely move on, without much aim or pupose.At the same time, the suffering of the slaves and the injustice and unimaginable inhumanity of that system is told, without any rightous or pompous tone. The author passes no judgement, he simply narrates.I assume, this is a book one loves, or one has no use for, nothing much in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-linear, but worthwhile","review":"_The Known World_ was not an easy read for several reasons: the myriad of characters can be a challange to track; the story, like life itself does not go in a straight line; and like life, persons are introduced, disappear and reappear as the story unfolds. Frequently the narration of the book goes off on tangents that have no real place or bearing on the main story line. This is no doubt distracting to some; I found these diversions conversational (in a \\"southern\\" sort of way) and added to the flavor and richness of the characters, which compensates for any frustration initially felt.What struck me the most was the underlying commentary Jones makes about the institution of slavery - essentially that it twists and malforms all who are touched by it, regardless of race, gender or place on the social heirarchy. It was moving in this regard. I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good New York Cop is a Dead One","review":"The government wanted to clean up the New York City Police Department.

This is a mostly acoustic affair, and while it pains me to even say this, calling them the \\"male\\" Indigo Girls wouldn't be way far off the mark. Thankfully though, they've left off the treacly, juvenile sermonizing that renders much of every Indigo Girls release unlistenable, and added way more memorable songs to the mix. These two voices blend together beautifully, and I for one, am happy to see artists do something other than \\"Part 2\\" of their previous release or band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny movie","review":"escogi esta calificacion porque el producto es muy buenome gusta por su presentacion y calidadlo recomiendo a cualquier cliente interesado es una pelicula muy graciosa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Band Lives!!!!","review":"What can you say about the Daniel Band except they rock. Now, I'm not talking about your typical 80's Christian Metal like Barnabus,Barren Cross, Blood Good and/or Saint. No, this is the original stuff. The Daniel Band was a bunch of guys who started out in the coffee houses in Canada and turned into Christian Metal Powerhouses. These guys rock. From their debut album of \\"On Rock\\" to \\"Running out of Time\\" they maintained the hard rocking integrity the whole way through. Check out the great highlight songs on this album like Power of Love where the lyrics state, \\"I see the mountains and your glories there. Into the evening, I know you care. I see the wonder, when you're my aim. I see the night stars they spell your name.\\" These are Spirit annointed lyrics with a heavy metal punch. Also, Lustful Illusions, Walk on the Water and Never gonna Die are great, great tunes. If you're a fan of good, old fashioned hard rock...buy this album. It rocks!!!! Jesus Christ is Lord!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"I absolutely love this CD. I have a big selection of Christmas piano music and this is one of my favorites.

I bought it (stupidly) without reading through it first for my son's first birthday. Although he doesn't (yet) mind the monotony of this book, I sure do.

I know it's just supposed to be a funny jump rope song, but teaching kids that it's okay to disobey your mom even though it means you'll get hurt doesn't seem right. The mother disregarding her own advice and her children's injuries at the end is just the last straw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable Product","review":"This book was a Christmas present for my son.

I've always been a believer that books can be a safe, educational substitute to the sheer stupidity that defines the content of so many children's television shows nowadays, and that the bookstore is a place where children can find media suitable to social and moral growth. It turns out, however, that I'm wrong. It seems that even the children's section at the bookstore is a questionable place, where kids are not to be left alone for fear they may find something that would encourage rudeness and disrespect. I don't find it unreasonable to suggest that a book such as this one is partially to blame for the growing population of unruly children and adults alike.

You pay a premium, but its worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst garbage disposl on the face of the earth","review":"We bought this garbage disposal last November when we remodeled our kitchen. Didn't buy it from Amazon, but the thing is almost worthless. It won't grind up anything that isn't soft to begin with. I gave it one star because it works great for cat food, but it won't even grind up a lime - just chews it and then the rind keeps going round and round inside till you finally have to pull it out. We even called the company to complain and they sent out a service technician who was also surprised it wouldn't even handle a lime, so he replaced it with a new one (same model, unfortunately) and the new one is just as bad as the old one. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. We wish we hadn't. You'll end up having to throw most everything in the trash rather than down the disposal. We're going to live with it as long as we can and then replace the stupid thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and durable","review":"We installed this when we remodeled our kitchen.

The Hartford circus fire is proof of just that. Prior to this fire, circus tents were waterproofed with gasoline and paraffin. Today, any circus that comes to Hartford plays in the civic center. O'Nan relates the tragedy that made the circus safer for future generations tastefully and respectfully, using eyewitness accounts and newpaper stories. For area residents, the story is brought home with plenty of familiar names, places and stories. He covers the investigation of Little Miss 1565, the unburned and yet strangely unclaimed victim, with particular detail and casts doubt on her identification ten years ago. Anyone will find it difficult to sit inside a circus tent after reading this book, despite the knowledge that exits are clearly marked and the tent is not flamable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart renching and touching book.","review":"I had this book read in two days, I simply couldn't put it down. It made me cry and made me laugh. When I started reading about the fire itself I started shivering and couldn't stop. I felt like I was really seeing and living what was happening. Very well written, it makes you truly feel for all the people involved. It also dispells many rumors and wild tales that have surrounded the fire from the beginning. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"No continuity at all in this book. It's just a confusing mishmash of facts in no real order. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book on a Kindle was problematic","review":"I love reading books on my Kindle Fire. This is the first book where the Kindle format proved problematic. To follow the details of the fire, you really need the large illustration of the circus tent in the book.In addition, this is unfair but I recently finished reading The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson. That book follows and tells the stories of three people and their families. In Circus Fire, O'Nan tries to weave in the stories of so many survivors of the fire that it gets confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking account","review":"Very well written,many details but never boring...Made you want to keep reading and not put it down......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devasting and worth reading every word","review":"I won't go on about this book but to say that the reviews here are correct. This book is good, the author did an excellent job and it is devastating to see what these poor people went through. The worst part for me was the trampling, \\"every man for himself\\" people who were running out of the tent when the fire started. Women, children and men being trampled and suffocated by the crowd due to panic. The most heartening part were the ones who went back in or grabbed children to save them. This is a horrifying but true story and very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of heroism and heartbreak","review":"The author of \\"Snow Angels\\", one of my favorite novels, has written a non-fiction account of the Hartford circus fire of 1944. This is a gruesome story in many instances, describing in great detail what happened when the fire began under the big top, and the ensuing panic and death. There are stories of parents sacrificing themselves to save their children, and of the heroic efforts of the circus people and average citizens to rescue the victims. The book has a plethora of photos, which makes the story that more compelling, because of the images they convey. The prose is taut, but several times the author uses the word \\"ahold\\", which grated on my sensibilities. The attempts, throughout the years, to ascertain the identity of Little Miss 1565 was extremely poignant. This episode is one of the little-known events of our history, and is well worth reading about, for these people deserve to have their story told to a new generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 56 years a Masterpiece","review":"Stewart O'Nan has taken the research and the true-life stories of the survivors of the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire and created a true historical accounting of this tragedy, and a memorial to the 168 people who entered the tent that very hot day in July expecting a wonderful show,only to end that day in terrible injury or death. I was at the circus that July 6th, a five-year old who was saved by a then unknown benefactor, who scooped me up when my mother was pushed down and trampled upon as we were fleeing the fire. I am amazed that it took 56 years for someone to write this accounting of that terrible, hot, steamy July day. Stewart O'Nan.s book serves as both an historical document and a wonderful memorial to the 168 people who perished.Thank you Mr. O'Nan for a wonderful job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very compelling","review":"As a historical text, Stewart O'Nan's \\"The Circus Fire\\" is OK, but to me it definitely was not \\"brilliantly constructed\\" as promised in the summary on the back of the book. The story itself is definitely a fascinating one and one and I for one am curious about the lack of a comprehensive history before O'Nan's. That aside, this book is so bogged down in a massive jumble of facts that it is difficult to follow in parts and I lost interest well before the end. If the author had concentrated on five or ten principal characters instead of 34+, this would have been a more compelling read. I realize that everyone involved has a story to tell, but it is hard to keep each person straight due to the sheer amount of people that O'Nan attempts to include."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and totally confusing....","review":"Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing. His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project. Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER about the TITANIC),this book leaveS you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower. STILL, it is vastly superior to the other work about the Hartford Circus fire that is currently out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired recount of what we already knew.","review":"Where is the story here? Where is the hero? The book is just a rambling bunch of facts about the circus fire, and debatable facts at that. Where is Rick Davey's research? It seems to try to dispute Rick Davey, but there's no back up to that. All O'Nan tells us is what led everyone to believe for years that 1565 was NOT Eleanor Emily Cook, the old news. What information does Rick Davey have that counters this? It must be something substantial if the State of Connecticut exhumed the body and buried her with the Cook family. Perhaps part of the reason O'Nan's book is so poor because he does not know this information. On the first page O'Nan says he didn't even want to write the book. Why did he bother? Abysmal writing, pitiful structure. Matter of Degree by Rick Davey and Don Massey is going to knock this right over on its boring side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully sad book","review":"This book was sooooo hard to put down... I read it until 2 am every night until I was done. The story itself is haunting, sad, and memorable, especially since it's a true story. And the author, while trying to stay objective, succeeds in making it even more realistic with his detailed descriptions and his obvious passion for the subject. There are so many stories in this book that will stay in your mind for days afterwards. If you like history, or the circus, or just a good story of tragedy and human bravery, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinatingly detailed","review":"The description of the fire as it travels from the sidewall across the big top is thorough, but not dull or boring. The author manages to tell a variety of stories that were all happening simultaneously. Occassionally I had to remind myself how compressed the time frame really was. While there is lots of information, and at times I lost track of who was who, this is a very compelling read and I had trouble putting the book down. The author balances the details of what happened; the who, where, when; with the stories of the people affected, telling a story that is intellectually and emotionally satisfying.Besides effectively covering the actual fire, the author does a great job of setting the scene and covering the chaos afterwards. I particularly appreciated the follow up ten and twenty years later with the continuing impact it had on some lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"This volume was a great disappointment. First, it is riddled with spelling and grammer errors. Where was the editor? Second, the author rambles on and on about how attractive he was to this gorgeous lady and what a \\"catholic\\" (little \\"c\\"?) his wife was. Give me a break! His wife bore him seven children, was faithful, and there is not one good word for her? She knew he was scum - he just hasn't looked in the mirror. There are no new insights into how detectives work either. In the conclusion the author essentially says he has hurt a lot of people, can't right the wrong, so he is has gone to live in the wilderness and raise dogs. Oh, what a shame! This author, potentially, had a great story to tell. Unfortunately, he has not done it - yet. I hope that he will some other time. A therapist might help him out, but he is going to have to grow up some day. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratching the surface","review":"The analysis described in the book is a start for an individual investor to do their own research and it points to some useful resources. But the depth of the analysis and process is not enough. Following this process would not be sufficient to replace an analysis by a professional analyst, provided the analyst is objective. In other words, one can not \\"fire the stock analyst\\" simply by following what the book says.Some criteria mentioned in the book are also abitrary, superficial. For example, it says slow growth would be sales growth of 30% or less. A sustainable of sales growth of 30% is extraordinary in real life. The book also gives different processes for growth and value investors, where growth and value should be integral parts of any analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This book rehashes info that is easily available on the web, especially, as the book itself points out, on Yahoo Finance.

The story steps carefully from past to present, revealing Sarah's own sense of being buried, just like the Anasazi girl whose skeleton she has found in the ruins. Her road trip with Tom John is the best part of the book, the archetypal journey to self. Sarah's sorrow (MS), her husband's sorrow (his affair), Tom John's sorrow (he's getting up there in years), Oma's sorrow (not being able to stay in her home), Sarah's family's sorrow all reflect off each other like sparkling shards of some shattered mirror.

There are a few points of discussion where I would have liked more details. He touches on the idea that truth is different in different domains I was left wanting to more about this. While he critiques pragmatism, it may be true that in certain domains the value of a concept is it's usefulness. Also of course there are areas of life where truth is clearly relative. If I say I like Mexican food, and you say Mexican foods is awful, who is right? Both are really stating the truth about their personal preferences. I would have liked more discussion of when truth is indeed relative, and stating that is my opinion is not just a way to avoid argument as Lynch suggests."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Tool, But Not The Only One","review":"We used this atlas for a 2 week road trip through Spain, and found it to be very helpful. I had also mapped routes using various internet sources, and having this atlas was better as we could change our minds and pick other routes, if we felt we wanted to. Sometimes the numbers of the highways didn't match exactly, but that can happen at anytime, anywhere. Maps and atlases are frequently outdated as soon as they are printed. But this one gives the best information available here in the States, I think.There aren't really any good maps of individual cities in the atlas, which might be a drawback. I did need to get individual maps of cities separately, which wasn't that big of a bother for us but it is something to consider. Overall, a very good road atlas if contemplating a road trip to Spain/Portugal. Easy to read and a good size to handle.

I didn't know much about him except from CNN before I read this book, but now I just don't like him much. Basically he's a commander more interested in his troop's welfare than in accomplishing a mission. That's not so bad, you say, generals should worry about their subordinates. The problem is that his missions go awry (Somalia), his advice is often wrong (Bosnia), or he steals credit for others' accomplishments (Iraq). I don't understand why folks are so mesmerized by the fact that he's black and came from New York. Powell comes across in his own book as ambitious, duplicitous, self-serving.

Figure it out. Like most politicians he uses his book to hide his flaws, backstab his enemies (even those who have passed away), smarm up to his friends and potential allies, and spin his career for public consumption. It was Powell whose decisions led to those boys deaths in Somalia. It was Powell who failed to go after Saddam. It was Powell who didn't even see any reason to attack Iraq, though Saddam would have controlled the majority of the oil in the entire world. It was Powell who was willing to blithely condemn thousands of Bosnian citizens to rape, torture, and murder.Powell is a politician, and if this book is so transparent, why is there still a cult of personality around this vain dishonest man?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spin, Spin, Spin","review":"My American Journey covers the familiar ground in Powell's life: Jamaican heritage, New York City, army, and Washington. It is such a transparent spin job that it's almost laughable. Powell blames everyone else for failures in Iraq, in Somalia, in Bosnia. His unwillingness to intervene in Bosnia, or even to understand the conflict there, was an appalling personal failure that led to thousands and thousands of pointless deaths. Powell has those corpses on his conscience. If the whitewash in this book is merely his way to manipulate the public and try to massage history, then its just duplicitous.

It's hard to read 600 plus pages of a book when there are so many more books that need reading and so many more things that need doing.

The series as a whole is just cheesy fun. Four of the movies are included in this set. Leprechaun stars Jennifer Aniston and it is goofy fun, in the tradition of Killer Klowns From Outer Space and Jack Frost. Leprechaun 2 is my least favorite in this set, but it still has its moments, my favorite being where an obviously gay character is killed by an espresso machine. Leprechaun 3 is a definite step up from both Leprechaun and Leprechaun 2. It's funnier, gorier, and has some good actors that include Caroline Williams (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2). However, my personal favorite of the series is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It works as a funny and fast-paced homage/spoof of Aliens. It's just a ton of fun, and includes a half man/half spider, as well as Giant Leprechaun. All in all, I'd say that this series is almost on par with the Child's Play series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still haven't received it yet.

How can you not love a 3 foot tall villian who kills a guy with a hairpick (Leprechaun in the Hood) and the then starts smoking weed with some rappers. Absolutely hysterical. The boxset is the only way I know of to get all the movies on DVD. I have yet to ever see parts 3 and 4 available in DVD as an individual release. Not to mention you save some cash by purchasing them together as oppsed to seperately. Every store I have seen them in they average 15 to 20 bucks apiece.

I fixed the chain right there and after riding for a few blocks, the chain popped off again. Again I fixed it and again the chain popped off further down the path. I lost my brakes about 8 times during a four mile bike ride. I thought the problem was isolated to just my bike but my brother, who coincidentally bought the same make and model a couple of years ago, told me that he too had the same problem.

I think that they, like most bands, are better live.This band really can't be compared to many others, but I would have to say that they are a heavier, more energetic Adema. Their songs always contain screaming and great drumming. They have some of the best talent as far as music goes. No song on this CD is rated below a 4, except for an interlude (#10).

Drew used to be so much more original; on the new album, he sometimes sounds like he's actually making an effort to imitate the talentless Fred Durst.

Always test a new comb on your hand, and if it scratches your hand then it will cut at your hair strands damaging them. If you have short hair this would be fine because the sharpness is high up in the comb, but for mid back length heavy hair these teeth will absolutely ravage your hair.

We bought this based on the great reviews (for this and other models identical except for color), and expected a toaster that performed well and was solidly built. We found neither to be the case. The build quality is no better or more substantial than the $20 toaster we bought this one to replace. We noticed a loud hum when the toaster was turned on, and several of the heating elements did not appear to function properly. And although the product description says it has maximum power, it didn't toast any faster or more evenly than our current cheap toaster. For the high price we expected something a whole lot better.

All I can say is it's very average and functional. Besides the price my only other gripe it that the springs inside are too strong. It will send your toast half way to the ceiling. Heavy bagels are fine but small bread or lighter english muffins will launch out of that thing like a rocket. One time my toast flew out then bounced off the cabinet and ended up on the floor. Another time it ended up in the sink. You would think for that price they could make something a little better.

His main argument is that the reparations did not save the US money or jobs, but instead cost them more. He argues the money spent sending Mexicans back to Mexico was more than welfare given to Mexicans. and jobs were not freed up, since most Americans wouldn't work the jobs Mexicans did. So instead, it caused a labor crisis for many employers. However, he doesn't argue this well. He instead writes a social history of the reparations. Who was sent back, what their experience was like, what the Mexican government did to help, etc.... He did not even explore the social reasons for the repatriation in detail.

I am 70 and have known many of the survivors (especially since many were children who were 10 or more years younger than soldiers). Some would share their story with me, some could not, but I believe that one thing that kept many alive was the need TO BEAR WITNESS.

But the tape is... well... very silly. One couple does a thing called \\"undulating\\" where they go outside and do a sort of standing snake-dance- naked. This is not stimulating or educational- it's hillarious. The basic message of the tape was to delay or eliminate orgasm. Come on, now, really!!! One couple had the sense to do their part clothed, and some couples were not entirely goofy, but this was definitely not worth the cash for the tiny bit it taught- that you should be sensitive to each other and take time with foreplay.

The show lived up to it's name sake. One reviewer said the animation in some of the episodes appeared rushed. Yes. In the special feature they refer to having delievered the prints wet! The featurette explains a lot except for NBC's rationale at canceling it. The show was incrediable to a 12 or thirteen year old kid and still looks good to the adult. I am sorry Roddenberry did not consider it canon, but every script had his approval, the stories were written in most cases by veteran TOS writers and voices were by the original actors. This is Star Trek, the last itereation of the Original Series. This was NO cartoon"},{"rating":"2","title":"great continuation of star trek","review":"it is a cartoon, right, and at times it is cartooony and a bit corny at times, but once you get past these points, it i a great star trek series, with the original voices of everyone except Chekhov, but Walter Koenig did write one of the episodes and it did not disappoint.this is a must buy for any fan of the original series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Star Trek fan must see","review":"Just as good as the original series--sometimes even better.

STAR TREK FANS is this the FINAL trek that haven't come outIf you had VHS you could buy it. However, This is TREK..of all the DVDs this year, this simple collection is for those who loved Classic Trek and decent animation. You had the voice talents of Shatner, Nimoy, Kelly, and Doohan. With Doohan doing more than Scotty, it was a good animated adventure.So it is worth it, WELL I AM A STAR TREK FAN. so to me , its worth it! To others, this collection is good early 70's animation when quality work was still done. The scripts were still written by SF writers and a few other (Walter Koenig for one).The show is better than most the most of the current stuff out there today. so yes, it is worth it!So you beaming up yet?Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back Memories Of Saturday Morning.","review":"I got this set mainly for nostalgia. It's been so long since I have seen any of these episodes the only thing I remembered was the incendental music. I was impressed when I watched these again after so many years. They are pretty much mini-Star Trek episodes. The stories are far more involved than I remember. It's a bit pricey (like all Trek DVDs) but it was worth it in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great Fun...even today","review":"I hate the packaging but that's it... I love this series. Ok, it is cheezy & stiff...but... is it fun? You bet. It is soooo 70s. This really needs to be part of the collection and it is a good value. I won't pay $100+ for a season of any TV show so package delivers on the Price/Enjoyment ratio. That's why I gave it a 5 instead of a 4. Just fun to watch with the family, the goofy music, the stiff voice work, and the not-so-deep plotlines, low budget-mass production animation...but it is just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One you thought would NEVER make it to DVD has arrived!","review":"Growing up, this was an acceptable alternative to no new Star Trek episodes. The stories were minimal and somewhat juvenile, but that's part of their appeal. The print adaptations were expertly done by Alan Dean Foster and were much better in terms of quality. I'm very happy with the 5.1 remix and video cleanup.As the companies keep releasing classic Saturday morning cartoons on DVD, I'll keep acquiring them, until I can program my own mornings and relive my days of youthful excess! Now all we need is Sealab 2020 and Jason of Star Command to round it out!Good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set","review":"A fun set, nicely mastered, with sharp color and excellent sound.

When we watched it I fell asleep on the couch because of boredom. He seemed to enjoy it, but I haven't figured out whether it is out of politeness or if he meant it. He doesn't ask me to watch it with him and I haven't seen him watch it since that night.So basically, I'm disapointed. The animation is great, considering when it was made, and the characters from the original series did the voice-overs. But it's just not the same as watching the \\"real\\" Captain Kirk navigate through space....Dare to NOT boldy go where I went with this DVD. Unless you'd like to just have it collect dust on your DVD shelf..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good episodes but overall not so good","review":"I think people giving this set 4 stars is more for nostalgic value than anything else. For years I thought of these (in my mind) as great episodes because I remember them that way from childhood than I obtained a VHS copy and they weren't exactly good. You can tell they did these on a shoestring budget, James Doohan does almost every voice on the show and the animation is so so. Buy it if you are a die hard Trekker but I dont think many kids would have interest in these today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I watched these when growing up, and wanted my 9 year old daughter to see them. They are great! Some are better than others (of course), but overall they are very enjoyable. The drawbacks: the animation isn't the best, and they tried to use as few voices as possible. Plus the actors weren't quite as \\"animated\\" (pardon the pun) as they were on the original series. Other than this, though, the story lines are mostly quite good and I enjoy most episodes as much as my daughter does."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Fans of Star Trek, The Original Series","review":"If you've purchased the original Star Trek DVDs, then you'll want to also see Star Trek The Animated Series. You can really tell that Gene Roddenberry was involved with the stories as they compliment the original shows beautifully. The character development and story lines are exceptionally well done and the animation allowed them to introduce exotic aliens on other worlds without having to resort to low-budget costumes and makeup that were sometimes needed to create aliens on the original show. Overall this series is lots of fun, full of surprises, and a bargain price to enjoy some additional adventures that includes most of the original cast performing their voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Stories are Really Good","review":"I remember watching a few of these when they were on TV but I sure did not remember they were this good.

I gave the series to a friend for Christmas and we watched some of them right away. If you think the original TV show was wacky, you have yet to see anything. The episodes are choppy, the logic behind them is more than questionable, the animation is rediculous, and the dialogue makes veiwers weep. All in all, an extremely trippy adventure for all those who love the original show and have an off-kilter sense of humor. If you're looking for hard-core Shatnerian Trekkie goodness with all the charm of the original, you may need to look again. Mostly, these are just good for giggles. Viewing is only advised in small doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyages of the animated Star Trek","review":"Do you like Star Trek? What about cartoons?

Don't know what else to say!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy but cool!","review":"The 1973 Filmation series reunited the original cast before the film series...so it can be bad, right? It took advantage of the animated media to put \\"another\\" alien on the bridge, to up the ante on the scale of the foes and the space battles. On the down side it was Filmation, and the look is far from mold-breaking, the sound fx are at times familiar,and at times cheesy stock sound from Filmation. But the primary colors are as much a joy here as in the original series.

The DVD extras shed some light on the challenges and bonus of creating the animated series as well as connecting the show to the live action series of the last forty years.

I can log in from work and peek into his room.The camera is very easy to set up, and I have it running on my wireless network with no problems. The power cord could (and should) be longer, but other than that I have no real complaints.

But they say I should return the camera at my cost, and they will ship me a new one by ground.

Some of the features that dont work are the ablilty to name cameras and it sometimes just misses one of the 4 cameras for no apparent reason.

The fuzziness, darkness and graininess of the image is quite incredible to behold.The camera is also surprisingly big. I have now returned the camera so I can't measure it accurately, but it was much chunkier than I was expecting from the pictures, though that did give it the feel of high build quality. Pity its performance is so awful.It's also klunky to set up, uses an ActiveX viewer, and is generally nasty to operate.If you need a network camera, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality and Easy to Use","review":"Quick and easy to set up.

I haven't tried other browsers. The client program is somewhat useful, especially the motion activated record feature.The camera itself is woefully insensitive under normal room lighting conditions. Daylight outdoors is fine. But under low or normal room light (i.e. at night) images are very dark compared to other very cheap web cameras I have. Outdoors at night with a spotlight it is completely unusable.

I think there are so many variables that could be in error...ports, DCHP vs Static IP, and on and on. None of which are clear in the CD installation.After reading the many reviews of others having the same issue, I decided that i didn't want to spend hours on the tech support line (just hearing it is in India is enough to make me not even call.)I'm returning this item and saving me some grief.

It does a better job of smoothing large flat surfaces in a matter of seconds than I can do by hand after several minutes at the bench belt sander. No gouges, and since I added an outfeed table, no snipe at board ends.An item was missing from my box. I called performax's 800 # and had the item in two days. No hassle.

As an adoptive parent of a Chinese daughter, I was deeply touched by the story of a developing China and the personal impact on its society. Having spent time in China, we were constantly reminded about the major gap between the utter poor and those with wealth. This video is expertly done and gives a phenomenal picture of the struggles of a poor peasant family coming to grips with a developing nation. Nothing sugar coated here. Watching the family dynamics play out as the family makes the difficult decision to send their daughter off to work is facinating.

It sounds like the record company is forcing them to release something so they're doing some sort of \\"work-to-rule\\" plan to get back at them.

And in each of the two long stories we meet a just-adolescent boy, discovering his own sexuality and that of the world around him, with--in one case--tragic and heart-breaking results. Can every story be \\"the best\\"? Maybe not, but in this collection, Davenport comes very close"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splurge on the Hardcover!","review":"No one plays with the assumptions of a reader in terms of genre, plot, image, or even sentence structure like Davenport.

I could see where the general public, that do not really know the classical music world, would find this book interesting because of all of its references to sex and drugs, but as a successful classical musician for 20 years now, I can tell you as a fact that this is not how a typical classical musician lives their life. Blair Tindell appears to be like the \\"Jerry Springer\\" of classical musicians. I mean really, just because a person propositions you for sex does not mean you have to do it ... just say \\"no\\". I have never slept with anyone in the classical music world to get ahead (nor have I ever done drugs). Instead of reading about all her sexual encounters, I would rather read about her practicing 8 hours a day to try to win an orchestral job! This book gives classical musicians a bad name and it's very unjustified! I'm sorry that Ms. Tindell has lost her love of music, but I can honestly say that I still love every minute of my music making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalism or Narcissism?","review":"Although Mozart in the Jungle points out some real concerns about arts funding and education in the US, it still fails to be a valid piece of journalism. Chronicling her rise and fall in the music business, Tindall only succeeds in revealing herself to be a bitter and deluded individual, perceiving brilliant career opportunities as sentences to boredom and failure. It's a very uninspiring life story, although the author seems to think she is pretty hot stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic woman","review":"Maybe Blair should blame her parents on her \\"musical misfortunes\\" instead of the industry. After all, one's upbringing is what helps get them through life. Obviously she wasn't raised with any morals or self respect. I'm sorry to hear that she considers playing in a Broadway orchestra pit her \\"fall from grace.\\" Those of us that do that sort of work enjoy and appreciate it and are proud to be there. I have yet to see an orgy take place in any of pits in which I have played. It's pathetic to hear somebody who had all of those wonderful opportunities whine and complain. Get over it, Blair. You could be in New Orleans right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Uncomfortable Read for all the Wrong Reasons","review":"This book has many redeeming moments where Ms. Tindall lets her intellect and journalistic talents process the inequities of the classical music world. What's disturbing is how viciously she turns on her friends, colleagues, neighbors and teachers. Mozart in the Jungle would have been a more powerful book had it not been punctuated with so much personal cruelty towards the supporting cast to her story, That vitriol adds little to the purpose of her expose, or the autobiographical thread of the work. Thus the book swings from muckraking and sometimes funny details about the salaries, egos and libidos of classical music's gentry, to petty barbs, self-righteous pronouncements and catty personal details about the free-lance classical music community that struggles to survive, and make an art form possible. We hope that having dealt with her personal vendettas, that Tindell's next effort is more representative of her talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about personal responsibility?","review":"I thought it a shame that Ms. Tindall spent so much time bemoaning sex as the only way to get her gigs. As a working musician for almost 20 years, I've never known anyone who had to do so...and yet, it seemed in many cases, she only won gigs through relationships which subsequently lost her those gigs. Perhaps if she'd actually learned how to make reeds (!), play her horn in tune, and overcome an almost theatrical case of performance anxiety, she might have earned gigs the way the rest of us do--through winning auditions. The fact that she had to further impugn the good names of many fine musicians in order to sell her story seems to highlight her lack of accountability. Too bad she now has a pen to wield instead of a rather lackluster oboe career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Argued Tell All Book","review":"Blair Tindall's book Mozart in the Jungle is a sad, cynical, trite, and clumsily written account of the life of a not particularly intelligent, performance anxiety ridden musician desperate for attention. She has succeeded in \\"taking on\\" the classical music world by quoting statistics any well informed music lover or other literate person can dig up online. This laundry listing of information is presented in bits and pieces, sprinkled in a narrative that is heavy on the carnal entertainment (a must if you're going to sell a tell-all book at present), and light on any real information. Personal opinion is part of any biographic writing, but to substitute opinion for fact is never acceptable. Grand, sweeping generalizations seem to be the norm for this neophyte scribbler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all true","review":"As an oboist married to another musician, I have a hard time believing anything she writes in this book. Not once in my career (or my husband's) have we come across any of the sex, drugs and nepotism that she suggests. I also have a hard time believing her, as she played with the New York Philharmonic and then goes on to review the New York Philharmonic later in her career. Conflict of interest much? This was a disgusting read. The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one was because it was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tawdry Memoir","review":"Blair Tindall has done some real damage to her fledgling career as a Serious Journalist with this tawdry memoir. A bildungsroman this is not: she exhibits no self-knowledge and has apparently gained little wisdom in all of her misspent years. She whines about work and income that plenty of conservatory graduates would be ecstatic to have. She gratuitously trashes those who have helped her and goes out of her way to hurt former lovers and colleagues; there is more than a whiff of vengeance in these pages. Interspersed with her fond reminiscences of sex and drugs are longueurs detailing the rise of orchestras and the life of musicians, but she breaks no new ground here. She is shameless enough to dedicate this sad tale to her parents. Is she really so deluded that she can think that they would be proud of this ill-considered effort?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"Tindall couldn't decide whether this book should be a personal dish-the-dirt expose, or an essay on the economics of classical music.

I simply got hooked as a teenager because it earned me attention.\\"...and that's really all the book seems to be -- an effort to earn \\"attention\\"...she does attempt to address issues regarding the with current situation in orchrestral/musician economics but the arguments and solutions presented are at best amateurish -- e.g. music schools need to reduce the number of graduates so as to reduce future competition between musicians...so much for aspiring performers, huh?...no, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwing around with reeds","review":"This is at first easy to read & quite amusing.

I went to the same performing arts high-school as she did and feel like I went to a completely different school. That's probably because I was practicing and honing my craft instead of screwing professors and hanging out with the druggies. She writes this book as sensationalism, making her a part of the machine that she claims to have so much contempt toward. The worst part is that she seems to just want to bring down the careers of others while furthering her own, taking far more advantage of her position than did those that she felt she needed to sleep with to get anywhere in her career.

Recreational players have a lot of options, including a new ball reputed to need less frequent filling. Ball preference for most of us is just that, a preference.

They are probably about the strongest magnet-tacks out there so if you have a need to hold up more than the average number of sheets of paper, and money is no object, it is nice to have a moderately strong magnet with a handle on it. You could get a MUCH stronger magnet for the same price but it would not have the convenient handle on it. Two dollars for each of these when you can get the smaller ones for about 15 cents (which I also reviewed) each just doesn't make sense to me. If you like the power of these and the ease of use the nice handle gives you, you could get a quarter inch by half inch magnet for a lot less and be stronger at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"item is NOT as pictured!!!","review":"I bought this assuming that I'd get what you see in the picture -- a sturdy brake pad spreader made entirely of metal.

It looked good on the counter, the stand was solid, the chrome and ceramic matched my wife's decor, the razor had a solid heft and seemed to give a closer shave than even the turbo razor itself. I loved it. Then, after about 2 months, the handle, which is apparently a ceramic sleeve over a metal shaft, became loose causing the blade to spin on the handle. If you try to shave with a 2 piece razor with a spinning blade you're asking for your first dueling scar. Ouch! Thought I could unscrew the end of the handle, slide off the ceramic, add a dab of Gorilla Glue, put it back together, and voila, good as new. Try as I might, I have been unable to unscrew anything, rendering the razor unusable. If you want something that looks good sitting next to the bathroom basin go for it. If you want to shave with it, spend a little more and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The item has a good heft and feel to it. However, the stand was wobbly out of the box due to a loose nut in the base. The only way to tighten it up is to remove the felt covering on the base. The base began to show rust within a month of using it. I am very disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"Everything looks nice on the stand, but it all fell apart when I tried to use the set to actually shave. For one, the razor is held together by a length of all-thread running down the middle that is little too short. I'll replace it with a longer piece from the hardware store when I get a chance. In the mean time, I'm using a different razor to shave with. Also, the brush keeps losing bristles. This is only the second shaving brush that I've owned, so I don't know if that's normal for a breaking-in period, but the first brush I owned didn't do that (Tweezerman brand)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing item","review":"I ordered this item on November 19, 2012 for a price of $66.00.

I'm tired of all these losers complaining that bands like Blink 182 and Good Charlote aren't punk WHO CARES! If you like it go ahead and listen to what you want to. But anyway this album is very good. To me it doesnt really seem like hardcore but maybe comparing it to Minor Threat isnt a good idea. I think what set the Dead Kennedys apart from all the other punk bands from the 80's is their unique sound I almost want to say that they sound like Primus with any of their metal influence replaced with punk. But hey maybe thats just me. The irony that this album is packed with is great with the political messages it has its really a must have for any punk fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"DK revolution begins!","review":"I like this album because it has a mean streak that actually comes off quite likeable.

No, not in 1980..... I was born in 81' see, but I discoverd the Dead Kennedys in 1996 I think, around that time I was into punkrock.Anyway the thing that I loved about this album (and still do) is just the Irony on this record.... Kill the poor, I kill children, Drug me, songs that were taken WAY to seriously back in 1980, and Jello was trying to provoke EXACTLY that. (wich eventually got taken so far that it killed them after Frankenchrist). Add a weird distorted surf guitar to it, psychotic bass line and slamming drums with bad 1980 production (wich of course makes this record PUNK) and oooh JELLO's voice is sooo awesome on this record.

Well if get the Subhumans if your'e a crusty.While talking about how people are in the crazy, f**ked up world. It turns into awesome punk-hardcore anthems the will change what you think about that monkey-ass face we have in the white house.If you like this album check Descendents, NOFX, Exploited, Ramones, and other DK's albums.

Such a great album as this should be in every punk collection. It's amazing how much energy each song has. This is also the most political band, and Kill The Poor is such a good song. But the best is definately Let's Lynch the Landlord. Jello Biafra is the best punk vocalist ever, even better than Ian McKaye.

Awful sound... everyone knows that the slicker it sounds, the more punk it is (take Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" for example). Once you get past the initial shock of the goatboy whaling vocals, you'll realize that there isn't enough about suburban angst and too much anarchist claptrap. Anarchist punks? How original! I wish there would be a right-wing punk scene.. sigh. Anywho, everything here seems to be taken out of the \\"How To Be a Punk\\" Wikihow page, almost verging into the \\"poser\\" territory.Save yourself the headache and listen to Blink-182, Sum 41, The Offspring or Bowling For Soup instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Boring Communist Punk","review":"Mr. Biafra seems to think that corrupting the minds of children through loud music is somehow more noble than property ownership. It is interesting that Mr. Biafra sells his C.D.'s.

Their lead singer sounds like he is trying to be Jonny Rotten(sex Pistles). I don't see how this band is polliticle. If you like hearing songs about killing childern this Albem is for you.

The guitar work of East Bay Ray is the backbone and driving force of the band, although the rhythm secion is probably second only to Watts/Hurley of Minutemen/fIREHOSE fame. Jello Biafra's vocals are somewhat drowned out. This and Give Me Convenience ... and Plastic Surgery Disasters/In God We Trust, Inc. must be digitally remastered NOW.

I've certainly not grown up much since it came out but listening to this crap now makes me embarrassed for myself. Jello's facile, by-the-book* brand of sedition may be earnest but it does not make up in enthusiasm what it lacks in sophistication. That said, this is the best DK ever created...truly a milestone in the context of an inchoate genre (*-it would be criminal to forget that Jello pretty much WROTE the book).

It has politics, ethos and humour in spades. However, I do still have the vinyl alternative tentacles version of Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death album and must say that this Manifesto release on 180gr vinyl could be considered somewhat flat in comparison. While the packaging is excellent and worthy of the \\"Deluxe\\" tag I feel that the mix does NOT give the music space to breathe. This is punk rock and the bass and drums is where the dynamic of the music is most heard and on this release it's all a bit homogenised or flat sounding. However, getting an original version of this album is all but out of the question these days so this is as good as we've got available and I'm happy to have it. The songs are great but they could have made this on 120gr vinyl and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference - a waste of 60grams of vinyl - but still a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fangs???","review":"I can't believe what a nothing video this is!

I watched it for free and I even want a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOTH DIARIES IS MEDIOCRE","review":"THE MOTH DIARIES looks nice, creating Gothic atmosphere in a modern setting. Ultimately, though, it's a hollow and uninspired film. Is Ernessa a true vampire or does Rebecca create her fears to eradicate herself over guilt she feels from her father's tragic death? The movie's failure to support either scenario results in an uneven film resulting in a disappointing conclusion.The cast does well, but the romantic subplot with Rebecca and the handsome professor has no real impact on the film. MOTH DIARIES is another example of style over substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish,well done horror movie","review":"Wow,so theres 2 Tim's who reviewed this movie ?

Her best friend in this boarding school for young girls is Lucy, until Ernessa enters the picture and destroys the friendship. Rebecca takes it to heart, but then develops a crush on her English teacher as she immerses herself in a Gothic Vampire novel, while becoming convinced that Ernessa is a Vampire, and the drama becomes intense. Rebecca decides to get rid of Ernessa with feelings of mixed-emotions. The drama turns into horror as the bodies of young girls begin to multiply with danger in the air. The haunting story is creepy, chilling, and filled with anxiety. Passion turns into fear with heart-pounding suspense. Highly Recommended for Horror lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine fillum","review":"Kudos to Sarah Bolger for her excellent performance in this film. Though Irish-born, she speaks Amurrican flawlessly, even in the specials! (Could she be bi-accentual?)

It gives an accurate working definition of evolution and natural selection, and explains how behavior can be molded by evolution. Dawkins writes in ways that anyone can understand. He explains theories in great detail, pulling examples from the natural world. The book outlines ideas and theories that have led to the popularization and growth of evolutionary psychology, which has become one of the fastest growing academic areas. This popularity has caused people to actually test theories systematically and empirically. A really excellent book that will change the ways one looks at human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawkins at his best","review":"Pseudo-intellectuals be warned.

This provocative book pushes the bounds of understanding while remaining firmly grasped in real world.Sadly, made evident by some of the accompanying reviews, as gifted of an explainer Dawkins is, the close-minded probably won't benefit from his genius.Dawkins put it best, Eastern flying carpets don't fly, Western 747's do.

His arguments provide a fresh perspective even after 30 years. I find the book a must read for those who enjoy some fresh explanations on how and why 'selfish' behaviors exist in all life forms on Earth. [Similar to the Chinese Tao philosophy.] It certainly challenges one's long held belief and myths on human nature(religious or otherwise.) I suspect that's why reviews here are either very positive or very negative. Judge for yourself...even if you don't like the arguments, the ideas are well presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsophisticated Writing masks Good Science","review":"Dawkins has an interesting and valid thesis in his book. Evolutionary psycology proves to be a compelling and meaningful field. \\"The Selfish Gene\\", however, does not communicate it justly. Dawkins relies too heavily on analogies and his convoluted writing style oversimplifies many issues to the point of incredibility. I would recommend, far more quickly, \\"The Moral Animal\\" by Robert Wright. It proves more persuasive through a greater use of examples and studies, rather than analogies. There is no doubt, however, that this science is fundamental to human existence and self-awareness."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?!","review":"While this book presents concepts that are interesting enough, it's overuse of metaphors and analogies makes it almost unreadable. The author poses a perfectly legitimate argument and then attempts to defend it with 5 pages of nonsensical jargon. It is enough to make one retire the book prematurely in frustration. On several occasions I found myself asking, \\"What exactly was the point of this rambling again?\\" Quite frankly, his tactics are peevish and tiresome.I have a better idea Mr. Dawkins. Instead of trying to bring science into the realm of the layman and blathering endlessly and needlessly about it, rewrite this book. This time around omit your attempts to dumb it down. I am betting you could trim it to a mere essay. But then, you could hardly market an essay could you?I would be absolutely infuriated if this book were made required reading for say, an entry level genetics course. Mr. Dawkins is exactly what is wrong with science today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words mean things","review":"To those who say don't sweat the semantics, words are all we have in this argument. Getting them right is all important. No, genes aren't selfish. No genes aren't independent. No genes do not have behavior. Genes translate into behavior, through nonlinear dynamics. The basic postulate of evolutionary stable strategies that Dawkins invokes is now in question in the scientific literature -- in peer reviewed journal papers -- read them. But if you'd rather steep yourself in pseudointellectualism, accepting arguments from authority, then don't bother and give this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this book","review":"This book, written by the famous English zoologist Richard Dawkins, explains how evolution acts, according to him, at gene level, and not at group (\\"group selection\\") or individual level. With lots of examples taken from nature, Dawkins proves his theory, giving extremely interesting insights into the natural world. He explains in clear ways hard concepts, which helps even the layman to understand the book, without a lot of background knowledge. Addressing topics such as (\\"unconscious\\") family planning, game theory, aggression, altruism, and of course selfishness, this book will teach you a lot about some very interesting aspects of nature and its ways. This book was a really \\"eye-opener\\" for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 'popular science' is 'popular'","review":"'The Selfish Gene' is the perfect book for the layperson if he or she wants to come to grips with modern evolutionary theory. For a start, it is clear and easy to follow. Secondly, it is highly interesting and educational, and it constantly kept me turning the pages to find out more. This book explains what the 'survival of the fittest' is really all about - with life as we know it perhaps really only being a matter of the genes' own survival. It is another one of those books from which you both learn and retain a lot of information. With some nice explanations - including a thorough discussion on 'The Prisoners' Dilemma', an almost sociological look at possible balances of 'selfish' Vs 'altruistic' genes, and other such things that you can take away to discuss with your friends - this is definitely the right book for anyone interested in popular science. It is also the book for anyone who is still in doubt as to how 'science' could ever be termed 'popular'."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"\\"Like many pseudoscience texts, this book starts out with an empty assertion that it really \`is science'. Unlike actual scientific theories which make no such assertion, and are formalised, systemized and then presented for correction in appropiate [sic] journals, this book is scantily referenced in the literature as \`Dawkins' intuition'.\\"Oh, really? 1) \\"Actual scientific theories\\" don't claim to be scientific? What ARE you smoking? 2) This is a POPULAR science book for the LAYMAN. Get over it!\\"To call it selfish that a unit of selection has a chance of reproduction is a nonstandard use of selfish.\\"The author is using the term \\"selfish\\" FIGURATIVELY! It makes a catchy title, okay? Go review \\"Batman\\" or something, will you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bypassed by science","review":"I first read this book when it came out in 1976. It had a certain appeal then. However, since then science has faslsified essentially all the scientific claims in the book. For example, gene sequencing of dozens of species has shown that the Darwinian straight-line descent of species from an original cell is wrong, that instead of a \`tree of life' there is a \`web of life' (see Scientific American, February 2000). This and other advances in chemistry and biology nullify the arguments about gene inheritance that the author attempts to make. Further the pop psychology underlying the author's treatment of human behavior is no longer in favor in that profession. This leaves the book as a useful guide to Dr. Dawkins's religious beliefs. I would recommend the book to anyone for whom that is an interesting subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book.","review":"This is an amazing book. Brilliantly written and brilliantly thought out. Contrary to the people who have reviewed this before me and see the book as doom laden for humans, I dont think it leaves one with a terrible view of mankind at all. This book simply explains the way life is, and how it got there. Dawkins doesnt say anywhere that \\"humans are naturally selfish and there is nothing you can do about\\", nor does he imply it(for the pedants out there). And he also doesnt say that that genes have a conscience and are knowingly selfish. Ignore the hype that has surrounded the title and read about life in all its marvellous glory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book which made me an Atheist","review":"\\"Selfish gene\\" is the book which made me become an Atheist finally. Similar to another reviewer, I was very depressed after reading this book; I too wished I could unread it. too late! But I think it is better to know the truth and be depressed than happy and ignorant.It removes naive optimism of the youth that everyone is nice and good. Know the truth - Every one is selfish \\"ultimately\\" - Even the most altruistic soul in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The evidence is culturaly biased and manipulate.","review":"Dawkins presents evidence and then shows what he calls mistakes that actually do more to disprove his thesis. The validity of his thesis is questionable and it seems to be more manipulated than actuall occurance. Dawkins takes what he already knows, ideas that have been indoctrinated in him since birth, by society, and then finds evidence that is that way. He presents his evidence in an unclear way that makes the reader look more into the subject. Upon a more careful and anaylitical reading the flaws appear much larger than if he had not provoked such thoughts form the reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your friends close....","review":"This is must reading, but mainly to know what to expect from those who will take up these old and tired arguments about how evolution works at the level of the gene. I get tired of reading popular science books where one author pats another author on the back who pats their author-friend on the back, and so on, in a bought of reciprocal altruism. The Selfish Gene sits at the top of a giant chain letter, where those at the bottom of the chain (the readers) pay the price. When reviews are posted here saying that Dawkins' ideas have stood the test of time, they are correct, but only in the popsci circles. Real peer-reviewed papers in biological journals say otherwise, Ridley notwithstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dino-Religio","review":"Since all those dino bones found all over aren't just fictional, along with the dating that has put them on this Earth for 200+ My (My=Million years for the creationist-science/math challenged), I still await the momentous discovery of a Cretatious-era bible.

I majored in anthropology so I figured I would at least slightly like the book...wrong. Dawkins essentially repeats the same argument over and over for the majority of the book. A wise professor once told me that any good reader will eventually throw a book across a room someday, and that was this book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life, explained?","review":"This book explains the world. In fact, it even explains the universe at large. Any question you have about the Earth, and life on it, is explained. Understanding the fundamentally simple concept of the selfish gene will give you the power to think about any biological situation. This book was part of my readings as a biology student, and without it, nothing in biology makes sense. Quite a claim, but read it and see. You might never have thought directly about questions of \\"why\\" in biology, but the world is beautiffly and simply explained.I recomend this book as one of the top literatures ever written. This book explains why we are here. The rest is history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution and game theory","review":"It explains the mechanisms of the evolution and more. His reasoning is very much in the style of game theory. Since many authors refer to this book and explain similar ideas, the concepts were not so much new for me -as it could have been probably if I read the book directly after publishing it (it was first published in 1976) . Newertheless it is worth to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startlingly new ideas, very good read.","review":"As other readers have pointed out the good parts, let me dwell on some shortcomings. The title \\"The Selfish Gene\\" despite the author's attempts to justify it, is somewhat misleading especially to those who are inclined to mistrust Darwinism. The title clearly is not intended to imply that there is a gene for selfishness rather that all genes are selfish. The other drawback is that the notion of a selfish replicator is not elaborated sufficiently perhaps because it falls outside the scope of biology. Nevertheless it may be argued that there is no compelling evidence so far that such a structure could emerge in nature using purely mechanical rather than teleological principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly recommended.","review":"This is an exciting and wonderful book.Read this book to get a more realistic (rather than poetic) point of view of this world.I don't agree with every word of this book but with themajority of it I do.It can answer many questions as: why do we behave likewe do? why do we look like we do? and, limited by your ownimagination, much more.The author was wise enough to deal with the opposition to the ideas presented.I'm sorry to say that many of those who oppose him didn'tunderstand the full meaning of what this book is about.It gave me a new bright perspective of the world around us.Mostly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supremely Important Book","review":"This is a must read for anyone who wants to know how the world works. If you have a logical and rational mind and have searched for answers about why humans exist and what we're doing on this planet, this is the book for you.

I must have read it at least three times that summer.Over the years, I have since thought back on The Ghost of Opalina fondly and have searched for it everywhere to own my own copy.I agree with other readers that this book needs to be re-published and even made into a film.

Any claim made by the producers that this film will be instructive or carefully-researched should be discounted at the outset -- it is a travesty of a great life. The puerile plot and excruciating dialogue are matched by wooden performances from the entire cast, young and old enough to know better. The crude political message is all too obvious.

Different genres are covered, including blues, flamenco, classical and (of course) rock. Very interesting profiles of a number of artists, including their styles of play and guitar types (including brand names).

The bonus is finding out why there is so much suburban sprawl in the US and that the Bush tactic of ruining your political opponents (and getting someone else, Rove, to take the blame) is nothing new.It took me about 30 hours to read over a two-week vacation.

I bought this book hoping to find out how Moses became a genius in making the law being passed the way he wanted, how he did political transactions with others, how he maintained his grip over people. The author glossed over all of them. This is not a book for aspiring people who want to learn something from Moses--but more for academics who want to evaluate his legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic (and I usually hate that word)","review":"If you live in New York City, there is no excuse not to read this book.Never have I enjoyed a biography more. It is not just a biography of Moses, but New York City as well.When I first picked up this book (with two hands) it was very intimidating as a casual reader.However, you quickly become absorbed in Moses and feel his determination. Peeling back the layer into the inner workings of the city I love is great.The drive, vision, and stubbornness of Moses is something I think can be related to many current day politicians. While the times change, the power struggle remains. Not just applicable to politics, but to any ambitious person trying to change the world as we know it.On a less profound note, I feel slightly more informed every time I see his name on the parks and expressways around the city :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reread","review":"Back in 1958 I was employed by the NYSDOT,who was working with the Moses group on the Moses Power Project in Niagara Falls, N.Y. and was considerably impressed with them.

Additionally, the subject matter of the book, the planning and construction of the infrastructure of New York City, would be more appreciated by an individual who lives or has lived in the New York metropolitan area. Nevertheless, this book presents a fascinating view of power and politics, and is enjoyable reading.

I knew very little about urban planning, New York City politics, or public works. Caro handles the subjects so thoroughly that the lack of familiarity mattered not at all. Moses was obviously a giant of a man. He accomplished great things and made colossal blunders; he was a man of great vision who was blind to the effects his policies had on the less fortunate. The contradictions are laid out in full detail in this monster of a book. It is hard to comprehend the work that Caro must have put into this book; it stands as the definitive biography of Moses and the textbook of urban policy in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure-trove of information","review":"This book is a treasure-trove of information. It is not only an in depth analysis of Robert Moses a study of Belle Moskowitz, Nelson Rockefellar, Al Dewey, Fiorella Laguardia, FDR and others.This book is about a man infatiuated with power and not money. It is about the understanding that Moses needed to surround himself with those that had money so that he could accomplish what we wanted to build without be 'outed' as a profit monger.The book reveals that Moses was racist towards blacks and puerto ricans and what he did to exclude them from the benefits of his labor.Another plus about this book is the author details money issues in such a way that is not boring and wanting to skip over. He writes with clarity and an 'evenflowness' that kept me engaged through-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Corrupts","review":"Robert Caro's masterful biography of Robert Moses chronicles how power corrupts. Robert Moses assumed an obscure government post in New York, and through patronage jobs and construction contracts he turned it into a power center from which he was able to defy New York City mayors and state governors, from the 1930s into the 1960s. Moses, once an idealistic reformer, ruthlessly punished opponents, and rode roughshod over the public he ostensibly served, all in the name of progress.I never lived in New York, and was unfamiliar with Robert Moses, but the historical lesson of this book goes far beyond local New York politics. It is a fascinating study of the way political power works, and how, if unchecked, it can corrupt even the most idealistic. Author Robert Caro uses exhaustive research and interviews to paint a fascinating character study, and shows why he is the best historical biographer of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"How politics really works","review":"By the time the public meetings and press conferences happen, the deals have already been done.

Robert Moses perfected this on a massive scale -- even more amazing when you consider that he never held an elective office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster of NY","review":"Having read Caro's books on LBJ, I just had to read this Pulitzer Prize winning bio. I was not disappointed. Dare I say Moses was New York City's own little Hitler! There is very little to admire about this man who tore great holes in NYC and catered to the rich. Read how he made sure that the overpasses that ran over the parkways that he built were made intentionally too low for busses to pass under. In doing that he insured that only those who could afford a car could get to his wonderful beaches. He also destroyed neighborhoods and people. Blind with ambition he only cared about building monuments to himself. You will not beleive how he stole power in NY and became the most powerful man in this country - even Roosevelt was beholden to him. He personally held the purse strings to the largest sums of money in the State and probably the nation. But it is a great story and well written. If you live and work in NYC you should not miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece of modern biography","review":"This famous book is kept on the shelves because, like Plutarch's 'Lives', it is a masterpiece of biography. THis vast story of Robert Moses and New York City in the 20s and 30s is large in comperser and minute in details. It combines many great American characters from La GUardia to Al SMith. All these important New York politicians. it describes the Tamanny Hall machine. It is also the story of Mr. Moses and his restructuring of the parks and parkways around New York and Long Island.An amazing book about power and about Americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Read","review":"What an incredible book and story. So well researched and paced, whether you read 200 pages or all 1200 you should thoroughly enjoy this book. The backdrop of Tammany Hall NYC alone makes it interesting, but Moses and his career are something completely unknown in today's age.Interesting side note, check out this transcribed lecture by Peter Thiel that gives an argument for why we no longer have big plans like those of Moses and the Space Race... [...]Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Having lived in New York for 2 years in the late 70's and after having read Mr Caro's Master of the Senate I was interestedto read how the subject of power would be explained. It is incredible how Robert Moses managed to outsmart all electedofficials over a lifetime. Certainly in the 70's the daily trip from Westchester to Manhattan through the South Bronx was avery sobering experience - richest country on earth would not improve those wastelands.Riveting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotta bang for your buck with this phenominal, big book!","review":"Exhaustively researched, brilliantly written, THE POWER BROKER is a masterpiece of reporting and fascinating history for anyone interested in urban planning and in NYC particularly. Interestingly, Moses outlived the publication so it would be wonderful if a new edition were released with an \\"update\\" to the biography. Regardless, it is impossible not to laud this wonderful work of non-fiction...insightful, revealing, compelling. The sheer size and density of the book may deter some, but once you get going, it's a read you won't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting things done.","review":"How do you get things done, in an environment which was virtually designed from the ground up to make it impossible? Robert Moses knows, better than anyone has known before or since. This is a much more balanced work than the other reviews will tell you; Robert Caro is as unstinting in his admiration for the genius behind Jones Beach as he is with his sympathy for the victims of his vindictiveness. And, in the end, while many of Moses' works probably shouldn't have been built, we have the spectacle of a city in desperate need of more grand projects, but profoundly unable to do anything about it. You see, only Moses could push them through. Do you want to deal with the Man Who Gets things Done, or do you just not want things to be done at all? It's a terrible choice.This is a truly compelling work, gripping through its entire 1200-odd page length. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Ones","review":"If you want to understand America and American cities, you must read three books:\\"Common Ground\\" by J Anothony Lukas.\\"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\\" by Jane Jacobs.And this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some regrets","review":"I didn?t pay much attention to the description of the book, something that proved to be an error.

He drew some of the most beautiful and dream-like pictures of women I have ever seen. Except for his society portraits, his women are always mythological, often nude, and sometimes very pretty. His painting style was very complex, colorful and elaborate, very decorative and intricate, full of symbolism and ancient mythical archetypes and motifs.

I told him I had the book, but had not read it yet, and asked his opinion. He replied that it is nothing but heresy. He was correct. Apparently Dr. Stauffer does not believe in salvation by grace for all.

The quick attachment works fine but is not something an elderly person may find easy to do.

We had 3 utility sinks in a row to clean paintbrushes or whatever. I would arrive at the sinks to find a mess because there was not really an easy way to rinse the sides and bottom of the sink. This was a great solution. The sprayer is attached to the furthest sink on the left and it can be stretched to clean the other 2 sinks. Problem solved. I liked it so much that I purchased a 2nd one to use at home for it's intended purpose...washing our dog. The package includes a variety of adapters to fit a variety of sinks. It fit the standard utility sink without using any adapter. My home utility sink is actually a restaurant sink and that faucet did require an adapter that was included.

This is an intense book at times when we get the conflicts between members of Clinton's staff and their competing priorities as they try to push Clinton's ideas through Congress.I found this book to be a good read but I just found myself lacking the interest in parts of it that hasn't otherwise been the case with Woodward's earlier books.I think one of the major pluses with the author is that his books have an easy read appeal, he doesn't get bogged down in the intricacies of politics too often.All in all, this is worth a read but it is not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woodward is lacking direction and missing the focus","review":"It would seem that Bob Woodward lacked the courage to investigate the Clintons that he had somehow mustered to bring down President Nixon.

If I had wanted to read a book describing Clinton's greatness, I would have chosen one entitled \\"How to lie under oath and get away with it.\\" This book was disappointing.

The guitarist, Tore Ostby is playing on a level that very few guitarists ever reach. His blistering leads, icy-blue tone (reminiscent of Kirk Hammett's lead tone on Ride The Lightning) and incredible riffs combined with Khan's excellent singing make this a very memorable CD.

Her writing is clear, lyrical, filled with vitality. I like the chances she takes with structure, the odds and ends of text she borrows from diverse sources to inform her narrative. I'm interested in the shift of voice that occurs over the course of the book, the anger and power that builds as she discovers a more authentic sense of self. My 7-year old Chinese daughter conceptualizes her birth mother mostly as a tummy, someone who has not yet assumed the shape of a fully realized woman. But I have no doubt that this will change.

Trenka reveals herself as selfish and arrogant and I'm not surprised that she had relationship tensions with her American family and adopted sister. I questioned her sincerity when she let money and vacation days come between her when her birth mother passed away. Her real struggle appears being a Korean in a white community. She seems only to find peace within herself after her birth mother has died and she's marries a white man, returning to Korea to show him off to her half sisters.

I guess the quality has changed radically. I was so happy when it arrived but when I opened it up and began to use it I noticed right away that it seemed dried out and difficult to get any real mascara on my lashes.

Unfortunately my eyes are very sensitive to chemicals, so if I don't wash off this mascara off very very well, I end up with blood shot eyes the next day. So I always have to put an extra effort.

I was told by a Mac representative that that means the mascara is old and needs to be replaced.

It can be a bit clumpy if you're not careful, but that's nothing a careful application and an eyelash comb can't fix. With that said, this product probably isn't for the casual makeup wearer. It comes off completely and easily with water and your usual face wash, but that also means you have to be careful if you cry. The first dramatic mascara I tried was Benefit's BagGal Lash, but I found that it didn't get my lashes as thick as DiorShow, and it dried out very quickly, within a month (and no, I do not pump the wand!)

Srinawk grew up in the rural northeast section of Thailand known as Esan; almost a synonym in his home country for poverty. Many of his stories center around life in an Esan village and the hardships that that entails. Other stories concern the experiences of Esan people in the city. Always, his theme is the friction between country and city, peasant and metropolitan folk. Srinawk captures the hardship, pain, and humiliation of being born poor in Thailand. Unlike other Thai writers of the bourgeouis class who romanticize the life of the poor, Srinawk, himself a peasant, paints his people in all their ignorance and selfishness. He never loses sight of what it means to be an Esan peasant, and simultaneously, what it means to be human."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book!","review":"Think of as many of the terrible things that people (particularly men) can do to other people (particularly women), cram them into one book, and you've got Abuse of Power.

But I don't feel the novel lived up to the potential.The plot was very over-the-top, I agree that it ...[should be]a \\"made-for-tv\\" kind of book... it seems to be made for an audience with a very short attention span.The characterization was lacking... they included a woman who had an horrible childhood and was trying to deal with the world as a single mother, another single mom dealing with cancer, a man who left a difficult life in a third-world country to start a new life in America, and many others. Talk about potential! You'd expect that a \\"bestselling\\" author would be able to do something with these characters... but I personally found them stereotypical and one-dimensional.Worst of all, the dialogue was forced and somewhat childlike. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaska Man's Embellishment","review":"Well written; this book would have received a 5 had it been more factual. I like reading factual accounts of travels in Alaska, especially older ones. This author left me wondering how did a human survive all he said he went through? Then I read that he admitted to embellishing his stories...well, it was his life he was writing about. An interesting life that included sea travel at a very young age. I couldn't quit reading until it was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blowdry-spray, curl-spray, comb-spray, ad infinitum","review":"Most styles depend on spray, gel, mousse or wax. Next to nothing on braids, twists, and updos and what there is is very basic with minimal instruction. After the section on care of your hair--minimize contact with direct heat, don't weigh hair down--there follows a collection of styles requiring blowdrying, curling irons, or hot curlers and the aforementioned goop. The section on \\"Super Cuts\\" which allow a number of different styles from one haircut was intriguing, but I don't believe I could repeat most and have them last five minutes after getting out the front door. Lots of lovely pictures of studio styling, but usually showing just one angle per style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book!","review":"This book stunk!

I didn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book!","review":"I generally enjoyed this book, and I do think that it is a good reference for people looking to change the way their hair is styled. However...Note to Potentially Dissatisfied Customers:This book is NOT a book that tells you how to braid your hair or put it up. It is a book that gives you ideas on ways to cut your hair or restyle it at the length that it already is. If you are looking to find ways of putting your hair up, I recommend \\"Hair\\" by Anne Akers Johnson instead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely not the best!","review":"The book description for this book makes it sound like it has instructions for styles for all types of hair. And it does, except I thought \\"styles\\" meant things like buns, braids and updos. The \\"styles\\" in this book are things like, \\"Blow-dry the hair, than use styling gel to hold it in place.\\" Not very informative! This book has a nice layout, for short-medium-long hair, with a curly hair section at the end of each length of hair section. Overall, if you are into blow-drying your hair instead of braiding it or something of that sort, than it is a pretty good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title tells you nothing!!!","review":"I had no idea this book was going to be about wonderfully gorgeous lesbians.

He took the inside knowledge of being a veteran of the F.B.I's Hostage Rescue Team, and spun it into a riveting tale of the \\"unknowns\\" and \\"unsung heroes\\" that protect our nation with no recognition and, sometimes no knowledge they are even players in the scheme.If you're waiting for the 'read of the summer', read Black. It's loaded with twists and turns that take you through the labyrinth of the Black Ops, and culminates in an exciting ending that leaves you wondering: \\"what, if any of this is actually true?\\" Truly a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"painful to finish","review":"I finished the book, but it was a struggle. I agree with other reviewers that the ending was a stretch. The constant juggling of viewpoints and storylines from character to character has been done by others, and for them, it worked. Here, it was annoying and distacting. Do not waste your money or your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel with the Ring of Reality","review":"A new recruit to the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team thought he understood what he was joining. Instead, he finds himself plunged deep into an Alice in Wonderland World of lack operations.In Black, Christopher Whitcomb, a fifteen-year veteran of the FBI and a Hostage Rescue Team member, has written a troubling novel about the shadowy world in which this recruit unexpectedly finds himself. It is a world dominated by black-box technology, gorgeous females with hidden agendas and mercenaries with shifting loyalties.Whitcomb infuses current sense of reality into the genre. It is obvious he has experienced the interplay between intelligence organizations and international corporations. He also includes timely references to the war on Iraq and Al-Qaeda.The novel is an easy read. Were it not for several instances of poor editing (he confuses Lincoln Center in New York with the Kennedy Center in Washington) it novel would rate five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly disappointing","review":"A tiresome read and one in desperate need of an editor. The ending is absurd and the characters as flat at the dialogue. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Blue","review":"For a guy who is a special op's expert this book falls far short of expectations. It also has several glaring inconsistencies. A woman leaves her lovers apartment with only cash and no purse and then goes to the bad guys office, copies a disk and then puts it into her, well, purse. Where did she get the disk to copy on or the purse to put it in? Well we just don't know.This book is full of stuff like that. Save your money and buy Flashman instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh ...","review":"I finished the book, so it can't be a 1-star review.But the ending was so unbelievable & contrived as to leave me laughing at the end. In hindsight, 2 of the 4 plotline threads seemed totally unnecessary. (Why exactly was Siran Malveaux key to the plot ... other than to provide one requisite sex scene?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"See storyline above.This newcomer to the spy-thriller is a welcome addition.Having the the background in this field, Whitcomb has written a knowledgable and fast-paced novel. It's sure to please even fans of early Ludlum. I look forward to reading the next 'Jeremy Walker' novel.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"At some point you realize that all the threads of the story will never be tied up as the books remaining pages disappear. Then when the end arrives, so does anger. I can accept that this is the first of, how many? But the complex absurdity of the ending is insulting in this world, where a fanatic with a backpack cannot be stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ends don't determine the means","review":"This novel has the advantage of being written by an expert in FBI ops. The characterization of the training and life as an agent was interesting. But the whole plot revolved around the \\"mastermind\\" predicting each and every step of his operatives, including how they would respond to torture, and at what exact moment they would end up in his office suite. And to what end? Probably one of the most ridiculous conclusions you'll read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Aside from the outlandish plot of 462 pages that all gets resolved in the following two pages, Whitcomb really isn't that good of a writer. That's where the book falls off. I ended up skipping large chunks of meaningless paragraphs as he explained, in minutia at times, what exactly was on a persons desk.Thrilling, I know.Please don't buy this. I honestly feel I wasted money on the paperback, and it is difficult to ever feel $8 is wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below standard","review":"Cold Zero, Whitcombs autobiography showed signs of real writing talent. \\"Black\\" shows none of that talent. The characters are one dimensional and un-interesting. The plot is hopelessly confused. At just 360 pages, is a short book, but he seems to have had to work hard to stretch it that far. If it had been published as a short story it might have been better. As it is, it lacks reality, creativity and gravitas. Unlike Whitcomb, Andy Mcnabb was a REAL soldier in the war on terror, and knows how to write a taught, interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST......","review":"I cannot state how much I loved this book (along w/ White). Excellent read for anybody interested in counter-terrorism, law enforcement and espionage. I cannot wait until Chris comes out with another series or better yet a movie. The author really puts his experience as a FBI agent into the story and this brings a great sense of realism to the book. The only problem I experienced was the ending...it was clear but than again it could've been much clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top...not as great as the first","review":"The third and final installment of the stonekeeper's adventures. I must say that this story was not as great as the very first installment \\"The Passion Ruby\\" where Hawk and Sienna first met. There was much more suspense, action, sensuality, and romance in \\"The Passion Ruby\\" where as in this one, Hawk seems to have evolved into a madman. Though, now I understand the true extent of his visions this took away some of the romance. I found it ridiculously funny and overly exaggerated when Hawk literally went \\"crazy\\" due to his visions and jumps over a table running off and yelling as if he were some wild animal. I could not contain my laughter.Don't get me wrong Ms Snoe is a great writer; \\"the ties that bind\\" is an excellent example. This one however, is much too over the top and unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A slow, tortuous and seemingly endless film of two young German lovers centered on the ups and downs of their relationship while on vacation in Italy. Did I mention that it's \\"Draggy\\"? Truth be told, it was very difficult to sit through this insipid mess which is devoid of drama, suspense or even human interest. Be forewarned before buying or renting this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Read!","review":"Good book. I've read the Godfather and this compares pretty much with that.

I only read it at the request of a friend. Surprisingly I was impressed. And I'm not the easiest person to impress in the world. Tony Cheatham's characters are realistic and the writing is impressive. The action and storylines appealed to me also. Without giving away too much, the story made me want to keep on reading until I got to the final page. Hopefully Tony Cheatham has plans to write another novel based on these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept my interest.","review":"The story moved fast.

The driving is extremlely twitchy and just plain not fun. There are too few cars and tracks to drive.Although it's not a rally game, Gran Tourismo 3 is a far better racing game all around.

Unlike Colin McRae Rally 2, you can't repair the car between stages (you just get a brand new car after each rally) and in championship mode you can only race with the ford focus (which sucks, by the way). If you're thinking about a rally game just try Colin 2.The only advantage of CMR 3 over CMR 2 are the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after the brilliant CMR 2.0","review":"Codemasters really dropped the ball on this one, making for a ridiculous championship mode in which you can ONLY be Colin McRae, and in which you can ONLY drive one car. They've also removed all the other options from CMR2.0, such as being able to run full rallies in other types of cars, etc. In CMR3, you can only run stages. If you want to run a full rally, you'll have to do the championship mode, which ends after three seasons.Ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight","review":"I never was really into reggae music but then I heard tracks from Elephant Man and Beenie Man and I started to love it.

Over the years, we have worn that LP down and despaired of ever finding a replacement. Now, at last, it is available on CD.My musical tastes are eclectic, ranging from Bikel to Bruckner and from Dylan to Hovhaness. Maria Ostiz' voice has a clarity and a purity which remind me of the 18 year old Joan Baez or of Judy Collins' earliest albums. But Ostiz is better.These songs are like nothing you have ever heard; they are a celebration of life and of beauty. Join that celebration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I enjoy many racing games . . . GT3, Burnout, Rallisport . . . but this one is horrible. Handling is fine, graphics are beautiful, replay fun, but everything else doesn't live up to the hype. Sound: you cannot hear the cars, the cheering washes out the cars and no way to adjust what sound is at what level. Tracks: are odd and irregular. And AI seem to cheat a bit . . . but that is in every game to a degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great graphics w/NO slow-down...2 thumbs up!","review":"\\"APEX Racing\\" for the XBOX is deep. There's not one negative thing I could say about it. Lavishly smooth graphics with NO slowdown. That's always a plus in my book. The cars handle great. I love how the car never feels like it's going to spin into a fish-tail at every turn like many racing games. While it's a bit arcadish, it still has a fantastic feel to it. Lastly, there's 54 tracks(as it claims on the back of the game case). I'm sick of spending a fortune on a race game, only for it to have 8 or 12 tracks. I have a feeling I'll be playing this one for awhile.2 thumbs up to Atari and Milestone for a fantastic racer."},{"rating":"2","title":"zoom,zoom, zoom","review":"Ok, this game is coming out this feb.

Basicaly it's your average racing game, but there is a catch. you can design and build your own car, make the brand name different but not the car name, so i could change chevrolet into daddydoo, but if the car was a neon it would stay a Neon.overall it's a very good racing sim. with a big choice of cars and tracks.But i gave it 4 stars because it's not XBox Live enabled.rent first, then buy if u enjoyed it.note:this game is for mostly racing fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great names of european fantasy & the absurd","review":"For everyone interested in fantasy in its purest state this is a gemm. This anthology mixes the many themes that cross the polish author's short stories.

It had all the gypsy-rooted elements that puts him at the top of his game. What makes this CD a pleasant surprise is the re-introduction of more percussion-heavy songs such as 'Switchback', 'Paloma' and 'Viva' which I have sorely missed after 'Gravity'. These pieces just make you get up, dance, jump and rejoice in dark robes around a campfire at night, doesn't it!? Another surprise is the flamenco-heavy stuff in 'Querido Amigo', man this guy can play true flamenco. Sad to say, though, the passion of his more introspective songs, once found in 'Breathing Below Surface (Vertigo)', 'Luna Llena (Gravity)' and 'Parasol (Tempest)', have gone 2 notches down. Maybe Jesse is just out to party this time, which is fine by me. I'll join in anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse keeps getting better","review":"I think this is his best work yet. I will echo several other reviewers: the man keeps changing. Thank God! These songs make my hair stand on end sometimes. To my ears, they are incredibly emotional. He credits Djivan Gasparyan with, \\"godlike Armenian duduk\\" on \\"Incantation.\\" I agree! The passion in that song is amazing. \\"Fall at Your Feet\\" rips me up.Jesse uses many instruments that may be foreign to American ears to beautifully season the brew of his music. He's showing you something new, OPEN YOUR EARS! And your heart. The roots of flamenco come from India, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Turkey, as the gypsies made their way from Rajasthan to Andalucia. Have a look at the movie, \\"Latcho Drom\\" for a fine look at the gypsies and some great music.Yes, Jesse is a master at the mixing board, producing his own music. But to me it most definitely does not hurt the music, quite the contrary! He has a deft touch in the booth.Give a listen, it's a great record."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"We waited with great excitment for Jesse's new album because his previous albums were our absolute favorites.

I actually bought this trade to just fill in the gap between Kevin Smith's short run and the Bendis run. I didn't expect much out of it but boy was I surprised. I loved this story! I do always enjoy Joe Quesada's artwork(even if I don't agree with his creative decisions). I thought that this was a touching story and I really enjoy Echo as a character. Some time ago I do remember reading New Avengers where is turns out that Ronin was Echo all along. That was the only exposure I had to the character. I really enjoy her backstory and her interaction with Daredevil. Pick this up if you liked volume one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe at any setting!","review":"While this series of toaster has some good reviews, my experience was a disaster. Everything burns, even at the lowest setting! Smoke is billowing out before the cycle has completed and my smoke alarms were blaring away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toasted?","review":"This toaster worked fine for a few weeks. Then we damaged the cord and needed to get it replaced. It hasn't worked since. Turns out, according to Dualit company representative, this is one of the only toasters that has not many replaceable parts in it. One side had stopped toasting and working as well. Which is unlike the toasters they advertise as lasting for generations or longer. This one is now junk for us. At least Amazon was willing to take it back damaged for a partial refund. I never did. We bought something else instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Terrible toaster. Edges of toast burn at setting No. 2. But at setting No. 1, bread does not toast. Bizarrely, the thing goes up to a setting No. 8, though anything above 3 burns it to charcoal. Hopefully I can return this useless, expensive piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty but performs poorly","review":"Despite the UK label this unit is definitely built in a low cost country, most likely China. As such it suffers from build consistency problems as all of the reviews here clearly show. In some cases, the unit's adjustment is OK and it performs fine. In other cases, including mine, the adjustment is lousy and the toast burns even at the lowest setting. My toaster will be on its way back tomorrow after only one day of use. I have a beautiful 15 year old Rowenta that is made in Germany and is now on its last legs but still produces consistent results every time. I was hoping to buy a quality product made in the US or Europe but all the units I have seen in the stores are cheaply made in China. It is so tragic that we can't get any decent small electric appliances anymore, no matter the brand or the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This toaster looks, feels and works like a quality appliance. Bread pops up enthusiastically, but it doesn't fly out of the toaster. My boyfriend's daughter says it's like cartoon toast. The bagel feature works great and there are long slots for toasting pita bread halves and wider-than-Wonder bread from the local bakery. The price was higher than toasters I saw at Target and Macy's, but there's a noticeable difference in construction quality. I fully expect this toaster to last many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dualit 4-slice toaster","review":"At last, a toaster that actually toasts! I especially like it for English muffins because it has a \\"toast on one side\\" feature. It's taken some experimentation to get the darkness level just right, and it can't seem to \\"understand\\" frozen bread, but overall, very happy with it. And it looks great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for us","review":"The website I purchased this from won't let me leave a review so I'll do one here. This toaster lasted 3 days before we packed it up and shipped it back. No matter how low the setting the inside edge of the toast burned. If we set it at 1 it wouldn't toast and we had to toast it again and then the whole slice would burn. At 2 the edges would burn. For something over $100 you'd think it would work -at least for a few months. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven toasting","review":"We've had this toster for about 3 weeks and we're tyring to return it. The toast is uneven both vertically and horizontally, and burns at #4 out of 8. We need a long 4-slice toaster because we buy bread that is wider than regular sandwich bread.

I am really picky with my music, and I must say, \\"Social Dancing\\" is a must-have for fans of pop, electronica, or just downright fun music. Bis have really refined the sound of their music. While \\"The New Transistor Heroes\\" was the band's pure sound, \\"Social Dancing\\" is more refined and even.

Creating fun-on-a-stick, Bis succeed in making your body move by sound alone (no cultivated mass media image, no happy-meal toys, no movie-deals). Armed in this album with a hefty load of electronics and a good sense of \\"hook,\\" Bis create music for a \\"pop revolution\\" that puts fun and quirk back into the radio. If only they *had* some radio play. One of the best last albums of last century, Bis succeeds in making me dance and even though the female vocalist screams through half the tracks (don't misread me, though. This screaming is in tune. It's coy, smarty-pants, and ultimately \\"fun\\"--screaming pop on the opposite end of Shona Knife, I assure you). Fantastic fun with cars and fashion and a middle-finger. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is There Something I should Know?","review":"The negative reviews on this page prove that most people don't get pop--Real pop like Nirvana, The Smiths, Big Star, Badfinger, Belle & Sebastian, The Beatles and now Bis is an acquired taste, not easily digestible like metal or rock.

After hearing the excellent single 'Action and Drama' I went and bought the album. Unfortunately, there are only two good tracks on this, 'Action and Drama' and 'Eurodisco.' Worth having for these tracks alone, admittedly, but it's hard to listen to their energetic screaming on other tracks and funky chicken rythmns without thinking of Japanese punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day classic.","review":"Lets just say it has got something for everyone with a discerning taste in music.From funky drum and bass to jazzy house it is all here on one album.These guys are good.check them out for yourselves.I could almost guarantee (99%) that you will love this album.A breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING!","review":"I heard this in the music store and it was song after song of narrative talking or perhaps poetry reading. Whatever it was it was turning what would have been a fine 'Quiet Storm' album into one big annoyance.The songs themselves were pleasant with a late night bedroom feel.

The genre is definitely underrated, and is some of the best music ever, but some is just overrated. Like this album.I adored their first album, although it got some getting used to. But this album could never even compare. It is very lackluster and boring and the only tracks really worth listening to are the first two, \\"Blessed 2 Have\\" and \\"SupaStar.\\" Otherwise, this is a somewhat mainstream R&B; and overrated set.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love neo-soul and Floetry, but I will tell the truth; this album isn't worth any of the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid follow-up that is a Classic!!!","review":"Very few artists can f/u with an album that exceeds the quality of their first but Floetry has done it!!! It is difficult to determine which album is the best b/c each brings something different with Floetry maintaining their same style, delivery, and flava. Everyone will have their fav but my fav is \\"Sometimes U Make Me Smile.\\" Which song holds the #2 spot??? Hard to choose b/c each song stands out. I am listening to it right now and will remain in heavy rotation. This is just a phenomenal album so pick it up!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm left wanting more...","review":"I have to say I am loving this album.

Yes, I will admit there was about two great songs on the album other then that it was heartbreaking.

I am surprised that \\"At War With The Army\\" did not make it in this batch ...but guess there must be a copyright issue, as there have been many low-quality renditions available on VHS, Laserdisc & even DVD, for years (I assume that the 16mm print must have fallen into the public domain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for such a simple book","review":"The book doesn't teach you much on the strategy on MTG.

However, the bitterness and underlying resentment completely overwhelm this book. The bad parts are exaggerated, and it seems to poison even the few good factors the author lists-- thus completely ruining both the book and the reader's impression of Germany. It is more a book of the author's commentary about Germany than Germany itself, and is filled with less than entertaining and inspiring anecdotes. But moreover it leaves the reader with a sickly tainted feeling and a twinge of dread for Germany and its people. Sadly, this book could have been a five star if it lost the attitude. If you want to like Germany, DO NOT read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Living for nearly 70 years in Germany as a native born German I don't agree with the negative reviews on this book. I read it with pleasure and found everything almost correct, maybe some smaller items and details could be corrected or updated. Lord gives a short and accurate summary of living in Germany. It is obvious that \\"each coin has two sides\\" as we say in Germany - and telling the negative (seeming) facts warning the visitor not to overrate his first impressions surely does not mean that Lord feels any bitterness towards my country.More Germans should read this book - they would become conscious of their behaviour that might seem strange to foreigners and could try to make them more comfortable.I am only sorry that Lord compares only very seldom German habits with US habits.

Before you shell out $11, I can tell you what this book says in a nutshell: Because your parents ignored and/or disciplined you when you acted up, you now shoot yourself in the foot when you try to achieve something. What can be done about it: Not much, if anything. Other than that, it's chock full of examples of clients who are 'addicted to unhappiness' and how they were cured when they realize how crappy their parents were for not worshipping them and letting them do whatever they want along with the magic of the Piepers' counseling.

An addiction is a serious disorder that requires medical attention. No scientific evidence is provided to support the existence of an addiction to unhappiness or that recognizing an \\"aversive reaction\\" is key to defeating the addiction. Countless people overcome self-defeating behaviors through the love and support of friends, self-help groups, families, church, etc. without referring to themsleves as \\"addicted.\\" Some even have the temerity to call this growth promoting behavior \\"maturity\\" -- something most adults are capable of through out their life span.

The Piepers' discovery about learned needs for unhappiness gave me the perspective I needed to break this discouraging pattern.

When one understands the confusion on real God born happiness and in only believing the unhappiness of growing up was \\"happy\\", a change could happen to adjust, albeit scary and unknown.

I was disappointed in the fact that the book claimed to unfold secrets to Mr. Lee's success, but found nothing more than a few basic thoughts. There was no insight into any CRM planning, such as how to initiate contact with a prospect, nor any steps on how to conduct such a venture with a client. Any points that Mr. Lee brought up that might be insiteful, were left unfulfilled. I was expecting more than an advertisement for a seminar. I have no doubt that Mr. Lee is a wonderful consultant, and having worked for American Express, and with 3M, (both companies touted in preface of the book), I am a believer in his work. I have seen CRM have tremendous results. If you are looking to implement CRM there are a number of books to choose from, but this unfortuately is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"I bought Lee's Planning Guide, Deployment Guide, and Survival Guide as one package. I read through the first two and was dissappointed to find nothing particularly revolutionary. Many of the concepts were ones I learned years ago in basic strategic planning. For $... this and the deployment guide fall way short on value.That being said, I read the Survival Guide and was extremely pleased. The detail that was lacking in the Kinkos assembled planning and deployment guides was plentiful in the Surival Guide. It was an easy read and clearly and honestly points out the pitfalls of CRM implementation.

I purchased this book hoping for some insight into Thunderbird folklore much like 1 or 2 of the other reviewers. It was so bad and so laughable that I loaned it to a Native American friend of mine and they laughed so hard they cried!

It arrived promptly (thank you, Amazon) and in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I've never been a John Cusack fan, but he's utterly riveting in the role of a coming-of-age grifter caught between two indelible women. Annette Bening, at least here, is a pure force of nature, a sexy tsunami overwhelming everything in her path. And Anjelica Huston??? Her entire career has been one splendid performance after another, and this is one of her finest. You simply cannot take your eyes off her. The interaction of these three is one of the best examples of ensemble acting outside of an Altman film. And the little subtleties around these three -- from the brilliant set piece of the orange scene to the almost-identical dresses worn by Lily and Myra to Elmer Bernstein's moody score -- make The Grifters a compelling experience. The only disappointment is that the CD has NO extras at all, but you could certainly make the case that this is a movie that can stand completely on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Smart with Powerhouse Performances!","review":"This is an extremely entertaining and fascinating look into the lives of con-men and con-women. Angelica Huston gives her best performance as the icy blonde con-mother of Roy, she is simply masterful in this film. John Cusack also gives his best and grittiest performance as Roy, a small-time con who wants to get out. Annette Bening is also excellent as Roy's knockout girlfriend who is looking for the long-con. The split-screen introduction sequence is great. Stephen Frears directs with cold assurance. Fascinating characters and plot, intelligent sharp dialogue and 3 powerhouse performances. One of the best movies of 1990. Extras: that's Martin Scorcese's voice narrating at the beginning of the film, he also produced. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Many Minutes Left?","review":"that's what i kept asking myself. the characters have no redeeming qualities, and do not evolve. borrrring!

The divine Anjelica Huston is to die for in this one. One of mine all time favorite movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Grift for DeMille","review":"This Hollywood look at con artists is well done. The casting is near perfection. Classy Annette Benning in her youth has a smoking-hot body as well as an excellent grasp of her part, and she shows it all several times. This is almost a film noir in its dialogue, character depictions, and stylized presentation, but it has too much \\"light\\" to win that prize. John Cusack and Anjelica Houston are at the top of their form for portraying \\"brooding\\" and \\"steel hardness\\", respectively. The story is good if a little forced. Supporting cast is also top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful performances, bad idea","review":"I don't usually take the time to review movies well beyond their release dates because, let's face it, who cares? I like film noir as much as anyone, but his is just well-performed drivel.SPOILER ALERT: So we're supposed to believe that, after having spent an entire movie establishing her love for her son, Huston is is willing to first disavow herself as a mother, then kill her son accidentally and then simply take the money and run? Right. Because they are grifters. Right. This is the laziest example of moral calumny you will find in a movie.There is nothing worth knowing or experiencing here. Move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Film, Sleazy Characters","review":"The Grifters provides an extremely interesting look at some genuinely sleazy parasite con-artists who pretty much ended up living the lives they deserved.

What's more, it advocates it in a snobish tone throughout, the authors barely concealing their contempt for people who are too busy earning a living, raising their kids, and doing the hundreds of other things required of regular people to spend time having oxford style debates about public policy issues.

I'm using primarily for Internet chat while gaming. I wouldn't recommend this headset for a couple reasons:1) The arm length is NOT adjustable. The arm was lodged into the side of my face and the mic was in my mouth. The mic can be twisted a bit, but to get it out of my mouth I had to twist it so it was pointing straight out. My roommate had the same problem. If you have a tiny head you may be able to wear these properly.2) The padding on the ears is very unsubstantial. After about an hour of gaming my ears ached from the hard plastic of the ear pieces digging into my ears.The voice quality (for chat anyway- didn't play music or game sounds through the ear pieces) was fine and the volume/mute controls worked as expected.

Echo Burning is a very satisfying read which keeps you guessing till the end. I cared about his characters. The plot of this book was not as complex as his others, but it was just as good. Lee Child is a great storyteller, and never fails to keep me interested, so much so that I find it hard to put his books down. The very first page of this novel surprised me not once, but twice.

In his early books he seemed to be building Reacher's character and had some progression from book to book but he just seemed to phone it in on this one. The story had so many factual errors, and child just had Reacher march through all obstacles without the reader ever having to wonder if he would make it. For me if the hero is omnipotent then what's the use of reading the story. There needs to be some doubt to hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Reacher classic by the master","review":"Brilliant as usual, if you like reacher books as much as I do try Soft Target by Conrad Jones its same genre but twice the bang for your buck.

The plot (well, up to page 158 when I tossed it into the rubbish) was just so silly. I like Jack Reacher as much as the next girl, but I just couldn't believe that a woman (Carmen) could be so, so, so...doormat...in the 21st century.

Great FAST reads because Child just keeps you on the edge of your seat from page one forward. This book (#5 in the series) did not disappoint, but it bogged down in a spot or two and actually became somewhat obvious as to who was overseeing the conspiracy. Those are not reasons, however to NOT read this book. As with all the Reacher novels, you will fly through it because of the fast-paced action, the characters and the author's writing style. Usually I bounce in and out of series books (Reacher, the Camel Club, Davenport, Bosch) - I'm going straight to the next book in this series because I enjoy Child's work that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This is the first Lee Child book I have read and probably the last. We will see. The story starts out being one thing and then changes into something else. A very confusing story. It made me wonder what is this book about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This One","review":"A few weeks ago I picked up my first Reacher novel - and enjoyed it. So I decided to work my way through all of them. So far I have had a good time with each one. But I got to Echo Burning and it just didn't measure up. I know it's fiction but right in the beginning I had to get over the fact that it was supposed to be 100 degrees before the sun comes up in the morning, in Lubbock. Everyone, especially those of us from West Texas, know that the desert is know for its cool nights - even when it gets up to 120 during the day. So that bothered me first, but what really got me was the premise that the white people out here treat latinos like slaves or worse. Again, I know this is fiction, but in reality the mexican people are by far in the majority out here, and they are well respected, leaders in each community. I guess just not in the fictional ones! Beyond those details that may only have bothered me, I just thought the plot was weak and the anticipated climax was a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Can't-Put-Down-Read","review":"This is Lee Child's best thriller yet. I can't say enough good things about it. First, there's his absolutely knock-out sense of place. The heat and desolation of rural southwest Texas ripple through every page. The starkness of the terrain and outlaw mentality of the cast provide the perfect backdrop for Jack Reacher--army major-turned-drifter--to mete out his own brand of perfect justice.I love Reacher because he's clever and tough, but it's his hint of vulnerability that makes him more interesting with every book. I also loved watching Reacher maneuver around the things he wasn't good at--saddling a horse, for instance. Lee Child kept me guessing about the motives of Carmen Greer, the beautiful Latina who picks up Reacher on the highway, as well as a host of other shady characters. If you're new to the series, start with this one. It'll keep you in your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo Burning","review":"I couldn't wade through this book, got 2/3's of the way through before I just gave up!

Excellent action/mystery books"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lakeview","review":"All of Lee Childs books are well written with outstanding plots and storylines. This book was certainly no exception. Jack Reacher is a great main character, essentially invincible but still posessing human flaws. Echo Burning is a fine example of the Jack Reacher series and will keep the reader up past his bedtime. I say \\"his\\" because I think this series would appeal primarily to a male reading audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy did not make sense","review":"I can ignore character flaws that might cause bad decisions, but the conspiracy plot twist went too far and ruined the book for me. There was no reason for the kidnapping and the forced confession. Justice would have moved along without this unnecessary risk. Also the ambush in the desert did not make sense. Professional killers would not act so stupid. How did the villains even know they were at the ranch? First Reacher went to the ranch, then back to the DA's office to steal a file, and then back to the ranch for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Lee Child started out with some pretty fine novels in his series featuring the ex-military cop, now drifter Jack Reacher. Reacher seems to have a penchant for landing in some rather outlandish and bizarre situations. Unfortunately, Child lost his touch in this one. ECHO BURNING is a slow, drawn out, and rather boring novel. While RUNNING BLIND, his last novel, was a terribly unbelievable and contrived plot - at least there was plenty of swift, moving action that kept the pages turning. Here we get long, unnecessarily detailed descriptions of Reacher sleeping, Reacher driving in a car, the melodrama of a six year old trying to figure out how to open a locked door. This reader kept saying \\"let's get on with it already!!\\"This was a rather slow and disappointing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite reacher novels so far.","review":"Reading them in order.

Reachers gone soft on this one!!!","review":"I did not like this book, the story line was thin, Jack Reacher is not the Reacher from the previous books, he makes mistakes and is far less violent. This seems that Lee had to fill in some time or fill a quota with this novel, not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful!","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This was a great read with the twists and turns that get you addicted to Lee Child... :) I love the series and the attitude that Jack Reacher has would certainly be a lot more helpful to cure societys ills than what a lot of people have now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite an unbelievable story.........","review":"The story in this one is too far-fetched for me.....why would a guy go to that length to protect someone he hardly knows? And there are definitely privacy act issues here....he gets into everyone's business, and the DA, lawyers, sheriffs--everyone tells him all about their clients. Get real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Correctness run amok!","review":"I've read 7 of Child's Jack Reacher novels before I was suckered in by this political diatribe. His other novels were all 1st class action books, but here Child decided to give us all his attitudes about Texans. (1) There are no white men (except Reacher) who isn't a racist scumbag, (2) there are no white women (except an enlightened New Yorker, graduated from Harvard) who isn't a racist, (3) every Mexican is a noble hardworking downtrodden saint who's been screwed by The Man. Now listen, i know there are racists in Texas (and in NY, and in NJ, and in NH, etc.) and i know there are a helluva lot of Mexicans who work their asses off to try to get ahead and provide for their families --- but how about SOME BALANCE? ... hey Lee Child, how about sticking to writing action-novels or else, take a job as an editorial writer for the NY Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, except for the \\"Texas bashing\\"","review":"In my opinnion this is probably worth reading if you have nothing else to do.

If I had not been listening to this book when I couldn't download another, I may never have finished it. I have read most of them, you don't need this one for any information in the others, so unless you just want to say you read all the Reacher books, you don't really need to buy this one.The other books more than make up for this one.

I am working my way through the Reacher series, having picked up 7 of them in paperback for nothing at my work library, devouring them, I then set out to fill in the blanks, so some of them I have read out of order. This one I purchased for my Kindle, however, it was very disappointing. It wasn't until about half way through the book that it started to pick up. I think all the heat and red paint and dust was just too much. It probably didn't help that we were in the middle of a heat wave with 35C degree temps. And the first half of the story was quite slow, very un-Reacher like. I was glad when I finished it. Usually Reacher leaves me wanting more, so that says something. On to the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"Lee Child is an excellent author who cuts directly to the chase. His books will grab your attention from page one and hold it until the last page. Definitely worth your time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Child's better ones","review":"I read this Reacher novel after having read others in the series, and I have to say I did not like it, as it was nowhere near the caliber of the others I'd read (The Enemy, The Affair, Hot Shot). Carmen was not a sympathetic character and I never did feel that much sympathy for her. Reacher seemed tired and the plot wound all over the place. His sidekick Alice, who only appears later in the book, came across as rather flat, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Jack Reacher","review":"I am addicted to these Jack Reacher books. The character is one of my all time favorites. This book finds him in the middle of a local family problem and local politics of Texas and he sets out and does his thing.It's a little less \\"big-time\\" than some of his other adventures like bringing down vice presidential assassins, Army conspiracies, and others. But that was welcome for me, every time he sets foot in a town I don't need him to be in the middle of a bigger and bigger mess. I liked reading him in a small town busting up some small time politicians and a woman abuser. And he still exposed a conspiracy of sorts to boot.On a Jack Reacher scale of the books I've read so-far it might lose a star, but compared to other series a 4 star Jack Reacher is another 5-star outstanding page-turner for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo burning - slow to start","review":"My least favorite Reacher book so far.

Thanks to everyone !! I have loved every book by Lee Childs."},{"rating":"1","title":"a slow burner","review":"This is my first Reacher and to be honest, it was a tough slog through this rambling story. The story never really built and seemed to go along at a snail's pace for me. I realize there are a whole series of Reacher novels, but there was no real character development in this book and no incentive for the reader to try and figure out the storyline - puzzling it out for ourselves that is. I'll probably try another of Child's novels because he seems recommended by a lot of people. But I prefer more thrilling thriller novels - Iles, Lincoln Child, Rollins and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy research, no mystery","review":"I have to say S. Temerlin practically wrote my review for me (see his of 11/12/2006). Child's knowledge of firearms is not even second-hand. Also, the tactics (it pains me to apply the term) Reacher used to defeat the bad guys were sloppy, self-defeating, and would have gotten him and Alice killed except that the \\"professional\\" killers were even more stupid than Reacher. His wrap up of the major bad guy was from an old Perry Mason TV show. This was my second, and last, Child book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange blend ...","review":"Jack Reacher novels seem to be a strange blend of PC (not too hamfisted, but it's there) and admiration for George W.

Another smart thriller with a smart hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto.... waste of time","review":"I am a Lee Child fan and have read all his preceding novels to Echo Burning.

I anxiously await the release of each of the \\"Jack Reacher\\" stories, but this story really stuck with me. I rarely re-read a book, but this one warrants another read! Lee Child writes in a style that puts you in the moment, I could feel the hot Texas sun and smell the mesquite. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't deserve to be part of the jack reacher series","review":"I'm working my way through the entire Jack Reacher series and am a huge fan. This one, however, was uninspired.I hate to admit it, but I think the problem was that it was too down to earth. While I can appreciate the sentiment, I like my Jack Reacher reading more in the realm of fantasy. The imperfect characters made them unlikeable. The action was also a bit lacking. Jack himself was a bit hard to take at times.

If you like stories with an attorney in them (a female, Harvard grad, no less), this may be the one for you. Hey, if you like the Reacher series, you read this a while back.

Very well written and heart-wrenching documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close to home","review":"I grew up in Lawrence. On the North side, but I knew the area where Andy lived very well. Watching this documentary hit so close to home. Even though I'm older than Andy was, looking back, it could have happened to me. Kids would swim in the city pools during the summer. Me in the Kennedy by Central Catholic and Andy in the Higgins in South Lawrence. We went there to have fun. Little kids having a good time. Not a worry in the world. And to think that men like Wayne Chapman were cruising these pools and the streets of Lawrence looking for their next victim. This DVD is certainly an eye opener and I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for any parent.","review":"Have You Seen Andy is a must see for both parents and children. Ideally,they will watch it together followed by a discussion on safety in today's world. It is more than just a story of one boy's abduction; it captures a piece of history and educates the viewer on how easy it is for a child to vanish into thin air. As a person who grew up in the Stadium Projects, Ican tell you it is very accurate and brought me back to those days. I was present for the search and aftermath of his disappearance, and it answered so many questions I had. For 31 years I wondered what happened to a nice kid who lived 1 door away from me. After watching Have You SeenAndy, I feel I know the whole story. This is more than a local film, it is something that will be appreciated from coast to coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Doldrums","review":"Did I miss something? I read every word, and found it all a big yawn. The writing is grammatically correct, but without any rhythm, not a single crescendo, completely devoid of climax. Rachel Carson? Please. I couldn't find a single hook in the anecdotes, not a compelling story within. Time after time, the stories and examples fell completely flat. Organizationally, the writer skipped around paragraph to paragraph without carrying any thought through a full chapter. The science was minimal at best, and just plain questionable at times. How did such a good premise turn out so dull? And what really got me was that I love the Outer Banks. Do yourself a favor; a textbook on wind will be more compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beret","review":"Great beret. It's comfortable, easy to fold into my pocket, and a fair price.

Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either.

A couple of important tips (it took a few tries to get it right):Make sure the glue is very hot, warm up the gun 5 minutes as it recommends, otherwise the glue will pop off of the tab before it pops off the car and will not pull up the dent. Let it cool after glueing it to the car for 10 minutes. Then when screwing/tightening up the tab do it slowly so it does not pop off too quickly. It worked on my BMW which has pretty thick sheet metal so I have to say I'm impressed, although like most I was left with not a perfect result, still a small \\"wave\\" in the metal but much better than the original ding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"The glue gave out way on the wingnut way before the dent could be pulled.

Some people classify DKM as oi skinhead punk, but it's really not.

Then, without warning, the screeching begins: \\"IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPYYYYYYYYYYY!\\" The bombast of Crow's voice, much like nails on a chalkboard, kills all good will fostered by the beginning of the song. The fact that the chorus repeats, thus forcing the listener to endure Crow's caterwauling more than once, only adds salt to the wound.

Thisis great adult pop-rock and more than deserves a huge audiencein the USA. They've come up with a sound at first similar tothe likes of Coldplay and Keane but its all Aha, they've justtaken their sound to new heights and the results are a stunningdisplay of talents, Morten Harkets has a voice like no other,still hits those high notes and can sing a ballard or fastone (Celice) and make it all sound so good together.

This whole collection shinestheir are favorites all over this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad really they aren't getting noticed.","review":"A-ha is probably one of the most under rated bands left over from the 80s. They have stayed true to their integral melodies but the rest has taken on a David Bowie like retransformation. Aha makes the most soulful music from any band from their times. It's a pity US audiences are not coming in droves, but their recent newer material suits an intimate atmosphere more then a mere radio. Aha is making lovely music ,they deserve a chance more then any one hit wonders with this music.

I have bought and thoroughly enjoyed each song on every album these guys have made. Except this one. Who's idea was it to make a CD with half the album dedicated to reliving the 60's. At any moment I was expecting the next track to be \\"White Rabbit\\". These songs could have easily been sung with the a-ha chemisty we all know and love. But the psychedelic channeling of John Lennon, Jim Morrison, and Grace Slick just doesn't work for a-ha. The whole love affair that Paul has for the 60's sound works for his other band Savoy, but completely fails for a-ha. The first 6 tracks are the a-ha signature sound, but the last 7 tracks are just a \\"long strange trip\\" to the 60's. I understand that a-ha's sound needs to progress and evolve, but this CD is de-evolution. That's why it's named Analogue. Guess we'll just have to chalk this album up as a bad one amoung seven good ones. Hope the next is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've seen better times...","review":"I do not want to sound old-timey, but nothing was as good as A-ha's earlier albums. I've been their fan since childhood and that is one of the bands which are not only my favourite but also affected my philosophy and perception with their incredible, totally out-of-this world romanticism. I think \\"East of the Sun...\\" is a masterpiece; songs from other albums such as \\"Cold rains of April\\" or \\"The sun never shines...\\" still touch me; but speaking about \\"Lifelines\\" and \\"Analogue\\", there are only 2 or 3 songs I can single out. Something LACKS. I understand that the guys at the age of 45 cannot perform the same music they did in their twenties, but... Revolt, passion, melancholy, unrestrained sincerity of the earlier years became nothing but EASY LISTENING. It grieves me so much. So, I give 4 stars more as a tribute to the music I USED to adore and to the great guys who, I'm sure, A-ha still are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another awful cd for a-ha.

This book, as referred to in the title, was a real eye opener. Bernstein touches on an array of subjects including factory farming, the value of humans and animals, and animal experimentation. I had no idea that animals were treated so badly in our society. However, the author does a good job in conveying these horrific facts in the book. He also does a good job in his research. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the author did a thorough job in researching and supporting his arguments. The book is very persuasive because the author presents his argument, and immediately addresses the possible counter arguments. With this structure, it is difficult to disagree with his opinions. Overall, the book kept my interest throughout and I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about our relationship with animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW BAD WAS IT?","review":"The year 1816 is known in the US for days of bitter cold in the Northeast that summer.

I was able to cut one dolphin out of a sandwich made of white bread, two dolphins out of whole-wheat bread. The cutter wasn't quite sharp enough to cut all the way through the sandwiches, leaving the bottom piece of bread a little ragged and torn. However, the top 2/3 was fine, and the sandwiches did look adorable in the end. My mom used the cookie cutter to make dolphin cookies, and as she did not mention any problems, I'm assuming it worked as expected.

But unlike most in the genre, they sing primarily about war (as can be told by the titles of their last two albums.)Instead of doing what most modern black metal artists do nowadays by adding a horrendous amount of synths and clean vocals, they have opted for a completley different route. In leu of the traditional clean vocals to break up the screaming, they have instead incorporated a more viking chant approach. This creates an interesting atmosphere.It's sad that more people won't check this out due to its unblasphemous nature. But that is their loss. This is a great band that deserves more mainstream blackmetal fans attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Boring","review":"I found the plot tiresome. Given that Joanna was treated in an inhuman way by her ex-husband, I don't think I understand why she would enter into a deceptive relationship with the old man only to develop the hots for his son. She was misjudged by Demetri but she brought that about through her own agreement to pose as the old man's mistress. I don't know but there was some lack of tact on her part and that of the old man's when he sought to use the very woman he was trying to protect and help to deceive his family. A woman's honour should not only be protected at all times but should also be seen to be protected. For Joanna to go along with the deceitful plot made her as guilty as the old man in dishonouring the honour of womanhood. I did not like the book because Joanna helped to dishonour womanhood. It is one thing to be misjudged and another to give sufficient reason to cause the misjudgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Brand of Teen-Friendly Feminism","review":"I am a teacher and I am always looking for supplementary material to help with the course material in the classroom.

After all, he had a letter from her brother-in-law vouching for his identity and honor. He was supposed to be a writer who was in the area to write a book on the relics in Hamdry and the moors. In truth, he was under orders by the Fay King, himself, to keep an eye on Clarice.The most I can tell you without revealing the surprises, yet to help you understand what this book is about and whether you would enjoy it, is that the Fay King needed Clarice as a pawn due to a war in the Fay world. Dominic was to be her jailer and guardian, because the King's enemy was trying to kidnap Clarice for different reasons.Full of magic, faeries, and a few mythical beings, this is the ULTIMATE of Super Natural Romance books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monkeemaniac's Dream Come True","review":"This deluxe edition is a first class reissue of the debut album.

If you are a casual Monkees fan, seek out the previous single-disc remaster from Rhino.

If I had, I wouldn't have bought it, because it is a philosophy book about gardening. I tend to buy gardening books that have lots of photos or diagrams of examples.

If you don't have a strong grip or find yourself stapling many times throughout the day the \\"one finger - 20 page power\\" feature of this stapler really comes in handy. I wouldn't recommend using this stapler for securing items on a wall or bulletin board, but for every day office use it certainly gets the job done. Adding new staples isn't the most intuitive process, but the yellow sticker helps explain how to accomplish this feat as each time I guarantee you will forget which way to load in the staples. Overall a quality stapler for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jammed Thing!","review":"I've NEVER had a stapler that jams as bad as this. I HATE it. What a terrible waste of money.

And we just normally staple an average of 10 pages or below."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst stapler ever!","review":"This stapler never worked out of the packaging. Basically a waste of money. The staple feed mechanism is terrible, it always spits out 2 staples at a time that tangle up and jam the stapler. Don't be fooled by the fancy blue color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ease","review":"Is it possible to have a major improvement over all other desk staplers? Yes, this is it. It works with little pressure. The only thing I don't like is if you need to re-staple over an old staple say just below the original staple, the action can be blocked making it hard to staple. For most purposes this is a far superior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Stapler, Lives Up to Its Claims","review":"I've been using this in my office for the last 3 years and it is awesome. In those three years of fairly continual use it has never once jammed or failed. It is surprisingly lightweight given its ability to staple a large number of sheets - and yes, it easily staples 20+ pages with one finger operation. For fun I tested its capacity, and it began to fail at about 27 or 28 sheets, and that is primarily because the staple can't bend properly for a stack of sheets that thick. It still has no problem punching through with ease. All in all this stapler rocks and is recommended without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"You could use a finger to staple!","review":"Honestly, you could use a finger to press down and staple without hurting yourself! Everyone else has said it, so I won't repeat; bottom line is it must be magic it so effortless to use. So if you want the best stapler to date, this is it. Only complaint is the boring color!Update May 2006: No complaint now, they come in colors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"We all have staplers like this on our desks, and they are great!

I will not be choosing this brand for my replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works, but doesn't last long","review":"I have had four PaperPro staplers (three different models). These are wonderful when they work. But all of them have lasted only a few months of very light usage. I thought the first one was a lemon and bought another because it was such a great stapler when it did work. But the others haven't lasted long either. I went and bought their staples, thinking it may be a staple problem, but that didn't work either.Its frustrating because I REALLY love the stapler when it works. But after paying a lot of money for three different models only to have all of them die quickly, I'm done with Paper Pro staplers. Theyy're a heartbreak waiting to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 10 uses.","review":"After 10 uses, the stapler has jammed.

It's called the Ominous Omnibus which means threatening bus.

He never has trouble getting to sleep because he always has the same bed. We plan on using this as his bed until he outgrows it or kills it, whichever comes first. :) Buy a couple of fitted sheets and write off the expensive cribs. This is all you need for the first two years!**Edit at age 4** This pack n' play is still going strong.

It is only single sided, with a rubber type backing that helps keep the mousepad in place, which works very well on my glass topped desk. My G500 glides effortlessly across it, while still giving just enough tactile feel for precise movements (and aiming in games). The surface is large enough so I never run out of tracking room, but not too big as to take up half my desk. Tracking for the G500 sensor has never been an issue on this surface. The mouse's feet are the originals and have not worn down after 6 months of intense use. It is also very, very thin.

The toast settings work well, and will toast from very lightly to charred, and everything in between. There are two long slots, so that bread of various sizes can be toasted. There is a bagel button which allows toasting of one side only (so that it toasts the top, but not the bottom of the bagel).

It is wonderful for the curious reader. However, as a scholarly work, it is lacking in precise details. In comparison to Knut Gjerset's History of Iceland, it is an easier read but with less information. While Karlsson touches upon a vareity of topics, he does not delve into them at great depth. However, this book would be great to find a topic that the reader would like to research or learn more about just because the nature of the book gives such a broad overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to Iceland","review":"A very readable history of Iceland, though it might have a few too many details and numbers for some people (not me).

He more than complements the meagre information about Indiana and jazz which was previously relegated to brief references to the Wolverines at the Casino Gardens and that Bix Beiderbecke and Frank Trumbauer joined Whiteman there. Jazz great Eddie Condon from Goodland, Indiana is only one of many musicians, Hoosier and otherwise who played in Indianapolis and/or recorded at the famous Gennett studios in Richmond, Indiana. The list of names are a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" in jazz. Sheidt knows his subject matter well. The book is loaded with photographs, many of which are Duncan's.

First was the bench. It had a big crack down the middle, not enough to split it, just enough to look terrible. Next I attempted to put the table together. The wood on one of the legs was split down the middle making it unusable. I was directed to the manufacturer, and I could not speak to anyone directly, I was only able leave a message. After 6 tries, I actually spoke to someone who was rude and reluctant to replace the piece. When I finally got the new piece, it was the wrong one. I wanted a refund but was persuaded to try a replacement table. I then opened the corner unit and discovered it was filled with nicks, chips and cracks. This time I wanted my money back!

Musically superb, cosmopolitan and European in feel, the album was ahead of its time and still has something to say. LIFELINE, the final track, blends foresight with environmental concern; CHERCHEZ LA FEMME is music to fall in and out of love to and DARK EYED JOHNNY still forms the soundtrack to motorcycle rides and days when things don't go right.

Soon artists start to die and we are not shown the killers' face, but if you ever watched Scooby-Doo you can figure this one out, it was that bad. The movie also makes a criticism of Hip-Hop music in the beginning as all sounding the same with limited topics. It has burned itself out. The bad plot was topped with bad acting and bad music. And when I say bad, I don't mean good. No sex. No nudity. The F-bomb was dropped, but was used sparingly. I am not sure why someone would watch this film. There doesn't seem to be any attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verve Remix 2 Rocks!!!!","review":"I thought it was impossible to surpass the Verve Remixed, but Verve Remixed 2 exceeded any and all expectations that I had.

Disc packaged in clear jewel case; total running time: 72:08. Booklet does not include information about the original recordings (not even songwriting credits).There are once again two remixes of Nina Simone recordings. There are also two Ella Fitzgerald recordings remixed.

The highlight is a viscious live cut of Mighty Mighty, the Curtis Mayfield classic, with a blistering horn section the backdrop to a monster funk jam. Huey's untimely death has lead to a limited range of tracks with a couple of versions of the same songs (hence the four star review) but don't let that put you off somebody who was sure to right up there with Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield,George Clinton and The Ohio Players as one of soul-funks phattest funkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantomimed","review":"Serious Version On Change Is Gonna Come,Up There With Sam Cooke With-Out A Doubt.About Time It Has Been Placed On CD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good game at all; kids might like ramp though","review":"My pet peeve is when toy designers think of a gimmick and then design a game around it.

In addition even though the author gets along well with the community, like so many bush teachers, he leaves after only a few short years. Although the meat of this book is the author's adventures with his new friends, there are several comments on bush schools in the first chapter and several more sprinkled throughout.

If the plot of Janie Jones sounds familiar, it's because its skeleton pretty closely matches that of Sofia Coppola's film Somewhere. The difference? Somewhere is worth watching, while Janie Jones is not. So what kept the latter from reaching the heights of the former? I say Janie Jones, which stars Abigail Breslin as the daughter and Alessandro Nivola as the father, is entirely too familiar in its themes and, despite effective performances from its leads, never quite musters the dramatic heft it needs to outshine the others of its ilk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has been done better.","review":"This is a pretty familiar tale of a father who has his previously unknown child dumped on him by a long-forgotten one night stand. The story is both predictable and somewhat boring, but the worst part is the music. It's not really terrible, but it's very simple and some of it was obviously written for the Breslin girl, who is obviously not a musician in any way. That said, the ACTING in this movie is pretty good. Abigail Breslin, especially does a great job in that department. After all, she is an actress, so that's what she does. However, when they were casting the part, it might have been better to put someone in the role who actually had some musical background, as well. There are some very good acting performances by several of the supporting players, too. Unfortunately, even really good acting can't raise the level of the poor material enough to make it very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ode to Janie Jones","review":"Since the plot has already been told in the product description and rehashed sufficiently by fellow reviewers, I'll be brief. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but it far surpassed the mediocre expectations I held. The cast, especially Abigail Breslin, blew me away. At no point did I feel as if I was watching a movie because I was entirely immersed in the story. The musical interludes underscored and sometimes alleviated the intense emotions of the characters and the audience.The entire movie felt immensely believable. The song choices were impeccable. I especially loved the ending lyrics; \\"Find love, and then give it all away.\\" I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie. I plan on watching it again this weekend and sharing it with my mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Cloudy","review":"Janie Jones is part of the Tribeca Film Series. At its' heart it is a deeply affecting father-daughter story. Ethan Brand (Alessandro Nivola) is a hard partying musician on the comeback trail with his band when an old flame decides to go to rehab leaving him in charge of his previously unknown thirteen year old daughter Janie Jones (Abigail Breslin) As Ethan Brand continues to spiral out of control, progressively losing everything, Janie is there to bail him out, as everyone else turns away from him.All of the characters were so deeply fleshed out that they stuck with me after the film ended. I also appreciated that the filmmakers didn't go with the cliché happy ending, yet offered the viewer the idea that Janie and Ethan could be okay. The lighting along with location shooting and set design came together to give Janie Jones a dark and gritty feel more than worthy of the seedy transient characters that inhabit the story.Best film I've watched in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 Stars - Needs More Realism but Has Some Heart","review":"Janie Jones is one of those smaller films that depends on their story and it delivers pretty solidly until the end. The teenage actress who appeared in Little Miss Sunshine works well in this film, making some borderline saccarine scenes play as authentic. Elisabeth Shue is fine in her smaller role but you get the feeling that a lesser known actress could have done just as well. The story is essentially the development of a relationship between a rocker dad and the daughter he didn't know. What makes it work is that lead actor is good enough as a singer to qualify as a rocker not good enough to be great. The relationship between him and his \\"surprise\\" teenage daughter is rocky and a work-in-progress that is good to see develop. The ending is pat and neat...which disappoints. If you like films like the recent FAMILIES LIKE US, then this is one that may appeal to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why only in english?","review":"See the tittle.Its a good movie, i want to buy it, but i'm peruvian and some people in my house dont understand english.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hundred Years of Navajo Rugs","review":"This is an excellent book for the beginning collector of Navajo Rugs.

Not On A White Horse is a perfect example. I read it so many times, when I had it. This book showcases one girl, Riannon, just before her teenage years, in a dead end town with a horrible family life. Then there is Angel, a hard headed white arabian who would rather be free wandering the hills than be captured. And then there are the people who own him, who give Ri a second home and her horse dreams. Very good!

It's amusing that people think Hudson's friend Jim Nabors was gay (because of a party joke about a \\"Rock/Pyle\\" wedding handed around Fire Island) and Phyllis Gates was straight. She was part of a fake couple (lesbian/gay man) and didn't hold up her end of the bargain. She bullied Hudson into not having lovers whenever possible and had as many girl lovers as she wished (because she was less in the public eye).

Lots of good stories about Hollywood in the 50's. The rise and fall of her marriage to Rock was interesting. She could have taken him to the cleaners or ruined his career but did neither.

I was left with the same question as the author: Did he simply marry her to cover his homosexuality and to protect his career? You can't know for sure, but it seems to be that way. The book didn't leave me with much respect for Rock Hudson. I was also convinced that his agent was a horrible person. Both Rock and he were just plain weird in an icky way. Rock seems very petty. He pouts for a day when his wife points out that the sailfish she caught was just slightly bigger than the one he caught.

Provide practice exams that are worded similarly to the tests---the test questions in this book did not even resemble the grammatical structure and syntax that I encountered on the real exam.Bottom line: buy another book"},{"rating":"2","title":"PMP here I come...","review":"I've only just started making use of this text, but I already recognize that it adds that 'ooomph' that can take you over the edge when attempting the PMP exam.

It did'nt work for me!","review":"I can't remember reading a book that is so patronizing as this. After reading through the entire book once I dumped it because I could bear the pain no longer. The clichés and the put-downs I found very annoying.Is that to say there were no golden nuggets from this book? Of course not, but when you are reading it and beginning to enjoy the content, Rita throws in a phrase like \\"If you are great project manager you will do this....\\". Project Management is not set in stone, different organizations adopt different project methodologies, so its not a one hat fits all profession.Many other readers enjoyed reading it as reflected in the reviews, and have used it to pass their exams, but it definitely was not for me, hence 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough, but opinionated","review":"The good: it's thorough and covers more material than a number of other prep books out there. There is material covered here in depth that isn't in the PMBOK. The author does have some good explanations for the PMBOK content that, if you can get past the author's patronizing tone, can be helpful.The bad: it's full of Rita's opinions on what you should do and it reminds you that the reason no one knows the full title of this book is because she's good at relationship marketing. There is material here that isn't in the PMBOK -- material which I found confusing and, at times, contrary to what was in the PMBOK. I hated the attitude of the author, found the \\"games\\" to be insulting to my intelligence, and found that I was better off just reading the PMBOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rita book - so much easier to read tham PMBOK!","review":"After struggling with the PMBOK for several weeks in my study group, i finally bought Rita Mulcahy's book, PMP Exam Prep.

Then I purchased Andy Crowe's book and read it cover to cover twice. I was thinking on taking the test when I decided to try Rita's book again. That was the best decision I made. The information in this book complemented the material I read on Andy's. Rita provides lots of very important details and not so obvious information about each process that are fundamental to pass the test. I did not rate it 5 starts because if you do not understand or are not very clear about the material and / or the PMI process, this should not be your first or sole source of study. I passed the exam thanks to the combination of two great books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"The tips in this book are useful, but the book has many problems:-incomplete or dated coverage: I took the test this morning (I passed) and I would estmate that close to 10% of the questions were on topics that got no coverage at all or dated coverage.-errors: although the website states that addenda are published, there are mistakes and omissions in the book that no corrections have been published for yet.-marginal presentation: I did not feel the book was organized well. Furthermore the index is quite poor. It took longer to use than it should have.-pompous attitude: While I didnt remove any points for this I think if you are going to continually mention how PMs should be fired for project failure or mistakes you should at least get the content of your book correct.-too much crosselling: again no points removed but it is annoying .If you can live with the errors in the book add a star. The tips are useful but I don't think it comes near to living up its hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended... the only book you'll need","review":"This is the only book you'll need to prepare for the PMP exam. Literally, I only used this as a study guide (I didn't even open the PMBOK) and passed the exam on the first try.

The quizzes at the end of each chapter are very representative of the types of questions you'll get on the exam. If you really nail the quizzes, you'll do fine on the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study aid","review":"Of the 3 books I studied for my PMP, this one was a closest match to the style and content of the questions on the test.

I passed on the first go around. Bad - IMHO, this book alone is not enough. I had a prep course which was invaluable in giving hints on the \\"need to know\\" and \\"not worth the study time\\" topics. I also found that there were a number of topics covered as \\"must knows\\" in the prep course that were not covered in the Rita's book or the Kerzner textbook.In general - as an aid, the book is fantastic; however, I do have one beef with the book... I found it really patronizing. The author quite frequently makes statements in the book that say (paraphrased, of course) that if you don't know XYZ topic, then you're not a good project manager. Honestly, this got annoying after the first time reading it.

She keeps reminding the reader that, if they don't understand some part of the material, they are not true project managers and will never pass the test. I feel that she is intimidated by succesful PMs who don't have the PMP certification.

When I read this one and I tried really hard not to compare the book with the TV show as I know these books where written first, but it was hard not to compare them to each other. I believe at the end of the book Elena becomes a vampire by accident and the TV show she doesn't. Now I don't know how accurate the book and TV show are in line. I don't know if one book equals one season of the TV show. But I still noticed difference with the two. I know that they are to be different but I would think that it wouldn't be too different. But I enjoyed reading this book just the same. I recommend this one to anyone who is reading vampire stories or at least the Vampire Diaries series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I received this book in excellent condition nothing wrong with it at all.

Damon wants to destroy his brother and keep Elena for himself and there doesn't seem to be much they can do to stop him. Damon isn't the only danger though, Caroline, Elena's arch rival, wants to destroy Elena and she doesn't care if Stefan gets caught in the crossfire.This series is still quite readable but it hasn't improved much since the first volume. Every time I find myself starting to like Elena she does something stupid or gets all weepy for no reason. Also, Elena and Stefan's supposed inability to fight back against anyone that is trying to hurt them is just frustrating and ridiculous. Another thing that keeps this series from being great is Damon, he's just not a very compelling villain. However, L. J. Smith's addictive writing makes this an entertaining, quick read and the series is still good despite it's flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book purchase","review":"I purchased this book along with The Awakening for my daughter as part of her Christmas gifts.

By the end of the third book, Elena has undergone a great deal of emotional maturity in a few short weeks. She ends up becoming quite unselfish and likable.\\" In this, the second book in that series, Elena is still in the first round of that transformation.

It introduces Ray McKinley with a post World War II band (1949), with exceptional arrangements by Eddie Sauter. The sound quality is fine. There is a marginal background crackle, which I prefer. It adds to the authenticity of the era and recording. McKinley first hit the scene with Will Bradley in the late 1930's, then spent several years with Glenn Miller.The cuts here are performed with verve and high energy. The Eddie Sauter arrangements are so strong. This is not a newer Glenn Miller orchestra, but one moving into a new life. Based on another review, I was prepared to listen to another just-so recording. That is not the case.

She was also required to write 2 poems for the final in this course using this textbook as an example, but, they were not to rhyme. She almost died trying NOT to ryhme. Somehow she survived.

And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad.

THE SWITCH is up to her usual high standards of interesting, believable characters and excellent storytelling. I may be a little biased toward this book, since I used to live in Dallas and she captured the flavor of my old neighborhood exactly.

How could Melina know the name and address of the killer if she wasn't at the restaurant and never went to the clinic. All Chief said about him was that he worked at Waters and had glasses. She then calls the clinic and asks for him by name? From that point on, the ending was so obvious and all other hints seemed ridiculous. I even guessed about Chief's father. The only surprise was the hystertomy which didn't add much to the thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a real disappointment","review":"I usually like Brown's books, but this one left me cold. As avid mystery readers, her characters did some of the most basic stupid things I've ever read. The Chief is hiding out and call his hotel and has his clothes sent to where he is hiding out - how stupid is that. And the police questioning everyone in one room at the same time?

Although it had all the prerequisites for a good story I felt it lacked depth. We really never get to know the characters despite all the soul searching they seem to go through.

The subject content of this book will turn many people off, and parts of reading it have a dirty, sleazy feel to it that is uncomfortable. The storyline is also a bit far-fetched, and is confusing at times. Why are these twins switching places as adult women? Isn't it a bit juvenile to still be doing that?

A man who falls into the bed of a twin right after the death of her sister whom he also slept with...ewww. The relationships between Hart and the sisters was disgusting and degrading. There was also no real connection between the twins. Not to mention that the holes in the plot were big enough to fly a spaceship through.

This book continues to disappoint. I skippped through much of it because Brown did not flesh out the characters enough to make me care about them. I thought they were boring. I did not care about them, and there was hardly any romance. I didn't understand why they even wanted to be together. I hate to beat up on Ms. Brown because I cherish her earlier books and often reread them.

Once again she wrote about religious fanatics. I'm curious to know why she is so obsessed with these people. She should write a book about that!In THE SWITCH the characters weren't overly likeable or dislikeable and neither was the story. Brown has a gift for keeping the reader guessing from chapter to chapter, but in this novel her attempts fell flat. The story was too predictable and the clues were easy to pick up on, you'll definitely figure it out. Unfortunately, I wasn't buying the romantic angle of the novel either. For reasons I cannot say without giving something away.If you're a Sandra Brown fan, you might enjoy this book. It's a quick read and an interesting idea.

It was predictable (come on guys- \\"thrilling?\\") and shallow. There were typos in the book and the grammar needed a review of it's own.

The characters, presented as extremely intelligent and strong, continue to do and say idiotic things that just don't make sense. Certain plot twists are very contrived and over the edge. As I listened to the book on unabridged audio, I kept thinking to myself, \\"She'd never do that or say that\\" and in the end, it still didn't make sense. Basically, while the story was interesting, I just didn't buy it as believable in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial and contrived","review":"The premise of this book is that a set of twins switch places one evening and as a result one of the twins is murdered. The premise is patently unbelievable and strained to it's limits; the dialogue between characters is artificial and contrived. The author uses language which sends you running to the dictionary to figure out what on earth she means since much of it is unheard of and taken out of context; as a result the characters are cold and unsympathetic. No basis for empathy for the surviving sister (Melina) exists. Don't waste the money for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first foray into the world of Sandra Brown","review":"I wasn't terribly impressed. The plot twist at the end made me go back and reread some parts that seemed unbelievable. Either I read too quickly of the images that I was left with at the begining of the bookd were purposefully misleading to get to the ending.I also did not understand Chief and his tortured self.

Sandra Brown is one of my favorites, however, The Switch was disappointing. I thought the characters were very vague. The only thing that did surprise me was in the end, regarding the twins, even then, I felt that I was hanging still wondering about certain things. I felt there was no definite closure on this novel. This novel needed much more detailed accounts of everything. In my opinion, Brown did not think all the way through on this one or even left certain things out that really needed to be there. Even though alot of thriller/mystery writers want to leave you hanging, there was to much missing in this story. I will not let this one ruin my confidence in Brown on future books though. I have read many of her novels and have loved them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I've only read two of Sandra Brown's books (the other being Standoff) and I thought this one was pretty bad. I never saw what everyone else thought was so bad about Standoff; I thought it was pretty good. This one was just plain stupid. It starts off good, building the characters and the plot quite well. But then, about halfway through, it changes form from clever thriller to stupid soap opera. Personally, I saw the ending coming from the beginning, but that's not to say everyone will. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book! If you're dying to read it, rent it at the library. You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Punch heads are not very durable","review":"I've had this unit for about 6 weeks and it worked well until a head broke today. I called the company thinking that 6 weeks was a little premature and they told me that the unit has a lifetime warranty on everything except the head and that the heads that cost $53.59 for a set of 3 should be replaced approximately every 100 punches. Had I known that I would not have purchased this unit. That is a very considerable addition to the cost of printing that was not disclosed anywhere pre-purchase. Furthermore, $53.59 is crazy, I was expecting them to say $6 or $7 for a set of 3. Yes when it's not broken it works fine, but they need to be more honest about the cost of operating this unit. Had it said anything about that in the description I'd give the unit a 5 but since they ignore it and pretend it isn't an issue they get a 2 and I really should give it a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of perspective please!","review":"I found this book to be important and fascinating as a clinical social worker, wife, mother and friend. Obviously psychotropic meds can and are helpful for a number of disorders which need addressing. However, it appears that we as a society have become totally hooked on the idea that everything from anxiety to pre-menstrual syndrome can and should be alleviated with medication. And don't get me started on the number of children being prescribed psychotropic medications for all kinds of things. Do we even prepare people for the fact that it is nearly impossible to wean from these drugs without horrendous side effects? These are the most prescribed medications in America today.

The first chapter is powerful and true. However, this author irresponsibly attacks the parents of the mentally ill as responsible for their children's illnesses!!!! He also attacks NAMI, the National Association of the Mentally Ill, an organization that has helped more mentally ill patients recover, find support and their way to a successful and meaningful life, and has truly educated more people about mental illness than Breggin has ever done himself, I am sure. The good points the book makes about inadequate and even harmful psychiatric care in mental institutions are, in my opinion, obfuscated by his unwarranted attacks on parents -- attacks, I believe, that may be a result of his old-fashioned psychoanalytical training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ask what year this author got his medical license!","review":"Having read this book years ago from cover to cover, and looking at it again today, it is clear that the Doctor hasn't kept up with the science. Much of what he says is true, however, much of it is self congratulatory, opinionated and out dated anecdote. Everyone needs love, and most would be happier with more empathy and therapy. This will not necessarily translate into holding a job, sustaining frindships or putting food on the table. This approach does allow for living on disability for a lifetime, at the working person's expense, and being an activist against Big Pharma while throwing the baby out with the bath water!

The fear-mongering nature of this read provides an extremely biased point-of-view by throwing psychiatric techniques at the reader that are either out-of-date or have been changed to better the patient(s) involved. A mental state is a DIRECT result of a particular brain state, and therefore, a disturbed continual mental state creating dysfunction in the individual must be a result of altered neurochemicals and must be corrected through proper medications.

To this day, it resists even the slightest control over its most abusive practices such as state mental hospitals, involuntary drugging, electroshock and lobotomy, and it fights every attempt to increase patients rights.\\" The book describes known problems with the various minor and major tranquilizers and mood altering drugs as well as ECT, electroconvulsive therapy. The book will be useful to parents and others as a reference, if not pleasant reading. Ones conclusions should be that psychiatry is to be avoided to the extent possible. One must assume responsibility for ones own behavior and there are less harmful alternatives to psychiatry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be read by every psychiatric patient.","review":"After my own 25 years in the mental health field it is refreshing to discover a colleague willing to lay out the facts.

Personally, I've always felt it was a great family movie. However, the movie mastered to this DVD edition is absolutely awful. It's so poorly done that it is unwatchable. It looks like a bad, smeary vhs copy. Picture is dull and lacks detail and sharpness. I tried to watch for a few minutes but ended up tossing this into the trash.

This ranks as one of them. Recently, some directors have fallen into the trap of putting style over content, but Big Bullet manages to reverse this trend. The story follows a demoted cop who joins with the Emergency Unit to capture two dangerous criminals. This unit has the usual mixture of cops each with their own story. However, Benny Chan has managed to create an excellent chemistry between the five heroic leads. Up against them are two of Hong Kongs great villains, Anthony Wong and Yu Wing Gong. Naturally the sparks fly spectatularly. Highly entertaining viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood favorite","review":"I have loved this book since I was 6-years-old.

Not only for the local history, but for the story of a woman. She was a woman who could have played cards and held tea parties, but she chose to use her brains, and money, to bring quality television to the Northwest. I, and many other baby boomer children, benefited from the efforts. Dorothy reinvented herself after the deaths of her father, brother and husband. It's a profile in courage, to borrow a JFK book title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorothy Stimson Bullitt: An Uncommon Life","review":"For anyone interested in the early \\"movers and shakers\\" of Seattle and particularly in the woman who built the first broadcasting empire between San Francisco and Minneapolis, this book will prove useful. Dorothy Stimson Bullitit's successful competition--without any previous business training--against the broadcast giants, her striving for higher standards in TV programming and her support of educational television and classical music radio all make her worthy of a biography. While the minutae of domestic details about her early life in Seattle's high society may interest some, to devote almost half the book to the period before her love affair with broadcasting began does slow the pace. Although it is obvious that the writer knew and admired her subject, the biography would have benefited from the writer being more selective in her details and aiming for a more objective interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can do it!","review":"This book is more advanced than others such as \\"Dare to Repair\\".

Tim Tebow is very inspirational and sends a good message to everyone on how to adapt to new journeys.

The thinking was to scrap the receivers speakers & use the Yamaha set. Got home, read the reviews on the receiver and took that unit back. Returned home & did a little more reading. Read the 2 outstanding reviews here and made the purchase. This unit is very nice and I'm thrilled with it. Yes the owners manual can be difficult to decipher and if you've never ran a patch cable in your life... get some help from someone who has or pay the fee to have a pro do it.

At least one out of three sentences are fragmented throughout this novel (and the series). While I understand that the use of a sentence fragment can be effective when used sparingly, this author has written an entire trilogy comprised almost entirely of fragments!Honestly, it makes the author look as though he has no command of the English language at all.His Cimmerians wear ponchos, which seem wildly out of place for the culture, and the author misidentifies the Shemites as a black race. Twice in the trilogy he mentions the ebony skin of Belit - a woman Robert E. Howard described as having ivory skin.The fragments really ruined the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique additon to the Conan Saga","review":"I have been reading Robert E. Howard for 23yrs now and own every book he wrote including the pastiches. This is a unique addition to the Hyborian Kingdom. The characters, (esp. Kern), have enough of the characteristics of Robert E. Howards style to be familiar yet are not just rip-offs. Loren Coleman maintains his own style yet still carries the flavour over from the Conan adventures. His use of unique paragraph breaks create suspense within the story without leaving you hanging. I have never seen this way of writing and I have read many, many books. The paragraph ends with an uncertain outcome or one with several possibilities and the next begins as if it was present after a comma, so there is no pause in the action just that, as indicated by a paragraph break. A good read and I look forward to more in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short read","review":"This book was suprisingly good.

Yes there are diagrams that show where to lay down the cones or line tape to perform team sport drills. This wasn't the book of exercise drills that I was hoping for. I know now to look at how many color pictures and pages the book has before I buy it. This book is meant for a coach of a large team because it had nothing but drills running back and forth around orange cones. Maybe its my fault because the book is 101 agility drills and there were differt ways to arrange cones on a field just not 101 exercise like jumping jacks or diamond push-ups or any thing better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I'd love cold coffee","review":"I won't try to be authoritative, as there are loads of great reviews for the 600ml version of the Mizudashi.

I love strong, hot black coffee, so I was really buying this for my wife. Turns out I quickly gained an appreciation for this Japanese style coffee.

The DVD does inform regarding the many artists that Tom has culled from over the years...but speaks so little about the man I was interested to watch about...Tom Waits! If you want depth, then this is good for you.

I am a general surgery resident and thus I thought I would find this book especially interesting. I did not. The author makes some interesting and valid observations, however I felt the book lacked any true analysis of what it really means to be a surgeon. If I were a medical student reading this I would steer clear of a career in surgery! Specifically I was annoyed by her contention that surgeons are merely clinicians and not true scientists as well as her insistence on referring to all surgeons by the male gender (a point she made early on).

When my oldest daughter got her first apartment at college, I let her take it since it's a wonderful source of advice for kids new to the kitchen. Somehow it got lost over the intervening years so I was as pleased as Hawaiian punch to find it in Amazon z-shops, even though it's out of print.Corum is a librarian in Hawaii who has published several other cookbooks. \\"Easy Cooking:The Island Way\\" is a good way to try out some of her recipes and to enjoy her easy Island style.

The band may not be \\"tr00 m3t4l\\", and they may have radio play, but I seriously don't care. This is the last album by them that tends to have a semi-progressive feel to it, and this is what tends to get me into this album so much. \\"World So Cold\\" is definitely my favorite song, but it's a shame that the media had to butcher it so much for radio play. It's a memorable ballad that will stick in your head. \\"Not Falling\\" has a definite progressive nature to it, and \\"Silenced\\" is an energetic song.Overall, I recommend this album to anyone who can keep an open mind and actually care about music.

But the rest of the disk is evidence that there is some weird demand for bands that yell and scream unintelligibly, and Mudvayne succumbs to the pressure of the demand. I don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"there baaaaaack","review":"At first i didnt like the CD i was liek what the hell they turnd soft on me...god this sux bring back the L.D.50 and listen to some \\"Dig\\" Well after a while i sold it i didnt care for it. Witch was a mistake by the way all of a sudden i wanted to listen to \\"Not Falling\\" again, so i did what i had to do i bought it again. And this time i was like holy [...] why did i ever sell this cd, it is amazing. I still care for L.D. 50 more than this album but at times i like this one more than L.D. 50 it just depends on my mood. The 1st track is one of my favs and all the way down to the last track, all the songs are good some are ok but overall its a damn well good cd, i recomend this to anyone that likes metal, besure to check out there new album thats comming out very very soon...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better","review":"Yeah, I've given Mudvayne a lot more respect since they scrapped their whole silly make up thing; they never really needed it! And this album also rocks: it's PUNISHING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mudvayne-end of all things to come","review":"Sadlly Mudvayne has hit and really missed in my book with this one. I bought this cause the fist single Not Falling was much like Dig witch made me pick up thier first cd. After a couple time playing it on my cd player and hearing the song on the radio the cd was out of heavy rotation with me. The only song that really sticks with me is the Dig Everything and nothing remix on the Resident Evil Soundtrack. I will be previewing any Mudvayne cd that comes out from now on. The one hard song to get you to buy thier cds and the rest just being more calm or boring is not worth my hard earned money. I would expect that this metal band live up to what I picture they should be, with songs like Dig and Not Falling making you shell out that money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"The only reason I gave this album two stars is because some of the songs start off with the right attitude. It doesn't take long, though, for the hard-edged, visceral riffs to give way to empty single note soliloquoys with the lead singer whining about how life sucks. I'll admit that I haven't read the lyrics, but how can I care what someone has to get across in their music if they bore me? They should realize...music first, then message. This band could be awesome if they could manage to maintain the intensity of the first twenty seconds of their songs. I only like a few of the songs on the first album, but I can't even say I enjoyed one on this. I'm not going to put them down anymore. If you didn't absolutely love the first album, then pass this one by; they haven't improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"am i missing something?","review":"again another review of a mudvayne album i had the dis-pleasure of being reccomended where is the music where is the vocals?all i hear is mindless back of the throat screaming and i can do thatyeah i can tune my guitar flat get my granddad to play bass get a dim witted monkey to play the drums and what have i got \\"mudvayne\\" that what i've got there a talentless bunch of nu-metallers who make good charlotte sound like bob dylan with their lyrical alblitiesbecause mudvayne have nonei really tried mudvayne fans i really tried to like this god forsaken metal you all love but i just can't i'd rather listen to the pioneers of space rock hawkwind motorhead and black sabbath than this bunch of clowns"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited crap sucks","review":"you guys who all bought the edited version of mudvayne are posers.

IT IS LIKE LISTENING TO SLIPKNOT EDITED WHICH RUINS THE CD. if you want the REAL the end of all things to come get the parental advisory one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intellegent, Very Talented","review":"Mudvayne are an awesome band. Unlike most nu metal bands that usually sound the same, these guys are intellegent, and very talented. The End Of All Things To Come is a great follow up to the kick ass major label debut L.D. 50. Every song is excellent. Chud is an excellent vocalist blending angry screams with some emotional melody. Guug's guitar riffs will stay stuck in your head for a long time. Spug's drumming is pretty good on here, and of course Ru-d's excellent fretline bass playing. This guy can do slaps, pops, everything. Best songs are Silenced, The End Of All Things To Come, Not Falling, World So Cold, Trapped In The Wake Of A Dream, A Key To Nothing, and Mercy, Severity. Do yourself a favor, throw away your crap Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park cds, and start listening to some Mudvayne, great album.Also look for Mudvayne's new album Lost and Found coming out on April 12th. Peace Out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands up to Letal Dosage","review":"This album is the best album I've heard in a very long time and this genre of music isn't what I prefer. I'm more interested in bands such as Face to Face, NUFAN, AFI, and Bad Religion. I had my friend make a copy of L.D. 50 when I heard -1 and I thought it was a great CD. Nothing to Gein and Severed are awesome songs. Then along comes \\"Not Falling\\" one day over the radio. I thought it wasn't bad. It got better and better the more it came on. My same friend bought \\"The End...\\". I listened to Silenced, then Trapped..., then Not Falling. I was blown away. They are incredible in this album. They are more intune and sound like they took time and used their talents which happen to be in abundance in this CD. World So Cold is all I can say to finish this review. World So Cold..."},{"rating":"2","title":"sell out?? gone soft?? oh heeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllll no!","review":"I really dont understand what people are complaing about. For all \\"naysayers\\", take a second and ask yourself...what did you expect from these guys? Sure an album that had nothing but speed and screaming would have been great, but thats not what mudvayne is. This album sounds like it should, and thats hard hitting and deep. Listen to this and listen to L.D 50 and you will notice the similar dynamics and a natural evolution. Good Job Mudvayne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great album. Very melodic and heavy at the same time. It has something very catchy to every song. It's really worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mudvayne does it again!","review":"I thought that LD 50 was one of the best, most original CDs i had heard in a long time. It was heavy, aggressive, and also melodic at times. This one is better. It still keeps all of what made LD 50 good, without being the same album all over again. It is still heavy, I would even say heavier at times, but it also takes time to be a little slower and more melodic. The lyrics are awesome and Chuud sings even more aggressively and emotionally in this album. This will be a hard act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"mudvayne rocks!","review":"i have like mudvayne ever since L.D. 50, but this cd is absolutely awesome. the best songs are (per)version of a truth and not falling. if you like slipknot, saliva, or disturbed, then this cd is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVEN BETTER THAN LD50","review":"Okay, this album is unbeliveable, it truly is. You probably won't think that after first listen, I didn't either. I had to listen to it at least five or six times until it really sank into my system, but once I got used to it, I absolutely loved it. It is not an album you're going to love at first listen, it has to grow on you, and that fact alone proves very talented songwriting! Most things you like from the get-go usually don't turn out to phase you down the road the same way they did at first listen, you know what I mean. Most music that is truly phenomenal has to grow on you, and this album definitely has that. If you liked LD50, this is a must, it's even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Worth Having!!!","review":"If you are a Mudvayne fan this is a must have. Don't compare it to LD 50 because it is hard to compare any CD that. The first time I listened to it I thought it was OK, but after listening to it several times...it keeps on getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but they've done it again.","review":"Mudvayne's new CD, \\"The End of All Things to Come\\" does not disappoint, even though it is very different from their first, flawless L.D. 50. It plays more like a \\"normal\\" metal album without the intro/sound effects that are before and between tracks on L.D. 50. It is also more radio friendly, especially the first track released, \\"Not Falling\\", making it more listenable for new fans, but it's still Mudvane enough for the purists."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the ... King Says Goes","review":"The end of all things to come is definitely worth buying. If you liked L.D. 50 then you'll like this one almost as much. There are no filler tracts just sonic gold, and crazy alternate timings. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mudvayne has released a cd better than LD 50? yes they have","review":"When i first heard \\"Not Falling\\" i wasnt sure if i liked it, but once i heard it again i was hooked. That was my reaction with most of this cd, dont go in expecting LD 50 and you will end up satisfied if not more. This is a much more mellow album but will not dissapoint those who like heavier music because it is still there just not in large quantaties. It is very much like the transition between Disturbed's \\"The Sickness\\" and \\"Beleive\\". If you werent overly dissapointed by \\"Beleive\\" than it should be the same here, even though this is much better than both Disturbed cds. Lets just face it, Mudvayne is here to stay and thats a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity!!!","review":"Mudvayne's new album doesn't have the raw feeling that L.D. 50 had but I think that it is just as good or better than L.D. 50. Yes, this new album is more produced but the talent and creativity of Mudvayne has shown through in this album. The album is more diverse and has a wider range...The vocals are stressed more and (Chud) does more singing than screaming on this album. But Mudvayne does mix it up and proves to its fans that they aren't sellouts like some people may think. This album is great and has the mix of hard music...and with some more melodic parts. Mudvayne doesn't dissapoint. My personal favorite track on the album is \\"World So Cold\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"Is this music, mudvayne are a kiss/slayer rip-off without the fun of gene simmons and the aggresion of Kerry King, boring songs, stupid makeup and pointless dialouge that you see only in KFC Commercials, this is overrated garbage.If you want REAL Metal check out slayer's rein in bloodThis is rehashable trashI Hate nu metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"What happened to these guys? Just a couple of years ago they sounded like the brave new Tool. LD 50 is a brilliant album. However, upon listening to this album, they sound like Slipknot Lite. Its a terrible mess, inflicted by disorganized songwriting and predictable \\"hardcore\\" riffage and lyrics. This cd is truly garbage and I strongly advise everyone from buying it. The only decent song is \\"Not falling\\". Download it, burn it, and save your money for LD 50 if you don't already have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mudvayne Sold Out!","review":"This CD is much worse than L.D. 50 i don't know what the other people are talking about it is better. Yeah it evolved it evolved into crapy trendy music. They are trying to be something they are not. Mudvayne was the last hope for metal with this slipknot/stone sour & murderdolls and Machine Head selling out we had nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your all Posers","review":"If you get Edited Cd's then your a bunch of posers who are too gentle and childish to get the real crap.

Mudvayne is boring hard rock music. You probably love them if you read Hit Parader magazine, though.

Grow up while you're at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it","review":"I really dont give a flying f**k about what people have to say about Mudvayne, espically ignorent metalheads (yes I am one, and love all types..death,grind,Hair.etc) but the only reason I rip is for better or worse for musicanship....Yet this Mudvayne CD is one of my favorite CD's. I think anyone who likes hard rock or metal should give this one a fair chance..Forget the image (now gone..they lost the makeup) or that they get FM radio and MTV airplay....This CD is brillent..Heavy is parts...Melodic in others..and downright hits a nerve everytime I listen to it....There isn't one bad song on this CD, and I am so impressed with the vocals more then anything...One thing..Please dont compare to them as Slipknot clones..They sound nothing like Slipknot even though they seemed to look like them at one time (or close to it) I believe they are totally unique without a true type of classification...I hope every metalhead and hard rock fan gives this CD a try..I think you will really like it..>ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of All Things to Come","review":"I just can't help but feel Mudvayne is something very special. I like all styles of metal, such as New Wave, Black and Death, and this is in rotation alot. Mudvayne have progressed since LD50, but unfortunately decided to drop the theatrics. The best songs are Silenced, Not Falling, World So Cold and Solve ET Corgula. Check this out if you enjoy their other albums.

The lead singer sounds very much like Bruce Dickinson, with that big operatic style that made Iron Maiden famous. Musically, these guys are most similar to Stratovarius, with the occassional harpsichord and very fast rhythm guitars making some songs sound like they could have come from Stratovarius's Visions disc.The only downside of this album is the ballads, which are mighty sappy and sound a bit too close to the theme music from Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow , the Geo-mod engine is reallyZZzzzzzz....","review":"Better than Unreal? Maybe. As good as a current FPS title? No way. The game is too short, and blowing holes in walls gets real boring after a while.

Since I LOVED the first Red Faction I figured this game would be right up my alley. So I bought it... brought it home... installed it. NO MULTIPLAYER!? NOT EVEN LAN!? Lemme tell you... a FPS without a multiplayer option is like a bathroom without a toilet. If you are a person that plays FPSs for the multiplayer (as I do), do yourself a favor and skip this game. With so many better games out there including Counter Strike 1.6/Condition Zero/Source, Day of Defeat, Half Life 1 & 2, Far Cry, Battlefield Vietnam/1942, and Unreal (and I'm sure you'll be able to think of TONS more) you should just save your money and just keep playing the first Red Faction.

I deleted the game half way thru... just got really boring without 'quick save' option. Having to replay loooong segments time after time killed the fun. Graphics seemed a couple steps back from the first Red Faction (what's with that?). I have been enjoying older games for the nostalgic experience... but I'll move on to RF Guerrilla and see if it's a bit more evolved. 'Seems 'quick save' is becoming a rare option in newer games. What's with that?! Cannot recommend this game... even at $12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not even close to the original Red Faction. It isn't a very long game and doesn't hold interest very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"The first Red Faction was truly fascinating. I loved the idea of blowing a hole in the floor then going around an obstacle. This was less so. It was far more cartoon-y and less plot-driven.

Nuff Said."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a disappointment.","review":"Found this game in a store today, was exicted, since it's hard to find this game in stores now. So I just grabbed it off the shelf and bought it, without reading the back or anything (which doesn't help), get home, install it, load it up, and notice theres NO multiplayer option, not even LAN, unlike the original Red Faction, it supported Mutliplayer/LAN which made the game, since the single player mode was pretty boring after beating it once. THQ, Violation, you need to come up with a patch/update for this game if you don't want your reputation smashed. This is horrible guys, come on. The engine is too slow, it's like a cheap Quake III: Arena engine in slow motion. Skip this game people, if you don't have Red Faction, get that. If you do have Red Faction, some other games you might like is RTCW (Return to Castle Wolfenstein), Quake III: Arena, or Far Cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folksy exposition of Anglo-Catholic religion","review":"Fr Rogers makes Anglo-Catholic thought accessible to the average person.

The flight scenes are breathtaking, and unusually for films dealing with world war II aviation, very effectively bring you into the cockpit, into the clouds and both behind the guns and in their lethal path... Anyone who loves WW II fighters, flying, spitfires or warbirds in general should watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Blue World","review":"If you don't mind subtitles you will enjoy this movie.

Each was a non-fictional first-hand personal story about \\"A World On Fire\\" - World War II.I was especially fascinated by the RAF pilots and their incredible Battle of Britain stories. They were extraordinary men, like Douglas Bader, Stanford Tuck, and Pierre Clostermann: the brave Frenchman who, like the heroes in \\"Dark Blue World,\\" fled his occupied homeland to fight for the RAF.This movie is an undiscovered treasure - resurrecting still again the emotions of authenticity those books once evoked.

Great characters, story, action scenes, and languages - English, Czech (almost like Polish), French, and German.The attention to detail was quite admirable. I loved watching the basic aircraft training - on bicycles! I can't think of a single cliche in this flick, and the characters were all original and complex. Overall, a very well-made film, and probably the most expensive-looking European film I've ever seen. Let's hope more like this come from the Czech Republic!-- JJ Timmins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Seeing","review":"Not all members of the \\"greatest generation\\" were Americans, and too often we tend to forget this fact.

Vol 2 does go into the building of wagon bodies and fith wheels which could be of use to modelers or restorers, but having said that, I think there are much better sources for primary data available for general wagon construction.This book is a reprint of information published over 100 years ago.As an historical reference to \\"how it was done back in the day\\", the book is interesting.

This book collects his essays, and in doing so shows his evolution from a historian writing/speaking about films in a somewhat negative light to one who realises the advantages and limitations of both media. This text showing one historian's changing opinion offers an excellect resource which helps us not only to understand the topic, but the histiography of it. Other books on this topic are often made up of single essays by historians who though maybe experts in their own field have not delt with the issue of the historical film as thoroughly as Prof. Rosenstone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitle !","review":"No subtitle (I have never seen a DVD or blu-ray wothout English subtitle !!) .Terrible for non-American.Sould be noted before sale !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it by","review":"I made it about 20 or 30 minutes before hitting 'eject'.Could've been OK but It was taking too long to get where it's going.As others have stated, this is a story that's been done better before.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to install","review":"None of the hardware was included, nor are there any holes in the round part at the bottom through with to drill screws.

The quality of that hose was so poor that I turned to amazon is search of something better. This hose caught my attention because it resembled the hose I was replacing, purchased years ago at Costco. Because the written description is so generic and the reviews referred mostly to tangling issues, I had to rely on the photo to make my decision. When it arrived I was very disappointed. It was not the hose pictured on the web. It is similar but different. The couplings are different. The nozzle is different as well. Comparing the photographs, I'd say it's a lower quality version.Please note the hose does not have any reinforcement at the female end.

Despite the fact that my math background goes through the second semester of calculus, I found all of equation derivasions to be confusing as well as useless. The (dis)organization of each chapter was into what was considered Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 material. This had the effect of making. any effort to go back and review a particular point nearly an impossibility--I always found I was trying to look something up in Level 2--when it was really in Level 3 (or Level 1!).

All of Chiang's stories are superb, and this one is set in an alternate Victorian age turned sideways by the use of Golems in their society. Since the name on a Golem's forehead describes its function, scientists in this age study names to analyze their meaning and power. If you like fantasy that is well thought out and sticks to its own rules, this is for you. Besides Chiang's alternative history tale, I liked Paul J. McAuley's \\"The Rift\\", about a hike down into uncharted pre-historic territory. I was a little bit alarmed about buying an anthology with 4 reprinted stories, but they are all good reads, especially Suzy McKee Charnas' \\"Listening To Brahms\\", about a group of astronauts who become the sole survivors of Earth and are saved from by extinction by copycat lizard aliens.

Perhaps one of the most valuable concepts that Dick Lee explains in his book is that CRM doesn't equal software. He also presents the reader with a step by step guide to implement a successful CRM initiative. In my opinion however, the most important concept that I got from this book was that CRM is about listening to the customer -genuinely - and transforming according to customer's needs and expectations.

I must admit that I did not finish this book. I realize that it was written a long time ago, but that is true of many outstanding novels and classic tales. This book misses the mark in so many ways. Very soon I realized that the writer was far more interested in proclaiming her own personal opinions on religion, good, evil and spiritual direction than she was interested in creating characters of depth or interesting plot development. I am certain that Fordyce's Sermons had better and more riveting writing. The characters in the book come across as steriotypical and one-diminsional, and I could not readily discern a plot or purpose beside the writer's intent to preach.

I've been trying to find out if there is another book on the way because this one just stops. I searched through the book several times trying to see what had happened to the rest of the pages, I was thinking that some of mine must have been torn out!

It is filled with action, adventure, love and all that other good stuff but for this book and the end of the last book I believe my title is appropriate. This book does not exactly deviate from the story line but it does make the characters seem totally different. I mean Hiro was like a stranger in this book. His personality totally changed and Heaven seemed weird too. The only semi-good part of this book is the very end when Heaven finds something out. Other than that though, this book left me wondering if Carrie Asai wrote it. Maybe her publishing company took away her creative freedom or something, I don't know. But this book was a total dissapointment and if she keeps writing like this, I know I won't be purchasing any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I agree with all the other sour reviews of this series ending book.

The story is full of supernatural characters and events. It develops during the bloody siege of Jerusalem, against the Moors and their famous leader, Soliman. The story is violent and erotic, especially the torrid love affair between Tancred, the bravest of the Christians, and Clorinda, a fierce but beautifl warrioress. Written in the XVI century, this book captures the spirit and ideology of the Middle Ages, specifically the XI century. Like in \\"Curial and Guelfa\\", Christian symbols mix with Greco-Roman ones, in a tale of war and sex. Tasso's images are powerful and the poem is anything but childish or naive. As I said, it is violent and full of action. It contains no boring digressions or reflections, but pure action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre translation and mediocre poetry","review":"Tasso's wonderful story of adventure and romance is rendered poorly by translator Esolen. While everyone realizes that prose translation is a difficult task, when the literature is written originally in meter, the task becomes daunting. Should the translator attempt to capture the meter of the poetry -- the song -- and give less attention to a strict rendering of the words? Or should the translator render the story as accurately as possible and be less concerned with the \\"song\\"?Esolen has chosen a middle road strategy that leads to both a mediocre rendering of the story and a mediocre use of English poetry to capture the song. Esolen's translation reads slowly and has a many, awkward, stilted, English rhymes. I would advise potential readers to seek another translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shucks!

I had used the guitar and mandolin books back in the 80s, so ordered this for the banjo. Two principal complaints: the first is that the tablature is hand-drawn, with notes \\"on top\\" of the assigned string, rather than \\"in\\" it. Example:__0__versus --0--No doubt an artifact of when it was published, before computers and .txt files.The other is that it contains a 33 rpm thin plastic record, rather than a CD.

For starters they're not very good -- at their absolute best (\\"Yellow\\") they were a passable impersonation of Catherine Wheel. At their worst they're essentially the new Doves album, 'Some Cities.'It kills me to say, but this album is an homage to Coldplay's style of crap/emo rock. There's far too much GOOD music out there these days to bother with the process of letting an album 'grow' on you, the common theme of all the reviewers who've posted so far. I've given this pig four listens and each time I want it to end.The only decent song is \\"Walk on Fire\\" because it has catchy guitar hooks, doesn't involved useless wailing, and makes you want to hear the next track. In other words it's more of a classic Doves tune. That's why it gets two stars and not one.I know 85 people will rip me for this writeup but if it saves one person from wasting their money then I've done my good deed for the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive.","review":"I wasnt much of a Doves fan till i heard the track \\"Your shadow lay across my life\\" from their album Lost Sides.

I don't bloody think so...","review":"Some Cities takes Doves in a slightly different and somewhat heavier direction than their last two albums. Yet their music retains all of the instrumentative genius that ensured Lost Souls and The Last Broadcast were instantly unforgettable. This CD may take a little longer to get in to in comparison, but in a way Some Cities was, at least for me, a more personal album that allowed me to connect more to where Doves are coming from as a band. And to all those people who are 'disappointed' with Some Cities in light of their previous efforts, maybe consider this - a 'slightly disappointing' Doves album is a million times better than any of the other crock out there. Be grateful for Doves and everything they produce, because it is of a quality so far and beyond any other band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"After two great albums this doesn't deliver.

It has examples of elements that made both of their previous albums (Lost Souls, Last Broadcast) unique and terriffic, while also showing signs of the things those albums shared.This album represents a bit of a holding pattern but not a muck through boring formula like we heard from other brittish bands this year (Coldplay, I'm looking in your direction).Some Cities is the sound of a very good band comfortable with its self, and is the perfect album for fans firmly with them.Initiates might do better to hear the earlier ones first.Read their respective descriptions to decide which one suits you best."},{"rating":"2","title":"53 Years Young","review":"I am a music fan period.

Yet again Doves pitch a perfect balance between atmospherically driven geology rhythms and catchable tap-toe, bob-head tune. Power ambience at its very best.

Doves have pushed the lush-richness factor to tapestritic proportions and blended them into a contemporary urban mindset. If you have the chance to catch them in concert, do it.

A young man in a cold, unnamed foreign city works feverishly at an unspecified technical job. As things fall apart for him at work he embarks on a doomed affair with a disturbed artist. It's all over in little more than a hundred pages; the impact lasts a lifetime.

Most of the movie was downright stupid with scenes with Abe Lincoln and a campaign stop in Georgia with a \\"Repube\\" and his wife going on for a long time and being massively unfunny. Also, the Axis werewolf leaders were incredibly lame, and things like the fetishs of FDR's secretary and his son were more messed up and disturbing than funny.

The subtitles are white and therefore at times difficult to read, but if you already know what's going on that doesn't hamper the experience. The French does go by at lightening speed which is a challenge. From a teaching perspective, the French is overwhelmingly fast, but again, if you've just finished reading the play, that shouldn't be too much of a problem. However, the film is old and looks it so students will need to be warned so they are more likely to see past the age and enjoy the play itself.

This movie, however, is a complete insult to viewers. The majority of the movie is annoying and the fighting is stressful and pointless. There is no elegant way to say it...this movie is plain stupid. Once the story line turns towards the baby, that's where it stays. There is no mystery, no horror, no psychological thrill, no connection with any of the characters. The ending is just as worthless and pointless and the rest of the movie.

Numbers's p. 4. comments from Science and Christianity in Pulpit and Pew (2007), I see that his comments there are outside the pale with regards to the majority of scholars on both Westfall and Hooykaas.

When you watch this you can't help but be reminded of \\"The Sting\\", The first two Godfather films and Once Upon a Time in America. I'd even put it above Leone's film in that it knows where to cut out the unnecessary; which can be a problem in some Hong Kong films. Andy Lau steals the screen once again, and if you haven't seen him in Infernal Affairs 1 & 3, get it now before Scorcese releases his remake. Leslie Cheung also had played the drama and action into his already complicated character with pure professionalism.The story is great, better than most of the crime films released in the US in the past 5 years, and the film is cut to leave you forced to rewatch the film to catch the subtleties that you missed the first time through."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceeded expectation","review":"I expected to find this film dull and my interest level unsustainable, but it was unexpectedly dark and unexpectedly interesting. The story follows Michael Sullivan (an unusually subdued Tom Hanks), an Irish mob hit man who also happens to be a devoted family man, working hard at maintaining a strict separation of work and home lives. When his older son witnesses one of his father's hits, the attempts to keep work and home lives separate are foiled as other hit men from the same crime family (that of John Rooney, played with an expert balance between patriarchal authority and power by an icy but somehow still, at times, warm, Paul Newman) murder Sullivan's wife and younger son. Sullivan goes on the run with his older son, both seeking revenge and seeking a surefire way to protect his son's life and prevent his son from traveling the same path he has. The film was well handled, subtly suspenseful and never dry, which helped it exceed my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not simple entertainment!","review":"Although the movie has all attributes of typical 'gangster' movies it seems like it has much more than this. It is quite dark with slowly developing plot but that doesn't seem somehow annoying. Tom Hanks brilliantly (as usual) portrays a killer that is forced to fight against people, to whom he was dedicated for many years, to defend his family. I don't normally like Paul Newman as an actor but in this movie he is totaly natural playing a kind of godfather, whose love for his son is stronger than any other considerations and who is torn because of this. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes, who directed \\"American Beauty', his first feature film. His second film is totally different but is in the same league (which is to say that it is as good as the first one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Americanized \\"Lone Wolf and the Cub\\"","review":"\\"A new Mafia movie\\"?

The cast and story really held a lot of promise, and reviews I had read up to that point were promising.While it was a text book 'good film,' I just couldn't buy Tom Hanks as an assassin. I certainly don't fault Hanks for this, but the way the character was written, I didn't see much opportunity to develop that aspect of a redemptive-cold blooded killer. If this premise doesn't work for the main character, suspending disbelief for the rest of the film is a little difficult as well.And the pacing. While it's not a lightening-charged piece of entertainment, the pace is slow and methodical. But sometimes it gets so slow that your mind is given ample opportunity to wander. A well-constructed film doesn't give you the chance to do that. I felt this could have easily lost 30 minutes and been better for it.I can't give this a hearty recommendation, but if you insist, it's not a bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks' Sensitive Gangster Can't Carry This Stinker","review":"I knew it was a bad sign when I kept glancing at the DVD timer while watching this.

He decides to take his son along, who we find out has a bad relationship with his father in the long run.The best thing about this movie is the acting. Tom Hanks plays his part well, and we come to like him as a solemn, not so much stoic, but humble man. His son is the farmer type, as seen in the movie. His son is also a bit, well he is naive. I can't describe him in one paragraph.The action is good. There are plenty of gun fights, some cars, and the occasional shoot em up action scene. But then theres the end.

This isn't lite fare and you may want to hesitate before bringing your 11 year old to see it. Still, great cinematography, direction and wonderful performances by Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law make this a film you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, But What Happened To The Cover?","review":"Sam Mendes is truly a genius, visually in particular because he's worked side by side in his only two films with the late Conrad L. Hall to attain Best Cinematography Oscars for each of them. Yet, rather than share mementos of that glorious camerawork on the cover (there is a smaller picture of Hank's character and his character's son at left, but it's not dominant), there's a still of Tom Hanks that does not do justice toward the skill of the Great Conrad. Why not show a still of the haunting opening shot, with Tyler Hoechlin in front of the water, or of Jude Law's introductory \\"Vertigo shot,\\" or of Hanks and Hoechlin walking in Chicago seen through a small depth of field? There are many other brilliant scenes optimized for stills that I haven't mentioned, and none of this rant goes against the film itself, but after all of Conrad L. Hall's amazing work, which earned the film's sole Oscar, why not showcase it on the film's display box?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of 2002.","review":"\\"Road to Perdition\\" is one film that I saw three times in the theater last year, and that's very rare. I was got up in the story, the mood it created, and the acting. The acting was perfect on almost all counts. The cinematography is beautiful and haunting. So is the music. This is director Sam Mendes' second movie, and it vastly improved upon his overrated film debut \\"American Beauty\\". That film was so smug and stupid. \\"Road to Perdition\\", however, is cinematic heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie put me in my place!","review":"I like to write fiction in my spare time and the writing in this movie is superb! To find out it was based on a graphic novel gave me a whole new appreciation for all of the comic book adaptions currently hitting the megaplex.This movie put me in my place. The scene where Paul Newman tells Tom Hanks \\"I'm glad it's you.\\" had me coming up with all sorts of responses and Tom Hanks showed the world what a brilliant actor he was by saying nothing and let it show in his eyes! What a performance! This is definitely one to own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful period piece","review":"The acting in this movie, both by Tom Hanks and the young man who played his son, were splendid. Paul Newman, who never seems to grow any older, just whiter, also played his part well. Being from the same time era that the movie took place in, I can tell you that the scenes, autos and clothing were all authentic appearing. (Didn't they always looked so overdressed compared to today?)The only negative: one could certainly believe that gangster assains were just good family men who went home most nights. It could be said to glamorize a person who in real life would probably have been a pschopathAll in all, n excellent movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Road to Perdition (Full Screen Edition)I really love this movie.

The story is great the acting is great and you really get into the movie and will not get up to go to the bathroom or anything like that you will stay sitting down staring at the screen until the movie is over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"The music of the movie is just too haunting,it's just too wonderful.The actors are as good as always.The story is just beautiful.It is set in Depression-era and Tom Hanks is a gangsterworking for Paul Newman.He's married with two children.One of his children is rather curious and his curiosity costs his entirefamily's life - because he has seen what he shouldn't have and he is the haunted one in case he reveals the secret to other people.I watched it so many times...and it never gets boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We're all murderers in this room\\"","review":"When Michael Sullivan's son and wife are murdered, Michael takes it too personal.Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a very credible gangster from the 1930s and is supported by the strong but not too lengthy appearances of Paul Newman and Daniel Craig (who went on to become the newest 007 James Bond).Although set in the 1930s the style is modern and the sequences paced to entertain.Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not overlook","review":"This is another film of great subtlety where I think Tom Hanks really plays one of his most daring roles as a father of two boys that also works for the mob during prohibition era.The movie is really about a son and father struggling to know one another and being forced together after the loss of the rest of the family.Jude Law also plays one of his darkest characters as a sick assassin for hire.The directing and lighting are absolutely flawless, and when I first saw the climax scene in the theater, I was amazed at how the silence and darkness were used to make such an atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Every performance is golden. Every bit of scenery adds to the weight and beauty of the film. Every moment invites a second viewing, and a third. Not a happy movie, but a lovely one. I was thrilled, and both my 19 year old son and 50 year old husband were mesmerized."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong role","review":"Mr.Hanks seems as if he can only play pathetic oversensitive characters anymore.The story was great but using Hanks for this gangster role was somewhat akin to having Henry Fonda or Alan Alda play 'Scarface'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of 2002's best...","review":"Ranking alongside \\"Signs,\\" \\"Gangs of New York,\\" and \\"The Two Towers,\\" \\"The Road to Perdition\\" is one of 2002's very best films, and one that wil be remembered and cherished for years to come. It is a heart-breking indictment of the criminal life, and a love story between father and son. Hanks is stellar, as usual; Law takes a memorable turn as the assassin sent to kill Hanks; and Newman brilliantly captures what he describes as a \\"lovable killer.\\" \\"The Road to Perdition\\" is easily one of the best 'mafia' films ever made - not because it portrays the lives of mobsters, but because it portrays the consequeces of their actions. Truly, this film speaks to the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambo in a trenchcoat","review":"Film is obviously a great seducer with the ability to create dramatic effect with all the great cinematic effects and music, not to mention the faces we've all come to love. This movie has plenty of all that. Some of the scenes are really gorgeous to look at. But the film ultimately rings hollow, offering no deeper insights into the violent nature of man as its' effects are continually smeared across the screen. Paul Newman's character, at one point, says, \\"These are the lives we choose\\" but rather than using this as a stepping stone into meditations on this potentially profound theme, it comes at the end, and in the next scene machines guns are being cocked. Trying to mimic reality a little more than a film treading similar ground, Rambo, here our protaganist dies. (Shucks, no part II.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok movie to fall asleep to","review":"I must be the only person who was bored out of my mind watching this movie.It is a great cast and the acting is great. The plot, about a mafia-father who has to take his son and run for their lives after his wife and other son are killed by one of his \\"partners\\", is a good plot.But, after the first 15 minutes I was so bored I was ready to turn the movie off and my husband was fast asleep.Everyone I've talked to says the same thing, but obviously none of them have written a review here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie!","review":"Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were great in this movie.....I usually like all Jude Laws movie's but not in this one. Because of what part he played. The whole story line to this movie was fantastic. Had you going through the whole movie. I love gangster movies and a must see movie and worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully filmed...","review":"...but very unsettling. I liked this movie-I liked it a lot. Yet I feel ambivalent towards it at the same time. Lots of seemingly unnecessary death, lots of blood, lots of violence. But then, I suppose that's the world of the gangster. Unfortunately, their families get drawn in to this hellish world and it usually never ends well. But for Michael Jr it kind of does. It was a pat, tidy ending, but that's OK...we needed a little happiness by that point! Again though...gorgeous sets-very evocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Hanks Does It Again","review":"Tom Hanks does it again in this ganster thriller. I found his character,as well as the others, along with the story line a captivating experience. I would like to go see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest Mob/Drama since the Godfather","review":"Drama is defined through this new age classic, Road to Perdition. Tom Hanks plays a mobster whose child witnesses a murder. When he discovers that his old mafia \\"friends\\" are out to get him and his son, he gives everything he has in order to protect his child. Tom Hanks delivers his best preformance since Forest Gump.This movie should only be purchased by those who can truly understand a deep movie plot. If you are looking for a light, no brainer... this is NOT for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went very wrong here.","review":"Fascinating scenario, wonderful screenplay, some marvelous performances and beautiful to look at. So, why didn't I love this movie? I'm not certain. There was a sense of something \\"false\\" throughout every frame which I remain unable to put my finger on. This bothers me.I hate to call something a turkey, but this movie - which seemingly has most of the elements of a great picture - fails to pull them together into a cohesive whole. Here, we must blame the director. There are, to be sure, some wonderfully riveting performances by an almost uniformly excellent cast, but these performances feel like they belong in another, more deserving, and ultimately better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of garbage","review":"Road to Perdition (Widescreen Edition)this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.

I believe it to be one of Tom Hanks's very best. The acting is outstanding and the story itself is superb. I have over eight hundred DVD's in my collection and this goes in my top ten favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I really enjoyed this movie because it wasn't your basic mob story--someone steals money from the mob, the mob boss tries to find out who it was or where he's at, blah, blah, blah. Instead, this movie is about a son's jealousy towards a man his father adores, the consequences of his jealousy, a young son's curiosity towards his father's work, the consequences of his curiosity, and the emotional decision two fathers must make in order to save their sons. This is not your basic blood and guts, shoot them up type of gangster movie--the kind of movie that your average male viewer might like; this movie requires emotional intelligence to appreciate it. Jude Law's performance was very good, as was Tom Hanks' performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Plot","review":"As fans of both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, my husband and I were both disappointed by this film. There is nothing wrong with the acting, or the cinematography, but the plot leaves something to be desired. Both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman acted their parts well. There is a lot of several hit men chasing each other around, and a lot of killing, but very little to the plot or story. If you really enjoy the 1930's Mobster Era, you will probably like this film. If, like me, you don't enjoy that era, try another Tom Hanks film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROAD TO PERDITION","review":"I just so Happen to love this movie and when I recieved this product I was excited to watch it. The only problem is that half way through the DVD skipped and I was unable to watch the remainder of this movie.

I couldn't disagree more. I found this film to be a disappointment. Tom Hanks & period-gangster style films just don't go together. When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.. not as a serious actor. In \\"Road To Perdition\\" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangster in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing. The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development. I'm a big fan of movies like the Godfather & Goodfellas but this one just plain stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road to Perdition - as viewed by LBlancke","review":"I know most of us are thinking its a pretty safe risk to spend [money]. ... on a flick starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. Road to Perdition is no exception. The story line reminded me of the movies of yesteryear. Just a strong story with strong actors. There were no flashy special effects, no hot sex or hard core language. Don't get me wrong the story revolves around a family of hit men, so the violence is everywhere but understated. Paul and Tom carry their understated personalities well. But for me the star was the young man who played Tom's son. Excellent acting! Excellent story! I'd like to see a sequel starting the young man (the son) as he makes decisions into manhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the point","review":"This movie is a good crime thriller, some great actors and a plot that keeps you well into the movie itself. A movie about a young boy led to the dark side of human behavior by his father. All in all, a good flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAD, CAN I BORROW THE MACHINE GUN?","review":"I am bewildered by the unanimous positive critical response to this movie. It's \\"The Godfather\\" meets \\"Father Knows Best\\" with a virtual bloodbath of gangster executions warmed over by a \\"Dad, can we have a man to man talk\\" mentality. The director screams \\"PERIOD PIECE!\\" with exquisitely manicured 1930s set designs that upstage the crummy little story of a boy being taken under the wing of his viscious but kindly gangster father. Jude Law playing a profiteering hitman/photographer is the only redemption here, his deranged characterization is the true spirit of this movie. I would have much preferred watching his life story for over two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats in this?","review":"The story - nothing great to mention. The movie - nothing special but for the photography and art - the only things to console a bit. I have a very high opinion on Tom Hanks and a serious fan. But his performance in this movie is greatly disappointing. The role requires a serious action and Tom Hanks almost struggles but for his own excellent performance in a couple of occassions. Of course, he is not the only to blame, the lose screenplay and direction are the main causes for the slack of the movie.If not for Tom Hanks, I thought the movie will pick-up sometime but never.And there are some questions unanswered in the movie. If Tom Hanks is so much trusted by his boss, why can't he just go and talk it out? Why should he run away like a coward?Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanks Shoots Blanks","review":"The whole thing fell apart in the second half. Totally implausible. The Rifleman trades his lever action 30 caliber for a Thompson sub-machinegun. Most overrated movie I can remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"tom hanks descends into hell -- not to mention bad movies","review":"the hype when this was released had this as one of the big movies of the year, but for once the public caught on and this silly thing has disappeared from consciousness. tom hanks continues the downward arc of his career, and paul newman is utterly unconvincing as the patriarch of a crime organization. what pretends to be a metaphor for the american family is little more than a 2 hour yawnfest; watch \\"the godfather\\" for the 27th time instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Money and Time","review":"My wife and I think Tom Hanks is a superb actor. My wife and I looked forward to seeing this movie, but found it dreadfully slow and boring. There were too many dark images and too dark emotionally. Give us some bright lights and vibrant colors. After 45 minutes we gave up and watched something else. Needless to say, we will not be watching the rest of this movie. This movie would definitely not be calssified as entertainment in our book. Only an idiot would consider this film to be a masterpiece. It is pure trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to Mediocrity","review":"This movie is nothing but a sad \\"Godfather\\" want to be. The story has more holes than can be imagined. Characters are sadly underdeveloped and make utterly no sense. Tom Hanks is the greatest over actor in the history of cinema and his constant yelling contends with that of the annoying Gene Hackman. Paul Newman gives an interesting performance but is way under used, as is Jude Law. Law's character is so underdeveloped that he is cartoonish at best. The villian in this movie being the son of a crime boss (Newman)is unjustified in everything he does. At no time does the audience care about these people the way they do in movies such as \\"the Godfather\\" or \\"Goodfellas.\\" The power in crime dramas has always come from that portrait of the duality of man but here all we are given are black and white charicatures. This movie is destined to be lost in the drift of the most forgettable movies in history. Don't waste your time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From Sam Mendes Films if You Want Class","review":"The only thing that gives this film some merit is its stellar cast who bring a mediocre script up to their level. The legendary Paul Newman comes off best but Tom Hanks, arguably the finest actor in movies today comes close. Jude law steals practically every scene he is in...a true talent. But the film is depressing and lacks character development. It is completely driven by the plot which makes one have absolutely no empathy for any of the characters or the situation they are in. It is typical Sam Mendes stuff, complete with blood, gore and no remorse for anything...just like the trashy \\"American Beauty\\" which should be retitled \\"American Ugly\\". Tom Hanks is worth watching in almost anything though and he makes the film worth one star for me. But I'm donating this one to the video store as I can't bear to watch unedifying trash like this fill up my screen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"duality of man","review":"Great story of a man torn between two worlds, something I think alot of people can identify with. Good gangster flick with a good underlying story. Great performance by Hanks. His character sucks you right into his pain. Newman, Tucci and Law turn in solid performances as they always do. I think this movie was overlooked by alot of people because it wasn't just a blood and guts shoot 'em up (although it does have a good amount of it) but had a story to it. Worth checking out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour de Force performance from Hanks","review":"Max Allan Collins, the former writer of the Dick Tracy Comic Strip wrote the graphic novel this story was based on. It this one Hank's character plays a hitman. His son follows him one day with tragic results. I don't want to give away too much. However it's a film that can be viewed more than once. It doesn't lose any of it's impact. I would like to read the graphic novel it's based on and the sequel. I have to wonder if the sequel matches the power of the first story.If you are a Hanks fan or any type of film buff, this is one you'll never forget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"I am surprised at the negativity to the film. Tom Hanks does a decent job at playing somebody cold and hard vs his usual nice guy routine. Paul Newman does a decent job at his role of the mob boss who \\"regretfully\\" makes a few decessions. Jude Law plays a great psycho!Sure there could have been things done better but when I go to a movie I just want to forget about things for a couple hours. I liked the characters for what they were.The ending was not what I expected but hey you should be surprised rather then the typical American Happy ending to most films...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was a dissapointment.","review":"This movie lacked character development. There was not a single character in the movie who I cared about. Yes, it was a heartless gangster movie, but at the same time the producer made no effort to develop empathy in any of the characters. Thus, when the sequences start showing different individuals being murdered, there was no pain, no sorrow. I was thinking, when is thos movie going to be over. My feeling is that this was an excellent story -- theoretically -- but when it came down to creating the movie, it looked differently in reality than it was when it was first thought up. That's unfortunate, of course, because there was a great deal of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Or, The Road to Pretension","review":"Genuinely awful. A glop of pretentious falderal.

I hated it, the predictible plot and characters, stupid motivations.My main beef with the film was the idea that a mob boss would allow anyone to get away with embezzling and cheating him, even his own son. We are frequently told throughout the movie that Hank's character is like a son to the mob boss and that the boss really doesn't get on with his real son. With films that are supposed to mirror reality, I could not suspend my disbelief and believe that this mob boss would protect a son who was a liability. Mob bosses don't get to that height without being ruthless and Newman's character was too fluffy.Plus it was boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I don't know where I got the idea that this was supposed to be a good movie...Lots of advertising hype? I love Tom Hanks, and I enjoy watching Jude Law's development, but this film is seriously bad. The plot is impeneterably confusing until it finally becomes clear that the Hanks character is trying to save his surviving son's life, and from then on it was a simple and predictable formula. The only thing remotely interesting here is the '30s mood, and even that was thin.

I really tried to let this movie capture me but just found this movie to be boring. (sorry)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Moody","review":"Whether or not Tom Hanks and Paul Newman fall into the great actors category for their roles in this film seems irrelevant when measuring the film's overall ability to entertain. Sadly, this 30s period piece involving murderous Irish gangsters flops miserably. The plot although reasonable is predictable from the moment the young son appears and begins his monologue against the backdrop of the roiling surf. Actually watching the trailer and drawing your own conclusions sufficiently will convey the film's complete content. Jude Law's lesser but equally grim appearance pushes the negative aspects of the plot to a dark precipice which no healthy mind wishes to go. This is no study of amorality like the much more entertaining and thought-provoking \\"Talented Mr. Ripley\\". This one makes you wish you hadn't bothered.Don't waste your time on a story and atmosphere that depresses rather than engages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks is no Al Pacino (in Gangster Roles)","review":"Although Road to Perdition is not a terrible movie, I feel that the entire movie suffers from a fatal flaw made before the first day of filming, and that's the casting of Tom Hanks as an organized crime hit man. Sorry, it just doesn't work. Hanks, although a brilliant actor, simply wasn't believable as a hit man. He's no menacing Al Pacino (The Godfather, Scarface), or even Gary Oldman (JFK, Sid and Nancy, Air Force One).Even if I could have gotten past Hanks as a hit man (I can't), there's the dark and brooding look to the film, which obscures a lot of the action. Another bad decision in the making of the film. Ultimately, it was kind of boring and a waste of time.This movie compares unfavorably to the much better crime genre movie \\"Miller's Crossing\\" by the Coen brothers. Now that's a good mob movie set in the 1930s, only done in a very artistic and entertaining way."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"This film had so much potential but it just didn't come across well enough to be believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I seen this movie once in I was touched Ive never got it out of my mind if you havent seen it yet then you should it worth it Tom Hanks GREAT ACTOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall Leaves On A High Note","review":"Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on.

The amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.None of the characters in here, frankly, are \\"good guys\\" as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman. Hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies!

For the hype it was getting (including comparisons to The Godfather!) I was expecting a fast moving, thought provoking gangster epic. Instead, I was subjected to the equivalent of a shot of nyquil. It put me to sleep and never tasted right. There were too many moments that should have been seen in this movie that were left to the imagination (anybody getting gunned down must dance with bullet impact, not be heard only!) Film is a visual medium for crying out loud! To the producers, director, actors, and hell even the authors of the graphic novel: it is not the audience's job to make your film interesting or even enjoyable. For the price of tickets is high, and there are other films to choose from.P.S. The Crow was a fluke, unless you're going to animate the feature. Leave the comics, err, graphic novels alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prep-School Imitation of John Woo","review":"This is a remake of The Lone Wolf and the Cub, and it borrows heavily from John Woo's Hong Kong gangster flicks - the male bonding, the shooting ups, the religious motifs... However, it is missing the intensity and passion, and Chow Yun-Fat. Tom Hanks just cannot fill Chow's shoes, and he appears uncomfortable trying to portray a \\"family-oriented\\" hitman.The original Japanese TV series, which has been remade into movies and other series several times in Asia, had much more heart and spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull gangster movie","review":"I went to see this having no idea what it was about... and found it dull, emotionally shallow, and highly predictable. It had none of the flair of The Untouchables or diligent detailing of The Godfather, the sets and locations were mediocre, and the lighting is pointlessly dark.It was in every way forgettable. I think too much has been made of Sam Mendes' direction of ths film (he's a fellow Brit, who commanded American Beauty magnificently, but not so here). The character development was wafer thin to the extent that you didn't really care who was killed. The plot was excruciatingly obvious.Hype is a dangerous thing when the goods are below 100%.

Also, Hanks just does not fit the profile of being a mafia gangster. He was much better in any of his other movies! Throughout the movie one can easily predict exacly what will happen. I heard one editorial say that this is the next great mafia movie since Goodfellas. No way is this in the slightest bit true! Goodfellas beat the hell out of this movie! However, if you don't specically care to see a great movie and you just want to kick back and see some great cinematic images then this movie might suite your desire.

In a time when movies appeal to the masses and have to give people a happy ending, Road to Perdition fits in well. The story is unbeleivable and ridiculous. The character played by Hanks is flat and a charicature of what he is meant to be. The only character who appealed to me was the killer trying to track down Hanks and his child.If you liked the godfather, goodfellas, or the Sopranos, you will most likely find this movie to be ridiculous, simplistic and supar coated. I am upset that I paid to see this movie and added to it's success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if your patient","review":"I first watched this movie expecting a stinker but I was pleasently supprised. You will love this movie unless you are expecting an action movie in the vein of Untouchables or Die Hard.Both of which I loved.This movie doesnt have large action scenes and if they do happen its usually between two people or someone is unexpectingly mowed down. In other words, if you want something thats action packed dont watch this movie. If you like a little more thought provoking material in your ganster flick than you will enjoy this movie. Excellent pacing is what makes this movie unique and brialliant. Also, kudos to the acting which is excellent.Movie Score-10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Road To Oscar ??

In reverse, I found him to be acting too much in this movie. There are many better choices this year for the Oscar Best Actor nomination. I love Tom Hanks, but forget about him this year.

My six year old has a very short attention span and needs to be in motion constantly, it seems. She loves music and games, so this curriculum seemed right for her. After doing the learning in this new way for just a few days, she was so excited to \\"play\\" more that she wanted to do it on the weekends also. She has learned all her letters now and the sounds they make. We have only been doing it for a couple weeks or so and she had been working on those things all last year and didn't master them.

This recording removes a little bit more high end than Yazoo typically removes, which puts the scratches a little more in the background, but they haven't overdone this and much of the presence of the 78's is thus maintained. I have fortunately just located a copy of the recently deleted _Ragtime Guitar's Foremost Fingerpicker_ (a gap in my collection) which is in my opinion the best compilation but if you can't find a copy of that disc, this one is a good bet.

Why the subtitle \\"Black Southern Cinema\\"? I'm not sure but perhaps it is due to the fact that these movies were made during the Great Northern Migration of Southern-born African-Americans who made up the majority of the audience for these films. The two bonus films, \\"The Blood of Jesus\\" and \\"Go Down, Death\\" make this DVD a bargain if you are interested at all in early Black Cinema. I just hope that some one will do some restoration on other films from this period and get them out on DVD. Film is such a perishable medium. Getting them into digital form is so important!!! Before they're gone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cryptic Portrait","review":"David Krell's avant-garde biography of the great philosopher is borderline incomprehensible as it is steeped in an impenetrable post-modern litany of obscurantist literary techniques. However, the novel is truly ambitious, as Krell attempts to tell the Nietzsche's story from the point of view of his late insanity. The result is extraordinarily unreadable and esoteric. Perhaps the one notable achievement of the work is that Krell has reproduced many of Nietzsche's original letters to friends and family and all of his medical documents recorded during his years in mental institutions. The reader is provided with a rich insight into the poor man's regression. Still, one is left with a broken storyline, undeveloped characters and scenarios, and prose that is entirely too derivative of Joyce's Ulysses."},{"rating":"1","title":"who can read this stuff?","review":"How anyone finished this book is beyond me. Stream-of-consciousness modernism became a literary cliche many decades ago, but it still survives to provide swanky intellectual cover for authors like Krell, who are unable to tell a compelling story. The flouting of sexual taboo is another tedious literary cliche, yet Krell attempts to use it as his meal ticket, with ridiculous effect: see his speculations about young Nietzsche sitting on his father's lap during a piano lesson and feeling an erection in Daddy's pants. Is this \\"novel\\" vile or simply ludicrous? Don't waste your time or money trying to decide which."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE!!!","review":"This has to be by far the best book I had ever read. I first came across a blurb from this book in a Seventeen magazine from Sept 2003 (I believe) and I had to buy the book. It's crazy that another human being feels/thinks/went thru the exact samething I did,and currently still struggling with. I carry a copy of this book with me in my bag. A line from the book is embedded in my head; \\"If you brought 30 ppl right now who knew me they would say I'm a wonderful person.

I think if you merged this with Marcus Hearn's gorgeous \\"Cinema of George Lucas\\" you'd have the perfect fan book; regardless, it's full of insider insight and historical context, something i've never seen. This book is also better than \\"The Second Coming of Steve Jobs\\" regarding the creation of Pixar. I wouldn't quantify this book as a typical fan book, it's more like a business story. It's very original, well paced, and full of tasty morsals about how films are really made. It's not what I expected, but i really loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a cultural history","review":"A very poor title, in my opinion. It is certainly as much about George Lucas as it is about a dozen others. It captures a time and a place in our digital revolution. The mechanical linkages of the past have been replaced by 1's and 0's and this books gives the reader a very accurate and clear representation of how painful that change can be. It is most definately a must read for anyone going into 3d as a profession. It will make clear the history behind some of the tools you abuse everyday.

Whether you are young and curious, interested in movies or the worlds of Lucas, Coppola, Pixar and more - or just a history of the refinement and evolution of \\"personal\\" computers, I believe you will enjoy and learn from this book as I did.

Sorry, but I just don't think this is quilting. Just sloppily putting together fabrics. It's easy to finish these projects in a day because there are not many pieces. The nine-patch blocks are thrown all over the place. It's like either making a cake with a box of Duncan Hines cake mix and canned frosting or making a cake from scratch with home-made frosting that takes time, care, and lots of love.

Instead of laying a fundamental basis for further economic study, this textbook presents a wishy-washy definition-oriented primer to econo-speak, nothing more. Simplification _is_ to be expected in an intro text, but simplification taken as fact is misleading, and ignoring some topics (utility, for example) while explaining others without any context (business cycles, for example) is just counterproductive!

Unfortunately, this movie does not do justice to Therese. At times, the movie is kind of creepy, paying undue attention to a lesbian nun in love with Therese. This nun is almost the co-star of the movie. It seems to me that the film maker is critical of Therese and the Carmelites. This is not a movie for children in particular, because it would only confuse them. Actually, it would probably confuse anyone. What a shame. The movie gets 1 star only because of good acting by the woman who plays Therese. The movie has other faults, but I'll not dwell on them because its really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do her justice","review":"I've read the books and know her life. This is nothing like her life. She was deeply in love with christ and didn't behave like this movie depicts. It isn't her at all. The more recent movie Theresa, which still hasn't been released in DVD is closer to her life. This movie is really horrible. Don't see it if you love Teresa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another hateful film against the a Catholic Saint","review":"Anyone who has read 'the Story of a Soul' knows that St. Therese was not a neurotic 'basketcase', as this film would have you beleive. This film is just another cheap shot at Catholic bigotry and I think 1 star is far too generous a rating for it.Read and reread the book but don't waste your money on a film like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naturalistic Reduction of Sanctity to Sadomasochism","review":"I first watched the Vatican-approved version with Lindsey Younce in the starring role, and while I enjoyed the film as part of my growing admiration for Therese, I felt the film was too emotionally drawn and lacking depth.This film, evidently directed by an atheist, went to the other extreme...too artsy fartsy. And what's more, the director's atheism portrayed the saint as well as all the other nuns in the Carmel as deranged neurotics with a latent S&M; streak.I'm reading the writings of Therese and those who knew her. That's where you will find her spirit...not in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many fantasies.","review":"The acting by Catherine Mouchet was very good; otherwise, this film contains too many inaccuracies, particularly too many fantasies about masochism and sadism that do not appear at all in any of the many books that I have read about St. Therese of Lisieux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed in this movie for the price I paid for the DVD. Perhaps my expectations of this movie were too high since I thought it would be displayed like the movies I saw as a child, \\"Song of Bernadette,\\" and \\"Our Lady of Fatima.\\" Unlike these two movies, \\"Therese,\\" was like seeing a stage show. While I was put on notice that there would be English subtitles, since the movie was in French, I could not read them fast enough before another new subtitle appeared, so I had to rewind the DVD and pause to read the prior subtitle. I concluded that probably the movie was made in French, and then it was decided later on to market it in English.Anyways, the content of the movie did not move me in any way. Again, as a child I was moved by the two films mentioned above, so I thought this one would too.Perhaps the problem is with me in that maybe if I had seen Therese as a child, I would have loved it. But, I guess these types of movies do nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to St. Therese","review":"I threw this movie in the trash after watching it and felt guilty for having given any time to it at all. It is a repulsive attack on the life of this holy woman. She is shown as mentally ill and secretly hating her Catholic faith. there is a scene where she drops a crucifix, steps on it and intentionally drags it along the floor under her foot...the directors attempt to somehow suggest her disrespect for Christ. There are many disturbing scenes which are based on the sick, anti-Catholic imagination of the director and not at all on any facts about St. Theresa's life. The only person who could enjoy such a film would have to have a similar hatred for Catholicism and be fond of these creepy, repulsive, so-called artsy movies. It taught me to do my research before buying a movie that I think might be edifying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Film about St. Therese","review":"I was not crazy about the American movie about St. Therese because I felt it portrayed the characters as too one-dimensional, and everything felt too airy fairy. However, after seeing this film, the American one now seems like a pure gem.This movie portrays St. Therese as a demented, neurotic, little creep. It portrays the monastic life as something that is dreary and rather depressing. It seems to me that the movie was based far more on the director's opinion of Catholic monasticism than on the actual life of St. Therese itself. For anybody interested in the actual life of St. Therese I recommend reading her autobiography, and avoiding this film at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual...Dark...Uninspirational","review":"The setting of this film was entirely on stage and thoroughly cinematic with a sense of darkness and lack of joy all throughout. It's not that the characters didn't express joy, it's just that I couldn't feel their joy from the way they expressed it. I found it to be at the utmost unusual, not in the least bit inspirational, and even scary to watch. I haven't read \\"Story of a Soul\\" (St. Therese's autobiography) but know about St. Therese's \\"little way\\". If I were to rely on this film alone, I would certainly have a misconstrued understanding.I've watched other films on saints, including \\"Bernadette\\", \\"The Passion of Bernadette\\", and \\"St. Teresa of the Andes\\", and found these films to be so much more inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling Bulimic?

I'm not even a religious person and this offended me.

It is full of sexual innuendo, usually when you least expect it. The actor also depicts a sick form of thought when talking about being a bride of Christ. This actor gives it an infatuation that is enough to make anyone gag. Rather than showing a true charity emotion for Jesus Christ, the movie gives it a 'my boyfriend is cooler than yours' type of teenage approach that was simply sickening. The movie even goes further by humiliating people of the faith by 'bragging' about her prayer and how much good it did. This movie is a definite waste of time.

If you are a Talisman fan you will appreciate the vocals by Jeff Scott Soto. They are a little different than what you are accustomed to with the previous CD's, but nontheless still explosive. The guitarist is different so the guitar sound is a little different. I found it lost some of it's groove. The previous guitarist was very busy and he had lot's of feel to his sound. The guitar work is still very good. The songs are just as aggressive as you are used to with very catchy choruses. It's definately one of their better CD's, but my favorite is still Humanimal part 2.

Martens is one of the most engaging characters one is likely to encounter. He is vain, but keeps it mostly to himself, and Machiavellian, although he rarely admits it.

It's simply awful.It almost sounds like she's forcing herself along. She seems to have no sense of the meaning behind the classic lyrics she's singing; her interpretations are uniformly flat and uninteresting, and performed without any ease. \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\" and \\"In the Still of the Night\\" are especially, un-listenably, bad. The arrangement and vocal for \\"My One and Only Love\\" --woo, particularly awful, especially when this version is compared with the glorious, sensual Paula Jones/Chris Botti version of a few years back.

Initially, I thought this was a good idea as I liked the \\"70s\\" Carly Simon and hadn't heard anything from her in a couple of decades. Unfortunately, she does not have the breath or range to sing these songs properly which are more demanding than her original work.

I can't imagine what all of her detractors are talking about, saying she's off-key and losing her voice. Yes, she slides into a note now and then, but Ol' Blue Eyes did that a lot, too. It didn't mean he couldn't sing.I'm a massage therapist and this CD hasn't left the player for days; my patients love it as much as I do. Maybe it's because I'm \\"old\\" and I grew up with these songs (courtesy of my parents), in their original big band incarnations, that this CD struck such a deep chord with me. Lush arrangements, that smooth and husky voice--this isn't lounge lizard music. This is one great singer, missing The Chairman of the Board across the piano from her. It seems to me she must have listened and learned from the stylistic masters who sang these songs originally; she holds her own, admirably, with the best of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight Sereade","review":"It is good to see Carly back in the shelves again with something outside her norm.

Her album, My Romance, is my all-time favorite album, but Mooonlight Seranade is an awful album. Richard Perry, the producer, ought to be ashamed. The music behind Carly sounds like Mitch Miller with synthesizer. The beat is so mechanical that I suspect a drum machine was used. Clearly the tracks were pre-recorded so that when Carly went into the studio to add in the vocal, she was totally hemmed in by what had been done. Even Carly's superb voice couldn't save this album.Budget is no excuse for this travesty. The same material recorded with a trio: piano (or guitar), bass and drums would have been memorable but with a mechanized Mitch Miller feel...Lord... what was Perry thinking?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring and (gulp) off key!","review":"This album is one of the most boring albums of standards I've ever listed to. The arrangements are pathetic - nothing more than having some of the musicians play each song's melody for \\"solos.\\" My goodness, we know the melody, improvise when Carly's not singing! And singing - well, how dull can she be? There is absolutely no sense of personality, soul, feeling in any of these songs. Did she just come in and sing this stuff without any musical interpretation? Or practice? Heavens, on some of the songs, I swear she's as flat as she can be. Get to the note Carly! Yikes this is bad stuff.If you want great singing, wonderful standards and great arrangements buy something from Diana Krall or Natalie Cole. But by all means, avoid this stinker.Paul Forrest"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Time","review":"Coming from a long time fan of Carly, this album gave me the creeps big time. Carly's voice, in my opinion, is totally fried, it is so very painful to listen to. Someone please put her out of her misery.

This collection is a treat because it is upbeat, flirtatious and joyful. I can honestly say that I have not been able to stop playing track #5 \\"Alone Together\\" since buying this. It is truly a perfect recording. It reflects the sexy bossa nova charm of the '60's that could easily support a whole collection of similar tunes. This song alone is worth the disc's price alone!

She didn't seem to be really trying, but coasting or something ... it just wasn't there. \\"Disappointing\\" is what it was for me, big time.Add in the arrangements, which seemed even less inspired, like it was played twice from the songbook's sheet music, then recorded.

No exaggeration, for the magic between producer Richard Perry and Carly brings back the warmth of 70s era. The accompaniment is masterful with John Ferraro on the drums and Vin D' Onofrio on the guitar. Carly works enough charm on the Porter's classics In the Still of the Night and I've got you under my skin, sings with sultry sexiness in Dietz's Alone Together and sass it up in Gershwin's classic How Long Has This Been Going on. All these 11 gems are consistently produced with an affecting dreaminess that serves as the perfect foil for Carly's sensuous vocals.

The choice of songs is great, as are the arrangements. But Carly Simon's voice seems so tired and shakey. She has never had a great range, but the smoothness of her delivery just was not there for me on most of the songs. I have been waiting for this disk to come out and so it was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Carly Simon Fan","review":"I'm sorry to say so, but I totally agree with others who have been disappointed in this CD!I remember hearing Carly's first album back in the 70's and being so thrilled by what an original talent she was ...and still is I'm sure ...even though you'd never know it to hear this recording!

The arrangements are blah and Carly sings them as if she's sleep walking or zonked on Valium. Her interpretations of these great songs are soulless, styleless and simply boring. The voice seems to have no high register anymore, but even using her lower register, Carly could have put a little feeling into her renditions. She did it on Torch and My Romance, so what in the world happened here? What was Richard Perry, the \\"great\\" producer, thinking. Or maybe she just can't sing anymore. If so, please retire, Carly, and live sumtuously on your royalties, which last I heard amounted to around half a million a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was very much looking forward to this CD and have to regretfully say how disappointing it is. There just doesn't seem to be any spark or emotion in her delivery of these wonderful classic songs. She sings each tune in what sounds like the same key, almost like someone speaking in a monotone voice. I didn't get the feeling that she was connecting with the music. When I played it for my husabnd and daughter, they agreed that it was not pleasant to listen to. If you like the old standards, I suggest the new CD by John Stevens (remember him from American Idol?) entitled \\"Red\\". This young kid can really croon and swing and has the perfect voice for this kind of music. The CD is co-produced by David Foster and the musical arrangements are excellent.

We were using wireless internet which may have contributed to the computer's slowness, but still it was pathetic. There were maybe 10 people using these computers and about 2/3 of us abandoned the Ibooks to go use the Imacs that our school got in 1998. It also could have been that (even with nortan anit-virus) these computers are very vulnerable to viruses.

A few of the scenes had difficult controls, like the log jumping, but the games were just hard enough to be challenging for them, but not so hard that they couldn't eventually get them, after I'd helped them a couple of times. They improved their mouse control with the map-through-the-shelf puzzle and the crystal-through-the-caves puzzle. The matching games were also at a good level for them. And the mazes were again challenging but not frustrating. They played this for many hours - there are many games in each area, rather than just the 5 of some of the other Barbie games.

I bought it and Classroom in a book at the same time, and this one is much better! It carefully explains all features in a slow, work-at-your-own-pace rate, and covers much more than the adobe book! It gives you the opportunity to try the projects, and also take the skills further for your own interests.

Not to mention that there are at least 3-4 refferees who will stop the game at any sign of trouble. When they say that paintball isn't safe, they are talking about when you are being irresponsible and run up to someone at your house, without a mask on, without your marker properly calibrated, and shoot them in the eye!

Stop the Dating merry-go-round and get on your knees before God and ask Him to reveal His choice of your marriage partner!

He focuses on Courtship being the only biblical answer for romantic relationships, and although somewhat legalistic in his out-working of that premise, still very helpfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never recommend this book...","review":"This book is waaaaaay too legalistic. If your looking for a good book to see how God views dating, get Boundaries in Dating.

Like other dating books it covers common sense advice like \\"avoid dating a non Christian, be mature in your relationship with Christ before entering a romantic relationship.\\" etc.The author presents charts throughout the book on how a romantic relationship should follow. No offense but there is no such thing as a formulaic way to go about relationships, and its ridiculous to actually think that dating is a sin or \\"disease.\\"Yes, I agree there are a lot of problems in dating but its not like \\"courting\\" is more holy or more safe. There will be problems with romantic relationships no matter what they want to call it. So while I agree there is a lot of smart advice in this book, I wouldn't recommend it.Life doesn't follow formulas and charts.

I am a Christian man with a strong faith in God and am always trying to better myself for Him, but this book just seemed to be a typical self help book, but with the fire and brimstone of the Old Testament thrown in to scare you into behaving a certain way.

This book is one of the extreme few that I found no value in. If you are looking for meditative visualizations, then you might actually enjoy this book. Visualizations are the only thing this book contains. Whether or not they will be helpful to you is another question. I personally found them to be of no use as I can create my own visualization scripts -- and personal creation is almost always more effective than depending on someone else's ideas.I was looking for techniques on astral projection to add to my current practices. Unfortunately, this book is devoid of any such techniques. I ended up spending money on something that offered no help, and wasn't even entertaining as fiction.

I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life.

It is refreshing to find a book that speaks so directly to young people. It addresses issues that all youth struggle with. It also conveys to the adult reader the importance of youth to society as a whole. While reading this book, I was reminded of the power and passion for life that youth possess. As adults, we sometimes tend to underscore the contributions that youth have made throughout history. Young people have ruled nations, fought wars, struggled against injustice, and created lasting works of artistic beauty.

I was a cKy fan for quite a while, but after some time all the songs get old and you start to forget about what it is exactly that you did like about them in the first place. Volume 1 was definitely a good purchase, but after all the hype from the cKy gang about IDR, listening to it, and realizing that it was nothing all that really different, I fell away and realized they were not all that different from other such bands. So, I bought it. I listened to it. It's quite ordinary. Now I'm depressed for having spent 13 dollars. I could have purchased a 12 pack of beer. So, to anyone who cares, it is nothing different from anything else. This whole \\"it's a revolution\\" stuff, is really just from 13 year old kids who love Bam and will listen to anything that anyone will tell them. Buy something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different GTR Sound","review":"Wow..The GTR sound on this disc is very cool. Its synth, but edgy.

I was very skeptical, but after one listen to an Answer can be found, i realized he underestimated. This is probably one of the greatest album's ever recorded. The only cd's i think are up in that catagory are Tool - Aenima, Mr. Bungle - California, and Smashing Pumpkins - Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. and to comment on a previous reviewers remarks:\\"CKY say that they are a versatile band, and will play many different styles. Maybe they can prove this by doing an album that has the same hard hitting lyrics and guitars that Vol.1 did.\\"--he totally contradicted himself. How does cky playing the same style of volume 1 show that they play different styles? idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest album ever","review":"I think CKY have there own style of music. they used to have more of a techno sound and now they just have an in your face f*** everyone attitude.

And to anyone who boasts about how great their self production is; all the production in the world couldnt save Deron's mediocre vocals that get old after the 2nd track.The guitar riffs are slowed down metal, the drums are okay at best, and the vocals suck. Now they claim they are forcing change and anyone who knows my opinion knows I think theyre just enforcing a horrible trend.This is mediocre music by a mediocre band with a gimmick of revolutionizing the music industry. The only CKY cd you need to hear is Volume 1, IDR they sold out, and with this release they go straight down the toilet bowl.Please dont waste your money, there are many other worthy cds here that amazon offers at a cheap used price.

After calling samsung and getting the run around, they said that my tv was not one they would fix for free.Sad that a billion dollar company would not take care of their customers do to their mistake. They transfered me to there repair department only to find that they do not repair dlp tv's anymore!! Yes you read right, THEY DONT REPAIR TV'S THAT THEY SOLD ME A COUPLE OF YEARS earlier!I called a local tv repair service to see what could be done.

All was well until February 9th. I turned it on to find the picture a reddish color. Turns out I need a new LED driver to which the service tech did not have when making my service call.

On the HLT6187, it is viewable (Which is nice, as I still have about 30 hours of shows on my TiVo to get through).I purchased directly from Amazon.com. The delivery was awsome!

And on top of all that this TV is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Dots","review":"I purchased TV back in July 2007. Now white spots are appearing all over the screen. I found that this is due to a widespread problem with the DLP chips. The repairs are about $600 from an authorized Samsung repair shop. However you can do it yourself for about $180. The chips themselves are about $170 plus a few bucks more for some thermal paste.Anyways I am pretty disappointed by this TV and in Samsung. A 5 year life for a $2400 TV just doesn't seem right. Sadly I recommended this TV and other Samsung products to others - Hopefully my friends won't experience similar problems.Just as an FYI the white spot problem is prevalent across several models. Some models are covered for out-of-warranty repairs by Samsung. So its worth calling in if you are experiencing this problem with a different model. In addition, if you have this model call in anyways - I am thinking if there are enough reports Samsung may include this model in their list of TVs that are covered for the white spot issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little white dots on my screen","review":"My 61inch Samsung DLP is now almost two years old and I notice tiny white dots appearing on the screen. So far they total 24 but I'm concerned that if it continues what can I do about it. Is this an indication of the tiny mirrors degrading? It really does not interfer with the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this TV","review":"I looked long and hard before deciding to buy this TV. If money were no object I would have probably bought a comparably sized LCD tv but that would have cost at least twice [maybe 3 times] the price of this set. The only benefits to an LCD are the flatness for wall mounting and viewing angle. Neither of these issues affect me so I am really happy with the tv. The picture is great. It displays my computer via hdmi really well. And the built in sound is very good as tv's go. It has all the needed inputs and outputs to do just about anything you might want to. I also really like the fact that I dont have to deal with bulb replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for the buck out there!","review":"I own an LCD, a plasma, and this Samsung DLP. I prefer the picture of the Samsung by far. It's not overly bright like the LCD, and has much better clarity than the plasma. Even at a whopping 61\\", the picture is perfect- no screen door effect, rainbow effect, or any of the other typical DLP issues I read about for months before my purchase. Even sitting at a fairly wide viewing angle I get a great picture with no noticeable falloff. To me, the picture is the closest thing to a movie experience, which I love. The blacks are deep and the colors are well-saturated. I paid over $400 more just a year ago, it's a heck of a bargain now. I was torn between this one and a comparable Sony (can't remember which model exactly, but price was nearly identical) and I'm glad I chose the Samsung. So far, one year after my purchase, I've had no problems whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for the money","review":"What a great TV the Samsung 61 is. Terrific colors and very sharp details . It was a real pleasure watching the Masters on the HD channel with the rich greens and other colors coming through. Incredible. I put it next to a 42 plasma and everyone agreed they thought the picture was better. You can't beat the price for quality either. This cost $1000 to $2000 less for comparable LCD or Plasma of the same size. This model even can play the new 3D movies! Very god purchase. Amazon was great too with price and delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy and satisfied!","review":"I got one of the refurbs from \\"warehouse deals\\".

Samsung tech support was terrible and denied this was a big problem with these sets. I decided to get the Sony KDS-60A3000. The set looks better and the only problem is a slight geometry issue which was also on the Samsung and is inherent to RPTV's. Get the Sony while you can and avoid this Samsung as it has many problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I have seen, but...","review":"I love this TV. OK, now that that's out of the way, there are a couple of problems. First, if you are not watching a true HD source, then the TV is just too big. It is far to grainy to be an enjoyable experience. The Food Network looks really good as I pull up in the driveway through the window, but once inside I got to change channels. It is almost to the point that if the channel isn't at least digital, I won't watch it. Second, when I programmed the cable's remote, I have to press the volume keys multible times to change the volume. The Samsung remote works fine. So why do I love it, sit in front of it and watch the game on ESPN-HD and you will never wanna go back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real nice picture -FOR A FEW YEARS","review":"Got the deadly 'white spot' problem after less than 4 years of use.

I made my decision based on the reviews, Buy this TV, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Simply a stunning TV. Caught it at $1700 about a week ago. After some fine tuning with the picture, I couldn't be more impressed. The delivery guy stared at it in awe after turning it on. It's beautiful and plays Xbox 360 games flawlessly. The DNLe technology tones down the grittiness of standard broadcasts, making them less of an eyesore, and the contrast and color range are amazing. My only gripe is that the viewing angle is slightly limited, but this is only if you're sitting close to the set. Sitting farther than eight feet should present no problems. Without a doubt, this is the best TV you can buy at this price.(Another thing to note is that these sets don't look very good in regular stores. The pictures have't been tuned so they have a gray, washed-out look to them. They look so much better after tuning.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! White dots and awful costumer service!","review":"White dots spreading out on screen after three years of moderate use. Called Samsung Customer Care and got told repair at your own expense despite of the DMD Chip failures in all of their DLP TV products:[...]It's shameful that such a big profitable company didn't stand behind their products, especially the apparent defective ones. I guess they only will recall and fix their defective TVs if we the consumers are brave enough to take them to court to keep them honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great screen for longer distance viewing","review":"This big screen LED is great if you have a big room and are viewing from a distance of 20' or more. The big advantage to this big screen is the LED will last the life of the set. (no expensive bulb replacement in a year or so. If your viewing space is less than 20' I would suggest that you purchase the 46\\" Samsung LCD for around the same price with a much better picture quality.I have both HDTVs and love them both. The 61\\" I watch from my bed at about 30' on the other side of the room. Guide text is large and easy to read and has a great picture form that distance. The 46\\" I watch in my den from 12' and the picture is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic picture but returning due to audible \\"click\\"","review":"I have had this TV for about two weeks now and the picture is absolutely fantastic.

Meanwhile the tv will not respond to the remote except for in a 1 second window(then the channel can be changed). I have another problem with another Samsung tv in the past. They like other manufactures are using bad parts and not talking responsibility for their Tvs. Samsung are not the only ones who have this problem. The reason my parents picked the tv because of their picture, which looks great, when it works.Samsung has a recall but not for this type of problem described above.Now I dont know which manufacture to trust.

The TV is best for viewing straight on at eye level. We bought this TV and put in on a mantel that is at eye level standing up. The picture is amazing when we are standing up or if we watch it from our kitchen, which is 12 feet away. But from our Sofas which are at an angle ( 45 from the center), the screen dims significantly. Also if we sit down on chairs in front of the TV, the screen dims. We are going to return this TV and get an LCD TV which is smaller than this but is better from all viewing angles.Update: We bought this TV from Best Buy and returned it to get Samsung 52 LCD HDTV from Amazon. The Samsung 52\\" LNT5271F LCD tv from Amazon. The LCD TV now has vertical bar or dead pixels and I am trying to get Amazon to exchange the LCD.

The TV is also well designed as far as connectivity. It fires up quickly and runs very quietly. The sleek design and minimalist border around the picture are elegant. The right-sided connections are well thought out and convenient to access. I would strongly recommend this HDTV as it is an excellent buy for the money.

They placed the TV on the stand for me and carried away all of the packaging after I finished inspecting the TV for damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my perfect TV!","review":"I cannot say enough about this TV. Picture is incredibly bright, crisp, with no noticeable geometry flaws my previous Hitachi 51\\" CRT had. The set is dead quiet and looks sleek on the Samsung TR-500X3B stand. PS3 Heavenly Sword, Ninja, and Warhawk all look mind-blowing on this unit. HD content via Comcast looks 3-D at times.Plus, at 1899.98 and free shipping this set is a steal!About the shipping... 1 elderly man arrived in a van, used a 2x4 as a ramp to drag the set out. I was cringing so I helped him carry it in. After we dragged the dirty box on my carpet we unboxed it, and dropped it on the stand. I had to convince him to stay while I hooked it up. Not so white glovey, but it was free shipping.The only bad thing is the no-bass tinny speakers so you will have to use your receiver for proper sound. Still, no regrets here.

I am please to say the TV exceeded my expectations. I bought the TV through Amazon and was also pleased with them. The price of the TV beat anything out there and the delivery was fine.

This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4\\" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head. Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.

It is unfortunate to find another Christian minister whose political agenda is so intertwined with his faith that he cannot distinguish between them -- whether a Wm Sloane Coffin or a Pat Robertson.One must be extraordinarily cynical to preach to a \\"young doubter\\", as Coffin does, that a particular political ideology is a prerequisite to following Jesus Christ.

We read it as part of our AP Environmental Science class. Three developers encounter Dave Brower, a conservationist with the Sierra Club. The reading was easy, but at times it was hard to follow because McPhee often jumps around and talks about the scientists' families. It was often repetitive because the developers and the conservationist argue about the same issues all the time. One of the strongest points of the novel is the description of the wilderness. It is very detailed and really gives the reader a sense of actually being there. Overall, the book is unbiased. It offers people the opportunity to explore both sides of environmental issues. It's a good book to read if you're really in the mood to read it, but it's not something most people would pick up and read. -GHHS AP Environmental Students"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many dam dams","review":"It made me want to hike the Sierra Nevada mountains. The cover of the book enticed me to read this book. The book was very informational about David Brower's life. It was good how the book was divided into three parts to makea it more interesting. John McPhee did a good job of describing how the mountains looked. It helped show how nature is affected by humans and how we shouldn't interfere with it. It was very interesting to see the differemt views of a conservationist verses a copper miner or a developer. Overall, this story has enlightened all of its readers to the effects of human growth and industrialization in the wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encounters with a bad book","review":"This book is not very interesting. It is very jumpy and hard to understand. There are many enviormental issues that are barely if at all touched on by the author.

Overall it is not that good of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encounters with the alcoholic","review":"Encounters with the Archdruid is an out-drawn, boring biography about David Brower. The three sections are repetitive and have no important facts about conservationists. The entire book is full of pointless arguements that usually end with Brower getting drunk. The reader can not even fully understand the opinions of Brower or the other characters because it is all being told by an unidentified narrator. This book is a waste of time and doesn't tell any stories of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conservation politics via dialogue","review":"My first encounter with John McPhee, and a memorable one. I will definitely be reading more of him. He has a great, objective, journalistic style, where most of the storytelling is done through summary and dialogue. This book serves as a good introduction into David Brower and his conservation tactics, his reason and stubborness, as he competes verbally with men of a different mind than his: a mineralogist, a developer, a dam erector. The interplay between passion and character is fascinating, as all the men are reasonable and driven and opinionated, but also able to interact with each other respectfully.I am currently also reading Cadillac Desert, and wanted to read this first as the third section (with Floyd Dominy) was great preparation. The politics of conservation and reclamation fascinate me.A recommended read, especially for conservationists or those opposing them. Even given that it was written in the early 70s, it is still timely and applicable."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"Wow! What a classy lady.

There is power, intricacy, tremendous writing and impeccable performances by everyone involved. The elegance and class of jazz spiced with a Spanish flavor evoking a Santana-like feel goes even further with the vision of Al and his band members. Jan Hammer (from The Mahavishnu Orchestra and Miami Vice) is the man on keyboards, and he is as exceptional as you would expect. The third song \\"Mediterranean Sundance\\" is a Spanish classical guitar duet with virtuoso Paco DeLucia which is a highlight of a beautiful fusion album. DiMeola's power and prowess is at it's best throughout this work. Not a moment is wasted. This album is a masterpiece, and Al's best album without a doubt!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neither flamingo music nor flamenco","review":"The correct term would be fusion. I read an interview with Al Dimeola where he lamented that this period of his career was devoted to attempting to be the fastest guitarist in the world (at the expense of deeper emotional development.) If the energy derived from youthful competitiveness is what you're after, this album is for you. This is a poor copy of flamenco if flamenco is what you're after, but for Paco de Lucia fans, his inclusion provides another interesting version of his \\"entre dos aguas\\" in \\"mediterranean sundance\\", and his presence and soul carry the theme of the album as evidenced even by the artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one","review":"I wish I heard of this guy way before I did because I really like the stuff he puts out !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it if you love energetic music","review":"This is one of the disc that i've heard most recently by Al. He didn't fail to amaze me with his speed and passion on this CD, but, of course, his music didn't have the depth and beauty that it does now, but that's alright, it was only his second CD. and he was in his early 20's, and he had plenty of time to blossom (and he did!) However, if you prefer the intense jazz/fusion of the 70's, you can't go wrong with this. This CD actually sounds more like Santana than any of his others, I guess it's cause of the percussion section. I do love the music, I love the first track, with the ultra-fast guitar solo in the middle where he jams with Jam Hammer, and with the panned flanging stuff, it's really cool. This is probably his best jazz/fusion CD. It's probably his most consistant CD of the 70's, so if your'e looking for straight up Al, you can't go wrong with this.

The Shark is also great for the car, for picking up a pile of swept crumbs (I don't like using the dust pan) and a lot of other quick clean ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We received this vac as a housewarming gift, and I thought that it was great the first 3 times I used it. Then the attachments would not stay on during use, it lost suction, and it died the 4th time I used it. This product was seriously disappointing. My dyson vaccume has such great attachments that I will never use a handheld like this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"Expecting to be able to get up the tracked-around-the-box kitty litter, I bought this. Shouldn't have. For one thing, the attachment hose comes loose frequently during use. Second, the brush attachment doesn't get the litter up, it just scatters it about. Third, there is no brushless wide-mouth attachment for litter (or other debris and dust), there is just the brush and the crevice attachment. Neither works well. It's noisy, smells odd and frankly, isn't worth it's small price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vac for the Price","review":"Lets be realistic! For this price you are not going to get a super vacume but it does great for getting into small corners and crevices. Has great suction power and is great for stairs and small messes. With a two year old and a husband I know about messes. Great little vac!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for spot cleaning...","review":"I, as well, got this thing for a buck. If I had paid full price, I would've been pissed, but it does come in handy once in a while. It's good for sucking up dust bunnies and little pieces of kitty litter that are always a problem at my place, but I would never use it for anything bigger than a door mat. Don't get it if what you really need is a full sized vacuum cleaner, and certainly don't buy it for full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your car","review":"I bought this unit for car vacuuming. Receive it today and find it is corded, not a portable vacum.What do you expect for $8, right? At least Amazon could have stated in its specification about the cord, so I don't have to waste both time and money because of their insufficient info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infomaterial Material","review":"I guess we all should learn to avoid whatever is sold on TV! I bought this as a 2nd vacuum, to get the dust from corners & other such small jobs. Unfortunately, while it is light & easy to carry, that's the only good thing about it. It has no power whatsoever, and even if you beg and plead, it wont pick up pet hair from carpet. Don't get this vacuum, unless all you're looking to clean is big easy things like cheerio's from the kitchen floor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fabulous little sucker...","review":"I've been using the shark for at least nine months and it works like a dream. Having read the other reviews... anyone who tries to clean a house with a hand vac is nuts and anyone who tries to use the thing to suck up lots of anything (dirt, food, ants) will have to clean out the filter eventually so deal with it... granted the small plastic attachments are small and plastic, but that should really be exptected for the price and if you use them appropriately they'll last longer and make the task easier... the only real downside here is that it has a cord, which isn't really that big a deal and means that the vac is consistently powerful and you don't have to worry about a battery needing to be recharged.... I used to have a small dustbuster that was several times more expensive and couldn't compare to this... give it a whirl and experiment with the attachments, treat it nicely and it will reciprocate..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave this one away","review":"I bought this for quick touch ups and when I didn't need to get out the big upright. Lousy suction!! It only is good right at the opening. You have to get right on top of the dirt and hair for it to be sucked up. It was supposed to have great suction and make quick work of messes. It would have been and now is easier to get out my regular vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong lil vacuum","review":"Good strong suction. BUT...you must clean the filter out a lot. It is tiny and clogs up fast. It is great for small jobs. I love it. I have toddlers, and don't want to constantly get out the big vacuum, so this is very convenient. Remember to clean out that fitler though, because you lose suction quick otherwise. If you need more cleaning the bigger 800 watt deluxe would be better.It is much better than my old dust buster!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"We bought one of the shark mini vacs from Sears. We bought it when we first got back from our honeymoon and found that our apartment (in a brand new complex) had been invaded by ants. We wanted a light-weight handheld vacuum that could suck up the dead ant bodies. So, we purchased the shark.It was the biggest waste of money. It sucked up the little ant bodies... but by the third or fourth time we used it, it didn't work at all! We plugged it in, flipped the switch, and nothing! It was completely dead. Please don't waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek Appearance and Powerful Name are Deceptive!!!!","review":"This was one of the biggest purchase disappointments I've ever made. The life span of this product in my home was only about 60 days so I returned it and got a new one hoping it would last longer. (I figured that it was an unique situation.) I figured wrong. The second one lasted only about 90 days and then died completely. I called the manufactuerer and they suggested I get a new battery for it. Unless you're interested in spending time and money on a product that is supposed to be a time and money saver, I suggest you, cautious shopper, shop for a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware keep your money in your pocket","review":"This is one of the loudest portable hand held vacuum cleaners I have ever used.

We like all emotions openly displayed. lots of dialogue and the plot must be resolved.You will find none of this in this movie, but it is certainly worth viewing and once you understand the reason for the lack of interaction between characters, it does make sense.Another aspect that makes the movie difficult is the long scenes when nothing is happening on the screen. That was the director's approach.The family is totally disfunctional as a unit. The parents never speak to each other, they all eat alone, and they function in their own little worlds with virtually no emotion.Even sex is random with no emotions attached.After the encounter between the son and the father, no one speaks of it and life continues on as before. There is no resolution to anything. That is the horror of the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow agonying fast forward-button movie watching experience","review":"i love artistic movies...but what happened to this one? it's a strange movie indeed. viewing from an artistic point of view, it may make some sense, but with lots of forwarding. if you like slow artsy movie, watch \\"scent of green papaya\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dud from an overrated director.","review":"...Ming-liang Tsai's films drag along endlessly with no direction and, quite frankly, no real acting.

It is really a \\"helps\\" book for those seeking healing for those who have been traumatized and haven't been able to get free.

The smell doesn't last for more than few hours,than I spray it again. Sometimes I'll try other by Kenzo as well, but this one is just perfect not morenot less.

Back in 1938 there was no such ability, and this kiler storm crept upon Long Island and southern New England without any serious warning. The devastation was incredible, and the loss of life amazing. It's a cautionary tale for weather forecasters everywhere about the dire consequences of incorrect or misleading weather information. There are many human interest stories interwoven in this book, some of them with happy endings, some with heartbreak. It's a part of our history that is mostly forgotten now, but deserves to be remembered, and I am very glad that this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"For the first time in my memory, I was unable to finish a book about a subject that fascinated me. Ms. Burnes tale reads like an eighth grade research paper. It is filled with inaccuracies: e.g. on average four tropical storms form in the Atlantic each year? There is no sense of narrative. She references the Perfect Storm several times, but the two books could not be more different. Junger's story was gripping, Burnes' is sleep inducing. It is truly awful. Instead, read Isaac's Storm, about the 1900 hurricane that hit Galveston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big storm, Little map","review":"Overall this book was riventing reading for me. Loving nature disaster stories like I do, I was glued to the pages till the storm petered out. However, I do have one complaint and that is the lack of detailed maps of the area included in the book. Anyone not familiar with the area is going to be at a loss without an atlas of the area for reference. Towns are named that mean nothing to me without a map, not to mention distances. Perhaps in further editions a good map of the area hardest hit could be included, otherwise a gripping read. Meanwhile, dear readers, read this with an atlas on your lap but do read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"Good history of event that I remember . Well worth reading after what happened in Sandy 2012 . Shows lesson to be learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isaac's Storm wannabe","review":"I hate books like this. The author didn't have enough faith in her story-telling ability to simply tell a great story instead of pretending that it was worse than it was. It was a terrible hurricane, yes. It was not, however, the worst hurricane ever. The reader can tell that she did some research on hurricanes in general, yet she makes not a single mention of the 1900 Galveston hurricane in which over 6000 people perished. It is impossible for her not to know about Galveston; in fact, I have an ungenerous hunch that she modeled this book after Isaac's Storm, Erik Larsen's account of the Galveston hurricane. Minor quibble: Her insistence on giving the storm a catchy name, \\"GH38\\", is grating.On the plus side, I did like the way she connected the storm to the great Depression on one side and World War II on the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the academic...","review":"Just to save the more academic people the pain... this book is made for a more casual reader, it is not written from a scientic perspective. The best account of the 1938 hurricane is still on the net: (google) \\"United States Hurricanes\\" Michael Grammatico is the only true scientific authority on hurricanes in the Northeast states."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully wondrous","review":"Hail to the Exalted Buddha...that is the message of this essential introduction to the Jatakas. In a way it can be thought of as a summary of much of all five Agamas of the Suttapitaka and as such is also an excellent introduction to the Abhidhamma.Students of Pali Buddhism cannot be without this book. Also ideal for university or college courses as it covers much key doctrinal ground along with the compelling, classic legendary but concise narrative of the Buddha's lives up until his enlightenment and ministry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"After reading all the reviews I decided to go ahead with this purchase anyway. Other reviewers warned that this would take your door right off the hinges if it was pushed too hard, but I figures, how hard can my 14th month old really push anyway? He loved to close doors and I thought these would be perfect to keep him from getting stuck in a room or losing a finger in the door. It certainly stopped my toddler from closing the door, which was great. However after only 3 uses my door started separating from the wall at the top hinge and now I don't need the door stopper at all, the door won't even close now. Hopefully we can repair/replace the hinge without too much trouble, but dont bother wiht this product. Try the Safety 1st no drill door stopper, works awesome, and I've had one in place for 6 months and absolutley no problems with that door whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best at all","review":"We use these ever so often. Most of the time they fall off. We have normal sized doors and all so I don't know why they end up on the floor. I would recommend looking into other door guards. My daughter can still push the door to the point where the door meets the frame...so she could still potentially get her fingers caught in between the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product but absolutely not for vintage doors. Very hard on hinges.","review":"Let me say first, that if you have industrial steel doors or a very, very sturdy frame, then this is the finger guard for you. But I have to second the emotion of the poster who says that it takes that door right off the upper hinges. All it takes is a few times and BOOM! You have a bigger safety issue than smashed finger-you have dangly door. Totally not the fault of the product-it works. It's easy. Pops on and off. If I had a loft or newer doors maybe? But I wish I'd *really* listened to the other reviewer. If you have an older home, you might try blocking the doors open during prime baby time instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great teether, not a great finger guard","review":"Super easy, yes. But, when your 11-month-old decides that he really wants that door shut, that door is going to shut, and take off the upper hinges as well. Granted, the hinges are 60 years old, but still. So, a new upper hinge later, the door works.And now we have two new teethers. Perfectly sized for little hands, I might add. The notches work well as a grip. So, for $5, we have a great new teething toy instead of a finger guard. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls door hinges off the frame","review":"I bought these because some of the reviews said that they don't pull the hinges off the wall. I was living in a brand new condo with heavy doors. Within two days, the doors would not shut right because they were being pulled from the door frame. Would not recommend, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a Minimum Width for Safety","review":"I am using these currently to deter my 2-year old son from slamming doors. The material is quite durable, better than the foam counterparts. The thickness could be a little more, but it certainly does the job.

I'd have given them 5 starts if they were just a bit thicker and didn't squish down so much, but I am heavy, so I hope that when I get back down to a reasonable size, they won't squish as quickly. They are quite comfortable even though they are compressed. I think, if they were just a bit thicker, I would like them even more. They have a slight support for the arch, which is nice and you don't often get with sandals like this. They make a thicker sole, but they are not flat, which I would not like. Overall, a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this frickin flip flop","review":"I tell people about this sandal all that time. I have arthritis and I've had surgery on my MTP joint so I'm super picky about shoes AND I still want my feet to still look cute. I know, I demand so much. That's point number one (the fact that I talk about it, not that I'm a brat). Point number two is I backpacked throughout Africa and the Middle East for 4 months with a pair of hiking boots and these flip flops. Yes, they stunk after 4 months of near daily use and I had to throw them out, but they were comfortable to the smelly end. I promptly purchased a pair for home, a pair for work, and an extra pair in case they ever get discontinued because I don't know how I'll cope without them. There's another sandal I'll have to review for comfort, but these are definitely the cutest comfortable sandals I own that don't dress down your outfit compared to other summer outdoorsy shoes (if you wear the all black pair).

I currently have plantar fiscitis which causes pain on the bottom of my feet and these are so wonderful for the softness and cushioning they provide. The only reason I did not mark five stars is because I wish they would come in a wide size. I have wide feet so it took a little time to stretch them a little so my pinky toes were not cramped.

I wear a size 7 and I am always true to size, however, these shoes felt extremely tight, even after attempting to stretch them out. In addition to feeling quite snug, every time I walked in them, I felt as if my feet were slipping out the back little by little each step. Also, these shoes do not offer much support.

I wear them almost every day when it's warm. They are the most comfortable sandal/shoe ever. I have high arches & they give great support because they mold to your feet so well. The soft straps hold them on your feet much better than normal flip flops. They are really easy to clean too. The sole of my pair is finally wearing out after 4 or 5 years of heavy use, but the top & straps still looks great. They've held up amazing well...longer than any other shoes I have. Needless to say, I've ordered a new pair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes!","review":"I have had two pair of these for 2 years now, and I love them. They are really the only flip flop I want to wear. I have the black on black and brown on brown, so they go with everything. They are a little dressier than the standard flip flop because of the cute straps, and people are always commenting on them. They stay looking great too. They are so cushiony. Extremely comfortable especially if you are going to be doing a lot of walking and they stay on well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sandal","review":"great sandal, wonderful price.

These work wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sandal","review":"This is my favorite flip-flop sandal, very comfortable, especially because of the built-up arch. I wear them 98% of the time during my year-long stays in Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never worn more comfortable shoes!!","review":"These shoes are absolutely fantastic- I've never worn more comfortable shoes- including my tennis shoes! I have two of these plus another pair of Tevas and I would buy more in a heartbeat- not once have I been uncomfortable in these shoes. I've had mine for a good year or two and after only a few months of wearing the sole creates a perfect mold of your foot- they become custom built specifically to your feet! Everyone says to order them big but mine were smaller than what I usually wear and I've actually found that they are small to begin with but as they conform to your feet they become bigger, so it's not always necessary to order up.If you're even thinking about buying these, do- there's absolutely no way you'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty to look at, but...","review":"Very uncomfortable to wear. I did not realize from the photos before purchased, that this was a \\"thong\\" - thought it was a criss/cross flip flop. Not only is it a thong, but a coarse and narrow thong material is utilized, making them quite painful and uncomfortable - cutting between the toes. Teva has a good name, but this flip flop is a disappointment - only good for bath to bedroom to dress. Too bad, as they are quite attractive"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for short pinky toes","review":"I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes. This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap. Nice colors, not very cushy sole because it's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it fit","review":"I had to give these to a friend when they didn't fit my foot. The straps were uncomfortably tight. I have a high arch. I know the straps would \\"give\\" after a little while, but they were too tight for me to even begin the \\"breaking in\\" process.However, my girlfriend has broken the straps in and *Loves* how cushy, yet classy the sandal looks on her foot --- yes, I am jealous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The incredible shrinking shoe","review":"Teva's are very comfortable, but don't leave them in the sun! They shrink! I left my new sandals in the back of my Jeep while I was at work one day. When I came out the top portion of the sole had shrunk and curled up. Didn't realize they were so fragile....not happy. $30 bucks wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shoe for narrow feet","review":"I was looking for a flip flop that had a bit of arch support and had comfortable straps. This shoe fits the bill and had such positive reviews, I had to try it. My only problem is the shape of my foot, it's narrow at the ankle but gets wide at the ball of the foot area. My outer metatarsal bone hangs off the edge of the shoe slightly, but due to the shape of the straps it isn't an issue. Also since the front of my foot is wider than average, the straps were a bit tight at first and were uncomfortable, but after wearing for a couple of days they have stretched a bit and now are very comfortable. The \\"mush\\" layer of foam on the foot bed is very comfortable and the little bit of arch support helps. If you have a wide foot in general, this may not be the shoe for you. I usually wear an 8 or 8.5 shoe, I ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teva Sandals ROCK","review":"These are the most comfortable flip flops I have ever worn - have purchased 2 pair now.

I HIGHLY recommend these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Flip Flops on the planet","review":"These are the most comfortable flip flop type shoes I have ever worn. We went on vacation to Disney and I watched a family friend wear these shoes everyday and walk at least 4 miles a day in them I couldn't believe it. She said she has over 20 pairs!! I came home and bought myself a pair and she was right!! They are so comfortable. I am a Teacher Assistant and I am on my feet all day long I wear these everyday-everywhere as long as the weather allows. I can't wait for Spring to get them back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn sandals","review":"I was sure with all the good reviews that these sandals would be awesome. Well for me...they are not. I do not like the way they feel at all. They are cushy on the bottom which is nice but they are just not comfy. The straps are not comfy. Sadly..I threw my money away on these since I had to wear them to find out I do not like them. Poor me.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable, Need a little Breaking In","review":"Overall these tevas are very comfortable. Tevas are always well made, and the sole is very cushy. The only problem I had is with the straps when I first started wearing them. After wearing all day, because the straps are made of a braided nylon/plastic fabric, the tops of my feet and around the tops of my big toes were a little sensitive, but I did not get blisters. After wearing several times, it feels like I've broken them in and no longer run into this problem. Just as comfortable as reefs, and I think more so than havaianas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"I bought these based solely on reviews from this site. I was not disappointed at all. I went from winter and boots and high end sneakers because of back problems to a vacation in Hawaii. I lived in these sandals all week and had no issues with comfort or my back. The arch support does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps loose and not uniform","review":"This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I've ordered. I LOVED the first pair. They were so comfortable, light weight, fit secure on my feet and provided arch support. So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season. I don't know what's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered. The straps were all over the place, some were way too loose, others too snug. They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn, so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund. Have not received yet. I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time. Again, I have had another pair of those, and the new ones were not as comfortable. Foot bed was harder than first pair, straps not uniform as to fit. TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps come loose","review":"This Teva style looks pretty nice for a flip flop. The strap configuration is the whole thing, the only thing I can see that distinuishes it from a $1.99 drugstore version.The third time I wore mine, the strap on one came loose. This means the main strap over the foot that holds the sandal on slipped out of its mooring 1/2 or 3/4 inch, from where it connects to the body of the shoe. I was just walking down a cement sidewalk with my dog.From that moment, the whole shoe is much too loose, and easy to trip with. Insecure. And the whole reason I chose this style was to have a more secure flip flop on my feet.I just could not face writing the company and shipping it back and paying $5 more to return an $18 item. Would not buy again. Disappointed in Teva."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned this","review":"These fit a little small for the size, even from other Chacos. I ended up returning them since the straps seemed tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teva Olowahu Flip Flops","review":"I love the design of these sandals... but I would suggest to get one size larger than you normally wear. They are sized small. My heel comes right up to the edge of the heel of the sandal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MOST comfortable flip flop ever made!","review":"My 25 year old daughter turned me on to these and I bought her two pairs of them. I have so many pairs of sandals in the closet that are all now going to Goodwill. I own two pairs of the same style of these with the wedge which are even more comfortable for me. I can't stand the summer heat but I'm actually sorry the summer is ending so I won't be able to wear them again until next year. Teva sandals and shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had on my feet and I'm 62 years old.....that's a lot of shoes I've gone through.

Chalfant's review of this item, claiming the makers of this fine documentary exhibit bias - which is true to some degree, as all filmmakers do to some greater or lesser extent, whether consciously or not. However, in the case of \\"The California Reich\\" it's hardly necessary for the documentarians involved to do anything other than let the cameras roll and allow their subjects to condemn themselves with their rabid, loathsome racist doggerel. These pathetic goons are so lame it's often laughable - until you hear their children spouting hateful garbage (these are the \\"loving\\" families Chalfant refers to in his review, I guess); one little boy in particular declares his ambition to become a policeman so that he can \\"kill n---ers.\\" One does have to wonder about the political affiliations of anyone who goes by the nickname of 'CSA fan,' as does the reviewer L. Chalfant. Yeah, hmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about bias!","review":"This film starts out by saying that it presents its subjects \\"in their own words\\", then goes out of its way to show these patriots- National Socialists in 1979 California- as oddballs, betraying an obvious prejudice at every step. But the filmmaker fails at several junctures: the families portrayed are obviously very loving and close; at the protests shown, the anti-National Socialists are screaming savage animals; and despite the efforts of the filmmaker, the organizational skills and leadership abilities of Allen Vincent shine through. All in all, though, a very one-sided waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Original Sadly Enough!","review":"The Bouncer is a sad case when it comes to music. Mainly because almost all the songs sound the same! It's one of those few CD's where you can fall asleep on song 3 and wake up on song 15 and feel like your listening to the same song! The one saving grace for this CD is The Bouncer's Theme \\"Forevermore\\" sung by Japanese superstar Reiko Noda! While this is a good song, sadly the english song that was in the game failed to make it on this CD (God only knows why)!

It was the 1ST romance novel I read & I realized that I continue to read everyone I come across to see if it will equal up to Valentine, Unfortunately, they never do. The use of language is exquisite, the characters are sensual yet quirky and the plot easily followed but hard to guess at. Gabrielle is funny, innocent, stubborn, and hopelessly in love while her sensual counterpart, Slyvester is strong, cumbersome, forceful, and in charge of every situation.

It's irreverent, jazzy, a time-capsule, has a snowy Alpine setting, and features the most stunning screen duo of all time: Gerard Phillipe and Jeanne Moreau. Try as they might to be deviant, they remain as young & innocent (and classy) as the period the film so paradigmatically embodies. There's a good deal of Europe on display here: a world of holidays, conviviality (Gemuetlichkeit) and easy-going hedonism. And the film manages to be profound in spite of itself.It's not the best transfer, but it may be the best SD transfer it receives in region 1. So, it you are a fan of French cinema, of black & white films, or films about relationships, you owe it to yourself to watch \\"Les Liasons Dangereuses\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film by Vadim with fantastic Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Philipe","review":"I loved this film.

Mainly she never even mentions credible nutrition research organizations when telling people where to turn for info, Instead she recommends supplement sales people for advice.

However, I have to doubt the validity of the author's recommendations based on two factors: 1.) Her \\"evidence\\" is often anecdotal and has no scientific support, and 2.) Most importantly, her militant views on religion would obviously not allow for other possibilities to be considered. The religious bias in Shannon's writing leads me to believe that she would sacrifice objectivity in the face of furthering her cause. I also took offense to having her brand of Christianity shoved down my throat and I hope non-Christians don't think we're all like this zealot. In retrospect, I see that the publisher is an affiliated religious organization, but the company seems eager to deceive the purchaser by not stating that affiliation or bias anywhere on the covers.

The book is clear and well-written, by someone with an enviable knowledge not only of Wittgenstein but also of theology. The first edition was criticised, with some justification, for being a bit light theologically, but Kerr has added a postscript which addresses this problem, at least to some extent. As theologians, we could all do with being more philosophically adept, and this volume shows one of Scotland's great theologians grappling with an important philosophical tradition.

Unfortunately, this long awaited DVD was transferred badly and the sound in part one is out of synch by several counts.

It is unbelievable that something like this could happen when you take into consideration that Balanchine was probably the most musical choreographer that ever lived. Never pedantic, always magical.

Unfortunately, their technical talent is stunted by their inability to use simple language, or hire an editor who can translate for them.

They make simple concepts extremely complicated by their inability to use anything but the most complicated manner of explanation.I am not actually taking this test, so I cannot rate it as a study guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Rangers Time Force","review":"This video is going to have the following episodes of Power Rangers Time Force season 1: Worlds Apart, The Quantum Quest, Clash for Controlle part 1, and Clash for Controlle part 2.

I like that seen from Worlds Apart were the Silver Guardians introduce themselves to Nadira, when she gets upset that they spoiled her shopping spree. The villains in this video will be: Ransik, Nadira, Frax, Gluto, X-Vualt mutant, Brickneck, Commandercon, snd if they have Bodyguard in Blue in there, the last one will be Nadira's mutant.

Humor, being one of the more important ones. Also, the lead charactor Dale Hartwell (played by \\"Acapulco HEAT\\" star Michael Worth) is a real human being, not a super hero. Worth handles the role with charisma and believability, another rarity in the genre. His skill as a fighter is evident, but he manages to convince us that it progresses through the film.The fight scenes are slightly above average and there is quite an abundance of them. Yet at the same time, they stay real.

They all said \\"The Assault\\". It would certainly be an exageration to say that Holland has no literature, but not much of an exageration. It is renowned for its great painters and architects, not its writers. But in \\"The Assault\\" at least, they have produced an indisputable masterpiece. If you read just one Dutch novel, this has to be it.An exquisitely poignant evocation of life in German-occupied Holland in World War II, it invites the reader to make moral judgements and then systematically undermines those judgements. It is a restrained, undemonstrative, beautifully written work that unfolds gradually and in a most unexpected way. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The assault on a German officer makes hell brake loose...","review":"This book should be read by everyone who is interested in the Second World War and the consequenses of this terrifying event.

It's a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novelist well worth exploring","review":"Brilliant long novella, spare but evocative, driven along by a wartime assault whose circumstances gradually and laconically unravel over a lifetime.Mulisch, who died in 2010, has long been regarded as the Netherlands' greatest postwar novelist. With the narrative sureness of Graham Greene and the plausibility of a William Trevor plot, his special area (resulting from his own, very troubling parentage) is the tensions between collaboration and resistance during the Hitler War.Going on this short novel, he's an author well worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad memories","review":"My grandson's teacher assigned THE ASSAULT as one of three books he was to read this term. He and I are sharing \\"the experience.\\" I would say he is in the age-group to begin reading such a novel and it certainly is another way of looking at the horrors of WWII. Anton is a bit too young to be able to understand all that is going on because he is so young - but as he begins to \\"age\\" the memories begin to play a role in his life. He is truly a victim of his past and is trying to live a life in the present, but there is a constant replaying of what has happened to him. I hope my grandson and I can share some of the poignant points of this life lived so tragically. I can only imagine the memories of the holocaust victims who still dream such terrible nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"no Dutch literature?

But it definitely fixed the problem I had where the computer (for the bike) wasn't picking up the transmitter accurately anymore. I was getting wildly varying readings with the old one, from 0 to well over \\"I should be dead\\" high readings in seconds. The old one lasted about 4 years of regular use, hopefully this one will last that long or longer. It attaches differently to the transmitter than the original Polar strap - the old one had connections at the ends of the strap which is where it opened the loop, where this one has a separate clasp and the snaps for the transmitter are in a fixed position, so if you're looking at this thinking it's the wrong one, keep that in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"chest strap polar bad","review":"I bought this strap as extra, came to use it today.

I wear an XL t-shirt and find the M-XXL strap that came with the polar HRM to not be large enough. While I can stand to lose a couple lbs (10-15) like everyone else, the strap fits way too tightly around the ribcage. I just checked, I'm pretty much skin-and-bone around this area... can't be due to body fat. The XXXL strap fits WAY better and allows me to get the fit just-right. Just a hint for anyone shopping around for one of these. Kind of disapointing that you have to shell out the additional $$$'s just to make the strap fit right on an honestly average-sized guy's chest.Like the other guy said, don't let the sizing be a blow to your progress or ego, I think they must have meant womens XXXL or something like that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Find","review":"\\"Peter Olaf\\" was a complete joy to read.

The story is beautifully orchestrated like waves of the ocean. Just when you think you can't stand the height of the torment, deceit, or sadness, the wave breaks and something perfect happens to the character.

I'm thinking the size of the doorknob has a lot to do with how easily you can open doors with these.

If I can do it, anyone can. The color turned out closer to the actual pic on the box than any haircolor I've ever used, and I color a lot.

I started with a blonde color just SLIGHTLY lighter than the photo on the box (and easily one of the three in the \\"color result guide\\" on the side of the box). All I wanted to do was to slightly change the tone. I now have DARK greenish-brown hair. It doesn't even SLIGHTLY resemble the color on the box (or even any natural color.) UGGG.

I thought the highlights might help, so I applied the highlights the same day, after I let my hair dry first. It was worse. The highlights turned out orange. I'm going to have to use a different product now, maybe a semi-permanent color to cover the orange at least, and bring the hair to one color at least.Will not buy this product again, it obviously doesn't have enough lift power, and it will bring out every red you might have in your hair.

After the first step (all over color) - I was happy with the color but it did not cover all of my grays. I had someone help me with the highlights and you couldn't even tell where we were putting the bleach. After rinsing that out - ONLY my roots were bleached.

It was always great. About 6 months ago or so the formulation changed. It used to take 30 minutes, now it takes 15 minutes. You should disregard any reviews for the old formulation. I can't tell any difference in color - that seems fine. But over the last several months the quality of my hair has become absolutely horrible, and I don't know what else I can blame. It's never been like this, frizzy looking, curling out of control, dry-looking. It looks severely unconditioned, but I'm using the same conditioner I have always used, including the conditioner that comes in the box. Has anyone else noticed this? I really wish I could go back to the old formulation for 6 months and see, but I can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, Natural Color","review":"Love this color. It's a warm brown with just the right amount of undertone. It's the closest color I've found to my natural hair color and covers the gray.

I love this product, and haven't had a bad experience.

I am often complimented on how natural the highlights look, even by my stylist.I gave the product 4 rather than 5 stars since I suspect that the product supplied to me by this outside-of-Amazon vendor may have unknowingly been a 'knock-off' product, OR very old OR subject somewhere to intense heat/cold. All of the plastic containers cracked with minimal and gentle handling spilling product everywhere. More importantly, the product didn't seem to color my roots as well as it has done in the past.

The books starts slow, peaks with some action about halfway, then starts to repeat itself over and over in the last half of the book. Ignoring the improbable in the guise of science fiction, the characters do not make sense. There appears to be no survival instinct in any of them. They sit on top of mine shafts, yet never explore them. Wind is blowing through the tunnels but they never think to find out from where it is coming.

Unfortunately, there is no answer, it's just a killer weed. That's it.I realize that not knowing the backgroud of a villian can be even more scary. I thought Darth Vader and Leatherface were much more terrifying before all of the sequels and prequels ruined all of the mystery. On the other hand, we're talking about a killer plant here, It's not scary to begin with.Even though I don't think this book is that great, I still don't think it is as bad as everyone else seems to think.

Isn't clever writing about conveying that kind of stuff without having to completely spell it all out? Whoever edited this book should have cut tons of it and made it into a short story. That would have been great.The ending was also completely not worth the time it took to get there.

I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones type stories and I thought this book was headed that way into the dark labrinyth of secret passages and bad South American priests.Well, there are no ruins. The only ruin was the book itself: a waste of trees. The story line is like thin soup and there is no depth to the characters. It reads like a \\"what I did on my summer vacation\\" written by a bored summer school student and I found myself flipping through pages hoping to find something exciting in the story.So five young tourists die on a hill side eaten by a plant.

Rather, I found it to be absurd, lame, corny, pick an adjective. Smith is a good writer (A Simple Plan is a great novel) but this thing read like a rejected script for a bad teen horror flick.

It's almost at the level of \\"I know, let's split up\\". I'd point out a few examples but it would give stuff away. Also the monster is just un-believable. I think the writer owes us a little bit more explanation about how it could come to be than the clueless, unconvincing speculations of our heros and sheros. Finally, it's hard to believe that its future prospects are good. One of these days someone's gonna show up with a working cellphone, an automatic weapon, or a container of paraquat - and then the game's over.Oh yeah, why did I finish it?

To me, this book was deeply silly. I'd been hoping for a good summer thriller. What I got a dopey novel about a bunch of kids terrorized by (spoiler alert) talking flowers. The writing itself isn't bad, and the initial premise of being trapped in a remote location is intriguing. But killer vines that talk? This is like a subpar episode of \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" It fails as horror, as science fiction, and even as good escapist entertainment. A dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been waiting for years for Scott Smith to write another book. I think A Simple Plan was one of the best books I have ever read. I was extremely disappointed with The Ruins. Killer vines--come on! Beyond ridiculous. Please, Mr. Smith, go back to at-least-possible fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it into a movie","review":"You'd be better off wasting an hour and a half on a B-grade horror movie than a whole afternoon or evening actually reading this book. Yeah, I get the premise, roads not taken, life turning out differently than you thought, etc. But please, these characters had to work really hard at getting themselves into the life-and-death situation they face, much like the horror film actress who opens the creepy door into the attic when you know nothing good can come from it. I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This should have been a short story, at best. It was slow to start and remained that way. I was so anesthesized by the tedious unraveling of the storyline that even the \\"horrors\\" of the what happens to the characters seemed mundane. This is actually a book that would be better as a movie....at least it'd only take a couple of hours to be put out of your misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited 13 years for this?","review":"I agree with one reviewer, who noted the title was misleading.If this is the best that Mr smith can comeup with after thirteen years, than he should find otherwork. This tale can be told in less than twenty pages,Mr Smith chose to \\"eat up the scenery\\", and earn himselfa fat (?) paycheck. To another reviewer, who was kept upall night reading this fantasy, better take one valiumbefore Mr. Smith's next book, and save yourself some money,as well as a good night's sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just skip this book","review":"I have NEVER written a negative review about a book before, but I am actually annoyed that I wasted 3 evenings of my life on The Ruins. I read it based on Stephen King's recommendation (I LOVE his work), and I cannot TELL you how disappointed I was. This is just not a good story. Period. I'm an AVID reader, so I feel like I'm a pretty good judge. I've read work by all different types of authors (like Clive Cussler, Michael Crighton, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Erik Larson, Annette Shreve, Pat Conroy, Ken Follett, Nicholas Sparks, etc.), and I read quite a bit that shows up on the NY Times Best Seller List. The Kite Runner is one of the best books I've read in five years. It's with great regret that I must say The Ruins is one of the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Disappointment","review":"I was so excited when I read the author of A SIMPLE PLAN had a new book. Then the press. They were beside themselves. Then I bought the book. It is a generic horror story (SPOILER...if you still want to read the book, pls stop reading this review) with man eating plants. No chapters, pages upon pages of narrative with no dialogue. Laborious descriptions of entering and exiting a well....if one is going to read pulp, let it at least be in bite sizes like James Patterson's books where two pages can constitute a chapter. There is something satisfying about getting to the end of a scene and having experienced first the sense of horror, the scene of horror, and then the escape from horror. In Smith's book, it is an academic, overly written mud field one needs to trog thru."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Pages Too Long","review":"Not much of a story, less than interesting characters and simply not very well written. That about says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The ending was disappointing. It could have been a 30pg short story and been just as affective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...........","review":"I guess my expectations were too high. I was expecting something of the caliber of \\"A Simple Plan\\". This is nothing more than a script for a teenage horror flick.Even the ending reminds me of so many horror movies.I can't believe that this is the result of 12 years of work.Now THAT's scary! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the Dumbest \\"Horror\\" Novels I've Read","review":"Don't let the title \\"The Ruins\\" fool you into thinking this story involves ancient Mayan ruins, with maybe some kind of supernatural, demonic presence. It is about 6 knuckleheads on a barren hill getting attacked by - a vine. Yes, a thinking, talking, flesh-eating vine with little red flowers that creeps onto them anytime they lose any bodily fluids. I kept waiting for some type of explanation on this thing, but it never came. Don't waste your time with this. I can't imagine that the movie coming out will be any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Horror story, but not for those who can't handle a little blood!","review":"\\"The Ruins\\" is a pure horror story alla Steven King (I am not surprised to see him plugging this book). The book does take awhile to get rolling, but once it does it is hard to put down! I think some of the negative reviews are from people not expecting a gory horror story. THIS IS NOT THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL! But it is a great bit literary horror fiction. Smith can write (I am now looking for his earlier book \\"A Simple Plan\\") He knows how do develop characters and draw out suspense. If you cannot handle gore than do not buy this book! But if you like horror and are looking for a great beach read you can't go wrong with \\"The Ruins!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Visceral, gory, ultimately disappointing","review":"This book was a disappointment. I read all the great reviews of it so perhaps my expectations were set too high. There was just a lot of blood and other bodily fluids and it wasn't very scary at all. The only reason I finished listening to it was to find out if anyone survived, even though by the end I really could not have cared less about the characters. If you really want to read this, I'd suggest checking it out at the library where it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audrey II","review":"SPOILER (if it is even possible to spoil the story):I loved Simple Plan, so based on that and the ringing endorsement from Stephen King, I bought the book. The build up to the plot-line is interesting enough (the first 4 chapters) - then, unfortunately the \\"plot\\" unfolds to reveal...malevolent, carnivorous vines. Vines that laugh and smell like pie (no, I'm not joking). The plot is inane and the characters so uninteresting I was glad to see them die. Scott Smith owes me $24.00!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"For the life of me I cannot understand Publisher's Weekly giving this book a starred review. I gave up halfway through it and normally I hang on till the bitter end. But in this case I was bored to tears and didn't want to waste any more time on it.The book was boring, the plot repetitive, the horror tedious, and the characterization inane. I generally agree with Stephen King but not in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too implausible ...","review":"I thought the situation was interesting and the character development was good, but the villian in this story a vine that can lay traps, read minds, pick up things and move them around, and speak both english and german. I actually got pretty engossed in the story sometimes, but then suddenly the magic vine was mimicking one characters voice, saying exactly the things that would most likely cause conflict with another character, and I'd pop out of the story and think, \\"Oh, come on...\\"Another complaint is that early in the story, Eric is being lowered into a shaft and he sees a tunnel to the side that holds promise for escape. Apparently he forgets about it and its never mentioned in the story again.The story held a lot of promise, but now I feel that reading it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I like to read all types of books, but this is a depressing waste of time. You know how its going to end one third of the way thru. It has no point to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses its way","review":"Completely peters out about the halfway mark, when you've seen everything there is to see and know exactly how the last 150 or so pages will proceed. Maintains a nice, creepy atmosphere for that first half (despite a complete lack of characterization), but once you discover what's going on it's just a slow countdown to each bloody death.In movie terms, this is (far) less 'The Shining' than it is a 'Hostel' or a 'Saw.' If you're into cartoon sadism, go for it. If you're into subtle spooks, just read the first half - you'll know what comes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a short story","review":"Although creating vivid characters with insightful psychology in the set-up, the book loses steam as the underlying menace is revealed, similar to Michael Crichton's 'Prey.' The set-up is great and doesn't take too long. But once the 'menace' (I'll avoid spoilers) is unveiled, it's capabilities seem unintentionally campy and, in several instances, inconsistent. All for the sake of creepy horror, you say? Well, it's ironic to me that Stephen King liked the book so much, because it really is an effort to -be- a Stephen King book. But it spends more time on character relationships and their fear, but doesn't deliver on the 'menace' in unexpected ways. The evil choice is filled with promise, but the execution sputters where it should creep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Bought this because of King's review... Skipped through most of the last half not interested in the development of his characters as they talk and think to themselves. It was too late for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but missed opportunities","review":"I was excited about reading a book set in Coba after having spent time climbing the ruins and learning everything there is to know about the Mayans. My husband and I are probably the only people to visit the Mayan Museum in Cancun. I was also curious how the author would make a vine into an adversary. Scott Smith accomplishes the task of setting up man vs. nature,but I wanted more Mayan intrigue and biology teasers. I think he failed in his task of developing man vs. man. What was the purpose of setting us up for a survival story when it only goes downhill? The women were so annoying and pointless. It is my personal nightmare to be trapped for in the jungle with three whining yuppies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"Implausible one review states and implausible it is. There is a lot to be scared of in this world but plants that talk and eat people and play tricks just doesn't do it for me. Stephen King said this book scared him....hmmmm.....what does that say about Mr.King?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book reaffirms my stance not to read Fiction","review":"I echo most of the bad reviews of this book. Long, drawn-out, thin-plotted and predictable. When I got to the end, I was more and more worried that it would end the way it did, AND IT DID! Ugh.Reading fiction is a risky venture. You can spend days with a book only to get to the end and find out it was a waste of time. Thanks Scott Smith for helping convince me that there aren't very many good story-tellers out there worth my time anymore.I'll stick with Non-Fiction. At least we know it was interesting enough for someone to put into print. Because \\"The Ruins\\" certainly wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"Like many others I've waited a long time for the new Scott Smith novel. This was so worth waiting for! I love this kind of book and there are so few like it. Once it gets going it's just too good to put down. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest at times. The tension and the way the reader is left constantly fearful of what \\"might\\" happen next make this an absolutely unmissable gem. I only hope we don't have to wait as long for the next book from this quite brilliant author."},{"rating":"2","title":"good surreal reading","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The character portrayals were very good and the story line was \\"weird\\". Good vacation reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"a typical cheesy teen kill movie.","review":"what a joke. i started reading again after 10 years of just magazines because movies are just bad. the worst kind of movie? stupid teen or early 20's movie where you want something good to happen because you are 36 years old and dan brown has set the bar a little high with interesting books. this was as predictable as they come. even if a book is predictable thats fine if its entertaing. this isnt. at all. i want my 10 hours of life back because this was a waste of it. i would givbe away the ending but you only need read to page 50 before you know that. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-d0af7260"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/61.md","filePath":"quotesmag/61.md"}'),j={name:"quotesmag/61.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
