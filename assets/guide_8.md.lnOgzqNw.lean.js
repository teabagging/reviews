Obviously you get what you pay for, the gun shoots fairly well, within the range of 35ft it is accurate, beyond that it isn't. It cocks and loads reliably, and shoots consistantly. As for looks it looks pretty cool. The case is a cool gimmick, good to store it in also, the speed-loader it comes with is useless for loading a clip, but if you have a reservoir loading gun it will be good. Weight and quality seem decent, its a simple gun but seems to be pretty good, treat it right and you will be fine.

Not cuz of anything the writer wrote, but cuz its just so bad. You look in book and at positions and some of the moves. Hard to stop from bursting out in laughter over how absurd and bad the moves are. So throw your money away on this book if thats what you wanna do.

I'm not sure the skull operation scene close ups were entirely needed, but hey...Plus these movies give you some interesting ideas to think about in terms of 'what have I really done with my life? what kind of person would Jigsaw say I am?'.

It joins the original Saw on blu ray, offered in an R rated form. Yet, parts 2,4,and 5 are the longest versions offered. Why would blu ray get the lesser versions of part 1 and 3? No idea.

I hurt when they hurt, i held on to my chair when there was a painful scene, and the suspense kept my teeth stuck together...Some may think it's disgusting to watch so much blood out of a person in one movie, but the blood is just the end of it; what's more interesting and worth the watch are the traps used and the story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"The first movie was an amazing film it had it all tension, horror etc. The second film was a slight let down.

No big names in this one, just the return of Jigsaw and his apprentice, Amanda. Some of the graphic and brutal tortue scenes are kind of silly but I always liked to story behind as to why these individulas don't appreciate their lives (Jigsaw has an obsession of people who don't feel grateful). This sequel doesn't compare to the original or even Saw II, but if you want to know how this baby ends then indulge yourself in a little game of cat and mouse.

The puzzle and Grand Guignol elements used in both raised the bar for the slasher genre. So it's sad that SAW III is such a disappointment.

I was amazed to see none of these while suffering through this one. However, I faintly picked up a glimpse of a good idea toward the end, but by then it was too late. Neat camera angles and a picture devoid of color, while intriguing at first, do not make up for this film's shortcomings (Hey, I just memorized this amazingly long monologue or I guess you'd call it a run-on sentence ten minutes ago and I think I can spit it out and remember to use words like \\"self-nullifying\\" and others that I would normally not EVER use in a normal conversation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I saw this on cable.

You won't want to miss laughing when Dante's ex-girlfriend screws a dead guy in the Quik Stop's bathroom and becomes, well, a little messed up in the head. I'll warn you right now that you will only find this View Askew Production as funny as I do if you enjoy a countless number of swears thrown onto a mountain of dirty jokes. If you like that sort of thing, you will immediately put this flick at the top of your favorite movie list. I suggest renting or BUYING all of Kevin Smith's films. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique but not clever.","review":"Kevin Smith in this, his first effort, writes dialogue that would be more believable in a comic book than in a movie. The lines seem too cute and don't convey any depth or indiviuality to any of the characters, rather, it is like listening to a play written by someone in high school being read by someone in high school. The actors are not good enough to make up for the lack of realism in the dialogue or the ubiquitous voice of Smith. His most recent movie, Chasing Amy, on the other hand, is proof that Smith is getting more original and deep with his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clerks Bluray!","review":"Wow, I thought you couldn't get much better than the LaserDisc version of Clerks in quality, strictly because the original movie was shot on grainy 16mm film, but, I was totally wrong. This Blu-ray version really shows Dave Kleins cinematography in rich new detail that really helps a viewers appreciation of Clerks.The extras on the Bluray were chock full of stuff too, which is totally expected of a Kevin Smith release, but I think they could have mined some of the fan-created material to give the viewer a sense of impact that Clerks had on society and the cinema-world as a whole. Eh, maybe a 20th Anniversary release we'll see that. :)All in all, whether you are a first time viewer or a long time fan of Clerks, this Blu-ray release of Clerks is totally worth a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and White?","review":"I was prepared to laugh when I slipped Clerks into my DVD player, but the moment I saw it was black and whit I took it out and returned it.

I got a lot of laughs. I saw this after seeing Clerks 2 and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. It's kinda neat to see how their characters evolved in the later movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, but bad DVD transfer","review":"This is an excellent movie to which I would've given 5 stars to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the DVD transfer. The picture quality is not great. They could've used digital filters to remove some of the graininess of the video. And the audio suffers from a bad sync problem. I've played it on a Sony DVP-NS500V, Intervideo's WinDVD 4, and PowerDVD XP 4.0. The only player that played it without a sound-sync problem was PowerDVD. It's not the fault of the players, but the disc itself. This disc is the only one that played with sync problems on the other two players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-Budget Brilliance","review":"The DVD is worth the extra money, if only for the hilarious version in which the video of the movie is played while the cast comments on each scene. Among other things, Jason Mewes (Jay) is basically passed-out drunk during the commentary and keeps yelling \\"Snoochie boochies!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather overrated","review":"This is one of those movies that I bought simply because so many people told me how wonderful it was. I've gotta say that even with some funny dialog and good ideas, it doesn't deserve anything close to the credit it gets.The dialog is really what kills this movie. The actors are pretty amateurish, and the delivery of lines is wooden and completely unnatural. The whole movie is based around conversations, and while the actual text of the script is good, the actors don't pull it off.It's pretty easy to make me laugh. But, as this movie stands, it only evoked a few chuckles. Not worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated PRETENTIOUS piece","review":"Probably the most \\"slacker\\" movie of them all, with its awfully smudgy pseudo-realistic b/w look, it nevertheless doesn't hold true to the feel of self-imposed reality. The characters are simply unbelievable, with all sorts of zingers/puns/\\"wits\\" filling their speeches to the brim(and they speak in COMPLETE and grammatically CORRECT phrases, only filled with F-word here and there as if to make them sound natural), proving over and over again that Kev Smith is a shame of the slacker generation cinematographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a second chance and ...","review":"I hated this movie the first time I saw it. It wasn't the low budget style that bothered me; it was mostly the way the male characters view the female characters in the movie as either bitches or ho's. So then I talked to many people who loved it and I thought maybe I should see it again, this time in a theatre with a midnight movie audience of people who love it. I still hated it. I've heard Kevin Smith got better with age - but after also renting Mallrats and hating that, too I am reluctant to spend more time on him or his work. I'm not going to waste a lot of time going into detail about why I hated it - this is just my opinion and my gut reaction. I also am writing this because I usually only bother writing reviews of movies I love - so I figured I should write at least one review of a movie I passionately hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Overated, Trite, Pretensious","review":"Boy, that Kevin Smith fella sure is clever. Or that's what he'd have us believe, anyway. His forte is painting cruel caricatures of people and having us laugh at these one-dimensional representations of human beings as they do improbably cruel things to each other. I guess you could glean some sort of philosophical staement from this, but don't try. Just know that in every Smith film there is a lot of intellectual jerking off and bad acting. I mean, Jesus, the acting in this film was cringe-inducing. The only redeeming aspect of the flick was Jason Mewes delightful performance as a caustic, foul-mouthed drug peddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated --Read a Book Instead!","review":"After hearing people talk about how great this low budget film was, I was expecting to see a good comedy about what its like to work in one of those mini marts and the oddballs that drop in at all hours. Instead, I was totally bored and had no trouble keeping myself from even a chuckle. The dialog between the characters was not particularly interesting---just mainly vulgar which bores me to death. My wife left the room after a half hour of it as she felt it was too offensive. I think I turned it off after 45 minutes. Recommendation: Buy a good book instead and don't waste your time or money with this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty-Mouthed and Boring","review":"\\"Clerks\\" is a comedy, filmed in black and white showing a day in the life of Clerks working in a convenience store. It is a cult film directed by Kevin Smith. Most of the film looked like it was shot for a high school film project. Potty-mouthed dialogue between Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) was ninety-percent of the film. Two scenes outside the convenience store (hockey game on the roof and visiting a funeral home) were the only breaks one got.Overall this cult film is just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Some reviews...\\"The funniest movie of the year\\"--New York Newsday(Must have been a bad year for comedies.)\\"Screamingly Funny!\\"--Rolling Stone(Screamingly bad is more like it.)\\"Two thumbs up!\\"--Siskel and Ebert(With the eight other fingers down.)Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The dialogue is as stimulating as the U.S. Tax Code, and the actors are as animated as John Kerry on downers. It would take too long to list this film's bad points. Just watch five minutes and you'll completely understand why it would be a waste of 87 minutes of your life to watch the rest.But I would have to say that having Jay in this movie was the clearest indicator of how moronic this film would be. (Nothing against Silent Bob. He was about the only interesting highlight of this calamity.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk....Talk...Talk..........","review":"This movie hasn't aged well.

In my opinion this was the biggest waste of, what, two hours? that I've ever had the misfortune to experience. Kevin Smith and his View Askew Production Company have made so many great movies...I assumed Clerks would be good too...There were maybe 2 funny parts throughout the entire movie, certainly not worth buying or even renting...Maybe if your friend has it you would give it a watch just to say you've seen it, but I wouldn't suggest it. Terrible movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"This has gotta be the worst script I've ever heard in a movie. Kevin Smith seems to be trying for a world record in tastelessness. His jokes aren't funny or clever, just vulgar. Like other overrated screenwriters like Matt Damon/Ben Affleck and Tarantino, Smith seems to think that there is merit in vulgarity. He doesn't realize that the is NO merit in such. Anyone can think of profanity; it requires niether creativity nor intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"I got this movie with the intention of seeing a comedy classic. The ridiculous amount of praise it received persuaded me into it. Not even a $27,000 budget is a good enough excuse for this piece of garbage. It's amazing that Smith wasn't permanently outcast from the film-making industry. I can't even begin to fathom a producer seeing this and thinking \\"Wow, I'd like to give this genious more money to make another movie.\\"You know, folks, just because a movie is low-budget and avant-garde, it doesn't necessarily mean its good.Hey, its not Smith's fault that his actors have the all the pizzazz of my introductory drama class in middle school, right?

This is also sometimes viewed as a look at the culture of the mid-1990s. The most mid-1990s-ish thing about it is its lousy attempt to copy that fast-paced dialogue of an early Tarantino film like Resevoir Dogs. C'mon, did anyone really laugh at the thing about the Death Star? Ugh. To add insult to injury, this movie is atrociously acted. A whining, nasal character named Dante who maintains the same weird, irritating intonation throughout the movie, his dope friend who literally can not act ONE BIT, and the dumb characters outside, including Smith himself, who try so hard to be funny, but aren't. This movie just stinks. Sorry to all those who love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"I don't remember too much about this movie (speaks volumes) other than the fact that it was boring and the c-rate actors over-rehersed their lines.

People either seem to love or hate this movie. It's obvious in the reviews. Those that love it would be more likely to comment, so I suggest that if you are considering seeing this movie, look for the negitive comments to get a balance.No one talks like they did in the film. I've met a broad spectrum of people from every conceivable profession and, none of them spoke the way the people in this piece-of-crap film do. This movie is so overrated its not even slightly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This movie is great! I docked it a star simply due to the fact that the acting is some of the worst that I have seen, however that is understandable due to the lack of funding and time that Kevin Smith had to make this film. When one simply looks at the screenplay, I think this is his best film! One of the funniest that I have seen in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique film from a unique filmmaker","review":"I appreciated this film more than any of Smith's others.

Truly deserving of praise, it gives a unique and real (and funny)view of life in customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever Made!","review":"Clerks is the best movie that we as humans have ever had the opportunity to view. The actors are so realistic it makes you feel as if you are in the movie yourself and standing right there in the middle of the conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, catchy and real to life","review":"\\"Clerks\\" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Kevin Smith takes a bunch of average Joes and turns them into a hilarious bunch of characters. The acting is so natural that it doesn't even seem like acting. But it does get a little dirty at times so make sure that you don't have any small children around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still funny","review":"I saw this movie when it originally came out, then recently decided to buy it for my dvd collection. Watched it recently and was surprised that it was as funny years later as the original viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny movie but...","review":"Very Funny movie but... I agree with some reviwers the extras needed to be more for die hard core Kevin Smith fans.Kevin Smith is one of just a few directors that I enjoy watching over and over again because I never ever get tired of his sense of humor and the actors do a great job on each and every movie he makes.So anyone who have ever wanted to rip into a customer watch this movie and enjoy laugh after laugh for you will not stop laughing threwout the movie experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not all Black & White","review":"An interesting look in the lifes of a handful of people working at and hanging around a small grocery store and video store. This microcosm is filmed in black and white either for economy or perception. The story is not dull and a fair amount of wit is layed upon us. Overall a decent work if you enjoy character developed stories like \\"Crash\\". Although this may not have the cast or budget of that magnitude, it stands up well against such comparison. At first I thought this was just going to be a comedy about shopkeepers, but it goes well beyond any superficial farce. I recommend it at least as a rental and there is a good chance you may want to add it to your collection. Good quality DVD, lots of extras, and good replayability."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"I loved this movie! I worked as a clerk for over 15 years and honest to god have met every single one of the customers in this movie (some of them more than once). I loved the conversations between Dante and Randall. You don't have to have non-stop action to have a good movie. When I first saw it I was still working in retail and laughed so hard I thought I was going to be sick. I loved the DVD version which has the original ending. (Won't give it away if you haven't seen it). I thought that the original ending would have been better. Just that extra punctuation to the day. If you want to understand the person behind the counter the next time you go to the store see this movie. If you are the person behind the counter see this movie. You'll be glad you did the next time the village idiot walks in your store. Either way though Clerks is a must see and I can't wait to get this 10th anniversary pack"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This movie is by far the funniest film ever produced... and on a measly budget, too! Not for virgin ears, though! Also check out: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma... all by the same director, Kevin Smith (aka: GOD) this is probably his best work, despite unexperienced actors, that just adds to the film's fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I have seen a lot of movies, but no movie is as funny as clerks. This movie had me laughing so hard I could not stop. Chasing Amy and Mallrats can not even come close to being as good as this movie. This movie is very original and very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"For anyone who has ever wondered what Shakespeare would be writing, were he alive today; look no further than the films of Kevin Smith. Whitty Dialogue, intricate story lines, characters with depth, and baudy humor (to satisfy the rabble in the pit; we smell our own)are the hallmark of his films. This film, the first of what fans have dubbed 'The Jersey Trilogy', is a decent debut for Smith, but the movie drags ever-so-slightly in the middle. It is, however, by no means is a disappointment. The new DVD release comes packed with features and is a \\"must have\\" for the hardcore fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clerks","review":"I did not care for Clerks, as it is definitely meant for the younger adult. The language and content were offensive. I turned it off half-way through the feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored. Shrug.","review":"I finally broke down and bought this after a co-worker talked favorably about the Silent Bob series. I've read the mostly-favorable comments about Kevin Smith movies, so...Why was I so bored? I think it was the long periods where the camera did not move, and the actors did not move either. They just talked - about boring things. I've worked retail. I like black and white movies. I can appreciate having no budget. I can appreciate \\"dialogue-based\\" movies. I found this movie nearly unwatchable.I give it a generous 2 stars for effort, I suppose. Although I would categorize it as \\"bad\\", it is not as truly horrifically bad as the few movies I have rated worse (Armageddon, Black and White, Lost and Delirious, The Smokers)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clerks! Where's the story?","review":"Lame attempt by the inept kevin Smith to score big in the independant film genre, is the movie Clerks. With no real story except for a oddball assortment of caracters and their encounter with even stranger folks as customers.Granted their is a few (very few) good laughs in this attempt of a independant comedy, but not enough to keep the viewer intrested.Pity me I did let a person talk me into watching the sequel Mall Rats, but once again the story failed, due to the fact that the only real thing that the two films have in common is the return of some of the original cast members.Don't waste your time go buy a Tarintino film, like Pulp Fiction, or Resivoir Dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low resolution Black & White source; save your money!","review":"First off, I love this movie. With that said, it is not worth upgrading this film to blu-ray. As stated in another review, this film was a low budget film shot on cheap low resolution black & white film stock. It may as well have been filmed with a camcorder.The blu ray version is also way over priced. Giving this film a blu ray \\"upgrade\\" makes as much sense as giving \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" a blu ray transfer. The source material is crap. If you must have everything blu ray, that's fine, but wait awhile as this one will surely drop in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clerks","review":"Here is the first movie created by director Kevin Smith who came on the scene and showed some good potential for making some great films in the future. Unfortunately Clerks was the first and last good movie he has created (with the slight exception of the Clerks Cartoon which was average).The story is about two young clerks, Dante and Randall, who are stuck in the mundane aspects of their lives and although they are obviously discontent they will not, or cannot escape this \\"Waiting for Godot\\" mentality.The story is amusing the the conversations are (pseudo)inteltually amusing.My only complaint about Clerks is how Kevin Smith changed the ending. I think the original ending was much better than the one that he finally chose for the theater. It simply was the \\"perfect\\" ending to a \\"perfect\\" day.But as Kevin Smith has proven through his later movies, he's not really a man of high ideals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The worst of the five movies to date. I found this pretty boring in the fact that nothing much happens. Even though I find the end to 'Chasing Amy' unsatisfactory, the original ending to this might have helped me in ensuring that this pap can never have a sequel.Let's face it folks nothing happens. Thank God Jay and Bob are in this to alleviate the lags of action.Key follow up question. Does everyone in the US smoke? All they seem to want to do are buy cigarettes...I'm sure that people can read any amount of subliminal psycho-analytical mumbo-jumbo into this, but hey, after university, I occasionally want to sit down and enjoy something which leads somewhere without having to go into theorising over juxtaposition, and the passage from light to lucidity.From all tragedy springs humour, in this case, only a minor yawn can be engendered.Start the series with Mallrats, and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best movie from Kevin Smith.","review":"I don't think this is bad because it is porley made,just because it's not funny.Kevin Smith wasn't being a genius here.I don't get it ,the rest of Kevin Smith's movie's are great.I think it's because he was just starting his directing career.I think the funniest person in that movie was Randall.I think it's funny that he works at the video store and never goes in,I think he was funnier in the cartoon series.I think Dontay is funny in the movie but a little to serious,but of course Brian O'Halloran has been in every Kevin Smith movie.Jay I think is the funniest part of this...comedy,he is funny in every movie he's in.Kevin Smith is not funny because he dosen't do anything but not talk and stand outside the Quick Stop.Once again it is Kevin Smith's worst movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vulgar Brilliance!","review":"Have you ever thought of what would happen if someone made an art form out of vulgarity? (In a movie, no less!) Well, Kevin Smith has done it and done it well. With witty, swear-drenched dialogue, a simple plot that most of us can relate to (who hasn't been a clerk?), and slacker characters, this is one hilarious comedy. Warning this not for the uptight, conservatives or comically challenged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Smith delivers a very true to life script","review":"Kevin Smith (Mallrats, Chasing Amy) expresses the feelings of a generation which has, up until now, been only misrepresented by MTV. His realistic dialogue, combined with characters we can all recognize from high school, presents youth culture in a way that many can relate to. Although somewhat coarse and destitute at times, Smith's movies serve as the long awaited ambassadors of College students to the rest of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"kevin smith, the vulgar truth","review":"i saw clerks and thought someone ought to speak an intelligent view about the film. with a budget of only 30,000 (give or take a little) kevin smith skillfully creates a plot that happens around the motionless existence of a jersey convience store. its not gross or even vulgar, its real. people do say things about sex, and as shocking as that may sound, sometimes they even get graphic. it should also be noted that kevin smith's message in the movie, is that only acceptence of such events like people discussing their sexual past, can lead to true understanding. when you try to hide, your girlfriend winds up having sex with a dead guy in the bathroom of the local 7-11. and in a secondary note, randle is the second coolest character ever (banky edwards, of chasing amy, is the first)."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Happy Scrappy Hero Pup~","review":"This film reached cult classic status a long time ago and, with the release of Dogma, is on the brink of becoming a mainstream movie. The direction is basic, the plot is silly, the acting is halting but the film still manages to be one of my all time favourites, why? Because of the awesome scripting. The characters seem alive and the set ups are hilarious. It is a film so filled with quotable lines that it needs to be watched weekly, in order to remind yourself of the ones you've forgotten. Oh, the acting, direction and plot might be iffy but thats only because of the financial constraints of a $30,000 budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie ever. end of discussion","review":"I think the title just about says what I need to. If you enjoy real dark humor this is it. It's worth seeing several times as you can't possibly pick it all up at once (as you won't be able to hear much of it over your own laughter). Kevin Smith is the greatest, if you liked Mallrats, buy Clerks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have!","review":"For anyone that's actually worked retail, this is an excellent choice. In some parts, it's painfully accurate; in others, it's a realization of what many wish they could do and not lose the job at which they work. (At least it was like that for me.) Upon the first viewing, it's obvious that it's low budget; but once you think about it, do you really need a budget to describe a day in the life of your average Clerk? Not really.All that aside; it's a hilarious, albeit filthy movie. Additionally the special edition is chock full o' extras, including the somewhat more depressing director's cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll like it...despite its imperfections","review":"After having seen \\"Mallrats\\" and \\"Chasing Amy\\" first, I finally found and rented \\"Clerks\\", the first installment of Kevin Smith's New Jersey trilogy. I knew beforehand that it was black-and-white and that Kevin Smith sold his comic book collection to get the film made. Knowing that, I was already impressed. Though not as outright slapstick humor-like as \\"Mallrats\\", \\"Clerks\\" is amusing...in that sickening sort of way. It is twenty-something independent film at its best...complete with actors who are not in the least \\"quintessential Hollywood\\" (and never will be). It took me a second viewing of it to appreciate it as I do now. Don't let its drawbacks detract you from renting or buying this movie. You'll find yourself loving it without even knowing a valid reason why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but not a great DVD","review":"My first viewing of \\"Clerks\\" was in a movie theatre, and I laughed so hard that I didn't even notice how bad it looked. It was made for $27000 and it shows. I think it's a great film and that homemade quality adds appeal, but it looks particularly cheesy on DVD. My main reason for giving this a mediocre 2 stars is the quality of the extras. The deleted scenes are just stuck on the disc, and the commentary track by Kevin Smith and cohorts is poorly recorded and for the most part uninsightful. It's funny in parts - particularly enjoyed hearing Smith belch and hiccup, and Jason Mewes snore - but really not for the reasons you'd expect. Still, I'd say buy the DVD if it weren't so damn expensive. The film cost about a nickel to make, and not much more was put into producing the DVD extras. This just isn't worth the money. IF you must own \\"Clerks,\\" get the VHS version or wait for the price to come down on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"extra cheesy","review":"Sorry. I did not like this movie at all. Most of the dialogue sounded very scripted and contrived... reminded me of a high school play. Since when do customers go into a store and say 'a pack of cigarettes, please'. Quite frankly, I was bored through most of this film. I realize that this movie was made on a shoestring budget but the camera work was pretty lousy like there was a single camera used or something. Probably the only redeeming value of the movie is the modern-ish soundtrack and the fact that it was filmed in black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"SJ's Review of Clerks","review":"For anyone interested in side-splitting comedy, Clerks is the movie for you. However, there is one fatal editing error in the movie that no one thus far has noticed except me.

Unique, Original, Funny!","review":"Give my regards to Jay and Silent Bob! Kevin Smith is by far one of the most original writer/directors in our Post-modern, Palm Pilot, Cell phone Society. The trials and tribulations of some of the most inconspicuous drone workers of our times ('some' being clerks everywhere) are thoughtfully and hilariously revealed as more than just a worker, but a WORKING CLASS HERO! Smith also has a amazing knack of rediculling society in all it's obvious folly. He proved this also in 'Dogma' by poking fun at, OH NO, HEAVENS, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, and before that 'CLERKS'. Smith is a pop culture treasure and 'CLERKS' years after its modest release proves to audiences today just how good Smith is. A wonderful movie, especially if you have some friends to watch it with, 'CLERKS' will have you treating our respectable gas-n-stop friends and video store jerks as far more than clerks, but ALL-AMERICAN CLERKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"Anyone who's ever dealt with customers can appreciate this one.

Whether hosting a celebration for a stuffed dog who has never had a birthday party, enjoying a sports challenge to win homemade trophies, or sailing down the river in homemade boats, the stuffed toys are filled with personality, caring, and humor. One of my favorite parts? There is absolutely nothing scary in any of these stories. Another plus: You can choose to play one of the ten-minute stories at a time, a set of three for a half-hour show, or all six.

Whereas some Black Christian-oriented novels have struck me as cliche'd, contrived or over-simplistic, Stimpson's work flows naturally, and is inhabited by complex, nuanced, genuine characters. Her writing is skilled without being ostentatious-- it is warm, inviting, and familiar... like her characters, their relationships, and their dialogue. Stimpson is a VERY gifted writer and observer of human nature and interpersonal dynamics. She portrays relationships, faith, and the individual's Christian faith journey in a way that does not deny or gloss over the ambiguities, challenges, failures, and complications that characterize our lives-- and the lives she narrates still manage, like our flawed lives and testimonies, to give unhindered glory to God. \\"Divas\\" was a PLEASURE to read, and actually helped me gain insight into some of my own relationships.

The two books that we read every year are \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" and \\"Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree.\\" I remember, as a child, believing that the magical world of Mr. Willowby was real, and I couldn't wait to live in it, through the book. That tradition continues today. I still have my original copy, and have purchased the book for my son and all of my nieces and nephews. Although, I've been able to recite the book word for word for 30 years, I still point all of the pictures out to the kids, who love the story as much as I do. I highly recommend this tradition to you, and hope that your family enjoys it as much as ours.

When I became a mother, I would borrow my mom's copy to read to my kids every Christmas eve. A few years ago I found this edition and ordered copies for myself and one for my brother. Every year my kids have taken a copy to school to read to their class, and now that my eldest daughter is in High School, she gathers her younger sisters on her lap to read it to them every year. They even asked to have a copy of it in their Christmas photo last year!An excellent tale of sharing, caring and reusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful classic","review":"Reading this book each Christmas has become a tradition for our family and everyone we have given it to. I have been reading this story to my children for 8 years. They are now twelve years old and still enjoy it. The illustrations are wonderful and the story has a great upbeat rhythm.

I bought it immediately. It became part of our Christmas tradition. The story is all about sharing. As the treetops continue to get chopped off and shared, even a small child can appreciate that sharing creates enough for everyone. With the cozy, rhyming text, and the charming graphics, this book would be a perfect gift for children of all ages. Today I purchased another copy for my 7 year old granddaughter. She enjoys reading my copy. Mr. Willowby still has the same appeal for kids today. That's a true classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that simply must be in your collection!","review":"Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree is one of those books that simply must be in your home collection -- borrowing it from the library just isn't good enough. The book tells a cute story that starts with rich old Mr. Willowby having his huge Christmas tree delivered to his house only to find that it's a bit too tall. The solution: chop off the top of course! The top finds a new home only there it is too tall once again so off goes more top and so on and so on. The illustrations are very well done and the words flow so well that my 5 year old can nearly recite the entire story. A great companion to 'Twas The Night Before Christmas. I've given this book as a gift several times and always found it to be a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent novel","review":"This was the second John Mac novel I've read and this one was better than the first. The first was one of his later novels. Soft Touch was written in 1958, so it is one of his earliest. The storyline and writing are very precise. It contains original ideas, creative characters and an interesting plot--overall entertaining. Also contains a good amount of humor which is a trait of MacDonald's. It doesn't get 5 stars because there are parts of the book which are dry--but not many. I'm looking forward to reading another of his novels; it'll probably be an earlier one. I'm discovering MacDonald late. But I'm glad I discovered him. I highly recommend this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A contemporary American tragedy that draws you in.","review":"McTeague is a tragedy, though not quite on par with the Greek and Shakespearean tragedies, is certainly worthy of praise. The author does a splendid job of vibrantly describing settings and characters. The characters are ones that you feel for and sympathize with as they all have their own tragic situations. Norris takes you through a rollercoaster as the characters in the book each have their highs and lows. Ultimately, McTeague, is more than just a story about mid-19th century California, but rather of the darker side of man himself. The evil qualities of man, such as lust and greed, are depicted in the book as well as the consequences of such qualities. Although McTeague starts of slowly at first, the novel sucks you in quickly and doesn't let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"just my opinion...","review":"At first glance I thought McTeague was going to be a relatively boring read. However, as I progressed through the novel I found myself enjoying it and I discarded my initial thoughts about the book.McTeague is actually a brilliant, little, fiction story about the innate savagery of mankind. In the novel, McTeague is large, and seemingly harmless, man. McTeague's docile qualities are slowly shed throughout the novel and his underlying, predominant atavistic qualities and behaviors take hold.One of the great things about this fiction novel is that it was derived from a non-fiction event. In the back of the novel there is an in-depth depiction of the events in which the ideas from McTeague were taken from. For those who seek to delve deeper into the novel, there is also a section of criticisms and lots of other useful and interesting discussions in the back of the book.All in all, I enjoyed reading this novel and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable, naturalistic novel.","review":"This book was very repetitive and predictable that it seemed to continue forever. I would not have finished the book except I was forced to take reading quizzes everyday in AP English. It was evident from the description of McTeague in the first few chapters that he was going to murder someone with his enormous strength. I was relieved when he finally met Marcus in the middle of the desert because it was obvious two hundred pages earlier that McTeague was going to kill him, and as soon as they met in Death Valley I knew the book was finally over"},{"rating":"1","title":"To quote the Beatles \\"It's a dirty story of a dirty man...\\"","review":"I read this book several years ago, and i don't look back to it as one of the books that i really enjoyed. Sure, if you want to prove a point that people and society are evil, then you could probably use this book. The characters have no redeeming qualities to them, and so when their lives slide into ruin, you can maybe feel sorry for them, but you aren't torn up that such bad things happened to them. Life is a lot better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tea: I think the few sips I've had are enough","review":"Overall, I bought this book from a recommendation from another author, and because its allegedly a \\"classic\\".I started reading the story, about a dentist practicing in San Francisco, California in the late 1800's. I found myself completely at a loss as to what the purpose of the story was, added to a complete disconnection or interest in the main character. I plain, just didn't get it, not in any way, shape or form.I was looking forward to reading this book because I thought it would be really good, an enjoyable read. It was a major let down, for me, and so bad I couldn't finish the book after about forty pages.Maybe if I had been alive in 1899, I would have loved it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinking about this book sends a chill down my spine!","review":"I had to read this book for one of English classes in high school. I like most literature, but I have to say that I think Mcteague is a very, insignificantly strange, messed up piece of literature. That's all I wanted to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A commentary on Greed","review":"Mcteague, a novel by Frank Norris, is a book which shows how greed can destroy a person's life. Hardworking Mcteague suddenly comes into som money when his wife wins the lottery. He thiks this is cause to celebrate, but he doesn't know how wrong he is. Soon, his best friend turns on him when he feels he has a legitimate claim to the money. A man named Zerkow is driven to murder when he finds that his wife may be withholding very value pottery from him. Almost everybody in the book is devastated in one way or another from their greed. This book is an excellent satire of the evils of greed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable and repetitive, but that's the point.","review":"It is true that aspects of this story are continually repeated. The repitions are vital to Norris' powerful story of the lost \\"American Dream\\". I had to read this book while in high school and I just read it again a few months ago. I would suggest that anyone who has read it once as a young person to read it again. The meaning will be greatly enhanced as you have learned about the world we are all living in."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book","review":"I liked this book it really kept me on the edge.

But this version is a big disappointment! Obviously this is a copy of a library book with the call number, the name of the library and other people's writing in it. The worst things are: it is not complete, and it is so blurring that I was not able to read it at all! I found a printing statement in the book saying that this is \\"due to the very old age and scarcity of this book\\". I really think Amazon should put this statement in the description of this book!

The 'E-Gig II' software works just as well with that unit too.

The fan is quiet and I'm happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Harder Mellencamp","review":"After the quiet, folky sounds of Big Daddy, John Mellencamp(now dropping the Cougar from his name), came back hard with WheneverWe Wanted To. On this album he combines the hard rock edge ofAmerican Fool with the socially relevant lyrics of his mid-80'salbums. \\"Get A Leg Up\\" is a hard rocker that is a distantcousin to \\"Hurts So Good\\". \\"Love &Happiness\\", \\"Crazy Ones\\", \\"Melting Pot\\" andthe title track are all excellent songs. \\"Again Tonight\\"was a single, but it doesn't work well in the album as it sounds likeit was stuck in as an afterthought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellencamp's disappointment","review":"After his best album ever (Big Daddy), Mellencamp followed it up with this waste of time. Apparently he tried to regain the hard rocking sound he had with earlier efforts (Uh Huh and American Fool), but whereas those albums had great tunes, Whenever We Wanted is just a mangle of hard guitar sounds.The opening track, \\"Love and Happiness\\" is probably memorable with its political commentary, and \\"Get a Leg Up\\" got some radio play, but the album as a whole is quite forgettable. This one and Mr. Happy Go Lucky are two Mellencamp albums I wish he hadn't made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-balanced triumph of an album","review":"For me, John Mellencamp's always been a great, straight-forward, no-nonsense songwriter, who was also capable of creating incredibly thoughtful music at the same time.\\"Whenever We Wanted\\" is a nice balance between the two - there's some great, harder-edged rock, and some more subtle material too... all of it done with heart - as you would expect.Overall, you couldn't ask for a better rock album - great performances by the band, heart-felt vocals from Mellencamp, done with complete sincerity and soul, and some great songwriting. Mellencamp's fans are his fans for one real reason: the honesty comes shining through everything he does. And his uncompromising attitude towards creating quality music (that earned him the \\"Little Bastard\\" nickname) is evident here - his stamp's clearly \\"visible\\" on every song, and it's all done with a truckload of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!

In a market of books that is over-run with testosterone and paranoia, a level-headed work written by an equally level-headed woman is a breath of fresh air. Wolfe writes of freedom of the heart, mind and body, and how it is slowly disappearing. Her suggestions on how to reclaim it, or at least slow down the process (without reverting to terrorism or running to the woods with shotguns and Spam), does my heart good.

For the bio moms of our 2 children, this is absolutely appropriate and applicable - the reason my children are mine thru adoption is BECAUSE their bio moms loved them, despite their inability to properly care for them. However, there's a page that states how the bio mom ate right and avoided medicine as soon as she knew she was pregnant. My children were adopted via children & youth - their mom's did not eat right and avoid \\"medicine\\" if you know what I mean.

The music is great and again ties into the games original feel.Perhaps the best thing that impressed me the most is the fact that the movie's ending is actually the beginning of the game. If the series holds true, Zone of Enders will be a must have for any anime fan.I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 due to the length issue. I was just begging for more.

Although they succeeded in removing most of the snap and crackle of the original 78s, the resulting sound quality is flat and lifeless. I suppose Columbia was aiming this product at a general listening audience as opposed to a dedicated afficionado of oldie jazz. Perhaps Columbia reasoned that the average listener would find the surface noise distracting. But this music should sound better than it does in Columbia's presentation of it. Yes it sounds clean, but it also sounds dull. There's no bloom on the trumpet tone!JSP's (much cheaper) issue of this wonderful music is also available on Amazon.

JSP doesn't have a big book or great photos, but its liner notes are incredibly informative about the music. The essays in this box seem more intent upon endlessly emphasizing that this music is great art. (I know that already!) If you're relatively new to listening to older jazz, the JPS remastering will show you just how good recordings from the 1920s can sound.

My personal friend (a fellow doctor) had an NDE and had specifically asked about her Catholicism. The spirits around her found her query amusing and explained that there IS on one \\"true\\" religion (the nature of her query), that almost all religions miss the point, and it all is about LOVE.She is now strong in her belief in God, her confidence in a loving and wonderful after life for ALL persons, she is now strongly pro-choice and is strongly in support of gay rights.

So little time.","review":"For a horror movie, this was not actually a good one. It does have a twist ending, but the tagline well tell you it all. A group of students at Westlake Prepschool loves to lie to people, and they make a little game out of it. When the students hear about a girl getting murdered in the nearby woods, they make a game out of it, convincing that their is a serial killer is on the loose.Not much gore, but blood, but not much blood. The thing that annoyed me about this film was the use of technology. All of the friends, room mates, killer, teachers, use instant messagine, and that's how they all die. A girl runs in the woods, and hides - she gets dialed by the killer, and she gets screwed as a bullet gets shot into her head. Real smart, she could've called the police.This movie has a body count of 2, people dying with a bullet. The ending was stupid, but smart in a lie-lie way. Movie is okay, could've been better.

Was he really that hard up for work to appear in this movie? And it took me most of the movie to realize Jon Bon Jovi was in it.Save your money.

If you watch this movie and figure out the ending early in the movie you have watched too many horror movies just like me. I liked the premise of this movie from the first time I saw the trailer and spots on tv.

Supernatural fans may also want to see it for Jared Padalecki as Morris' room-mate who is also in on the prank.

The film centres around a group of school friends who love to play games with each other realising that someone is no longer playing fair or at all, for that matter.

The story takes a few turns and ends no better than it begins, in the vein of \\"twist ending\\" suspense films. Cry wolf is neither scary nor gory - and there is certainly nothing \\"Unrated\\" about the movie or this DVD edition. No nudity, gore or cursing...

The greatest moment though comes at the end when Gary Cole speaks using a VERY poor English accent, it's quite laughable. Oh, the plot of the movie.

That is a good horror movie. . i know the unrated but it doesnt do much to be unrated. the so called killing parts did not even look that good. all i know is that do not waste 3-8 bucks to rent this. you can wait 2 years until it airs on regular tv.

Basically, the plot is thin, like in most teen \\"horror\\" movies, in this one we have a mask killer with a knife, everyone suspects everyone else of being the killer, when really all there is in this movie, is a bunch of idiotic teenagers deciding to play a joke on the school, by making up a wild story of a killer called \\"the wolf\\", and how he killed all these teens on Halloween.When in reality, there is no killer, their prank backfires, and an innocent man actually does get killed at the very end. (There is a slight twist at the very end, that I'm not going to reveal). Overall, I was bored halfway through the movie, and its not actually a horror movie, but more of a guessing game, mystery movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry_Help","review":"At first it was the advertisements that gave me an encouragement to see this film. So I did. These advertisements were completely false. It opens up with a young girl running from an unknown killer leading her to her death. Ok..it does start off a little promising, but leading to scenery of bad acting, and useless dialogue. It was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. It doesnt even come close to a scary movie. I have noticed how people have said that horror does not need violence to entertain, which I totaly agree with. But for god sake, it needs something. This has nothing. With one of the most rediculous, rubbish endings I have ever seen in a long time.

If this was meant to cater to twenty-somethings, I might have been disappointed, but it's supposed to be for teenagers so I pretty much knew what to expect upon entering (not quite sure why others seem surprised). The camera work was fantastic, acting was pretty good (especially the kid that played Owen) if perhaps a little over-done at times, and the story line had a few twists. I will take my little brother to see this and be comfortable, and he will love it (as did the other teens in the theater).

We cannot pour a liquid out of it without dripping liquid all over the floor or counter. For every glass poured you have to get the kitchen towel or a paper towel. Regardless if it is me, my wife or my 12 y.o. son pouring, it always seems to drip and require cleanup.Also, the ice holder we got rid of into the recycling bin soon after getting the kit and the stirring stick broke in half after the first two months. Also because of the shape it is a little harder to clean too.A lass pitcher shouldn't be that difficult. It is a simple implement that you need to mix in, pour from and store in the fridge.

It feels like it would take a pretty big fall to really do damage to this thing.It's very easy to clean, the glass is attractive, and the shape is perfect for its usage.

Anyone who actually has success with this thing, please post a video review because I have to see it to believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Although this pitcher is a good idea in theory, it doesn't perform well. The ice tube takes up a lot of space in the pitcher only allowing for about 7 cups or 56 ounces of liquid.

I was also surprised that it was made in Italy (not China)! The pitcher is dishwasher-safe but the tube has a small sign indicating that it is not. My only wish is that the lid covers the spout so that the contents won't absorb odors in the fridge. There are pitchers with lids that you turn to open/close the spout.

The combination of retro and modern definitely skews more towards the 'retro' side (as you can hear on \\"Disco Bus\\"), but that's part of the album's charm. The vocal bits that pepper \\"Disclix\\" help the acid build to those woodwind flourishes.

Usually I use a very heavy cream or something like Vaseline to keep my skin in somewhat good condition, but in the summer these can be sticky and uncomfortable and I always have a sneaking suspicion that bugs are going to stick to my legs. Complex 15 is very light and absorbant, but it still moisturizes very well. It's a little thin for the very worst of my rashes, where the skin is already cracked and thickened, but for the rest of my body I think it works really well. I don't feel sticky at all, and it's non-irritating so I can put more on throughout the day. It's also light enough to use on my face. It absorbs quickly, so I don't have to wait long to add sunscreen. All in all, it's the best thing I've found for overall skin moisturizing for my eczema in the summertime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I ordered this lotion because a friend said it was fantastic. I have really sensitive skin. It burned and itched my face. I had to wash it off right away.,so I use it on my hands. Not very good moisturizer. My hands were dry again after a few minutes.

It didn't happen over night, but it did happen, this is the best I have ever tried and I have tried so many lotions, one of the best things about it is the way it absorbs into the skin, and there is absolutely no greasy or oily feeling, my elbows are just as smooth as the rest of me, I can't say enough about this product, if you try it do commit to a whole bottle, it took time for your skin to get in bad shape and it will take some time to get it in good shape, but my skin everywhere is as smooth and silky as a child's, and no fragrance is a plus, I urge anybody with dry skin or scaly cracked areas to try this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I've gone through many moisturizers over the years... I could use a new brand for a few months, but would end up with dry itchy patches around the base of my face, and neck, and red patches under my eyes. (Weird... I know...)

I wish they made a version for the rest of my body!Try it... you will LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The battle wages on...","review":"I ordered Complex 15 because someone recommended it to address my ongoing battle with acne and rosacia. After 3 weeks, I can see improvement with both areas. Also, it is great for after shaving. It does seem to have a magic touch for soothing most of the issues I encounter with my problem skin. It is nice to have one go to product. While the Rosacia seems managed, the acne is still a problem. The Complex 15 has reduced the large breakouts, and now it is smaller.

With this watch you are pretty much set up for life. Another good thing is the battery, no need to replace it. It's always charged as long as you have it in the light at least once every 6 months, perhaps even longer. It is really comfortable to wear, this is why i choose the leather band instead of metal band. I just like the leather feel on my hand. Some of the other extra features allow you to set up your watch to operate at different time zone, it's especially useful if you travel a lot, that means you can always keep time zone where you live and just adjust time zone wherever you fly into.

It ticks inbetween the second markers instead directly on the marks. Other than these small comlaints its totally worth it.Oh, and I only rated it 4 stars out of 5 is because I live in a state where I don't get a whole lot of sun. It's a mistake I won't be making again but I got a sweet watch out of my dumb mistake. I do put a rechargeable LED flashlight onto the dial every night and it doesn't seem to help much.

A little cheaper than I see here on Amazon. For the price I paid, I like it. I like the fact that it has an alarm. I have read other reviews about the alrm being too quiet.

Unfortunately, the Goodwin's well-chosen excerpts were the only good things from Estes' novel which was a big disappointment.*** Estes' focuses on the small town community of Bentley near Atlanta, Georgia where things move slowly and not a whole lot happens except for church gatherings and whenever trains pull into town. When WW2 comes along, you can hardly tell the difference except for the heavy-handed sermons on the merits of the war. The writing style is simplistic and very reminiscent of Reader's Digest stories, and the characters are wooden and aloof. Even the war can't provide Estes with a real plot.

The screws provided are near worthless. I have provided my own, quality screws and mounting went up alright.I gave this product 2 stars because I'm getting tired of buying junk from China, made to inferior specs. I would have chalked one breaking up to myself, but 3 out of 4 is a manufacturers defect, you simply don't have those issues with a Made in the USA screw. Home Depot saved the day.

Relatively easy to lift bicycle into and off of bracket. I probably mounted mine a little too high (about 7 feet), a foot lower would make it much easier to put bike on/off bracket. The only concern I would have is if you have kids, it seems possible that they could twist the bike off the bracket and have it fall on them.Overall a great product, that provides a simple compact storage system for one bicycle and multiple brackets can be installed to accommodate more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but the rubber coating rips after a few uses and bunches up","review":"Nice, clean-looking white bike mount to hang your bike vertically.

It is fairly easy to mount the bike. You may want to rotate the tire after mounting so the spoke is not in contact with the hook. I got 2 from Amazon for about $28 which was a good deal.

Overall this definitely the best album released in 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"good debut album nothing to gein and dig are best songs internal primates forever is awesome as well some songs are kind of long but for a new band releasing their first album it is impressive kud can sing or he can scream he is a good vocalist nothing to gein is one of my favorite songs right now it is about some guy named ed gein say mudvayne at ozzfest they ruled picture of mudvayne with face paint and blood will anger and scare your parents and little kids my mom found them disgusting i think they look cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather sell insurance and listen to Yanni","review":"I am completely serious. Music like this makes me want to dry heave and look in the mirror at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me, but what is this garbage?","review":"Add another band to the trend metal list. Mudvayne is allready in the same league as Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Korn, P.O.D., and all the other recent bands everyone is jumping on the bandwagon for. If the cookie monster singing isn't enough, the music itself isn't anything not allready done before. They're not exactly geniuses in the songwriting department, but \\"Death Blooms\\" is an actual good song, and its no surprise it got released as a single. Seeing the makeup and getups that the band members wear makes me laugh a lot too, and what gets me is the kids think that this is hardcore, that this is metal, and it's not, it's all been done before, and done a lot better. Don't believe me?, then go listen to older Slayer or Morbid Angel or Nile and you'll see what I mean. Than again, if you need a coaster to put your drink on, then by all means by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its nu-metal people.","review":"I hate nu-metal and any band that plays that kind of music? Does not have any talent... I've heard mudvayne's music and it sounds like everything else or even worse. There's not diference or originality but un-original, slipknot clones and they try to copy tool too. I wish some kid that loves this genre, could explain to me whats so appealing about nu-metal ? It all sounds the same. Anyways, mudvayne's \\"ld 50\\" is a let down and plus sounds unoriginal,boring,every song sounds the same,annoying bass, and, weak drummer. Why bother with mediocre music when you can actullie, listing to actual music? With actual talent? Dont bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When is nu metal gonna die?","review":"I'm getting very tired of these whiny 30 year olds with makeup and/or masks saying how their parents abused them, and with such horrible music behind it. If you want real metal, go listen to Soundgarden, or better yet, Black Sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE TALENTLESS NUMETAL GARBAGE!!!!","review":"This album not is comparable to Slipknot but its pretty much the same exact band. Only non musicians and kids can possible think these guys have talent. There absolutley no structure in the song writing. The lyrics might b \\"deep\\" but theyre just random words with no ryme or reason. Typical new metal garbage is right they re all the same. Its a disgrace that this style is even called metal its not its pop with screamed lyrics , metal is about emotion and musicianship which this has neither of. And to even dare say that the bass player is liek les claypool is pure filth, there less than zero similarities."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This is just rubbish, these musicians (in the loosest sense of the word)are just abslolute talentless. every instrument is pathetic and the singing is about as enjoyable as washing ... with a cheese grater. why is this music called metal. its just as bad as slipknot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original","review":"If you are looking for something that is cookie cutter, than don't bother. But if orginality is key then this album is full of it. This quartet provides some of the most thought provoking, emotional music without being over bearing. The amount of musician ship on this album exceeds that of most others. Creative riffing along with oddtime feel and complex arrangements help to creat a powerful atmosphere of metal madness. Backing this madness is vocalist Chud, who carries an unbelievable range, in both screaming and melodic spectrums. I walked away from this album feeling as though I had experienced something new, which was an experience close to that when KoRn first hit the scene. This album is a must for any fan of metal or solidly writen music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Please MTV dont play these guys anymore. They suck. You all think they are like \\"New\\" slipknot, but they suck. Buy some Spineshank or Nothingface instead of this. The only good song is Severed and Dig. I cant believe i wasted my money on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud isn't Talent","review":"There is nothing progressive about downtuned power chord riffing coupled with ferocious growling. There is nothing metal about clean riffing coupled with emo-reminiscent vocals. And putting the two together is ugly, especially when mixed with several short tracks of irrelevant noise. This in a sense, is LD50.Mudvayne has only mixed up their generic numetal formula with the inclusion of a downtuned slap bassist. This does, without argument, create a clever sound and a bit of a groove, but does little to save the songs. The vocals are either weakly sung, or loudly roared. The lyrics aren't memorable in the slightest. The riffs are unoriginal, no matter how heavy, and the drumming is generic. Dig is the spotlight on this album, but loses its luster by the uninspired songs after it that sound similar. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Nothing","review":"Im sure all the little Kiddies and 12-13 year old Teeny Boppers will think its cool to have Mudvayne in their collection. But this CD just sucks. The music has no melody in it, except for Death Blooms. The rest is just awful music, with the only good instrument being the Bass. The singer is horrible, only when he sings it sounds descent. So what if they're on MTV, these guys are just plain horrible. So if you want to be cool, buy some Nothingface, Or Machine Head, or even some Taproot, but not this.Dig and Death Blooms are the only good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, but need a more original look","review":"I have to agree with some people about this being a good debut cd, which it is, but I think that they should do something about their look. Because with the spiked hair and odd face paint, people are just going to brand them as Slipknot wannabes, which I don't think they are. And in spite of the fact that they are Slipknot's proteges, ( they were \\"discovered\\" by 6 of Slipknot), they do have a sound that is their own. Instead of being the fast, skull crushing speed metal of Slipknot, Mudvayne is somewhat more of an \\"Art\\" metal, using odd instrumental and studio sound effects, coming out to sound like old Nine Inch Nails blasting their way through the Resident Evil Mansion. So don't just dub these guys off as Slipknot wannabes, if you have the chance to listen to L.D. 50, go ahead. You may just be suprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"Mudvayne shows its interesting style on their major label debut (though this isn't their first album). They share a distinct likeness with Slipknot (not surprising since Shawn from Slipknot is an executive producer for the album), Deftones, and Tool. Lyrically, Mudvayne brings a different type of message, something that is not found in many of the bands out there today. Overall, this is a great start for a band beginning in the short-attention span of the nu-metal scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of amazing","review":"I don't think that I can say more than whats been said. But seriously if you like metal but want a little bit more than the 'mainstream' stuff has to offer, give this a try. And don't judge this CD by the bands later releases.. they're really different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST OWN","review":"Everytime I hear this cd, it brings back memories from when this album was released back in 2000. It simply blew my mind and changed my whole perspective on heavy music the first time I played it through, and five years later, it's still one of the best (if not the best) heavy records to be released. Mudvayne should have hung up the towel shortly after releasing their second album, because not only do their past two albums pale in comparison to LD50, but even their live show cant even touch the intensity they showed on stage when they were still a fresh face on the music scene. I'm just glad I was fortunate enough to see this band multiple times when they were still doing the small club scene in support of this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy ****** This is good music!!!!","review":"The first time I Heard Mudvayne was at 2:00AM and i was half awake I heard \\"DIG\\" and I woke right up. Talk about a different kind of music. These guys can go from hard metal to harmonic vocals or even a mix between. They can pull off pretty much any kind of music.And to top it all off they look horific in a good way.This CD is a must have for any true SlipKnot or rock fan for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This guys voice is amazing. Awesome higher scream, pretty good lyrics, very angry. Some crazy stuff in there. If you like slipknot you should pick this up, they go well together :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"..there are a few catchy songs on the album, DIG and -1 a lot of the songs have no structure, its just non stop screaming, Kud does have an excellent singing voice, but on their next album they should work on making the songs a little more catchy ala Dig ,"},{"rating":"2","title":"MuDvAyNe has created one of the best albums ever","review":"all i can say is this album is wonderful.its hard and fast the growling lyrics provided by Kud are amazing,bone crushing brutal guitar riffs by Greg TRibbett,thumping slap bass and great drum beats.this album turned me into a huge MuDvAyNe fan and every song is great.this cd is definately worth buying and if your not too into MuDvAyNe,buy this cd and you will instantly become a fan.So take my advice,buy this album,support MuDvAyNe,listen to it daily,and go cause anarchy"},{"rating":"1","title":"CuMsTaYnE","review":"Anyone notice how the lead singer sounds strikingly similar to Phil from PanterA? Anyway, these guys are pretty overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"for some reason people pay more attention to - reviews","review":"having bought this cd after hearing dig on the radio, i was expecting a cd full of songs like dig. i was wrong, none of the other songs sound like dig, which is a good thing because i hate dig now (too much airplay hint..hint..). Being a bassist myself the first thing i was attracted to was the bass lines in the songs. they were absolutely incredible, he has so much talent and is not afraid to make the music more interesting by using slap and pop lines kinda red hot chillipeppers style. the songs themselves are nice to listen to, they are well arranged and the time changes make them interesting to listen to. the only con to this disk would be the filler tracks which seem to be ripped off of a tool cd, but tool at least has something to it's fillers. overall great! hasn't left my cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite bands","review":"I've loved Mudvayne for a long time, even before this album hit the stores. The reason why so many people can't appreciate them is because the music goes over their heads. No, they don't play simple, one track songs. They are far more complex than that. I wouldn't really compare them to TOOL, but I think they are just as talented. Every Mudvayne song is an epic. My only complaint is that I wish Gurg would play his guitar with the same force as he did on \\"Kill I Oughta.\\" My favorite part of this CD by far is Ryan Martinie. He is a bass God. It sounds like Les Claypool stepped into a metal band. No, they're not hardcore, they're not \\"real\\" metal, but they're a great nu-metal band - their rhythm section has set a new standard for all nu-metal acts to follow. Rock on Mudvayne."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Deep Experience","review":"Let's start right off by debunking the myth that Mudvayne is just another Slipknot clone. To be honest, except for a song or two (ie-Dig), this band is a lot more reminiscent of the Deftones. The music varies from all-out assualt to a kind of soothing, dark journey into places of your psyche that are rarely visited. These are four talented and very intelligent musicians. From the name of the album referencing scientific principles of mortality to the sublime influences of \\"Christian Death\\"(Death Blooms), and the scientific explanation of psychedelics, Mudvayne are the thinking man's \\"metal\\" band. Options are explored, sometimes brutal images are created by the music but underneath it all is a harsh beauty. if you've ever seen the movie \\"American Beauty\\", you know what I mean. Even cruelty has a beauty inherent in it's own existence. If you are ready for a \\"Trip at the Brain\\" buy this CD. Definite \\"Mood\\" music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay. Im not impressed","review":"I like the song Dig from a while ago, and i do mean a while ago (october). So i got the CD then. I liked it, but not enough. I only liked 5 songs of the 12. They were Dig, Severed, Pharmaecopie, Everything and Nothing, Death Blooms, and Negative One. Plus their is also like 5 filler songs which make the album drag on, although, some songs fall right into the next. If you like Dig, i wouldnt buy this album right now, i'd go with Slipknot, Spineshank, Nothingface, or Machine Head."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is excelent","review":"I have to say that i disagree with most of the bad reviews posted by other people. I think it is excellent. It is the only CD that I have had in my CD player for over a month without putting anything else in. The singer, KuD has an amazing voice, where at one point can screem his head off like Slipknot's Corey Taylor, and at another point sound like Tool's Maynard James Keenan. All the songs on L.D. 50 are unique, and sound completely different from the next. Personal favorites of mine are \\"Dig,\\" \\"-1,\\" \\"Death Blooms,\\" \\"Cradle,\\" \\"Nothing to Gein,\\" \\"Severed,\\" and \\"Pharmaecopia,\\" just to name a few ;). Bottom line is, if you like this type of music (Speedmetal/Hardcore Rock) you will definitely like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"i don't know what \\"A music fan\\" from Wisconsin was talking about but this cd is far from worth nothing. according to him or her only two of the songs have melody, which makes me wonder if this person even listened to the whole cd. first off almost every track on here has melody, and most are very deep too, going through heavy moments to soft and back to heavy again. the vocals are also awesome going from soft singing to screaming instantly. and below all the screaming are good and mostly meaningful lyrics. this is like slipknot ( as many of the reviews say), only better and without the clown makeup. if you like heavy rock music, buy this you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"a surprise","review":"I was surprised at this album, i listen to Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, Deicide, Immortal, Marduk and other heavy stuff in that vein. People said that this band was like Slipknot, not really, Mudvayne have more of a unique sound and more talent. Some great vocals on here, variety of them. Some good double bass and some awesome rhythm riffs. Its not death or black metal but they are making heavy music sound fresh with this album, a great bwonging bass guitar sound!! Must be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVER RATED","review":"A few good songs..dig and l.d 50..the rest are [garbage]..most of the songs are just pointless screaming with no direction...kud ( the lead singer) does have a voice on him..but the majority of the songs just have no structure.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal or nu-metal? You decide.","review":"Mudvayne are very heavy, and, unlike a lot of nu-metal, are surprisingly talented. Pick it up and see what you think.Other bands that are toss-ups:Slipknot, Soulfly, Coal Chamber, Soil, Dry Kill Logic, Ill Nino (at least their first album), System Of A Down (the old one), and Static-X (to name a few)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!","review":"Please, do we need another masked metal band? This band says they were heavily influenced by Black Sabbath. Ok. First of all, Black sabbath didnt tune their guitars down to where it sounds like noisy farts. And Black sabbath didnt growl-rap. If there's one thing that i cant stand, it's rap. But growl-rap? AAAAA! And they didn't swear every other word..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude, crude.....and no goode","review":"Have you ever heard the speculation that if you leave a bunch of monkey's alone long enough with some typewriters, that eventually they'd write something like Shakespeare? Well, I think four monkeys got a hold of some guitars and drums and this CD is the result. Most of this CD sounds likes the \\"band\\" has been thrown inside of a sealed metal drum and rolled down a flight of stairs. I guess they applied their makeup while they were in the drum as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you give this 5 stars?","review":"Only the Limp Bizkit Korn Posers can actually give this band 5 stars. Because they saw them on MTV. WOW. I bought this a while ago and its horrible. The singer should be in another band, instead of this one. If you people can see, its a 3 1/2 star rating. I still dont see why this is selling good though. If you want to look cool, it wont make you, because everyone already has this CD. I guess the first real 4 songs are the ones that set the mood. The CD is weird, not heavy. If you think its heavy, download Prod, Cradle, or Everything and Nothing. The only songs that are good are -1, Dig, and Severed. The rest is either a filler track (1,6,9,12,17), or a dull, noisy song. With that said, most songs are just screaming, loud guitar, and amplified bass. No musical talent whatsoever. Another MTV sellout band that's going nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mud mud mud mud mud mud","review":"It seems that a lot of bands are taking a trip down the road of Soft with Heavy...many have tried...many have failed.. MuDvAyNe on the other hand....takes it to a new level. to say the band is good is an understatement. Songs like 'Dig' and 'Death Blooms' perfectly display a love for the heavy side. While 'Prod' and 'Severed' show a liking to the softer more slow sound. The album as a whole fits together nicely with little intermission type songs inbetween certain tracks.Great CD, a promising band....hopefully the face of Rock will change once more...leaning away from Metallica and moving into another direction completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Now, I'm not gonna argue with somebody about this Slipknot to Mudvayne crap. But I gotta say, they kinda sound like them, on Dig, they definitley sound like Slipknot. I think the drum part in Dig is probably the best part, if you listen close you can here him beatin' on the drum real fast. But, I gotta admit, they're songs are easy on guitar. I play guitar and I figured out Dig in 1 minute flat. But it's blends in with the drums. And the singers screams are probably the best screams I have heard. I think the bass comes in a lot too. In my opinion, they kinda look like Insane Clown Posse. The singer anyway. But all in all the cd is real good."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comment....its just bad","review":"Well, i bought this because of Dig, but it turns out to be the only descent song. the rest is weird. Its almost gothic. Some songs are fast, but songs like Everything and Nothing, -1, Cradle, and nothing to gein makes this a waste of money.Please, dont buy this. It's not good.Get someSnot Glassjaw Hatebreed ( real heavy) Machine Head"},{"rating":"1","title":"In response to Ashton","review":"Just because they play \\"math metal\\" like Tool does doesn't make them the master musicians that Tool is. Dream Theater also uses mathematical signature changes and I don't see any comparisons. I'll admit that the bass player is good, but as for the other musicians... well, they aren't the \\"best\\" as you claim. Check out Peter Lingrine (sp? sorry) and Mikael Akerfeld from Opeth for two amazing guitarists, and Slayers Kerry King for another amazing guitarist, Slayers Tom Araya for a better screamer, and Slayers Dave Lombardo for a better drumber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically impaired progressive mock","review":"Sad is the day when the only requirement needed to be considered technical metal is simply stating, \\"We are a technical metal band\\". This \\"music\\" is about as progressive as Limp Bizkit in reverse. To me, this band depicts a failed attempt at the once unique sound of such bands as Meshuggah, Dillinger Escape Plan (who, contrary to what Mudavayne claims in various interviews, coined the term \\"Math Metal\\", and fit this description much better), and Strapping Young Lad. The band arrogantly compares themselves to the like of Frederik Thordendal (Lead guitarist and songwriter of Meshuggah, for the metal-ly challenged). Fred could wipe his a$$ and pull off more talent than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very diverse collection of \\"math-metal\\"","review":"Mudvayne is not your typical rock band out there. They are pioneers of Math Metal.They are not a straight ahead rock band. LD 50 is a collection of songs that should appeal to most rock fans. The first non-intsrumental song Dig is the first single and is in my opinion one of the best songs on the album tied with Severed and Prod. Internal Primates is also a great song but -1 is a surprise. it starts off slow and then bulids up. If you're trying to think of how Mudvayne souns think Slipknotmixed in with the Melodicity of Tool meets Static-x. Mudvayne is a great cd. Be fore warned! This cd is not for the faint of heart! It is well derserving of it's PA label. One listen to Dig and you'll agree. By this cd is you're looking for a mind expanding experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing new metal","review":"i listened to this cd in a local store called Hot Topic and thought they were ok, but now that i bought there new cd they have become one of my favorite bands. I dont get how everybody thinks they sound like Slipknot. Maybe \\"Dig\\" sounds Slipknotish but the rest is a melodic amazing cd. The basist Rhino is amazing with great riffs hes one of my favorite basists. Kudd is an amazing singer too. My favorite songs are \\"Severed\\", \\"Death Blooms\\", \\"Minus One\\", \\"Prod\\", \\"Under My Skin\\", and \\"Now Forever\\". These people can really sing and really have musical talent. I say that this is one of the best albums ive ever heard. If you are a metal fan pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.D 50 ~MuDvAyNe","review":"AWESOME CD THAT LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE.

Most of the songs are very unique and it's not ALL screaming, I like it when he sings. He has a good singing voice, such as in \\"Death Blooms\\", and he has a good...screaming voice. The first time you listen to this you brobably will hate it, I sure did, but it grows on you every time you listen and you'll eventually love it. \\"Death Blooms\\" is by far the best track here and one of the best in the metal genre. Other god ones are \\"Dig\\", \\"Prod\\", \\"Nothing to Gein\\", and \\"-1\\". Even if you don't like heavy metal you might like this. And I don't agree that they should be compared to Slipknow whatsoever, even thought they have freaky face paintings and have the same basic kind of music. They're much, much better than Slipknot. Only reason this didn't get 5 stars by me is \\"Under My skin\\" and \\"(K)now F(orever)\\" sound [bland] and he starts rapping in Under My Skin which just sounds retarded and gives me a headache.

Now all these limp roach korn pod posers are all fans of them and its making the band look bad, so why do you people want to tell the whole world how good they are. Do you want them to be a band like Papa Roach, Bizkit, or even Korn and Pod incubus. ___ NO!the CD is pretty good, with good tracks like Severed, Nothing to Gein, and pharmaecopia. and the heavy ones, Under My Skin, Internal Primates Forever, Death Blooms, Everything and Nothing,Dig. overall, okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire","review":"More hyped up nu-metal with little style yet even less substance. This band are obviously being touted as the next Slipknot, but where as Slipknot backed up their laughable image with some of the fastest and aggressive nu-metal around, Mudvayne just churn out familiar riffs and unoriginal songs. Mudvayne are just a boy-band for metalheads and the music on L.D. 50 is just as weak, formulaic and easily marketable as your standard pop band. \`Dig' is the closest to being a decent song but the rest of the album is just bland and, surprisingly, inoffensive.

Looks like we have another entry in the \\"most unoriginal band of the year award\\"! Yay! Exucuse me while I loose my lunch all over the kitchen floor.To me, I agree with the naysayers. This band sounds like Slipknot. Infact, they so closely resemeble Slipknot, the only reason why I would not think they arent them is that they look more like ICP then they do those other guys. Slipknot, however, had one redeeming quality, \\"wait and bleed\\". These guys, nothing. From that annoying \\"dig\\" bassline, to the pulsating drums because someone realized that they can do a drum roll if they use double kick(which does not make you talented. I dont even have double kick on my drums and I know I could do it). Infact, just about everything annoys me about Mudvayne. So rather than wasting my time, I am gonna stop with the details and move on. If I want heavy agro, I'll listen to Machine Head thank you. This review is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mudvayne=wanna be heavy metal","review":"first of all, they don't have to dress all ridiculous and their songs are not even hard compared to actual heavy metal like cannibal corpse or slayer. And then, the lead singer tries to be all evil by putting fake blood all over his face and body and sorry, that doesn't prove that he's a killer or an evil group. You don't see Cannibal Corpse or Kerry King spraying all this stupid Kool-Aid all over his bald head to try to look all scary.Anyways, their song Dig and Death Blooms are the only songs that everybody hears and that is the reason they rate it a good CD. Other better bands are Metallica, Pantera, Megadeth, Slayer, Sepultura, Testament, Cannibal Corpse, Anthrax, and Limp Bizkit. Just kidding! Limp Bizkit is the worst band in the whole world.Sorry Ernesto, Mudvayne sucks and so does Drowning Pool and Disturbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHA the WORST piece of SH*T I've ever listened to!!","review":"This band.. it's SOOOO bad that makes me laught, ohhh NO musical direction , just garbage all the time, the lirycs are TERRIBLE, the instrumentals are even worst and the vocal line are the same with the instruments... maybe the WORST cd ever made... absolutely terrible band and garbage (cd), It's hard to believe that someone support this mindless garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"To tell you the truth, I was very dissapointed with this CD. I heard the single \\"Dig\\" on the radio, thinking that the band produced many songs like this. After buying the CD, I realized how 'not good' it was. One thing you'll notice is that there are many of what I have come to call \\"B.S. Songs\\" on this cd, which are tracks that are nothing more than sounds created by a synthesizer, and a waste of time and space. Even Slipknot is better than this band. The only thing good about MuDvAyNe is the interesting war paint designs, and bassist RyKnow has some neat bass lines and techniques here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what our music scene has become?","review":"Jesus Crist, I can't imagine a more horrible band. Another Kiss ripoff by wearing masks, and another Rush ripoff by using so called \\"math\\" metal. Well, Rush wasn't metal, but this Math metal is nothing more than a drummer who can't keep a straight rythym. Time changes are good, but not every 2 seconds! The singer sounds like he's having sex with a anvil. And the guitarist sounds like distorted farts. Did Black Sabbath influence them? I pray that the music scene will get better! DIG!

Still Excellent!","review":"Mudvayne brings together an edgey mix of grind metal and lyrics that can only described as smooth.

Some of the best songs are \\"Dig\\", \\"-1\\", \\"Cradle\\", \\"Nothing to gein\\", and \\"everything and nothing.\\" While this isn't thier debut album it certainly is getting them the attention they deserve. The other album, \\"kill, i bought\\" is pretty good from what I hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Metal Cd!!!","review":"Mudvayne... un-ecpected thrash metal.

For you rockers into the really heavy stuff there's Dig. For some of you out there into hard rock but not the stuff like Dig there's songs like Death Blooms, Nothing to Gein, -1, and Severed(my favorite Mudvayne song), which include both singing and yelling. Personally, I find Mudvayne an extremely talented band. I am a resonably intelligent person with a pretty good taste in music. I bought this CD because of Dig and Death Blooms and have found NUMEROUS AWESOME songs previously unknown to me throughout the CD. Trust me, this CD is more than worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Very heavy, different sounding then all of the nu-metal clones. The best rhythym section in metal. An album that actually grows on you and gets better the more you hear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations, Sony","review":"The soulless empty suits who run the major record labels strike again! In an era of degrading music, Mudvayne makes Eminem look like Vic Damone. There isn't a crumb of originality here, just a bunch of rock star wannabes in costumes screaming and plodding through death-metal riffs that were out of style 10 years ago. I'm sure the idiotic kids who will fall for this will really have their toes a-tappin' when mumsy gives them 18 bucks and they come home with this shrink-wrapped garbage. There is no truth or beauty in this product...it's not music--this is noise to plot criminal activity by. Thanks a lot, Sony. In an era of degrading music, you're just contributing to the downfall of culture. Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"slipknot (....)!","review":"This band is not original, they sound like a watered down version of slipknot. This would not necessarily be a bad thing if this album was done better. The songs are written almost lyrically like slipknot, they sound exactly like slipknot, they even look like slipknot, but lack the punch and direction of slipknot. Another problem is the songs last a tad bit too long. This would not be a problem if their songs actually had focus which they don't. At times even their best songs fizzle toward the middle or end and become flat and boring. They are good at times with initial leadins though. My suggestion buy slipknot not this. These guys could have potential if they changed their focus and tried to be original and tried to create music of their own. Avoid this album or download it from (....) This is my advice to all, take it or leave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is Music, then Videodrone is the best band","review":"god, i have never heard something more horrible than this.

If you like SlipKnot, you will not like this. SlipKnot is harder, faster, and has more style. The song Death Blooms sounds like the retarded version of (sic).These guys.... They have no assurence. If you like Dig, you wont like this. Settle for Slipknot. Plus their are only 12 songs. 5 are fillers. This band wont be anywhere in a year.If you want real metal, buy someSlipknot Spineshank Taproot Nothingface Relative Ash & DeftonesIf you already like any of those bands, dont get this.Ladies and gentleman, this is ....its horrible... dont get it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sellout MTV band","review":"Im one of those victims that saw these guys on MTV and on sales charts and figured why not? Well, Dig, a fast catchy song, was the main attraction. But it was the only good song. These guys have a mix of Loud guitar with slow, heavy beats. It has good singing and slow parts, but all of a sudden the bassist hits his guitar with a hammer and it falls apart. .... Sloppy, listen to songs like Cradle, Nothing to Gein, and Internal Primates Forever. Its horrible. Its noise for Noise. Get some real underground Nu metal other than Korn, and L Bizkit, and Papa Roach, and Coal Chamber. Like Nothingface, Finger Eleven, Spineshank, Nonpoint, or (hed) Pe. ...

Kerry King is a good guitar player but honestly his playing is too frantic to hear any notes all you can hear are a flood of noise. Yes I know he is playing notes, but playing fast doesn't make a good guitar player. and finally Tom Araya, well that's not screaming thats imitation of a little girl. You cannot understand a word he says unless you look up the lyrics, that's bad form, and I understand that is the standard for screaming in his style of music, but it just doesnt cut t he cakeYOu need to branch out and listen to music all the way, such as I havegood day"},{"rating":"2","title":"great nu-metal piece","review":"The first song I ever heard from this band was \\"dig\\".After i heard that song I bought the cd.Im happy i bought it because this cd kills!favorite tracks:track 2:dig-a seriously fast song with a tight beat and the vocals make you wanna beat something up.track 3:internal primates-excellent song that rules.track 4:-1-this is one of if not my fav songs in this album next to the next track.This song almost has some vocals in the verse that reminds me of tool.track 5:death blooms-this is an awesome song which was has an awesome video to go along with it.This song is insane,the outro is real nice and is a great way to end the song.Well l.d.50 was the perfect title for this album because it is a lethal dosage of nu-metal.buy it if you like slipnot,tool,and disturbed.Even though this cd isnt perfect though.THis album is 17 tracks long but i dont even listen to half of the tracks.Still,this is an album that all nu-metal fans should enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot's better","review":"I bought this CD after downloading Death Blooms. That song has a good contrast between beautiful singing and hardcore screaming that I admire in bands like Deftones, System of a Down, and Nothingface, so I naturaly loved it, and got LD50.What a waste of money. Mudvayne is like Slipknot, but not as aggressive, which is its downfall. While listening to Slipknot, I can feel the intensity of Cory's vocals, and the intensity of the band combining to form the ultimate angry album. This is just long, drawn out songs that have no real energy, except for Cradle and Death Blooms. Yes, there is melody, but there is too much pointless screaming to make it sound worthwhile. Mudvayne has nothing Slipknot doens't have in heaviness, and is inferior to Nothingface in the soft department.Instead of buying this, download Death Blooms and Cradle. If you need a CD like this, get Violence by Nothingface, or System of a Down's self-titled album. Those are two great metal albums that I enjoy listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mudvayne.........hmmm...","review":"I thought this cd was very weird. I like alot of the songs on this cd but some were just weird and boring.

These guys did everything right: they wrote great songs, they play an awesome live show, they got connections (Slipknot), and they utilized their talent to the fullest extent. If you thought that Slipknot's success was rightfully earned, you should take a listen to Mudvayne. These guys blow Slipknot way off the map!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mainstream Metal on the way from mudvayne","review":"If you are into all the new mainstream metal bands out there (slipknot, korn, linkin park, etc.) will love this album. This band blows every other nu-metal band out of the water. With a crazy lead singer, pounding double bass from the drums, strange guitar and bass riffs, you will be screaming for more. Check out songs like -1, death blooms, dig, and cradle and you will know what i mean. Mudvayne is often compared to slipknot, but after listening to this record, slipknot should be compared to mudvayne. ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant really get into these guys","review":"these guys are pure noise. they rip off of Tool and Slipknot. Okay. Call these guys original? wtf? Then, i see them on mTV, okay, now everyone likes them. Bad. Whats a good song? Dig, because its the only one you've heard and you dont know a thing about music. So you buy the CD so it makes you look cool, only problem, when everyone has it, its WONT make you look cool. Its horrible. Dig is nice and fast. the only songs that are actually in the style of Dig are Internal Primates Forever, and Under My Skin. The rest is slow, and copying off tool. Songs like Prod, Everything and Nothing, Cradle suck. and not to mention 5 of the tracks are fillers. Bad CD, save your money for Spineshank.

They played Dig, Internal Primates Forever, -1, Under My Skin, and Cradle. I bought the CD and i found that the only good songs were Dig, Internal Primates Forever, Death Blooms, Severed, and Know Forever. The rest didn't live up to the live versions. Also, i hoped this band would have been harder. That way, this CD wouldnt be bought by a bunch of Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit posers. Who will later, put them on TRL, and make all the original fans of this band get mad because they sold out. So, actually, i like this band a lot, just dont make them sound so good, because then EVERYONE, (including Carson Daly) will want a piece of them.

Personally, I don't care what kind of metal it is as long as its good. I agree that many nu metal bands out there do kinda suck because they're too simple. This one, however, is the good kind of nu metal. It is a cut above the nu metal bands that are ridiculed most (they are a hell of a lot better than Linkin Park). They have talent without a doubt, and it shows very quickly. Dig is a really awesome song, and even so it is still definately not the best one. I like all of the actual songs a lot (I find the interludes boring, the CD could do without them).

The only songs that actually sounded good wereInternal Primates Forever, -1, and uNder my SkiN. The rest was bad. Dig is all screaming, and could have been a little bit more melodic.

Having gone through all of the seasons, Jack is like a member of the family, and you can tell the emotions he's going through as he lives through the days in these seasons. Kiefer is the man, pure and simple. Carlos Bernard as Tony, great in the first two seasons also, is really great in this season.

God Lord.... this individual has yet to make one single responsible, mature decision, utter a single sentence that makes sense or do anything but make a total joke of herself. It wastes valuable air time on this show having to deal with her. Somebody pull the rug from her feet and let her actions cause her timely death.Yikes, no more seasons for me... I just can't take it anymore. I also think the script writers went on permanent vacation, because you know exactly what each character is about to say at any given time.

The movie is good, but this book is better. This is pretty much an existential western, our hero a man confronted with living up to a code which even he knows is phony and impossible to sustain, and those who love him trying to make it possible for someone, anyone, to live their life truly. Unfortunately, when the hero knows this is happening, conflict ensues.

I was simply awed by the writing of Mr Hall, and the universal human truths he reminds the reader of. I can see that more than a few writers must have read Oakley Hall's novels, most especially Cormac Mccarthy. Warlock was published in 1958, and Badlands was at least 10 yrs later, followed by Apaches, which was at least another decade later. Mr Hall also does the fine Ambrose Bierce series of novels, and with a career spanning 5 decades, he is still underated and underapreciated by the general public. do yourself a favor and discover this most excellent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warlock","review":"still waiting on shipment of book,as of 2-16-13, we have not recieved it.

It feels very nice and looks rather snazzy. The earphones are comfortable and produce a great sound as do the extra earbuds that come with it. There is an extra bass-boost button that adds full resonance to the sound. And you even get small speakers. What a deal for the money!

Burzum's music has always been of higher artistic standard than anything within the original genre, and it continues this way. \\"Daui Baldrs\\" was already way beyond what most metallers could take, and this is possibly even more so. The sound is better, deeper, but makes it more difficult to absorb the nuances of the music - these are few due to the simplistic character of composition, but fundamental for an understanding of each piece.Since the last offering, Vikernes has left the anger of metal completely. His quest now is to guide his people to a brighter future through a new context, based in pre-Christian myth and psychology. This, Burzum's second electronically pure album, benefits from its keyboard simplicity to build emotion and create something greater - higher - much in the vein of Chopin's piano-centric ventures.Yet another masterpiece, and his final."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This, although not black metal, is one of the best albums done by an artist who primarily writes black metal.

I only read the book because I saw it available through a library.

I have successfully used this book in my voice studio. The response from my voice students is always \\"A-ha! NOW I understand!\\" And this is the premise of Body Mapping explained in this book: we move according to how we THINK we are constructed, not how we actually ARE constructed. By correcting our Body Maps, we then understand how we actually ARE constructed. Correcting our Body Map is easily and quickly achieved with this book, and then our movement as we perform and our perception of our movement become free and fluid, yet also lively and vibrant."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!

It's essentially a picture book with incredibly weak explanations. I should go into more detail about why this book is weak, but it has been awhile since I have used it and I rarely look through it after my first few experiences reading it. \\"How to Learn\\" is better overall and the preferred book, but has some seriously poor writing within it.

Most pages include text that (1) exhorts you to be loose in the joint being discussed and (2) tells you to congratulate yourself if you are. Unfortunately, that's as far as it gets. There's no guidance on how to measure or improve. For that, you're referred elsewhere.I'm not sure of the target audience...

With their blend of Rock, Pop, and a dash of psychology, they climbed all the way to the top.The 1992 Greatest Hits Album, Tears Roll Down, was the very first reflection of Tears For Fears classic songs. The songs are strong and enduring as you could ever expect from them. Each song tells a \\"Freudian\\" kind of story that still keeps acting like several therapy sessions. From Shout, to Head Over Heels, and their biggest hit, Everybody Wants To Rule The World, each song still as authentic as it was originally released back in the late 80's.Although Tears For Fears never regained their exposure, every song is truly worth the listen to, and that is still no reason to shout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Collection Of Well-Crafted Songs","review":"All in all, this is a worthy greatest hits package. I've never been a real large fan of this group, but I do have to admit that they knew how to write some good songs. \\"Advice for the Young at Heart,\\" would have to be my favorite song. They should've left off two or three songs on this package though; the songs don't sound like hits and are prosaic.

The band consisted of two men: Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.Their crisp pop/rock hippy-ish tunes and stadium rockers cemented the band's position on the charts and their status in rock history.Although many consider Tears For Fears a nostalgic act that was begging to vanish away; their classics cannot be denied: the Beatlesque Sowing The Seeds Of Love, the anthemic mega hit Everybody Wants To Rule The World, the mellow Woman In Chains, the stadium rockers and fan favorites Shout and Head Over Heals, the elusive Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down), and the groovy Mothers Talk.Even though the band are not as big as they used to be, shed no tears for Tears For Fears, their best 80's music is timeless and it's all here on Tears Roll Down.RecommendedB-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears For Fears","review":"This item came on time and was packaged safely.

The chairs are as slick as they look in the pictures. The leather is also conducive to wipe-downs after encounters with eating children.

My wife even stood on one to reach a cabinet, although I wold not recommend that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Chairs","review":"We were shopping for this modern look chair that would go with our rustic wood table for a while.

They are stylish as they are comfortable. The upholstery has a nice feel to it - it is made of regenerated leather. I found out that regenerated leather is made of real leather which is ground up and mixed with latex and then processed into sheets. The result is a very leather like feel without the natural imperfections of a real animal hide. These chairs definitely feel like high quality natural leather.They were very easy to assemble. The seats attach to the chrome frame with three screws on the front. The chairs are very sturdy and have a nice weight to them. It's too bad that they are only sold in sets of four because I like them enough to buy two more chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italmodern Gracy Leather Chair","review":"I took a chance and bought these chairs based on just the picture and the few reviews.

It was Casablanca, Kiss's label, so the songs are a mixture of awesome Angel originals and a few pale Kiss imitations. Despite that, it's still a pretty good outing by Angel. They were really more a prog rock outfit than a stadium metal band. I think they fell through the cracks between the two genres and never got the recognition they deserved. I agree with those who made Kansas, Styx and Queen comparisons, but there's even some ELO influence on a song or two (Flying with Broken Wings). A weird mixture of influences on White Hot, but definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cold","review":"Kiss in heavenly white satin, but without their parent group's innate humor or pure rock savy. Zappa's hysterically funny parody of this band in \\"Punky's Whips\\" says just about everything you need to know about Angel. At best, they're an amusing footnote in the history of rock 'n' roll. Even the best studio production can't disguise the group's most greivous faults on White Hot: moronic lyrics, uninspired riffing, and a general lack of both humor and humility. If there were a system which included a 0 star rating, Angel would surely deserve it--if only because they're at least partially responsible for the androgynous hairmetal dross that came after them, including such rock \\"heavyweights\\" as Poison and Brittany Fox. Epitomizes the worst excesses of 70s cockrock fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"SINFUL","review":"Another great dose of Rock and Roll from Angel. After some positive reaction to ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN, this was the release that was supposed to put Angel in the lime light. Despite how good the disc was, though, that success didn't follow them with airplay or sales. There are very few bands with more talent than Angel. Fortunately for the listener most of their material is available on CD and at a budget price.My favorite cut from this disc is \\"Flying With Broken Wings\\". Other tracks that showcase the bands talents are \\"Don't leave Me Lonely\\", \\"Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\", \\"Got Love if You Want It\\", and \\"\\"Hold Me, Squeeze Me\\". Most of the tracks are more commercial than songs from the first two albums, but this was suppposed to be the big push in their careers that just didn't pan out. But, how can you argue with such a respectably priced piece of rock history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated band ever.","review":"I agree with the reviewer that would give all of their albums 5 stars (Sinful only gets 4) so I must be biased too. I bought White Hot when it first came out when I was 10. I rocked out to it constantly and it ended up being one of my favorite albums of all time. It still is. I'm now middle aged and I still rock out to it and always will. I saw them live back in 1978 and I still have memories of what a terrific concert it was. I never understood why they didn't get extremely popular. I want to thank them for all of the great music and the hard work that they put into it. There are those of us that appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that 'got away'","review":"Angel switched bass players for this album, and gone were the semi-annoying high-pitched background singing the former 4-stringer offered up...here, we have a more talented player, and more balanced singing, even tho the harder rock/metal elements were toned down a bit...however, this album contains some of Angel's finest moments...one of their most over-looked songs is here in the form of 'You Could Lose Me' - and 'The Winter Song' (later re-made into 'The Christmas Song' for a holiday offering from the guys) is just magic. Want some 70's rock bombast? Try 'Got Love If You Want It,' which is even better in concert. Great stuff. And Barry Brandt just beat the crap out of his drums...every serious collector of 70's 'arena' rock needs this album, along with 'Sinful' and 'On Earth As It Is In Heaven.' Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic white hot band!","review":"Angel was one of the mostunderrated melodic hard rockbands but because of the imagethey were ignored by media &radio because of KISS i think.The music was good but i knowsome people who hated it. Iloved it. This album is oneof the best with a classichard/pop rock sound. Theband was great all beinggreat players. I think morepeople should give them achance and check out thismusic. I would start here.Very very good rock n roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reviewers have it right.. stay away","review":"I was given this book as a gift and even after reading these reviews I gave it a shot since I like the premise. I tried to get into it but I just couldnt. The reviewers are right. There is just too much unnecessary round table discussions about useless stuff and it really gets old. Please pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unputdownable... yeah right","review":"The blurb says it is an unputdownable read. The only way this is true is if it was glued to your hands. Even then I would be tempted to get out a saw. Chapter 6 ends on a boat. Chapter 7 acts like it is in continuity but they are all of a sudden in a helicopter?????? Gave up after chapter 8. By and large one of my worst purchases ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only barely finished this one","review":"This book is completely ridiculous. I really like the ideas of what happened to Atlantis, but beyond that, the book had its head in the clouds. The author spent pages and pages of each chapter describing technical mumbo-jumbo that was impossible to understand and didn't contribute to the novel. But probably my biggest problem was that the main characters lived to the end! They should have been dead half-way through the book, but apparently disarming a warhead, sinking to the bottom of the ocean, being shot, running out of oxygen, being fired at with missiles, jumping out of flaming helicopters, being attacked by a tiny submarine, and escaping a terrorist prison are all just in a day's work for these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring it made me angry","review":"I had read some of the negative reviews about this book, but it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a chance anyway. I made it about halfway through before I gave up, angry for having wasted time and money on it. And I almost never give up on novels.The premise is interesting, but instead of telling the story, Gibbins wastes too much time on irrelevant technical details. Gibbins clearly knows what he's writing about and has some good ideas, but he doesn't know how to tell a story. This is the most boring novel I can remember. It kept my interest for about 100 pages. After another 80 pages or so I was hoping the pace would pick up and halfway through I gave up. In fact, because I sometimes suffer from insomnia, I tried to use it instead of sleeping pills, but it only made me angry by how boring it was.My recommendation is: Trust the bad reviews on this one and don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A history lecture trying to be a novel","review":"This book was a dissapointment to me. While it is full of some unusual theories on a possible Atlantis - and the author certinaly knows his history and archaelogy in depth - I felt like I was being bashed over the head with this information while reading this book. At every junction our good guys stop to have a conversation - in depth - on the possibly history of everything - and they are almost always right.Despite the authors knowledge of the topic he is writing on his characters come across as lacking in depth, and full of cliches to some extent. I found myself hard pushed to finish this novel, and it was somewhat depressing to read the usual formula of a great find in history only see it destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes for this...","review":"... But unfortunately was very disappointed. Supposed to be full of new theories in an exciting story, but reads like Clive Cussler trying to write a history of scuba diving."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond Archeologist?","review":"The first chapters are very interesting and educational; the author creates a plausible theory for the existence of Atlantis. However, in later chapters, when the bad guys show up, the story degenerates into a James Bond like script losing the scientific edge that makes the book interesting. The hero performs unrealistic and improbable acts of valor, there is a megalomaniac millionaire, the hero suddenly is an expert helicopter pilot, etc, the only missing element is a hairless cat! For a first book the author shows some promise, but he should work on his plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Readable","review":"As a previous reviewer has mentioned, the back cover made this sound like a really great novel, similar to the DaVinci Code. The blurb couldn't have been more wrong! The basic premise of the novel, the mystery of Atlantis, was facinating, but the writing itself was just one page after the other of detailed technical mumbo jumbo. Instead of simply mentioning that a bomb was particularly volatile and had caused an explosion and such and such a submarine, the writer went into detailed description of what the bomb was made of, it's designation, how it created the explosion on the submarine, etc. And page after page was exactly like that. YAWN! The characters were boring, the action a bit contrived.I just kept reading it to find out the total story behind Atlantis."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't even finish it","review":"I very rarely will not finish a book, but this book just is boring. I love history, culture, archaeology, etc. I expected that I would enjoy this book. The book is just filled with facts that really don't seem important. It it taking forever to get through the book. Maybe the plot is good, but it is so full of other information that most times I forget what the plot is. I have tried on 2 different occassions to finish this book, but I am giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATLANTIS - More than the City was lost...","review":"I read about 20-25 books a year. My favotite authors are Preston & Child, John Grisham and Dan Brown. I enjoy both history and adventure novels so I thought \\"Atlantis\\" by David Gibbins had potential...WRONG!I cannot even decide what about this book I disliked more. The characters are unappealing and unrealistic. I found myself rooting for the bad guys after a while. The \\"filler\\" in the book was a bunch of deep sea language that only a college professor could understand. The plot was absolutely boring and predictable. The only reason I did not stop was because I paid $6.99 for it.I realize that book burning is terrible but in this book's case I would be more that happy to throw my copy on the pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go for it!","review":"Bad character's development. Too many technological devices descriptions. Poor dialogues with comic dramatic situations.Don't go for it, you'll be bored to the bone.The location and how the characters got to it is ridiculous, everyone knows everything, you could discover atlantis while driving your car.Reject it, go for When the Sky Fell, In the Search of Atlantis, Flem-Ath book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I am unable to make it to the half way point. I've continued reading this far because the author's knowledge of history, archaeology, and underwater exploration seem very strong (to me, who knows little about any of them). But the plotline is so contrived, and the conveniences are so numerous they've become an impossible to ignore irritant, that I am not able to read another page. Maybe my hopes were too high, but the general idea of the book is fascinating to me and I really wanted it to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive Clussler has no worries","review":"Too much historic fiction; very little story, it was written as if it were a movie, with too much, too fast, with little to give it substance to the reader. I kept waiting for the hook. Jack will never be Dirk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises much, delivers little","review":"The book Atlantis promises a story of great wealth and depth with a lot of adventure. Instead of discovering Atlantis, we instead get involved in a pseudo military combat with characters we could care less about due to a poor character development on the part of the author. We find out little but tantalizing glimpses of Atlantis and instead focus more on fire power and fake technology.First book in my entire life that I have literally not been able to finish for sheer boredom and lack of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Reading the book description on the back cover made this sound like a good adventure story, the type of fiction I like to read. However, the 1st half of the book was pretty boring. Way too much talking between the characters, way too much historical and scientific detail that at times made it difficult to read. Characters were one-dimensional. Book was a poor imitation of a Clive Cussler novel. I forced myself to read the book because I paid for it. The 2nd half was a little better, but nothing great."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"ouch... okay, first of all i have to state that in my opinion, melissa is THE greatest rock singer in recent history. there is no one with a more awesome voice and knack for lyrics. HOWEVER, \\"Never Enough\\" was THE worst cd she's ever released. i would have only given it 1 star but \\"Ain't it Heavy\\" deserved one all by itself. Don't get me wrong, Melissa's the greatest female rock singer since Janis Joplin and every home should own piles of her records but my advice would be to purchase a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I am so sick of Melissa Etheridge, I can't stand listening to her music any more. I used to buy all her CDs strictly because it was the lesbian thing to do, but now I refuse to waste my money. There's nothing spectacular about her voice, it's average at best. All her songs sound the same, there's not much diversity to her songwriting skills. She's pitifully weak when compared to such incredible voices as k.d. lang or Karen Carpenter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb like the others!","review":"\\"Never Enough\\" was strange to me but I bought it anyway since she's one of my favorites. I knew the song \\"Ain'T it Heavy\\" but the rest were new. Boy, how I love this CD! \\"Dance without Sleeping\\" and \\"It's For You\\" are the best. This sounds very similar to her self-titled album. I have yet to obtain \\"Brave and Crazy\\" but it's on its way! ME is great and I love them all except for \\"Your Little Secret.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Without Sleeping","review":"I think that Dance Without Sleeping is, without a doubt, Melissa's best song ever. It was featured on the movie, \\"GI Jane\\" and I haven't a clue why it was never released. If you enjoy Melissa Etheridge's music, you will find this a great song to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich for the ear.","review":"Some very beautiful songs on here that should be included if there ever put together a best of disc.Should include:Ain't It HeavyDance Without SleepingKeep It Preciousthe Letting GoIt's For You.Worth picking up, hetero or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Poorly designed - broke in the first day.

If you are a fan of the \\"underground\\"-type shows or even the greats like Monty Python, you are likely to love these. The discs have spent more time in my DVD player than their cases. Very satisfying to watch again and again. If you've seen Dylan Moran's comedy act, hang on because this is where he goes well over the top. The humor is outlandish and sometimes a bit cruel, but absolutely brilliant! One of my favorite casts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"Black Books is, absolutely Great !!!.

This one is a MUST HAVE and SEE !!!.Black Books - The Complete First and Second Series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Dark Comedy from the UK","review":"This wildly funny British series was a blind pick based on a recommendation from my on-line DVD rental subscription. The first episode left me stunned - hard to believe I'd never heard of it before. The performers mesh in a way that makes the dark and crazy comedy even funnier, and the outtakes and extras (particularly Black's Puppets) are even better. I just returned my rental disks and am already in withdrawal; needless to say, I just ordered my very own copy. This series is one of the funniest I've ever seen, and worth owning and watching over and over. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just did not get it...","review":"I'm originally from the UK and look forward to 'fixes' of UK comedy and drama whenever I can get them. 'Shameless' is excellent, 'The Office' is priceless and I was looking forward to this as it had been recommended to me by my brother.I tried, but this seemed immature and poorly acted. In fact, it really started to annoy me after about 10 minutes.Lots of shouting, over dramatization and a reliance on slapstick left me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just David","review":"Just David was a steal for me. I bought it at a Garage Sale along with many other old books. I had it for over a year before I finally read it. It is by far my most favorite book. I love how David always brings out the best in people without actually realizing what he is doing. He is young and the most naive little boy ever. He reminds me a bit of my six year old daughter. She always sees the beauty of something...even bugs. This is the only book I ever recommend. It is a wonderful, delightful, and interesting book. A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE! I am so glad it is still in print. I have seen it in many local libraries as well. I have since read other books by Eleanor Porter, but find Just David to be my favorite to date. Most Libraries will loan out there copies...so if not on your library shelf, see if they can find a copy for you to read. Enjoy!

I would sing, not play, but the approach to life, and yes death, is the same! If you need to talk to anyone about death, this book will guide you! It is so refreshing! I cried...ALOT!

The subject was difficult, but able to be grasped with some study. (I am an adult student)As for the \\"International Economics\\" textbook, I feel it is very poor as an educational medium. If you ever really sit and attempt to read this thing, all you are reading are a bunch of letters. There is no sense to the material and very little attempt to clarify anything. It is confusing enough to learn a difficult subject without having to decipher every letter of the alphabet into a different word or variable. I understand brevity is necessary to avoid repetition, but please! This is to be a learning tool. There should at least be some attempt to 'spell out' the information once. I feel this book was a very bad investment on my part, and would never have been my chosen text for this topic. I wouldn't even give it one star, but that was as low as I was able to select."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Theoretical and Useless!","review":"This book is very difficult to read as far as the main text is concerned. The graphs do help students understand the concepts but the organization is poor. After reading a chapter, I still do not get the \\"big picture\\".

She's SOOO good that you can't take it all in the first time, or even the second or the third. She writes it, arranges it and then performs it. The total package. Jill Scott is who all those funky divas out there wish they were. Need a soulful, funky, moody, groove-piece by a get-down, black, female master of the genre for anytime playing on your headphones or car stereo or home set-up, this is it. She out Badus Badu, out Keyes Keyes, and out O'cellos O'cello. I don't even listen to them anymore. I put Jill Scott right up there with Miles Davis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Bangin!","review":"Personally I heard her on the The ROOTS live album performing \\"You Got me\\"(which she wrote). I was waiting for this to drop. She is apart of the new true generation of 'classic' R&B.

She is in a class by herself. This CD is the best that I have purchased thus far. I was diggin' on the song \\"Gettin' In THe Way\\" and I liked the video so I thought I'd give her CD a try. Off the hook! She has her own style, her own vibe, her own flow that is just hard to describe. The words she speaks are deep and thoughtful and true! Favorite songs thus far are #3.......\\"Raheem....right? Right.\\" That song hit the nail on the head! #4.....\\"$5.99 or sumthin' like that\\"..I heard that. And finally #11 \\"He was my voodoo priest and I was his faithful concubine\\"...the words to this song are soooo deep.

Jill Scott....you go girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should like this album more than I do...","review":"I should like this album more than I do because of it's originality. It's a mixture of street poetry and hip-hop and she has a fine voice but it just doesn't do it for me. I'll stick with Patti Smith or Lauren Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Who Is Jill Scott?\\"...A Long Walk from Impressive","review":"There has been excessive \\"HYPE\\" centered around the release of: \\"Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1\\". The fact is, the albums vibe is very inconsistent. O.k., great, she sings the hook for: \\"You Got Me\\" better than Erykah Badu, that does'nt mean her album is any better. Beneath the hip-hop influenced, bluesy tempo, is the same \\"brokenhearted\\", \\"sensually-based\\" drama. The only track to truly look forward to, and find a sense of \\"refreshment\\" on, is the bueatiful: \\"A LONG WALK\\". It's groove is rich and inspiring, accompanied by Jill's powerful, crystal-clear alto, which strongly emphasizes, that a true relationship is not only \\"mutual edification\\", but \\"power\\" and \\"influence\\" as well. Unfortunately, \\"Who Is Jill Scott?\\" DID NOT impress my listening ears. It will take a bit more than \\"unorthodoxed grooves\\" and \\"spoken word\\" to stirr this soul. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is jill scott? she thinks she's badu","review":"I bought this cd after listening to all the hype. For the life of me I can't figure out what the big deal is. Jill's voice is nice, but the music is derivative. Buy the new Erekah Badu cd for the real thing. One thing that might have helped is if the music had been more varied. You can only sustain a mellow groove for so long until it gets boring. Check out the Kelis cd to see a perfect mix of tempos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"Who is Jill Scott? She is someone to be reconized, she is the true form of the work artist. Her style is smooth, her voice is real, and she put's her soul into it. I have been waiting since last year for her work to come out and I'm very very pleased. I'm truly injoying this CD, and can't wait to see her live. Keep is Real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philly's Best","review":"This album is well worth owning. Jill Scott's melodious voice gives each cut it's own life, and leaves me wanting more.I used to think the best song was A Long Walk, in which she tells of meeting her fiance and their first date. But with each tune thais released on radio, I find another reason to replay the album again. Not to gush, but each song seems to speak just to me, reminding me of my love for myself and those around me.Each song seems to speak of love, respect and good feelings. A great buy, I would recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fo' Real","review":"I got the CD in late August after viewing someone's page on Blackplanet. I didn't know who Jill Scott was, but damn I know her now. She is like that, fo' real. The CD is wonderful. I love every song and you can't say that about everybody's CD. I'm just waiting for the next one to drop.

I really didn't want to buy another CD until I bought my girl Sandra St. Victor's new CD, but I may have to wait a little longer for that.So, my friend Bernard finally convinces me to buy this Jill Scott CD. All it took was the mere mention of the word 'Vaseline' *grin!*ANYWAY, I was not ready for what I heard! At first, she comes off sounding like Erykah Badu, just a little tighter, but by the end of the album, she's smouldering like Anita Baker - and it's all decorated with her FIERCE poetry! She is working realness, but it's not going to take her four albums to get her technique together (like Mary J.

This is by far the best album of the decade. Jill and her producers took their time when making this album. Jill uses singing, poetry, and rapping very nicely throughout this album. The album is great and has a mix of R&B, jazz, hip-hop, and poetic influences in most of the songs. Jill is truly gifted and can actually sing. I also like that she has the ability to change her voice to fit the music she is singing. The most notable tracks are \\"The Way,\\" \\"He Loves Me,\\" \\"It's Love,\\" and \\"Long Walk.\\" I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves good music.

She has so much great music on this album and it is truly essential for anyone to have it in their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"After hearing all the hype, I was so excited about my Jill Scott album, only to be let down by a CD that is nothing special... Jill has a great voice, but I just couldn't get myself to care about this album. It reminded me of a cross between M'shell Ndegeocello and Janet Jackson's \\"Janet\\" album, but not as good as either. It's very earthy, but not profound. If you want some nice background music that doesn't require much concentration, then this is for you.

To be clear again, my only point is that I did not like her music, not that it wasn't any good. It just isn't my style. I assumed it would be more traditional jazz/blues, which it is not.

Her lyrics have their own poetic and expressive style, which most other artists need. She also makes some great political statements that she continues to sing as soulfully as the other tracks. \\"A Long Walk\\" is one of the best R&B songs to listen to on a first date or on a regular walk around the park with that special someone. \\"Getting In My Way\\" expresses her fierce side.

She is amazing, He Loves Me ( Lyzel in E Flat) became my song, it is so pure and simple, yet exquisite and deep, all at the same time. I love The Way, A Long Walk, One Is The Magic Number,... just the whole dang album, but the song that I love the most (or second) is a spoken word poem, Watchin' Me, a poem of paranoia, that is truth and reality for many a people. To hear her live is like the album but time 1,000,000 better, and to hear her speak like listening to a Sunday sermon that you just don't want to stop. She is a junior Aretha, Patti,or Chaka and a worthy colleague to Mary, Erykah, Angie,and Faith.

It's not like female artist CDs that drive on sex and materialistic items. From the introduction of her birth until the beginning of her growth, I can only await for Ms. Scott to take us into her second stage. I thank Ms. Scott for bringing to life a CD that reflects every female in any and every way.

I look forward to owning a collection of her albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poetic and musical fusion!!","review":"Jill Scott's cd is phenomenal! She blends the art form of the spoken word with a neo-soul sound that is spell-binding. Her spoken word pieces on the cd bring to mind Nikki Giovanni and Sonia Sanchez. Exclusively will simply make you say unhh! and shake your head. My favorite tracks on this cd are track #4 \\"Gettin in the Way\\", track # 5 \\"A Long Walk\\", and track #8 \\"It's Love\\". But the tracks that I find myself playing over and over again are #9 \\"The Way\\", #14 \\"Slowly Surely\\", and #15 \\"Watching Me\\".

I'm loving Jill's CD!","review":"This is a CD definitely for \\"Mature Audiences\\" meaning you have to listen to the melodies, feel the mood and understand the lyrics. This is sexy without vulgarity, spirituality without sounding preachey, funky but not dirty. This CD is not boring, it enhances and delights your sensuality.

I went out and bought the cd after listening to one song. Don't worry about which one... every song will move you.I had also seen here in concert at Bimbo's (San Francisco) and all I can say is... What a blessing! Jill is a person with amazing precence not only as a performer, but as a true-hearted, genuine human being. You can see the passion in her eyes, the truth in her lyrics, and the flame of her heart.I was fortunate to meet her after the concert and I was even more impressed after talking one on one with her. Music lovers, critics, singers, poets, and architects... Jill Scott is timeless! She will be around for a long time. Everyone you come in contact with should experience her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Taken","review":"Never before has any entire CD taken me with the amount of pleasure in just listenting to the lyrics.

Why did it take this soulful songstress, so long to step out of the shadows and blow us away with her first full length CD. Jill Scott, who many foolishly compare to Erykah Badu(note to all they are both wonderful singers, with very different styles)puts together a masterpiece on wax. This CD is like a cup of good, hot gumbo, there is a lot of different things in it, but it's all good. We hear Jill flip it from spoken word, to urban soul, and then she even mixes it up with a little hip hop. Stand out tracks include the beautiful \\"Love Rain\\", \\"Gettin In The Way\\", and \\"Watching Me\\", which should feature Goodie Mob if she decides to remix it. All in all this is $12.99 well spent. This CD is actually a \\"two-for\\"- since you will need two copies, one for the car and the other for the crib.Peace, Digge"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful the second time around","review":"I lost the first disc and asked for it again for Christmas! This cd is one you must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry in Music","review":"When this album was first released she was one of the first that unleashed a different style of \\"neo-soul\\" (I'm not a fan of this label.). These songs are an intricate mix of blues, jazz, r&b and poetry. Each song has the weight to stand alone without music. Each song is filled with stories of experiences that...if you have lived you will remember, feel and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word from Blighty","review":"Good grief, there I was walking around Virgin in Brighton, England when I came across this album, it was hidden away in the corner next to a Britney CD of all things!??

I could NOT stop playing \\"The Way\\". The poetry is smooth and real. I first heard \\"Exclusively\\" at the Essence Festival read live and was pleasantly surprised to discover Jill had penned that. This is a CD you can leave on and it simply flows. The sequeway of track 6 into 7 is beautiful and heartfelt. Jill Scott has wonderful range and a style all her own. She sings clearly and eloquently and so soulfully, and judging by the 242 posts in here, people are feelin' this Philly sista. Don't sleep on this one here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is J.S.? Her incredible voice and lyrics tell all...","review":"Slowly, surely....One of the choruses from an interlude proves itself to be a wonderful preminition about Jill's fame.. slowly and surely she will become an icon for where R&B will and should be..From the intro to the outro, Jill's magnificent voice and well-written lines of verse carry us through love, laughter, infidelity, self-awareness, passion, joy, heartbreak, and self-expression. She takes anyone who cares to listen ona \\"Long Walk\\" that will leave you feeling refreshed and energized."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else it there to say?","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Simply put, the girl is baddd. I'll just say this; there are comparisons to Eryka Badu and that is fine, but comparisons lead to criticizing but I think they are both great and have their own individual flavor. There is room for both. Of course I like \\"Gettin in the Way\\" that has the much-talked about video. When I here her reciting on such tracks as \\"Exclusively\\" and \\"Love Rain\\" I could swear I was in a smoky cafe at a poetry reading. She sounds like she belongs in the era of Billie Holliday on Number 8 \\"It's Love\\". Every track is great and will have you saying \\"So this is Jill Scott\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Word Can't describe.....","review":"how great this CD is! Jill Scott is mega talented!

Keep doing it \\"home girl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN JUST R&B...","review":"This CD is R&B at it's best! There is something on this CD for everyone. There's more to the songs than just \\"my man this\\" and \\"my man that.\\" This CD is truly inspirational and at the end there are two hidden songs. Number 44 says \\"Try\\" but there is another song after that too! The lyrics are intelligent and thought-provoking and the instrumentation on this CD is absolutely beautiful! If you don't buy this CD you're definitely missing out on some great music and a wonderful new artist that's a force to be reckoned with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"This is an excellent debut by Jill Scott. This CD is beautiful, soulful, artistic. It's definitely worth listening to. Jill Scott has so much variety with this album, not only in the songs but with the way she sings. At some times, she sings staight from the diaphragm with a resonant deep tone; at other times she is light and airy with an almost falsetto voice; other times she is smooth and kinda jazzy. She also has a unique \\"flow\\" in a couple of the songs (Love Rain, Watchin' Me). If you're into mature, soulful R&B with great variety and real instruments (i.e. Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu), you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jill Scott is....REFRESHING","review":"The 'soul' version of Mariah Carey. Writing her own lyrics, originally free verse poems and such. Just one phrase or track that makes her CD for me... THE WAY! The song is so smooth, it could have been the only one. But I am so glad it was not :) The way she writes, the way she sings, the way she expresses her self with sass, class and attitude. This is sure to be one of those CDs that will never be taken out of my 400 disc player. Along with Sade, Rachelle Ferrell, Erkah Badu and more. Through this CD, we are truly finding out about Ms. Scott!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next generation soul","review":"Whenever an artist breaks through the current boundaries of a genre, we have a chance to remember that we count on them to do that even more than we count on them to show us why a genre works or matters. Then occasionally somebody shows up who can do both. In this set of tracks, on any track she wants, at any moment she wants, Jill Scott simply sails effortlessly back and forth, in and out of, the currents of soul, jazz, and spoken word in a sleek vessel made of rhythm and blues, ultimately showing up as an amazingly nuanced torch singer who will make you stop what you're doing and pay attention until she's finished. In Jill's cuts, she shows us what soul is for, what jazz is for, what spoken word is for -- when to use them, how they matter -- when you need to get your inner beats out. Then you wind up saying to her, \\"yeah, do that again...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is Jill Scott?","review":"Ill be more than glad to make an attempth through this review at answering the question, Who is Jill Scott? Although I've personally never met her, her music depicts her to be a very soul oriented, lyrically motivated and creative artist. The production is definetly soul based, and her lyrics were poetical as usual. Jill differs than the typical singer in that her lyrics aren't the stereotypical \\"you stole my man heffer, Black men are no good, I want a rider\\" type theme. She is often supportive of men, and versatile on her first album. I would say the best or my favorite tracks are \\"Gettin in the Way\\", \\"Its Love\\", \\"The Way\\", \\"Honey Molasses\\", \\"A Long Walk\\", \\"Love Rain\\", and \\"Slowly Surely\\". I have so many favorites because the whole album is excellent!! I mean great!! I can literally play the whole album staight through.

I was particularly impressed with \\"A Long Walk\\" and \\"He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)\\" it is just beautiful. If I ever get married that will be my dedication to him. The girl at the record store headed me to the R&B section when I asked if they had any Jill Scott cd's. I cannot figure out why she was in R&B, not to negate that genre in any way, I love R&B, however, Jill Scott is a jazz lyricist if ever there was one.

In concert, he bends and sways like a fiddler at a Hungarian restaurant. Judging by this Sibelius, he's never met a ritard he didn't like. All of that herky-jerky stopping and starting all but ruins the gorgeous through line of this miraculous concerto. Sibelius may have been a romantic, but his Finnish personality was cooler by many Celsius degrees than the stereotypical sheen given by Mr. Bell. By contrast, Salonen's accompaniment with the L.A. Phil may be even more persuasive than his work with The Philharmonia for Cho-Liang Lin. But Lin's absolute understanding of the work, his intelligence, clarity, beautiful tone...his total approach makes this the recording to own. Lin has unjustifiably never attained the superstar status of Bell, but he is by far the greater musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat lost in expression....","review":"Bell starts the Sibelius quite beautifully. It is full of poetic beauty with delicate nuances. However, as it goes on, the true beauty of the music gets lost in his too much coloration in each phrasing. A bit too much of shading in each phrase he creates, and the scale of the music is not outlined well. It is well expressed, but somewhat it sounds like the music was broken into pretty pieces.The best of Sibelius will be Cho Liang Lin, Kyung Wha Chung, David Oistrakh and Heifetz. All of them have the inner strength in the thin line of Sibelius' beautiful melody. Bell completely misses the mark.Also, Salonen is terrible here. He was very good when he did with Lin. But with Bell, there are some dull moments in the 2nd movement. Just there is no magic between the two.Goldmark, I think Bell is quite good here, but I strongly recommend Sarah Chang's Goldmark.I know Bell is a great violinist.

When I first the Allmans (A borrowed Brothers and Sisters), I didn't really care to much about it, then I kept hearing good things about them. Soon I had all their albums and some live tapes. It just takes a little maturity and time. (I have over 150 CD's, mostly classic rock, and they are probably my favorite band, with Blue Sky being my favorite song ever). If you are looking to buy a first CD of thiers, and like to collect the albums (like me), start out with Beginnings if you like harder music (like I should have) or start with Eat A Peach if you like softer music (though at first skip the Mountain Jam). Then get Fillmore later (It is thier best, but I didn't get used into for the longest time). That is just what I think.

And this album is one of those classic albums which exemplify great rock music. In my opinion, there are five rock albums which stand out as the best rock albums of all time; Boston - Boston (self-titled album), Rush - 2112, Kansas - Song For America, Lynyrd Skynyrd - Pronounced... and this, Angel - Angel (self-titled album). With songs like \\"Tower\\", \\"Rock & Rollers\\" and \\"Mariner\\", you get classic, memorable rock songs. Just as a side note... I would rank the song \\"Tower\\" right up there with the greatest rock songs of all time; like \\"Freebird\\" & \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". The rest of the album is great, too. Even if you only buy it for one song, \\"Tower\\", one of the best rock songs ever made, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not an enjoyable storyline","review":"John Irving is a good writer, self-indulgent at times, but very readable nonetheless. This book was recommended to me by my boss who absolutely loves it. Unfortunately, I thought Irving tried too hard here and the book is actually borderline perverse. Crappy ending as well- I'd look elsewhere for your reading pleasure unless you enjoy pornographic romance novels regarding the issues involved in swinging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful study of messy human emotion","review":"Based on the reviews and the questionable subject matter, I was unprepared to actually *like* this book. What a pleasant surprise! It is deeply moving, tragic, and painful -- the story of four children playing an adult game whose consequences they are unwilling to consider. The story arc, which mirrors real life in this situation, wraps up as untidily as it would in real life, with no real growth of any of the characters, no happy ending, no real promise, even, that the characters won't repeat their mistakes again. But that's real life ... and I loved it! John Irving is a brilliant master of human emotions; I have yet to read a book of his all the way through that I haven't loved (though I am struggling to get into one of his most acclaimed: The Cider House Rules.) The 158-Pound Marriage isn't for everyone; however, if you're not discomfited by loose ties, no morals, and messy human emotions, it's a terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Irving","review":"This was a typical John Irving read, though there seemed to be a lot more sex in this book than others I've read. The plot centres on two couples that are each having some measure of marital problems. They embark on a special relationship, that's all I can say without giving away the plot. I doubt that it was the point of the book, but Irving doesn't come close to capturing the complexities of marriage. It's a light read about some people who get into a lot of twists and turns because of some of the mistakes that each couple has made in their marriage. It's written from the point of view from one of the men, a writer, and he's a very odd person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Puerile","review":"Beyond the obvious titillation of this novel, there is little to be said for this work. Irving masks his lack of skill as a writer by simply going over the top with his characters and situations. He is like a magician trying to distract us from seeing the real action going on, which in the case of his work, is unimaginative and boring. The novel has serious moral flaws. He cavalier in mentioning violence, as if it is just a bit of backdrop, ignoring the shattering implication of this in the life of women. There are Irvings gag names, his fixation with wresting, his \\"imaginative\\" flights of fancy which are little more than filler. Any interesting observations he has about life and love are buried in the ground of his compulsions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may be good by only the most narrow of definitions","review":"By \\"good,\\" I mean it is gramatically correct, contains appropriate punctuation, etc. But hey! What book ISN'T \\"good\\", provided it has been in the hands of a copy editor or ten? I read this book only because it was bound into one hardcover which also contained _The Water Method Man_ and _Setting Free the Bears_. I am grateful to have read _Setting Free the Bears_ since I feel it is a masterfully told story. As for this one, though, it engaged me the way the enlarged print condensed books I find on the tables at hospitals and the dentist's office engage me. Don't waste your time. Floss your teeth instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irving fans - don't overlook this one","review":"John Irving fans should not overlook this gem of a book, though it departs drastically from the style that Irving is known and loved for. While there is little of the over-the-top humor and element of the absurd that made him famous, the deep-felt humanity and compassion that fills his characters is here in abundance. This is certainly the leanest, most serious, and yes, the saddest of his many fine novels. It tackles a thorny and complex subject - the effect that a ménage a quatre has on the two couples involved - with honesty and grace. For one of his earlier works, this book shows a surprising level of maturity, both in the terse, precise prose and the nuanced, layered approach to the subject matter. Irving's exploration of human emotion and the consequences of our decisions and actions are remarkably reminiscent of similar work by Philip Roth and Richard Ford years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than trash, it is BORING trash","review":"How could such a titillating topic be so boring?

Nearly every page contains multiple footnotes, some of which take up more space on the page than the actual text. This greatly interferes with the flow when reading. If that information is truly that relevant to the text, then it should have been written into the text. Run-on sentences and poor grammar and editing further impede reading. It seems like an incomplete work.Some parts of this book seem to be a thinly veiled advertisement for the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina, which is of questionable merit: several decades and hundreds of millions of dollars for a grandiose building housing a mediocre library.

I am a big fan of short fiction, and I have to say that Orner's work blew me away. The breadth and depth he brings to these gems is simply amazing. It's refreshing to see a young writer who doesn't resort to shock or gimmicks to keep the readers interest, but rather relies on character, wit, and language to keep us enthralled.Orner has a profound sense of place. The characters in these stories often seem to be prisoners of not only their own desires, but of geography.I am recommending this book to everyone I know and my book club next month is scheduled to read it (I will gladly re-read it!).

Can anyone explain how someone without any directorial experience got chosen to shoot this low-budget film?

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that should be read by everyone..","review":"Some books are just mild placebos to mitigate the tiresome life we lead on everyday. This book is the greatest achievement on doing exactly this! When you watch your life on retrospective you may find something that you don't like, this is the time to look on to the other side, where subworlds can be found under the carpet, where our problems are ludicrous compared to other's, where fantasy and reality can play together without destroying our lives like toys in the hands of children.This is not about how well written the prose is, this is about the characters' destiny and our helplessness to interfere.Clive Barker wrote Weaveworld thinking of the way the worlds should be, the antagonist just appears like in every real story...Rommel Luna H."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book I've ever read!","review":"This epic weaves the tale of a lost world that's hidden in a carpet.

You can read the other reviews, and you can read the synopsis..... but you should really read the book, it's truly remarkable. Unlike anything he's written. I would love to see Spielberg make a film of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock-N-Genius!","review":"Barker's version/vision of \\"The garden of Eden\\" totally rocked! He's a genius. This was my first Clive Barker book and I've been a devoted fan of all his work ever since. Weaveworld is a nonstop thrill ride from beginning to end; with staggering twists, sharp turns, and sudden dips. Poor Cal and Suzanna, if it wasn't one thing it was another. It seemed like those two didn't get one iota of peace throughout the yarn, but in the end, all their struggles were well worth it. Like Imajica, Barker really knows how to bring his worlds to life: they are so colorful (in every implication of the word) and vivid that they just pull you right in to its many folds. Weaveworld is such an incredible story, that I don't think my words give it the justice it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I read this book when it first came out and all I can say is WoW! The idea behind this book is so far fetched I'm suprised I even read it. The beauty of it is you believe the whole story and can picture yourself in the story! Clive and Peter did a wonderful job with this book. I haven't read it in years but plan on purchasing again because it was that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Needs Work","review":"I've been a fan for decades, but when I bought the kindle edition I was very disappointed.

I returned the book, as I did the others, for a refund. I will continue to do this with poorly formatted books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Just doesn't live up to its reputation. I found it virtually impossible to identify with any of the main characters and the motivation for their behaviour and actions, the dialogue is just plain corny in places and, the more the story goes on, the clearer it becomes that Barker is having trouble controlling all the different strands of his story. Ultimately, the whole thing drags. Not so much unputdownable as unpickupable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanciful delirium...","review":"I bought this book half-a-year ago and still did not finish it (I think I'll never will, neither do I have any wish): the beginning was so-so, and afterwards the author was completely lost in the creatures he himself created,but for what purpose? It takes more to write a good book than creating a delirious mess of queer monsters and worlds... I think it is my second and last book by Barker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glam Trash","review":"European imports Clive Barker & Neil Gaiman have spoken of their dislike of Tolkien in print, Barker whose initial fame has worn thin over the years mistakes political correctness for depth (like his fellow \\"special interest\\" fantasist Ursula Le Guin) that his literary themes will soon parallel theme parks in Disney Land just confirms the superficial nature of much of his writing. Gaiman billed as one of the top post-modern writers reveals the cut & paste method of character development and his works are ideally suited for video game developers and Quentin Tarrantino. Both are limited to the London rave scene and U.S. equivalents in their appeal. And both lack the numinous \\"extra literary\\" qualities of Tolkien & C.S. Lewis and their successors like Stephen R. Donaldson or even Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking apart another world","review":"Can you sew? Well, neither can I! The last book I read by the author Clive Barker was called Weaveworld. Imagine a magical loom weaving together pieces of thread to make a carpet. Now it's not ordinary thread being used, but pieces of reality itself! Rivers, streams, lakes, pieces of land, houses, and even people (they are called Seerkind and are hiding in the carpet 'cause us humans want to destroy all of them) are weaved into this carpet! For generations this carpet has been protected by a custodian (no, they don't get paid) until now...the last custodian has died and naturally the bad guys want to get their hands on this kingdom. Free slaves and a kingdom to rule over sounded very good to the evil salesman in the story. Along with good guys who have magical powers, a dark Virgin goddess, Cuckoos (humans), an insane angel from heaven and a magical carpet to be unraveled, you have an awesome and totally mind-blowing book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea: A truly wonderful cup","review":"Overall, this is one of my all time favorites, and my favorite from Clive. Its a great book to keep re-reading.This story is a little different from his other books, almost a depart from his normal style, similar to King and Straub's \\"The Taliasman\\", with all the magic weaved into the story, with of course Clive's dark outlook intertwined into the story.This story follows an average guy, who, by circumstance or bad luck, stumbles across another world, hidden in a carpet. Then he finds himself trying to save a diminishing world from destruction and protect it. Because, oh by the way, some really nasty people are now after him, because he's stupidly put himself between them and their goal, to destroy the weave once and for all.The core of the story, a quote from the book, \\"What can be imagined, need never be lost.\\"Great book...great story...variety of intriguing and opposing characters...great world building...lots of action and twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jules Vernes could have dreamed it.","review":"Weaveworld is like a dream that Jules Verne could have made.a fantastic story between reality and imaginary.

It was recommended to me by one of my school's Sensei who felt it covered ideas and concepts that you would normally only hear through the spoken word: the relevance of Kata, the formal apsects of the dojo, and why there is no defence in Kendo. The author is an antropoligist in NY, and I believe it gives him a nice perspective on the aesthics and ideas behind Kendo that you will not find in most other books, especially those translated from the east. I think begginers and advanced students will learn a lot from this book and I believe it is the perfect companion to Kendo: The Definitive Guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a technical manual.","review":"This book is more a literary piece rather than a technical book on Kendo.

Beyond the world of the blues, Willie was, and is, a muse for rock musicians. His songs such as \\"Spoonful,\\" \\"Evil\\" and \\"I'm ready\\" are classics in both generes.In this set all of the the performers are blues singers.

Unquestionably the greatest blues songwriter, he also arranged most of the classic material that came out of Chess Record during the Golden age of the blues- the 50s.

I listened to Angel in their heyday, their first album being their best. What you must note is where Angel started and where they finished. They started almost as this progressive kind of band with those kind of fantasy type lyric's. Yes, they threw in the pop tune for the radio, but overall they had a distinctive sound. But as time progressed they seemed to regress. To the reviewer's point on why this album never sold. It's because it sucked and sucked bad. White Hot was a stretch because the group sold out to the record label and churned out the cheesy pop tunes and not what got them there. Shame on them and with 'Sinful' this proved to be their downfall. And a note to the reviewer check out their comeback cd 'In the Beginning' from 1999, but don't expect it to sound anything like what Angel used to sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unattractive fit","review":"I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform.

The album speaks to the listener, appealing to all emotions that we experience, love, hate, joyful optimism, despair and anger.I remember listening to this on my headphones on long coach trips. It took me away and made the trip an actual 'journey'.From the opening, tingling notes of 'Born of Frustration' to the closing 'Seven' the listener will be part of the album.Highlights of the album are 'Born of Frustration', the aching duet 'Don't wait that long' and the mournfully sweet 'Heavens'.A snapshot in time from a band who were at their peak.

Serena is self-centered, sharp-tempered/ quick to anger, domineering, and managing--her beauty has not been good for her character.

I must admit, I remember being entranced by the title from an early age (kindergarten even), and I loved the idea of being tangled up in a bathtub--which surely added to the mystique when I was old enough to actually read the book!

Although I tend to like and appreciate a wide palatte of modern jazz, swing doesn't usually find its way to my vast and growing collection.I bought this disc primarily because I saw drummer Joe Ascione was on it. I'd heard Ascione once before, and I was completely blown away by his incredible sense of swing. Along with John Goldsby on bass and Sir Roland Hanna on piano, this is surely among the finest swing rhythm sections ever recorded. And they do not disappoint.Vignola has a very attractive single-note style on guitar, is very fleet-fingured, incorporates spot-on intonation, has a sophisticated rhymthmic sense, and effectively comps where appropriate. All in all, a very accomplished set. Only those who are allergic to swing should avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Has Drummer Joe Ascione Been Hiding?","review":"WOW! This has to rank right up there as one of the very best straight ahead jazz albums I have ever come across!

Frank Vignola's guitar work and all the rest of the musicians on this title are just as incredible! I love to find hidden gems like this.

However, that confidence all too often expressed itself as swagger. With 'Arkansas Traveler' it has matured to an easy assurance. In this fabulous collection of songs, Shocked seems to have a hundred years of American music at her fingertips, and to be able to combine any ingredients from that century to creat something that is both fresh and familiar. Not since The Band's 'Music From Big Pink' has such a stylistic gumbo been created with such zest and integrity. In her sleeve notes, the artist credits 'Minstrel Music' with being the inspiration - and in so doing does herself a disservice. The album is richer and more layered than the simple term implies, and carries influences from a far wider range of Americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning as she earns.","review":"\\"The secret to a long life is knowing when it's time to go.\\" The words find their way to the back of your head aided by Levon Helm's raspy harmony.

Compare this to the WPA Writer's Guide to Wisconsin and it doesn't hold a candle.Normally the folks at UW Extension are masters at making their expertise accessible to anyone, but they sure didn't do that here.

If you are the parent of an ADHD child, their stance is insulting. ADHD is a physiological disorder disrupting executive functioning in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - brain scans have been done to show the underarousal in ADHD patients in these very areas of the brain. ADHD is being increasingly diagnosed because as a society we are increasingly requiring children to unnaturally sit at attention for longer and longer periods of time - 100 years ago, children did not sit at desks all day long. I encourage alternative treatments to the disorder - many random controlled trials have been done on homeopathy, essential oils, biofeedback etc. But this is a real disorder - all you need is to live with a child who has it to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is trully a treasure","review":"Such a rare and beautiful find.

I never really like The Lord of the Rings that much. I read the books (and The Hobbit) about 10 years ago, and was genuinely unimpressed. I gather Tolkien intended for it to be a parable presenting the message that whatever the odds, England had to do what was right and oppose Hitler. This is an interesting point, but the book is too long, and way to pretentious for me.Bored of the Rings is so much better. For one thing, it's nowhere near as long. For another, it's much more fun, doesn't take itself at all seriously, and is basically just one joke after another. I won't ruin any of them, they're too much fun to tell you. I will warn you that as most of the reviewers noted, many of them are cultural references that are very dated, and some of the attitudes are changed (drug abuse was very hip in the late \`60's, but isn't any more.Given that, I would still recommend this book, it's way too funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly, offensive, dumb, and very funny","review":"I suppose I can understand why some people take offense at the fine fellows who wrote Bored of the Rings. After all, those people clearly live in their parents' basements and need the solace of believing that the Lord of the Rings is the One True Book to make it through their empty days.Fair enough.But the rest of us will cheerfully, or even embarassedly, admit that Bored of the Rings is a guilty pleasure, a silly, profane, and wildly uneven book.

I didn't have the $ to get it, but I did skim through it--laughing OFTEN. And I would have laughed LOUD if it weren't for the fact that I'd soon have every eye in the store on me--I don't like too much attention. Humor, as we all know, is a hard thing to do. Most movies and books are funny in parts, but the rest lags. With BOTR, just about every page brough a laugh, at the very least a smile. The rhyming poetry is terrific. Yes, the book is raunchy at times, but it was written quite a while back when books were still somewhat edited for content. I strongly disagree with the people who hate this book because they think it's \\"sacrelige\\". Tolkien is a mortal, not a god. Get a life. Better yet, get a sense of humor.

I don't want to give it away much...so READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and not very funny at all","review":"I'm sure that most who read this book are fans of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as I am. The idea of a parody seemed clever to me back in 1993 and I thought that I should buy this book to complement my complete set of Tolkien's brilliant works. I couldn't even finish half of it. It really has very little to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Comment...","review":"I have a good sense of humor, and I love a good laugh, but this is not my kind of book. However, I could not help but notice a comment made in a review a little farther down the page. The writer claimed that without this book, Tolkien would have long been forgotten. I could't disagree with his statement more. Most of my friends and I have grown up loving Tolkien and his Middle Earth, yet I had never heard anything about this parody. There is a reason Tolkien has been dubbed \\"The Father of Modern Fantasy\\". He was the first author to sucessfully take classic myth and legend and shape it into the fantasy novel. The genre of fantasy could not be where it is today if Tolkien hadn't paved the way. There will always be room in people's hearts for his stories.In contrast to that statement, I believe it is the other way around--this parody could not have existed without Tolkien. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored of \\"Bored of...\\"","review":"I heard some good things about this book, read the reviews right here on this page and figured the other person who gave this book a 1 just didn't have a sense of humor. I love humor books. Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, poking fun at sf, was hilarious. Woody Allen's 3 books were hilarious. Bored of the Rings was the worst excuse for comedy I've ever seen. I had to quit after 40 pages without a single laugh. I was really looking forward to someone poking fun at fantasy, even though I'm not a fan of that genre. Maybe you have to be to appreciate the humor here. Maybe you have to have never read another humor book. I don't know. God help me, I just don't know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two-star insults!","review":"I began reading \\"Bored of the Rings\\" with great expectations (a mistake?), but soon was bitterly disappointed. Since the book is some dozen times shorter than the work of literature it parodies, the text is a summary of LotR at best. Because of this underwhelming lack of structure, the writing moves clumsily. Although the authors were certainly successful in making fun of the characters' names, they made the mistake of making everything into a tasteless gag. The truly humorous parts are few and far between, and to get to them you must find your way past unfunny oxymorons, senseless one-liners, and odd, but certainly not entertaining descriptions. Sure it's worth a read- if you aren't afraid of poking fun at great literature, that is- but only the patient few will have the nerve to get through the lewd misadventures of these hapless, reptilian boggies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored of the Rings","review":"This is example of how not to do a parody. They go in for a lot of cheap and easy jokes, especially cheap and tasteless sex jokes. I'm not a hardcore LOTR fan, and I'm not offended or angered by the parody; I just think that the potential of this book was squandered. There was the potential for a lot of big laughs, but for that to happen you need writers of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't funny: it's an insult to everything I believe in!","review":"Number one: the parodies are tired and predictable. Changing Bilbo to Dildo (Just sick, if you ask me, and could you have made that a little more subtle?) and Frodo to Frito is something even a baby could have come up with. Number two, as a devoted Tolkien fan, I was insulted by some of the things that were clearly meant to be funny. It could have been a little more subtle. I love LOTR and I can't stand anyone mucking it up and trivializing it and ridiculing it! The authors must really hate Tolkien to defile his work like this!!!! They as good as stripped him of his clothes and put him out on the street for public ridicule! This is the worst book ever. I could puke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aappalling...","review":"This is one of the most disgusting books I believe was ever created. Lord of the Rings is (other than the Bible) one of the greatest books ever published. Tolkien had a brilliant mind unhindered by perversion(which this book is filled with).

Odds are, the person who came up with this idea, was irritated that Tolkien, and Jackson were having such success with their creative masterpieces, that he wanted to have his time in the limelight. So he picked apart only the greatest creation in literary history, just to have his 15 minutes of fame. I'm completely outraged that someone would even consider for half a second writing a 'parody' or 'joke' about such a wonderful epic.

This is the great, authoritative Lord of the RIngs parody for all time. All right, these characters are treacherous and deceitful. They're gross. THey even steal silverware. But if you're looking for a great parody of an even greater fantasy series, this one's right at the top (or rather, the bottom)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Parody of all times!","review":"When in High School I first found this book and enjoyed reading it. Being a fan of Tolkien I couldn't help but love it. It is just the right mixture of silly jokes, gross scenes and real humor. Humor that makes me laugh out loud on the bus or train. There are lots of books out there trying to be parodies but many fail. Rereading it really allowed me to enjoy it again and, on some cases, allowed me to understand some of the jokes I had not before.Being published in 1969 I do think some of the jokes are outdated and, frankly, I don't understand some of them. Never did. But the book is still ten [...] many fantasy books and reminds me a lot of the Hitchhiker's Guide in pacing and delivery. I love the character of Goodgulf the Wizard and his ways of dealing with people. You HAVE to have this book if you are a fan of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I bought this book when in came out in 1969 and enjoyed it then. By then I'd already read The Lord of The Rings a couple of times and loved Tolkien's work. I thought this book funny and enjoyable and, while not high literature, I do think it worth reading if you're a true fan of the Lord of The Rings. Since then I've read LoTR probably a dozen times, but I still find this book amusing.As another reviewer, J. D. Heise says, this book \\"takes Tolkien's trilogy(sic) and spins it, flambes it, purees it, folds, spindles and mutilates it\\", but, unlike the recent movies that did the same thing, it was intennded which makes it much easier to enjoy. If you're a diehard fan of the LoTR book, buy something totally useless (this book) and have a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien is spinning in his grave, and laughing as well.","review":"I hope Peter Jackson has a sense of humor, because it will be impossible to watch his trilogy the same way after reading this gem. Back in print after some years, this takes Tolkien's trilogy and spins it, flambes it, purees it, folds, spindles and mutilates it. Full of outrageous puns, bad jokes and imagery that would make an Orc gag, this parody is laugh-out-loud funny, and I could not help but imagine the characters from the movie in the same roles and becoming slapstick victims.

The book is like the highly overrated TV show, Everybody Loves Raymond (ELR)in that it is unfunny and irritating. Ray CAN be funny listen to his audio CD or Ice Age, but this book tries too hard to be like his television show. Howeever, unlike the TV show, there's no supporting cast who create the vast majority of the laughs. The fact that Romano got a reported seven figures for this book is a shame. Spend your money on romano's Cd, unless you are a ELR fan, if you are ELR fan a Caveat. Ray uses profanity in this book, so it's not as family-friendly as the show. I cannot recommend this book sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Loves Ray","review":"Ray Romano has one of the driest senses of humor in showbiz and it comes across well in his writing debut, Everything & Kite. Mr. Romano's meat and potatoes is family life and, like his TV show, he explores everything from kids, to parenting, to his sex life. His stories on his own childhood and his parents are a scream as is his stories about his sex life. This book will leave you laughing as Mr. Romano goes into situations we all can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you love him that much more!","review":"It is always impressive when a comic writes a book that you actually can't put down. I was laughing out loud through the whole book. I have been watching the show since it aired and I love it, but now I love Ray Romano even more. He gives you incite on every aspect of his life, and even when being serious he is funny. Any person can relate to what he wrote about, whether your married, single, have kids or a dog. If you like his comic abilities it's definitly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio book read by Ray Romano is a winner!","review":"I ordered the audio CD of this book, and I am quite pleased that I did. In both stand-up routines and his television show, I find Ray Romano's comic delivery to be priceless. Hearing this book read by Ray Romano himself definitely adds to the charm of this hilarious material. Raymond writes about \\"what he knows,\\" and his material is made all the more funny because the audience can definitely relate to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand-up funny.

Mr. Romano writes about everything from babies, marriage, growing up, and many other topics with what else, much comic flair.

This book read as if it were put together in a hurry so that Ray Romanno can now add \\"author\\" on his resume'. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but my thoughts while setting it down were: \\"This book is well worth $4.95,\\" and \\"Hey, anyone can write a book.\\" Yes, I will continue to watch his TV show."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find Ray Romano and his book absolutely hysterical.","review":"I enjoyed Everything and a Kite immensely, because Mr. Romano talks about everything that happens to all of us in our life.

I am almost finished and she is about halfway through. We started in August and I can now play most simple songs, Happy birthday, Twinkle twinkle, basic Christmas carols, anything simple I can find music for.It is fun and easy and I now practice almost every day. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to teach themselves a bit of the basics or for parents who want to see how interested their kids are before paying for lessons.It covers notes and chords and explains how to play and read both.It isn't really a \\"girl\\" book, except the first few pages are girly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Woman's Perspective","review":"Another reviewer had concerns that he would appear chauvinistic for saying the book was a regular guitar book with girly designs. I have to say he's not being a jerk.

It is not a cajun compilation although it does contain examples of the classic stompin accordian sound. Rather it is a melting pot of American influences ( Soul. Country, Blues, R&B; and cajun). Its a bit like spending a night playing pool and drinking beer in a juke joint somewhere in the Bayous.

For those who think of \\"bayou\\" music as cajun, accordian/harmonica/thumping bass type stuff, as I was looking for, only about 1/3 of the tracks here deliver. The rest is the same type of rockabilly/honkytonk stuff that I don't necessarily associate with \\"bayou\\" - more like \\"anywhere in the 50's, moreso in the South.\\" I was looking to inject some cajun into my cd collection.

I bought this recording with high hopes, but having never listened to her voice - I regret it. The material she performs is good (if somewhat standard), but her voice is really...weird. It has a Beverly Sills (past the golden years) wobble in it that she seems to think is a healthy vibrato. I know she was pulled out of Indiana U early for a Met contract, and I think they did her a disservice - her technique is horrible. She does have good control of her pianissimi, but as a whole, the recording is most disappointing. In the Rach, her fortes are frighteningly bad, almost embarassing.

Being interested in new ways to stimulate my students and inspire them to learn, I picked up this book. Although its message sounds good, it is in fact impractical and impossible to apply to the classroom without losing control of the students.

This isn't worth buying unless you just want the recipe - which is really what you are getting. The author could have made a good story out of her idea - which then lead up to the recipe, but unfortunately seemed only interested in getting to the cake.

Jan Karon took one scene--I'm not kidding you--and made a whole \\"book\\" out of it. It's one thing to know an author is going to \\"trade on\\" a household brand name like the Mitford series to sell a few more copies of something...it's another thing entirely to have that author try to pass off a \\"spinoff\\" side product as another book in itself.

Better move to Mitford and beg Esther to bake one for you because even the recipe is a disappointment. I think of myself modestly as a seasoned baker with 30 years experience. Perhaps Karon's publisher outsourced the job to a cakemix chemistry lab? I did all the painstaking steps and used all the top ingredients; something is off.

There was no plot, no meaning. Please don't tell me the author is on her way out.

My Mom watched the whole series from 1994-2004 and loved it so after the show was over I decided to start watching it myself. I've seen most of them except for season 10 and a couple of others. And you know what? It didn't cost me a dime. Friends is on my local station KTVU twice a night, Monday through Friday, TBS once a day on weekdays (On Tuesdays there are 3 shows!) It's on KTVU once every Saturday. My point is why would you spend $20 or $30 on DVD sets when you could watch them on TV for free? Look if you really have to have them go and buy them. Check to see what features they have though. I would change my mind and buy a few if they had blooper reels or deleated scenes but for now I'll save my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"We own the whole series and really like them.

You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth having this DVD","review":"I own all seven seasons of Friends on dvd and it's totally worth the 40 bux or whatever. They air Friends reruns here all the time but they cut out at least 5 minutes worth of jokes in every episode. Plus with season 6 and 7 you get the blooper reel, which if possible, is funnier than the show. AND I maybe a loser saying this but the commentary that you get from Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright on some episodes is good. It gives some input on what goes on behind the scenes etc. I can't wait to get season 8 (already pre-ordered) because I haven't seen much of it and it's defintely one of the funniest seasons. Seasons 9 and 10 were amazing..and I cant believe its over.

Lola is a wonderful character, all spunk and sass and WAY overdramatic, which makes her observations on life lots of fun to read. Dare I admit I see a bit of the teenage me in Lola the Drama Queen?

Lola is a grating, unsympathetic heroine: she's at least as self-absorbed as her rival Carla Santini. She's also too smart by half for a 16 year old.

First let me say I hated the fact that one of the stories the girl was trippin on being a size 14 come on when you get past an 18 or 20 the trip. The shopping thing was ok as females we all can get out of hand but that fact these were same weak female and the men in this book was just as weak. Not one of theses books had a real point or a good ending. Even the love screen and the romance were not there. I can not say one good thing about this book. Each Story was worse then the first.

For small companies, sometimes we take for granted that managing human capital can be as easy as yelling over the top of a cube wall, and that applying for a patent can be amonumental achievement. But in companies where these things are routine, and systematic approaches are needed, Sullivan seems to present some credible, sound logic towards hot to approach these problems. This is not a how-to book, but returns to business management fundamentals to lay the ground work for an approach. There are no how-to books in this field, but this is an area that requires thought by readers, and Sullivan doesn't presume to know all the answers and detail. I have already applied many of the principles he presents in this book in my own company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quick Introduction","review":"This book has its good points and its bad points. The good thing is that it is very well written, concise and easy to read. It brings important points to light and is a good start at dealing with a large complex issue.

It provides a tangled treatment of IC yielding simplistic impracticable formulae and high-level stratification of IC concepts with very little applicable process. I'm afraid it falls short of its stated objective to offer an approach for extracting value from intellectual capital, and is not nearly as informative nor engaging as related works such as those by Thomas Stewart or Karl Erik Sveiby.-- Doug Laney, Senior Program Director, META Group"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute delight","review":"Incredible, subtle, mesmerizing, rewarding, creative, addictive, relentless, matchless, soulful, powerful. And more.Meyer has redefined the Bach Cello Suites in ways heretofore unimaginable. The deep notes of his double bass can give you goose bumps at times. The phrasings are superb, and his mastery of techniques is truly awe inspiring. Bach himself would have been pleased!The only complaint I have is that this CD contains only three of the six suites. Here's to hoping that Meyer will do the rest of them in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless","review":"Awesome, gorgeous, exquisite, exhilirating...I don't have words. The technical prouesse is nothing short of astonishing: one has to try and imagine the sheer physical difficulty of handling the double bass, the physical effort invoved in playing this most awkward of instruments, its bulk, the weight of its strings, the inertia of the bow. Then there's the beauty of the double bass: the volume, the overtones, the basses, the harmonics. And then there's Meyer... Casals' recordings are a must, and unsurpassed on the cello. What Meyer does here is add another dimension, literally: using the bass' limitations, he makes them work for him, for the music, for us and for our enjoyment. This is art of the highest order, beautifully recorded and produced. Even if you have Casals' recordings, get these. They'll change the way you hear the Suites"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian","review":"I have many recordings of these suites and I don't like this one. The recording does not capture the drama and pathos of the suites - they are played matter-of-fact. Recording engineer Todd Whitelock's sound is dead and artificial. The cello has no sense of localization in space. I assume Mr. Whitelock chose to place it predominantly on the left channel to compensate for that. There are literally hundreds of recordings of these suites on cello, but not on the double bass. There is a reason they are not played on the double bass - it doesn't sound as rich and nuanced as on cello."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Edgar Meyer shows his virtuosity in this recording.

I especially love Make It Funky Pt 1, Try Me and my all time favourite Get Up Offa That Thing. This is a cd that you can really enjoy because the music is contagious and you can't help dancing.What an amazing talent James was and I'm sure he'll be missed by all his fans.

Now, I know why.He's having fun, delivering tight, enjoyable music. It's infectuous. And, I can hear the roots of some of my favorite music. For example, the muted/rapid/funky picking effect that runs through this music also runs through much of Talking Heads \\"Stop Making Sense.\\" At one point on that album (Or was it the movie?) the Heads repeat \\"James Brown\\" several times. And, I think that Led Zeppelin also pays homage, of sorts, on The Crunge from \\"Houses of the Holy,\\" where they use the same guitar technique, and make reference to \\"the bridge,\\" a point of reference several times among Brown's tracks.If you've ever enjoyed anything by James Brown, you can't lose with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!","review":"Another of the best of the modern Terence Hill/ Bud Spencer comedy spoofs.

Starting with one of the best Spencer set-ups Hill has yet arranged, films goes through many hilarious slapstick episodes. Only weakness in my opinion is the villain, K-1. His female karate companion makes up for him, however. Secret agent spoofing themes make film of interest to James Bond fans, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trinity & Bambino \\"Get Smart\\"","review":"This is one of their best slapsticks ever. There's something out of many genres to pick from here, including spoofing the CIA and the Get Smart series. Their impersonation of wealthy Texas cattlemen is a hoot. It's great how the scripting wrote in little nuances throughout the storyline, such as the agents who don't want their lack of job performance passed onto the boss. The clip where the CIA boss is chatting with an agent whose bugging Castro's private quarters is really clever. Very James Bondish is the bad guy who again, paradies the evil individual out to rule the world. His side kick is a woman who could be a guy in drag and adds to the humor of this whacky comedy. If you love the Trinity boys, this is a definite for collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I was looking for a compact decent sounding stereo for my kitchen and bought this thinking it would be great to install on the wall.

By preparing for tests in a proper way, text anxiety is minimized. I recommend this book for my students and their parents. It is written in an easy simple to follow format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating mural of sacred worship for God","review":"I see this book through my Christian perspective, through Jesus' encouragement to love one another, even those who are \\"different.\\" This book helps me to do that. It introduces the world's major religions with respect and admiration. It highlights in beautiful pictures and clear descriptions the rich diversity in our global community as we face the big questions together. Sometimes arguments over the answers escalate religions into wars over who owns God. But this book encourages religions to make peace through understanding. It follows the thread of love meandering through all of these religions, weaving them into a fascinating mural of sacred worship for God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and well thought out.","review":"I'm about two thirds of the way through the book and I have to say that it's well ballanced and well written. The author takes great care in presenting accurate and unbiased descriptions of the world's religions. I'd recommend it for anyone trying to gain an understanding of what each of these religions represent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important omission","review":"This has a nice treatment of faith concepts, and would be an excellent resource for people contemplating various religions... but I marvel that it hardly mentions the most recent, fastest growing, most widespread (next to Christianity) independent world religion: the Baha'i Faith. This is odd, especially given that the Baha'i's acknowledge the unity of God, of all religions, and of humanity, and especially given that the founder of the Faith has over 100 volumes of scripture available for study. I think it warrants more attention in any book that proposes to compare religions; and the omission is an unfortunate one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult, but fulfilling read","review":"I purchased this book by Huston Smith for my world religions class. It does not read like a classic \\"text\\" book. This may please you, or it may drive you crazy. Mr. Smith has a very compact way of writing. He fits his descriptions into as little space as possible and uses a lot of little-known words. However, he has a very magical sense about him that just begs to be quoted. If you prefer a traditional text book, this book is not for you. I enjoyed reading it but couldn't help more than a few times to feel like I was missing out on a lot of information in the name of brevity and eloquence. I'd like to give this book a 3.5-star rating, but that's not a choice. 3 is unfair, so I chose 4 mainly because it's very inexpensive and that's good for us college students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful...","review":"I found this book very useful and informative. It gets right to the point of what's important for the newcomer to know when just learning about the different religions. This is the book our instructor requires for our college class on world religions, so that alone says that it must be an important book. While it doesn't cover ALL religions, it does a great job of covering the most major ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice illustrations to accompany the 6 dominant faiths.","review":"If your looking at sourcing detailed information on Theology this isn't the book for you. On the other hand if you want a brief synopsis on the main faiths with some beautiful illustrations this book serves the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent gift","review":"If you enjoy keeping score at baseball games, this book has numerous ideas for variations that will add to your enjoyment, and help you explain to your friends why you work \\"so hard\\" at baseball games.

I'm buying it as a gift for several baseball loving relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joy of Keeping Score","review":"What a great book! I am a Baseball fan and have always enjoyed watching the game. This book expains scoring and now I understand how scoring is a deeper level of understanding baseball. The author provides many wonderful anecdotes and stories about great plays and how they were scored. Fascinating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to learn to keep score, don't buy this one.","review":"Unfortunately, I purchased this book looking for detailed instructions on how to keep score.

I was surprised that this book didn't get more attention because it is as rivetting as The DaVinci Code, maybe even more. Lyn Hamilton is quite skilled at developing a sense of place, I have wanted to visit every locale she writes about. You won't be disappointed with this mystery either, it is as good as any Hitchcock had in his best days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The author struggles to string out her convoluted tale; there's a lot of toing and froing by the principal character as she stumbles about the country side making choices a normal person never would. At page 74 the author shows little understanding of the \\"lost wax\\" process; does \\"artistic license\\" absolve her from misinforming the reader about this process? The last thirty pages are devoted to the denouement, revealing that three of the villains \\"managed to have their sentences reduced by testifying against Rosati, who couldn't defend himself for the obvious reason [he was dead]...\\" What a silly, naive suggestion. Judges normally don't give any weight or reward to self-serving statements by villains placing the blame on a conveniently dead crime partner. But then there's a lot of sillier stuff in this tale. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the question should be who do you think you are?","review":"this is a great series, its very intense and the story line is great. People complain about the long complicated parts and if you don't like that kinda stuff this isn't the show for you.

The singers are off-tune and lousy and sing with no feeling. The music in the backround dull and boring and sounds nothing like the actual soundtrack.

My interest is in the postal system, the stamps and postal stationery of this tumultuous period of Indonesia's history. I wanted to understand the struggle of the revolutionary armies and youth groups and how it affected the sending and receiving of mail throughout the archipelago during the period after WWII. This book is a great addition to my reference library from this period of Indonesian history and one that I will go back to again and again. I can see it becoming well worn with lots of bookmarks, highlighting and pencil annotations to help with my studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you have a moment for a little Chit-chat?","review":"This is a great overlooked movie, for the sake of movie. Cinematographie, scenes, locations, all beautiful.Stallone and Bandaras are a hoot. There scenes together were great, their scenes seperate...o.k. Julianne Moore is great. She is the person in this movie that really helps sell it.It's a good movie for passing the time. Rent it, buy it, or just sit at home and pray no one has put a hit out on you. Cause either one of these guys would happily finish you if paid enough. Sorry, I should't talk that way to a lady. My bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth 'Assassins'","review":"Sylvester Stallone is back again along with a new comic hero, Antonio Banderas. The best duo since Tango and Cash, yes! Assassin Stallone wants to retire with one last hit, but Assassin Banderas ruins the cash payment. Naive man. You don't mess with Stallone, he gets angry real fast. A woman who has valuable information and is a hacker, must be assassinated. But luckily for her, Stallone protects her from Banderas. An encounterment in a taxicab forced Stallone to drive like a madman and crash into other cars, gutsy! The stove trick was clever forcing Banderas to jump out of the window! In the final pay-off, Banderas waited in a tower for Stallone to come out of a bank, but Stallone took his time and made Banderas sweat. I was laughing with enthusiasm. This movie is too smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BLU RAY TRANSFER!","review":"Pleased to inform since the release of Laser Disc in mid nineties this is the only worthy transfer. The colours and sound are amazing. Great bargain if you're a Stallone fan.A good blu ray movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Stallone Film","review":"This was a really good Sly action movie. The idea of two competing assassins was cool and seeing Stallone take on such a different type of character was interesting. Antonio Banderas was a perfect choice for an assassin, he did a very good job playing one. I agree with many other people though who say it could have been done much better with perhaps a different director. The movie did kind of get long and pretty soon you're just like...go faster! But overall a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stallone + Banderas = FLOP","review":"This movie is in desperate need of subtitles because Antonio and Sly are not comprehensible. I would take a portion of the budget for this film and give them acting lessons. They should have casted Robert Goulet and Carrottop. It would have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid performances","review":"This movie has become a classic favorite with me. Stallone getting help from a quirky, independent woman -- the beautiful, talented Julianne Moore; a cat, Antonio Banderas, strategic action and a building falling apart. Don't know what more I could want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number One With A Bullet","review":"We would have to recommend this to any fan of Sly, or Antonio. Julianne Moore was a wonderful supporting actress as well. We had a hard time deciding who to root for. The entire movie was classic Sly, and a nice surprise regarding Mr. Banderas in his early years. Action, fun, intrigue and the usual cat and mouse. But with excellent delivery. Well made, perfectly pulled off. I had to give it a five star rating for those reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"avid movie fan","review":"I love it. I got the dvd on time. The dvd is in good condition and I have been watching it many time eversince I received it. thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made.","review":"I am in no way one of those die-hard Sylvester Stallone fans, but I do think he's come a long way since the 80's.He had himself pretty much typecast as the macho, kill 'em all and blow everything up character, but in this he's actually intelligent, sophisticated, and not in-your-face. In fact, he was pretty meek in his later work, \\"Cop Land\\". Not many actors are able to resurrect themselves the way he did.Overall, his work in \\"Assassins\\" was top-notch, as was Banderas'. As a young actor, Banderas, I think, is off to a great start, and Stallone pretty much extended his career opportunities indefinitely.Very Well Done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood anti-gun rights rant.","review":"This was a horrible movie. It was predicable and way too long. In addition, it was ironic that Hollywood would put so many anti-gun rights messages into a movie that glorifies gun-violence.Hollywood would you at least please teach actors how to hold and fire a handgun--seeing these guys handle the weapons in the movie is laughable. If I see another actor firing a gun while holding it sideways I think I'll scream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted talents...","review":"Face the truth: this movie jus didn't take off at all. The plot idea was good, but the stupidity of the scenes are disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor picture quality","review":"Poor picture quality, every other second the picture either goes blurry or seems to glitch and show lines. Quite obvious on a computer monitor, less so on a tv. Annoying. Decent flick, though not half as dark as it tries to be, and burdened with typical Hollywood elements that detract from an otherwise viable main story. It does have its moments, primarily thanks to Banderas (IMHO), but is still doomed to cliche and mediocrity for its \\"action movie\\" formula. End result: where this movie could have been much darker, it is merely campy (like a typical action movie). Could have very easily become the thriller it should have been, if it had been given a director with some vision. It's clear that Donner really didn't know where he wanted to go (except to the bank) with this movie. LONG STORY SHORT: decent flick, bad dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spaceland...","review":"Spaceland is a good science fiction book, but it doesn't appear to be much more than that. Overall, the book as a whole is a good read, but for those who are looking for something which is more of the tune of Flatland, you would probably be better off looking for a different book. The twist in the entire story is probably one of the best \\"scientific\\" reasoning which make it plausible, but it could have been expanded better."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor character development","review":"I just finished reading Spaceland and I'm a more than a little disappointed. The relationships that exist between characters is so dysfunctional that it's almost completely unrealistic. It's like the breakfast club of emotional misfits: co-dependent, hopelessly insecure, delusional, borderline personality, morally vacuous -- it's a mess that Rucker tries to pass off as normal human interaction when it's anything but. This was such a frustrating distraction that it ruined what would have been an otherwise decent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot secondary to concept","review":"I enjoyed this book, but thought that the fourth dimension concepts somewhat overpowered the plot. I found the Flatland references appealing, but readers who have not read Flatland may find this book difficult to enjoy. On the other hand, serious Flatland students might find this too lighthearted.At times Rucker over-explains the science; at times he under-explains the science; and sometimes he makes significant plot twists without enough context. That said, this is a very creative story. The silicon valley references, and its characters, are amusing. I also appreciated Rucker's sketches sprinkled throughout the book.I think this book would be most appealing to casual Flatland readers looking for a light, humorous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An owners manual that we all need.","review":"I had already listened to this in full because someone had uploaded it to YouTube.

Draftees, National Guard, Reservists, and Regular Army thrown together on foreign ground, fighting a dedicated, expierenced enemy, often with better equipment and knowledge of the terrain. Only in Viet-Nam, unlike in North Africa 1942-1943 and Iraq today, there were very few National Guard or Reservists in the fight. His descriptions of the US Army officer corps, NCOs and GIs are right on the mark. Achieving victories and a reputation as a good leader under fire then,as now, has as much to do with timing, logistics and good luck as it does with courage.

I have read many, many books on WWII but this was different. He spent a lot of time discussing personalities and how they related to specific battles.

He was captured on Feb. 14, 1943 in a battle described in the book. I don't think I could have given him a more appreciated gift at this time in his life. As he reads it he tells me how right it is, how relevant it is to him, and how much he is learning about what was going on \\"above him\\" (he was a 2nd Lt. just out of ROTC).

I am not a historian, but I have read several first person narratives and a bit of history surrounding WWII. This book reads like a novel, it's well scripted and follows a clear time-line that allows you to understand what's going on where and when.This book offers a bit of insight into the personality and character of each of the U.S. generals and various other leaders and outlines where mistakes were made and how individuals learned from those mistakes to improve our forces.While this may not be an exhaustive history of all of the issues surrounding the campaign in North Africa, it is a GREAT starting point for the amateur reader or arm-chair historian to get a great view of how the American involvement in World War II began.I have already purchased the second edition and eagerly await the third!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic history of the North African Campaign.","review":"This book is loaded to bear with information on the war in North Africa.

He provided a good deal of information concerning the difficulties that the Allies faced and also spent a good deal of the book on the discussions with the French before the invasion. The book is well written and fast paced. The individuals portrayed in the book are very real and come to life in the pages.

The first in a projected series of books on WWII, it talks about the North African theater of war from the view of both headquarters and down on the ground with the troops. It lacks the intricate details of his book about West Pointers and Vietnam, \\"The Long Gray Line\\", but, maybe that's just as well. As a matter of fact for history buffs, I would recommend your also reading \\"The Long Gray Line\\" and \\"West Point\\" by Norman Thomas Remick."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-American Experieance","review":"Excellent and entertaining.

One of the best WWII books I have ever read. Mr. Atkinson brings to the forefront, in novel-like fashion, a portion of the war that few people are familiar with and very clearly points out just how closly we came to losing. My only criticism, when reading this book a person needs to keep a dictionary close by. Other than that, book is great. This is a must read for anyone interested in WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of WWII","review":"A thorough history of America's initiation into WWII in the Western Theater. A very detailed and engaging narrative style. Someone said that Rick Atkinson has done for WWII what Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote did for the Civil War.My only objection is that he used too many British terms(winkle?), even when describing the activities of American troops. Having already read the 3 volumes by Jeff Shaara covering the same war(fiction), I have to say that this history is much more deeply satifying. 8 on a scale of 1-10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader from Jonesboro, AR who never read the book","review":"I question the motivation of this reviewer who points out a mistake another reviewer had made about the depiction of Patton firing his revolvers at enemy aircraft.The reviewer questioned the accuracy of Mr. Atkinson's book without having read it simply because another reviewer made a mistake in describing the Patton incident.If the \\"reader from Jonesboro\\" had read the book he/she would have found that the passage reads:\\"After strafing the streets, the planes returned for a final bombing run, during which a melon-sized fragment blew through the conference room, where the generals were now sprawled on the floor.

Farner has achieved what many historians have not, he relays the truth. This exceptional piece shows many unknown truths about American History. Farner has assembled a group of articles that reflect what history should be. He fearlessly states the good with the bad. This book uncovers some little known facts about true American History. The author does not avoid touchy subjects, like flamboyant crossdressing political leaders. American history shows itself in the truest sense, satin clad male governors and all. I highly recommend this book for it's sincerity regarding history, and the real role New Jersey has had in America. This book promotes thought, while keeping the readers interest.

At the bottom of it, the author doesn't seem to like the Chinese very much. Page after page, she complains about the food, accommodations, the transportation, the people. She brings to mind the outdated attitudes of the colonial British, holding their noses as they looked down upon the natives, confident in their smug superiority. In addition, her sense of humor is rather tiresome, always at another's expense, arch and acerbic.

Seems like an opportunistic book, superficial, and wholly at the expense of the Chinese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book!","review":"Like another poster, I really wanted to enjoy this book. It wasn't even remotely funny. I found the author to be sarcastic, and very arrogant. She painted a very bad picture of China (its culture and its people). The author is so narrow minded, that I'm afraid to read any more of her work. For someone who is supposed to be funny...I found the book to be offensive.If I could give this book ZERO stars, I would. Don't waste your time reading this piece of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Culture Shock","review":"This is a good, fast, and informative read. Be prepared to be shocked and perhaps a bit disgusted because of the graphic explanations of what is done in public. I've never had a great desire to travel to China. Now that I have read the book, I'm not ever going there. The book is filled with great and very interesting historical information.If you want a really great read by the same author get:It's Not About the Tapas: A Spanish Adventure on Two Wheels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Phone","review":"LCD screen is marginally readable. Sound quality is average. Unit clock resets itself to midnight, December 31, everytime I hang up the phone. Batteries tend to pop out of holder. The cord between the base unit and the handset has special plugs that are slightly narrower then standard plugs, so to replace this cord, one must purchase a Panasonic manufactured cord, not a generic. Called Panasonic to get a replacement phone and they said I had to pay for shipping and that the replacement phone, although new, would come in a box that was marked \\"Remanufactured Unit\\".

I should have. In 2 months I have replaced the batteries 3 times; this last time they only lasted a few days! Panasonic customer service actually had the nerve to suggest I replace them again with Panasonic brand batteries (instead of the new Duracell Alkaline AAs I used). Now I have to package it up with the incvoice, the reason for return on a separate page, go and post it at my expense and wait for them to send me a refurbished replacement. Is it so difficult to simply make a telephone that does what it's supposed to do? Another inexcusable annoyance is that, as a wall phone, it attaches only in 1 place, which causes it to swing if you move/walk while using the handset. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap components","review":"Do not buy this phone. I bought this phone in April. By the end of June, the rocker button (up-down-left-right) didn't work and the time display would resent to 000 when you tried to review calls.

Changing the batteries does not help. (We tried this twice, with different batches of batteries.)Apparently we can return the phones and get back refurbished phones after several weeks but since our office can't be without phones, we'll just have to scrap these and get something else. I would not judge this product so harshly if this was just a random defect, but it seems to be a common problem judging by the number of similar complaints.

This may actually be loud enough to be painful, depending on your ears, your headset, and the volume settings of the phone and the headset (if it has a volume setting). But regardless of whether it hurts, it is annoying. I am going to try to replace this phone with a Plantronics T10 due to this problem.

John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band again portray Eddie and the Cruisers, but these recordings have a more unpolished sound of a demo tape, in an obvious way to closely follow the movie scripts.For the uninitiated, the 49 seconds of Eddie's Confession will be nothing short of puzzling, since it explains the major mystery which would only be known by watching the movies. And with the total running time of a few ticks under 30 minutes, this may ultimately be an unsatisfying game of lost and found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide to organize a workplace for architects & managers","review":"I've used this excellent guide to reorganize workplaces with clients and in my own firm., Its guidelines & checklists allow the readers to participate and architects & managers to apply organizational and psychological criteria with clients and working together."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!!! : Do NOT buy these!","review":"We bought these for my son and within a minute of riding his bike the \\"tire\\" on one of them split in two and fell off... as did my son.

However, Iwaaki's extrapolation of the premise (of mysterious aliens taking human forms and preying on humans) is intelligent and well-developed, his character explorations are perceptive, and his depictions of the alien parasytes are sheer cleverness. (I've never seen such creative yet unrepulsive gore...it's a damn cool manga!) Good stuff. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parasyte...","review":"\\"Parasyte 1\\" was originally published in Japan in 1990, this particular translation is from 1998. I don't know anime, but I know what I like. I know even less about manga. Still, I was recommended this, since I'm a fan of sci-fi, and I quite liked it.A Parasyte, possibly from outer space, invades Shin's home and tries to get into his brain through his arm, but gets stuck in his left hand, where he mutates. Parasytes have lots of special properties. They can talk, morph into all sorts of shapes, can sense what its host is feeling. A lot of the issue sees Shin and \\"Lefty\\" getting used to life with each other, while discovering what the Parasytes really are.It's pretty exciting stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-industrial bio-ecological horror","review":"This series clearly owes its existence to Nagai Go's classic Devilman. Whereas Nagai's work is a product of the cold war socio-political reality with its apocalyptic dualist themes, this one is more in a post-industrial globalist mode with its emphasis on ecological symbiosis. And as such it is a scathing critique of modern egocentricity, which is in fact just another name for rationalism. The ending is perhaps something of an anti-climax and borders on naivety, but it will no doubt make you think and ponder about what it means to \\"live\\" with others. Leaving aside all the gory scenes that the series contains, this could perhaps be used as a secondary-school textbook under the strict guidance of an informed instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere on Earth, somebody wondered...","review":"In this, the first book of the Parasyte series, we are introduced to the main character and shown how he came to share his body with an alien entity, the Parasyte.

The best hosts/hostesses I have ever known have been individuals who loved people. Entertaining is a lot of work but it is very rewarding in that all your efforts are intended to make your friends and family happy. How can Nan Kempner possibly know anything about entertaining when she comes out with such a statement as \\"I HATE FAT PEOPLE\\" in W magazine.

Or, for that matter, Princess Lee Radziwill? I think if Lee did that, it would be the biggest camp classic since Patrick Dennis's Little Me.

This too, happened to me, and the book reaffirmed my conclusion that enabling is wrong path to continue on. Enabling doesn't work, and only makes the situation worse.

If you follow the author's advice you will get through it. You are not alone. Just knowing there are others sharing your pain, make it easier.

This book gives a lot of good advice to stopping the enabling we do to our children who end up addicts. If a parent followed this advice before there are any problems our society might not have the level of addiction in our teenagers that has become epidemic in our society. If you think your child would never become an addict think again it happens in every neighborhood in every level of income.

I cannot express enough how beneficial this book is to anybody raising teenagers. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"The book was not helpful.

After reading about all his experiences, I felt worse than I already did. This guy has given up, turned his back on his children to protect himself. There's a huge difference between turning your back and remaining hopeful and compassionate. Addicts need understanding, not bitterness and vitriol. I don't think he's moved on, as much as he'd like to say he has.There are MUCH better books on the subject, that will comfort you, and help you realize just how difficult the process of recovery is.

There is useful information in the book, but it is hard to find as you're sifting through the chapters. Most of the information is just common sense put to use. I would not recommend this book as an answer to parents who need real life altering help. It may be useful for families dealing with the first stages of drug addiction, but most of us don't realize the problem until we're in much deeper.

He reminds us that when a child is high on drugs, you are not having a conversation with your child, you are having a conversation with the drug. Please read this book and highlight the passages you need when your child is conning you and making you feel guilty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents don't need to feel responsible only compassion","review":"Finally a book that recognizes that not all children that become drug addicted came from abusive and bad families. This book addresses the parents that have loved and adored their children from birth. In fact, it addresses the parents that thought they did it all right. Loving, supportive environments were provided. And when the trouble begins (school calling, police involved) the parent who is bailing their kid out of trouble, but can never seem to fix them. Things only get worse. This book tells you why you can NEVER fix your kids. Thank you for this book. My heart is broken, my pocketbook is broken, but I can finally stop.

You won't want to put it down. You'll find yourself underlining statements to go back to as reminders of what to do and what not to do. You may regret killing yourself by wishful thinking and enabling behavior, but this book is not about blaming parents; it's all about healing parents. The focus is arming one's self against the manipulation, freeing one's self from the abuse, and recovering from the pain. The hardest lessons of the book are to disengage to learn not get conned, to learn to say \\"no\\" to kids who belong to their addiction, who long ago stopped being your kids.

Reading of his almost meteoric rise to fame and fortune it is easy to see that the title is accurate, Fox is a very lucky man indeed. Blessed not only with great financial success but with a loving wife and devoted family as well, Fox shares how coming to terms with his disease has led to a richer, more emotionally secure life than chasing the dream of fame ever could. Anybody who reads this book will come away feeling like they have spent an evening with a good friend who has shared his most personal and painful battles...and won. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael J Fox at his best!","review":"OK, I've been a MJF fan for a long time, and consider him one of my favorite actors; well now, I count him as one of my favorite authors. When I bought his book, expected a reasoning through his illness, and how he dealt with it. However, for my pleasant surprise, I found him taking me back and forth through what I call an interesting life, that gives you all the angles to really understand why he, after all this years, calls himself a \\"Lucky Man\\". Trully and inspirational book, that shows you that even superstars are human after all! I give this book, five stars times 1000.

There is such heart and hope and love in this book about life it's insane. I've never been so proud to be a fan of Michael and have since signed up to make a monthly donation to his foundation. I can't think of a better thing to do with my money. And you can't go wrong reading this book. You will be all the better for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"Lucky Man is an interesting read - a well-written celebrity biography with a serious side. Fox writes very well - excellent style and vocabulary - and is candid about the impact of Parkinson's Disease on his life. Since his struggle with the disease and his acting career are both on-going, the book did not have a strong finish, but I found it insightful and worthwhile. I never read celebrity books but read this one because I admire Fox's candor about his illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy reader","review":"I did like this book but It was sad at times because Michael J Fox is such an inspirational man.

Michael is so honest with the reader you can empathize with his feelings every step of the way. Michael writes as if he is speaking to you which makes this book all the more on a personal level. I felt his pain, fear, joys, anger and triumphs. Good writing, Michael. Sorry I didn't catch this tome sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modest and heartwarming","review":"I have been fond of Michael J.Fox and his work for almost 20 years now. It seems as if he's been with me all this time, since I first saw him on the big screen in \\"Back to the Future\\" and \\"Family Ties\\". He is not only a very talented actor, with sharp, yet down-to-earth sense of humor, but also a profoundly developed human being. I've always seen him as a personality rather than celebrity, and this book proved that I was right from the beginning. If I could see him in person I would like to thank him for sharing his thoughts and the most amusing facts with me, and congratulate on his ability to cope with the less fortunate moments of his life. This book is a must to read. I recommend it with all my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Man","review":"The book is fairly well written and interesting.

Fox's mouth. He said, \\"I sacrificed my 20's in order to have my 30's.\\" He figured becoming a major movie star and TV star and multi-millionaire was a \\"sacrifice.\\" And now he could retire at 30 with all his money and raise his kid. Typical annoying \\"fame and fortune are painful\\" junk that comes out of the mouths of so many stars. I would have loved to have traded places with him. When I heard later that Fox had since become afflicted with Parkinson's, I thought, \\"NOW he'll find out what sacrifice truly is.\\" Well, to his credit, he does now seem to know what TRUE sacrifice is, and this book is evidence of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Man","review":"Fascinating read about an interesting guy, I particularly liked his reflections on success and how hard he worked on the movie sets and TV shows in the early years of making it big in Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"mominmontevallo","review":"Enjoyed this book very much.

Fox is straightforward with his story from his work/family/friends and Parkinson's. One gets a sense of the person behind the image.

Overall is is a refreshing read and he shows the reader how his journey let him to his political/social actions regarding Parkinson's today.I slap enjoyed his reflections on his siblings and Nana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinforcement of a great man and his courage","review":"I was completely immersed in this book.

A really well written book which carries the reader along and feel involved.Certainly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I remember when I first heard that Michael J. Fox had Parkinson's, and I felt so sorry for him. I remember when I first started seeing him on TV and awards shows, and his symptoms were becoming pretty obvious, and I felt so sorry for him. Then I read this book, and I felt so inspired. He considers himself a \\"lucky man,\\" so shouldn't we all? I was a fan before, and am a fan a million times over with this candid book. This touches not only on Parkinson's, but his family, his struggles, his triumphs, his acting work, and his charity work. He is the epitome of class and hope. I truly admire him for all he has done and is doing, for his amazing attitude, and inspiring spirit and message. I am sure it took him a while to get to the point where he has such a positive attitude (he has even said this). This would be a great story for anyone struggling with a disease or with something they feel is insurmountable."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must buy this book!","review":"I just finished reading Michael J. Fox's memoir. It took me one day. I loved it. He talks about his life as a child and his rise to fame and his struggle but amazingly positive acceptance of his Parkinson's.Because all the proceeds of this book benefit his Parkinson's organization which is working on a cure for the disease, I decided I will buy 20 more and send a book to family and friends.I encourage people to buy this book.

Michael J Fox gave a very poignant story about his childhood and the years beyond. Thoroughly enjoyed the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written and Courageous Story","review":"Reading about a person who has an incurable illness can be a real downer for most of us, especially if it's a celebrity that we really admire, but this book does just the opposite. It not only carries us along but leaves us with a hopeful feeling at the end. It is a chronicle of Michael's fight with PD and his life before and after becoming a big TV and movie celebrity. His sense of humor and positive outlook on life is always evident as we discover how he deals with his disease personally and with the adoring public, his family and fellow workers and the ever-present, prying media. Besides giving us a great insight into that privileged world of Hollywood it shows us that even those special people who seem to live fantasy lives also have problems that money cannot always solve. For anyone experiencing bad times personally or helping another with their troubles this book should help you find hope and courage while still entertaining you. It sure did for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael J. Fox Lucky Man","review":"I really enjoyed the book.

Fox. For those of us who have just watched him on television, though, this book is perhaps a bit much, going into very intricate and intimate detail regarding his personal life and his struggle with Parkinson's Disease.

The scenery of Yellowstone is so much more than geysers and steamy places yet that is mostly what this video showed. I think Grand Teton N.P is one of the most beautiful places on earth (you know there really has to be a God when you see those mountains in the sunlight!). This park might have been given 7 or 8 minutes (at the most) in this overly long video.

We see Schneider as he tries to find a way to revert things, while hiding from her boyfriend, friends, family and school authorities, with the help of a few of her girlfriends (including Anna Faris in a hilarious role as a not so bright cheerleader).While it'll never be in any AFI comedy lists, you get to spend some good times with this film.

The start of the first organizations to promote a homosexual presents, with their naive belief that they would be excepted, to the more militant efforts in the early sixties. D'emilio has documented carefully the many events of importants that led up the the stonewall riot. Making it clear that the fight didn't begin at stonewall, but many years before. He talks in detail about the different organizations that started, and how they developed and changed as the struggle continued. D'emilio did his homework on this one without question.

Theres a demo version of \\"Do It\\" and the rest are live tracks. The 2 live versions of \\"Mexican Grass War\\" & \\"Why Does A red Cow\\" are unsatisfying and unecessary. So that leaves the live versions of \\"Do It\\", \\"Uncle Harry's Last Freakout\\", & \\"The Snake\\" to justify this cd. Well guess what ? The sound quality isnt too good!I originally gave this 3 stars because I like the Fairies, but writing this made me realize this is a pretty bad cd. Buy \\"Think Pink\\" & you have the best songs on this comp.Its Definitely NOT worth the high price being asked (unless youre a complete Fairies nut). Luckily I got mine cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Fairies - 'Do It' (Total Energy)","review":"Another highly comprehensive compilation CD by the Pink Fairies. What I like about this disc is the fact it has three live songs from the famed 1971 Glastonbury Fayre, which are \\"Do It\\", \\"Mexican Grass War\\" and the band's signature tune \\"Uncle Harry's Last Freakout\\". There's one tune I never heard \\"The Snake\\" recorded at another big outdoor bash, the Weeley Festival. Then there's three tracks from Twink's solo classic 'Think Pink', which are \\"Sparrow Is A Sign\\", \\"Suicide\\" and \\"Ten Thousand Words\\" (listen closely to the lyrics). Well worth seeking out a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerhouse and an expense","review":"This is a gorgeous album with a lot of great instumental music. It also has a bit of vocals, namely \\"Back In The Good Old World.\\" That song is probably the greatest on the album, and is a favorite amonsgt Waits fans, even without seeing the movie. Getting the album is difficult, as it is now out of print, but a true Waits fan is glad to shell out some more for the real good stuff. Now, if you don't want to pay at least thirty dollars plus shipping, you can search out \\"Goin' Out West.\\" It was a single from Waits' \\"Bone Machine\\" and it has Back in the good old world on it. Sadly this may also prove difficult to find, but this single is an oddly cheap buy. My copy was just 6 dollars in a used music store. Overall, it is absolutely worth the money, and I recomend it whole heartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT FROM AMAZON !!!","review":"They do NOT ship you ANYTHING that is in the photo or description; no compression gauge, no hose, no adapters.

And even if you don't fit that description but long for more meaningful prayers or find yourself in interfaith gatherings calling for prayer, you will value this a useful resource. The author opens with brief descriptions of common prayer practices from lectio divina to walking meditation, and prayerware from beads to cymbals, chimes, and bells. Twelve chapters are devoted to separate types of prayer, such as prayers for the earth and the animals, blessings, litanies and mantras. Each prayer is labeled according to tradition/path (as Catholic/Christian; Interfaith; and Christian Feminism) and accompanied by a brief explanation of its origin and options for use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Book","review":"I first heard of this book when our priest read from it during Mass. I loved the reading and it prompted me to ask him about the book; thus, I bought a copy for myself. I can highly recommend this book as a lovely set of prayers, diverse in their content and origins. I especially love the readings and prayers for the animals. Dostoyevsky has a particularly beautiful prayer in here for the animals and all creation. A book like this teaches us to be kindler and gentler in a society that isn't always that way. Highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service NON-EXISTENT","review":"I purchased an 8 foot ballet bar for my daughter.

Some of the hanging around en route could benefit by being abridged, but once at base camp the book is a real page-turner. Child's position as the inexperienced young climber tagging along with Doug Scott and Don Whillans is very cool...provides some interesting personality insights I have not seen in other books. Scott said something like \\"This is the move, kid, we have to go for it now...\\" was very endearing (both from the fatherly perspective of Scott as well as the willingness to trust of Child).

My garage ceiling is 11' and it will not come all the way to the floor, but that is okay by me and is easy to load. The brace that hold the drive mechanism flexes a lot when putting the rack up. When I first start it really seems like it is going to break and I have NOT overloaded it at all. With the provided handle it goes up and down VERY SLOWLY, so I tried to use a drill... works, but not very well. The hook on the handle easily hits the mechanism lock and the first time I used a drill it bent the locking mechanism pretty bad. I straightened it back out and no matter how slowly I used the drill the hook kept hitting the lock.Sounds like I'm not happy, but I really am.

It works great. It keeps it out of the way when it is not in use, and when my grandson visits it lowers easily. Best of all, I can lower it to his height so he can see the layout and enjoy it. It was fairly easy to assemble. I use a high torque battery operated drill to raise and lower the unit. The unit is well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall product","review":"This is a fairly good product, probably best suited for a relatively high garage ceiling (depending upon what you place on it you may find it not at an elevation to your liking).Pros: Good solid construction. Elevation mechanism works well. Assembly not too teribly hard. Good platform spaceCons: Heavy, I probably should have had help during the installation.One of the end caps would not fit in the tube due to unfinishing during the manufacturing process.The cross bar that is responsible for the lowering and raising the platform is securly fitted on one side via the hoist mechanism, but just sits in a larger opening on the other. Because of this, it moves around in the opening.

The method of securing the grate to the bar were J-hooks, and did not function as required. Plus, one of the hooks were not threaded as the others - requiring a call to the manufacter to replace.

We found this lifter in the Sky Mall magazine on a flight, then ckecked it out on Amazon ($80 less). I store my motorcycle trailer on it during the winter months. The specs are a bit miss-leading.

The maximum lift is more like 8 feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort","review":"Despite the fact that it looks \\"so easy\\" to put up, it really needs 2 strong people to be able to hold the heavy brace in place to drill the holes in the garage ceiling. We ended up using other screws than the ones that came with because their heads did not fit into place in the key hole type hole. If you do use those screws you must have a metric rachet set.The pulley takes a while to take the platform up.But after it's up, it holds a lot that now doesn't have to be on the floor of my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product","review":"This is a great product-in theory. In practice, it is very difficult to install, especially if you are trying to do so alone. The supplied J hooks are too short-in some cases not long enough to include the washer-and the crank requires herculian strength to raise the rack when it is fully loaded (at less than 250 lbs.) I called Racor complaining about both the short J hooks and stiff crank gear box, and they sent me replacements. Exactly like the originals.Given the difficulty of raising the rack, it is not worth the extreme effort required to install it. I would recommend instead installing fixed celining racks and using a ladder to load and unload them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy lift installation","review":"The heavy lift works well. I would suggest using a 2 x 4 accross the joists for installation vs what the manual suggests simply because the joists will never be parallel enough to make sure the arms are square. Once I found the joists, it went up easy and works well. It would be better if they gave you a couple of more feet of cable. If you have higher than an 8' ceiling, it does not come close to touching the ground. Overall, I am satisfied with it and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved a big storage problem for us","review":"The Racor Pro Heavy lift solved a storage problem for us.

I must say the paper directions were just ok. The images could have been drawn better. I used the video directions on the Racor company website when the paper directions were not clear. This product performs as advertised. I would like to add that I first put together this storage rack and then modified it to create a hanging light system for use in my printing studio. After elongating the crank shaft that connects the two pulley system ends I was able to suspend my 14 foot horizontal rack of track lights. I now can raise and lower my lighting system by using the hand crank that attaches to the gearbox. It takes quite a bit of easy hand cranking to raise and lower the system. Once I attached a cordless power drill to the pole with the attachment that comes with the kit, raising and lowering the unit is now even easier and much faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to install- works great- hardware not the best","review":"After I finally decided where and how to install this in the garage- it went up rather quickly. The only thing that I could say bad about it is the J-hooks really aren't long enough- but still work. Holds alot of weight. I put a 100+lb. generator and alot of other things on it and it seems to hold it no problem.Going to buy another one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great... install is a PITA","review":"I purchased two of these units and installed them in my garage. So far they work great and haven't come crashing down so that is a good sign. Install was quite the adventure mostly due to the construction and framing of my garage. There are lots of parts and pieces to this kit which requires assembly and you will definitely need two able bodied people to install these. The bars have to be mounted 48\\" appart so make sure you have located your joists and plan accordingly. Ideally your joists will run on 12\\", 16\\", or 24\\" centers so you can bolt the rails on separate joists but you can also run perpendicular to the joists as needed. My garage ceiling is finished drywall and installation took several hours. I'm glad I purchased these but they are certainly staying with the home whenever I decided to move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racor Storage Rack","review":"The Racor Heavylift Storage Rack was just as described. I had none of the problems with the lag bolts as described by some other reviewers.

I am considering ordering two more to go with the two I have already installed. They did exactly what I needed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than IKEA","review":"All I have to say is that as easy as this looks to install from the marketing.....well it's not. I ordered two of these things and have them still sitting on the garage floor because I have to get a board to mount to the ceiling so the mounting hardware that was supposed to mount to the ceiling directly can actually work. I also have to get some new bolts that are actually threaded, I understand these are mass produced but have some kind of quality control if customers aren't even able to use the hardware included to put together your product. I actually have at least 3 of the nuts that have zero threading on them so how am I supposed to use that?To say the least this is a cheap setup for the price they charge and especially in the quality of the material. I can't speak for how it works because I havent been able to get to the hardware store yet to finish building these things.There has to be better products out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Installation Nightmare","review":"The installation instructions for this were a nightmare (major translation issues - we tried both the English and Spanish versions - both were BAD) and many of the nuts and bolts required for assembly were not included in the package.

The installation wasn't too difficult, although it did take several hours.When the rack has near 200 lbs on it the difficulty in cranking it upward is fairly high. I have overcome this by leaving the plastic handle off of the bottom and attaching a heavy duty drill in its place. The drill make raising and lowering the platform a breeze.I do wish it came with longer cables.

It is a 1 man operation from here on.Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"Bought this about 2 months ago, and I love it. At first, I was using a cordless drill to operate it. But it occurred to me that if I could find a corded drill and do some \\"engineeering\\", I could create my own electric lift. So now, after purchasing a used $15 corded drill (love craigslist), and a little creative use of a soldering gun, i have a switch right by my garage door openers that operates the lift (even variable speed!).The quality of the rack is not too bad. I do wish they'd done the edgerail-to-grid attachment a little more structural, but it's totally fine for the weight rating they put this at.Bottom line, I love this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Dangerous","review":"Worked great for the first year of ownership. Installed per instructions then one day the worm drive tension system gave way when my father was lowering the unit using the supplied crankshaft. It caught the corner of his forearm and tore his skin pretty badly. I used it with my HD drill and had no problem. I used it again with the crankshaft and had no problem. I then went back to the drill and it happened to me as well. It now just sits up there, locked, until I figure out what to replace it with or how to repair it safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this Lift and Risk your Life - One failure is one too many.","review":"I purchased and installed the Racor Heavy Lift according to instructions, except I bought new lag bolts as recommended by some users. I used the lift to store a Harmar trailer hitch scooter carrier #A300, which weighs 105 lbs. I figured this was OK, since the Racor is rated at 250 lbs. Less than six months after installing the Racor and hoisting up my scooter carrier for storage, all four cables broke and the lift and scooter carrier dropped to the garage floor, narrowly missing a family member and the hood of my new Subaru Outback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raccor Lift","review":"Bought this to use for lifting the hard top off of my Jeep. It works like a charm 1 person operation the included instructions are a bit vague and the hardware is horrible!! the crank is not very angle operating friendly it works best when used vertical. Do yourself a favor and replace all the nuts and bolts before you start assembling. Other then the horrible hardware the unit works great. It's a little tough to get the platform level if you have a low ceiling like i do, but i needed it to go all the way to the ground to hoist my top from the jeep onto the rolling cart i made. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to use for hard top removal and the plus i store the soft top on the shelf in the winter, and store the freedom panels on it in the summer. I would have rated it 5 stars had the hardware not been horrible and then directions so vague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under engineered for 250#","review":"I really like the idea and it will work for LIGHT loads. I just finished installing this product and found it to be under engineered to lift 250# as advertised. It seems to work reasonably well if the load is kept under 200#. The ceiling arms, cable, and platform seem to be okay, but the roller mechanism, particularly the roller gearbox and support are too light weight and try to twist with a full load. The gearbox ratio is such that it would be extremely difficult to crank it up with anything other than a very light load. I used a 1/2 drill as mentioned in the instructions, but you had to be very careful that the hook didn't ride up and bind. When this happened the lightweight rod used for the crank bent and I had to straighten it out (three times) and was lucky that I didn't sprain my wrist. If you use a drill, make sure you pull down on it while winding it up to keep the hook in place and do it in short bursts (not continuous) to keep it from riding up and binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lift","review":"We have two of them in our garage to safe space. Works great the bolts on the other hand are made of poor quality and I would reccomend that you purchase new ones prior to installing this. I would have giving 5 stars except for the bolts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Well Made","review":"I bought this lift to store my kayak overhead in my garage. The directions were not easy to follow. The photographs really lacked perspective. If it were not for the on-line videos, I would have returned it, and doubt another product. The metal hooks used to hold the frame elements together were of poor quality metal and not consistently shaped. These quality issues with the hooks made it very difficult to get the platform shelf square and level, even with the almost 3/4\\" of adjustability in length of the suspension bolts. Even after several attempts to square up the platform and adjust the length of the suspension wires, I was unable to get the platform square and level. That said, I was able to place my kayak on the platform and raise it into a reasonably stable position. Given all the time, effort and frustration to only reach a marginal storage position, this product is simply not worth the cost. I would not recommend or purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This storage lift works exactly as advertised. This is a great way to clear up some floor space by storing seasonal items up off the floor in the garage. I'm pushing the limits of the weight capacity with all of my ice fishing gear and still didn't have any issue using my cordless drill to wind it up to the ceiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea but could be built better......","review":"I bought two of these and like other reviewers, I too experienced poor hardware. Some of the J bolts were not long enough so I ended up designing and building my own floor platform out of 2X4s and plywood. I did use the metal beams to support the wood floor but I pitched the wire floor pieces. The end result was a much stronger platform with only 20 lbs additional weight. So far I have not experienced any trouble with the upper support unit but I will be keeping a close watch especially after reading Paul Cama's review. All in all I am satisfied with the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice idea and almost a great product","review":"Great idea, but without reading other reviews this would have been a pain to install. Tha biggest flaw are the lag screws to attach the lift frame to the rafters, the ones that come with it are useless. The second item is the instructions, I think a few pix of an installed unit would clear up a lot. Unit works great and I'll purchase another in the fall when the summer junk must disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage but ........","review":"My husband just ordered and installed this storage system and we are very pleased with the system but this is certainly a two person installation process and takes about 3 hours. We must have received the latest version of the system because he did not have any problems with the hardware and hole alignments. We certainly would order this system again but do get strong help in attaching it to the ceiling - it is a safety issue without help and two ladders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storage Rack","review":"The storage unit was exactly as advertised, fairly easy to assemble and attach to the garage ceiling. However, the lag bolts intended to secure the assembly to the ceiling were \\"soft,\\" made of poor quality steel and I had to replace them because the heads twisted off in the joists even with a pilot hole drilled. Also, the lifting mechanism (gear box) worm screw was stripped and as a result it was impossible to crank the storage up or down. This may have been a returned unit to the retailer given the condition of the box upon arrival. I contacted the original equipment manufacturer and they replaced the gear box without cost within a week. The lift is now installed and works as advertised - albeit the 4 star rating comes from all the self help required completing the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best garage storage system available!","review":"I purchased three Heavy Lift's from Amazon over a year ago and have been extremely pleased with these storage devices. They are ruggedly built and easy to install. The units come with a hand crank which works well but I have found that cutting the handle off and using a portable electric drill makes raising and lowering the unit a dream. One of my units has developed a slight roughness in the gearbox. I sent an email to Racor describing the problem and have learned that a new gearbox is already in route at no charge. This email was answered in less than 24 hours. A great product and wonderful customer support - it doesn't get any better. I give this storage unit my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE A QUESTION BUT DON'T KNOW WHO TO ASK!","review":"WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PRODUCT, AND I AM NOT A PRO AT INSTALLING THINGS BUT, DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION \\"CAN IT BE MOUNTED ON THE RAFTERS OF THE GARAGE IF THEY ARE SLANTED?

However installation was a pain primarily because the instructions that comes with the product are junk. I found myself using the installation video and the installation manual just to figure everything out. However I can say I probably can put the thing up in half the time now if I decided to buy another unit (one person job - about 6 hours most of that spent staring at the instructions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have purchased this product twice. I purchased the second lift when we moved to our new home. I liked the first one so much that I needed it for my garage in the new place. The only reason I do not give this product five stars is because it does take a while to install. But once it is installed, it works great. I recommend having a friend help you install. It goes much smoother that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"This storage rack is great for my garage, however, it took a long time to put together. It works great and for a single woman to have it on cable's is perfect but it takes a lot of strength to use the crank. I purchased two but only had room for one. The dimesions are wider than 4x4 because of the crank pulley system. A friend purchased the other one so I didn't have to send it back..yeah! So far it's working out perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage solution for the cost","review":"I read all the reviews before buying this rack. It took me a little over a hour to put it together & get it up. My garage ceiling is about 9 feet high, finished with drywall, and joists are 16 inch on center. The lag bolts worked fine for my application, just drilled each before like the directions said. I used an air powered wratchet to put it together & to hang it which worked very well. I have a small generator, push lawn mower, and a bunch of coolers on it. It is not the easiest thing to crank up, but down is a breeze. I am a bit surprised the lags did not come with washers, but otherwise it is very nice for the cost. Now that I see it in action, I will likely buy a second to put next to it. Can never have enough storage space :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"racor heavy lift","review":"I think it is a very nice product to have and every bit what the manufacturer said it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy to have, a little difficult to install.","review":"I am very happy with the product. It operates exactly as shown, and I am sure that if you use all of the bolts that you are given it would hold much more than 250 lbs. Unfortunately, one end of the main winding rod was rusted where the retaining washer is screwed in -- the replacement they sent me was also rusted. I bought a tap and fixed it myself. BTW, the Racor service was quick -- I got the replacement part within a week of calling them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect to clear your garage floor","review":"Had originally wanted an electric version, but bought this due to the price difference. I bought two of them and installed them side by side. Pretty easy to level (look almost like they are a single unit when raised). Not sure why some have reported difficulties leveling them etc. Installation isn't very difficult, if one is relatively handy. Took about two and a half hours from start to finish. Very happy with them so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cable lifted storage rack","review":"This met our expectations in every way but one - the directions were difficult to understand.

The masks are virtually non usable due to the inability of the single band to tightly hold the mask against your face.I would return them but it's just not worth the trouble for the $5 cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality disposable masks.","review":"This is an economical way to get a supply of decent quality basic general purpose masks. They are pre-strung with elastic bands and have a metal pinch strip across the nose to allow for some fit customizing. They are not rated for hazardous materials nor are they meant for anything but for use in well ventilated areas and non-toxic materials. Those who are allergic to dust withh find these to be a good option. I use them for cleaning when I'm working on items such as ceiling fan blades and mini blinds. I even wear one when I clean out the litter box so that the dust that is generated doesn't end up in my lungs and mouth.

The simplicity and the power are so evident that you immediately think about your own walls. We all have them. I know I did for sure. I knew that day at the bookstore that this humble book had changed my life and I find myself thinking about what I had read and I know that I am a much more tolerant person because of it.

It is written like a children's picture book, but it the adults that really like it. Not really a true allegory, but it has a lot of truth. It is the story of how we protect ourselves from other people. We think we are doing a good thing by building a beautiful wall, but then come to realize how we isolated ourselves. And then it shows that there is hope of becoming free, but not without tears. It is written with understanding. I put it in the same category as the book 'Hope for the Flowers'."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh yes","review":"I recently visited a friend I grew up with and was telling her how tough stuff in my life made me put up walls.

It covers most of the important historical aspects of carrier aviation in the US Navy, and if you aren't very familiar with our Navy it is a fair overview to start with.

Everyday Food, however, keeps things simple and the ingredients are usually those I would have in my house.On this DVD, my only complaint (if you can call it that) is when one of them makes carmelized bacon. Not only does it look so good that it's bad for you, the chef claims it is easy to make for breakfast before the kids go off to school (or something close to that)!

If you're interested in delving into the human mind this has some really great idea's and concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, insightful, but a little long","review":"Matt Ridley does a great job in this book, laying out theories of sexual behavior based on genetics and evolution by looking at organisms from insects to fish to peacocks. While he does take his time before discussing specifically human behavior, the time spend discussing genes and other creatures provides insights into his perspective and theory, and allows insightful comparison for our human nature. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A principle of evolutionary biology and its consequences","review":"Red Queen is a principle of evolutionary biology.

The \\"glue text\\" is sometimes humorous, sometimes boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of complicated","review":"I don't recommend if you want a simple book detailing sex and human nature. This book is kind of complicated, which is fine if I were reading it for a class. Not a casual read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was a bit thick at some points because it used a lot of terminology and more scientific talk than what I am used to reading (outside of college at least). It talked a lot about how various animals \\"court\\" each other which was interesting because some go through a lot of work just to have sex for 3 seconds and never see each other again (like with some of the birds the book mentioned). It also described how some animals are very monogamous and how humans fall somewhere in between the two extremes (polygamous and monogamous). One of the parts I enjoyed reading the most was about how in humans, ovulation is basically undetectable \\"a tiny change in the woman's temperature, undetectable before thermometers, and that's all.\\" (page 230) It's a longer read than some of the other books on this topic, but still brings to light a lot of great information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I can't add very much to the excellent reviews already posted. I'll just say quickly that I enjoyed very much the fresh insight into mating practices among the \\"lower animals\\" and among humans. I've read a lot about evolution and biology and so forth, and still found much new material here. I really enjoyed learning about how scientists finally discovered the rampant adultery among birds and how incredible they are at hiding it.Several reviewers warn about having to \\"make it through\\" the first part, and I certainly understand that if your primary interest is in the evolutionary origins of human sexuality. However, I really enjoyed the first part as well, because it provides a broad understanding of sex in evolution and give lots of fun examples about different behaviors and adaptations.Although I didn't give the book 5 stars (I reserve that for the best of the best), it showed me that Mr. Ridley is a great writer and I'll check out his other books (I think I'll start with Genome)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Genome and Origins of Virtue","review":"I think the book will be liked by a layman rather than people who have been working in this field.

Nevertheless a good read.

Different scientific theories are either given bizarre names, like \\"tangled bank\\", or attached to the names of the originating scientists. Tangential metaphors, or even poems, are thrown about willy-nilly. I became so confused trying to figure out what was what, and who was who, that I gave up about halfway through the book. For truly excellent expositions on developmental biology -- lucid, informative, and entertaining -- you cannot do better than the books by Dawkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with insight","review":"Matt Ridley has an extraordinary command of the English language.

Reviewed by a Paleo Fan","review":"This book is amazing. I like primitive thinking and this really gets me thinking outside the box. Everything makes so much sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subject matter, though difficult to read at first","review":"When I first got this book, it was very difficult for me to get through the first couple of chapters, which are very technical and deal with the most fundamental question of how organisms and sex emerged. So I skipped ahead a few chapters and started reading about the more specific human behaviors, much easier to digest.These days, I actually enjoy the first part of the book more. I went back and re-read his discussion of pre-historic times, and surprisingly that part is much more authoritative than his observations of contemporary human mating (which are better summarized by other scientists)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but convoluted","review":"I was disappointed with this book. While the primary thesis was indeed interesting, the book might better have been summarized in an article. The author clearly tried to cover too many areas of the evolution of sexual differences and consequently diluted the substance of his argument. The 2 stars might seem harsh but the other ratings of 5 stars were WAY too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book oversimplifies complex matters","review":"I thought this book oversimplified genders too much. How things work in a tribal society and modern western society is very different. Yet Matt takes studies from a tribal society and considers them universal. It is apples and oranges. You see gender roles being much more fluid and flexible in the modern day western society.I give this one star because it missinforms. You may become dumber by reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare for offence","review":"Ridley's conjecture and supposition swirling about the knowledge are deeply offensive to me. I guess that is what drew my interest, how much more can this author offend a human being, especially to those that are male, which is the focus of Ridley's writing, maybe because he would be unpopular if he tackled the other sex. Apologies made to those that are female, why? I can only guess that western society, political correctness etc have shaped the lens through which the author sees the world. Still, I was interested in what he had to say, I received something like a punch in the face. Indeed I'm flummoxed as to why other readers haven't expressed opinions of disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great song but BUY THE ALBUM.","review":"Trust me, you'd much rather buy the album than the single. The album is really good. It has one song called \\"Independent Lady\\" and its not only features Lil Zane rapping on. But it's also featuring Teddy Riley of Blackstreet. I really like the song. I think all three of them work really well together. I also really love the songs \\"Stupid (Nothing I Believe)\\", \\"I Adore\\", and \\"Big Things\\". Those are just my very, very favorites.
