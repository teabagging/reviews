So, looked for his earlier works and came up with \\"Midsomer's Murders.\\" Although, the \\"Foil's War\\" series was professionally more interesting to me as a historian of the World War II era, this series kept me entertained and guessing throughout as to who was responsible for these murders (always more than one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"every episode, every series, is Midsomer Murder Magnificient","review":"Television's most murderous county is Midsomer, England, and the show has been solving multiple murders in episodes for over a decade. John Nettles, Midsomer's DCI Tom Barnaby, is the cop leading the investigation team. Expect some smiles (& LOL), a touch of romance, some awesome scenic footage of beautiful village life in England, of course crime mystery, some blood-but not too much, and a sensational support cast with always the sub-plots through relationships. If you are new to Midsomer Murders, they are based on books by Caroline Graham. And many leading British guest stars, as huge stars beg to be on an episode to kill or be killed.I have never watched a less-than GREAT episode of Midsomer Murders."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Closed-Caption?","review":"British TV shown in the US is usually superior to American-made drama. Unfortunately the fact that the British tend to mumble so much, yet seem to usually refuse to have Closed Captioning on their DVDs, surely limits sales.The British are likely *never* to speak clearly (at least not to American-English \\"ears\\"), but they certainly can *write* clearly, e.g., in Closed Captioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Dark to View","review":"One of the DVD's ( Deaths Shadow)is so dark it is almost impossible to see.

The English village settings are lovely and colorful. The main detective (delightfully played by John Nettles) and his family are exceedingly well realized and enjoyable folks to spend time with. His sidekick is engaging and offers a fine contrast (Daniel Casey more than holds his own). The guest artists provide a great guessing game (\\"isn't that so-and-so from such-and-such?\\"). And the plots are well constructed and keep you guessing until the end.The only reason I'm not giving this a full five stars is because the DVD set contains no bonus materials to speak of. Hopefully, that will be remedied in future editions. The Brother Cadfael DVDs have Derek Jacobi's audio commentary. Any reason why the Midsomer Murders DVDs could not have interviews with Nettles or someone else involved in the production?That one caveat aside, I highly recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does mystery like the Brits!","review":"Midsomer Worthy is a small English village much like Miss Marple's St. Mary Meade. But in this quaint seeminly benign village evil is ever present. It is up to DCI Barnaby and his young Sgt., Troy, to find the evil source and bring him/her to justice. This series is very enjoyable but not fast paced. You will be charmed by the English country side; the cobblestoned streets; the flower gardens; and the people.

This book was totally lost on me. What was the miracle? I won't spoil it for those who haven't read yet, but that kind of power, divine intervention..I could do without. The aftermath was bleak and unfulfilling for the reader and the characters. I got the feeling McBride didn't know what the end should be. It opens with a great hook..Hector's cryptic words \\"I know\\" and finished with my own, \\"who cares?\\" The characters were cliche, the language wasn't true to the time period, and the writing wasn't that great.

There were other repercussions, too, and as Crux opens, we see the first of them; a dying Michael tries to pass his power into Elaine, but the resultant explosion sends both Elaine and Lucifer into another realm entirely, leaving the way clear for the Lilim to attempt to size control of heaven. As if Fenris weren't enough of a problem. While all that's going on, Lucifer's giving Elaine a crash course in how to use her newfound power; she'll need all of it if she's going to hold worlds together in the face of such an assault. Very, very good stuff, this, and well worth your time if you're a Sandman fan (and aren't we all?). ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, bad title","review":"I enjoyed the book very much and would highly recommend it. As another reviewer suggested, however, the book's subtitle is misleading. The focus of the book is one the Civil War in Louisiana generally and on the military career of Dick Taylor. Both subjects are very interesting. I have a peculiar interest in the Battle of Mansfield. The treatment of that battle is relatively brief and not entirely clear, to me at least, perhaps because of the absence of maps. If you're not disappointed by what the book isn't, you'll probably enjoy what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"I found this book a terrible disappointment. The author jumps back and forth through time to the point of complete confusion. It is also poorly researched and inaccurate. Imagine my surprise when the author states that Fort Donnelson was positioned near the point where the Cumberland River empties into the Mississippi River. The Cumberland river empties into the Ohio River and no where near where Fort Donnelson was located. The author, a southerner, wants the reader to believe that the Civil War was caused by social discord between Puritans and Celts. Slavery, in his view, slavery was not a cause at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Martin Mull more than he does himself...","review":"I haven't heard this album in about 25 years.

Personally, I find it criminal that anyone would have the audacity to release something this bad, let alone sell it at a price comparable to other shows that have pristine production qualities.Secondly, aside from the unacceptable production quality, the show itself was dull and uninteresting. I cannot recall a single episode that I found to be especially good. When it comes to private eye type shows, there are so many others that are way, way better in every respect, i.e., writing, acting, directing and guest stars. I can see why this show did not last long on the air."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Rate Packaging/Third Rate Product","review":"For anyone used to classic television show DVDs such as Perry Mason and Twilight Zone, these Checkmate shows are terrible beyond belief. Although the packaging is first rate, the DVD product is third rate at best. There has been no remastering, the prints are not clear, the sound is hit or miss, and it wouldn't be surprising if we were to learn that they are not even produced from original negatives, although I have no idea how they were produced. As much as I like the Checkmate show, I watched two episodes and said forget it, no more. To watch any more of them would be a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Waste your Money on Checkmate, an Inferior Product...","review":"I absolutely do not recommend this DVD series to anyone. The film quality is horrendous, and the writing is inferior. Even though it has well-known actors, the shows are boring. I own the entire Perry Mason series that is available so far, and Checkmate does not compare in the quality of film, or the plots. The price, $51.99, is excessive for such an inferior product, and I regret wasting the money. Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful 60's Series!","review":"I am glad to see this series released to Video....another iconic series from the 60's, which holds special memories for me...again we have series stars, who for the most part were in the beginning or near beginning of their careers, with Doug McClure going on to the Virginian series a few years later, and Sebastian Cabot going on to the butler role in Family Affair. There was much location filming, and as the synopsis indicates, the beautiful and sometimes haunting vistas of San Francisco and the bay area. I have visited there and it is truly one of the most beautiful places in the States... The stories were for the most part very well done with wonderful guest stars from time to time and terrific acting...A welcome addition to the other series of that era...Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Checkmate Quality Review","review":"Checkmate was one of my favorite TV shows. I saw the complete series was available for purchase and I jumped at the chance to own it. I was deeply disappointed in the quality of the video, it was obviously not remastered. I have purchased other vintage TV series, Alfred Hitchcock TV series for example and I found the quality to be excellent.

I expereienced a recent incident where a properly seated and tightened rabbeting bit came loose and was propelled at a very high velocity. The bit glanced off the router base, struck the workpiece, and ended up being lodged in the ground. Fortunately no one was hurt! Previous to this \\"incident,\\" the collet would fail to release bits, requiring a great amount of hand force to insert or remove the bits. Yet the same collet will not hold a bit in place during rotation.Due to this substantial weakness in the design, I cannot give more than a one star rating of this router. Run like hell from this one. A user would be better served spending his/her money on DeWalt or Bosch. Even my cheap $80 Ryobi has never presented any safety issues like the Porter-Cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porter Cable 693 VSPK","review":"I recently purchased one of these routers from you. I find that this is one of the most user unfriendly routers I have ever purchased, and I have five from Ryobi to Chacago machine. Right now my knuckles are bleeding from changing the bit. Had I known that you have to remove the entire motor from the housing and use two wrenches just to change the bit, and then put the whole thing back together, I would have never bought it.

I didn't even get through the tiny starter box of nails that came with the nailer before it died! I took the nailer to a guy who repairs tools and he said that it would cost more to repair than to buy new.

She is supposed to be a Private Eye sent by his sister. The motives of all the villains are not threshed out clearly, and the book just has too many inconsistencies. The characters also lack depth-I mean, this is Harlequin but they should still be something other than their jobs or medical conditions-we never do get to find out why they fall in love so intently in the first place seven years ago, let alone now. And the fact that they already love each other diminishes the tension.

I put it under the parchment paper, with the point sticking up through the paper. (I always use parchment, greased on both sides, esp for chocolate cakes which are notorious for sticking.)The flower nail didn't deform the cake -- no hole to plug -- and cooked the center just as well. It was easy to remove by flipping the layer onto a wire rack. I also always use insulating strips around the outside of my pans (from Wilton and others) to slow down the outer edges while the middle catches up, resulting in more even tops and more moist outer edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for large pans","review":"This item is needed if you are making a cake in a LARGE or DEEP pan.

So I attempted to use the keyboard to steer. When I tap left or right, I go about 90 degress the direction I turned, crashing into whatever is to the left or right of me. Everything else if fine, but everything else is impossible to experience when I can't race because I'm always hitting building and trees because of the super sensitive controls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of attitude, but no game","review":"Midnight Club 2 has decent graphics if you have the hardware, but it's a complete failure as a racing game. All of your computer opponents fly past you even on straight stretches with the throttle maxed. The damage to your car and others is completely unrealistic, and there's no difference in the way any of these cars drive and handle. I was disappointed with the driving physics in EA's NFS Hot Pursuit, but this game makes it look like a racing simulation in comparison. It's not even good enough to be considered an arcade racer as the keyboard controls are overly sensitive and there's no way to adjust the settings.The PS2 version got a lot of positive reviews, but something was lost in the translation to the PC. If you're looking for a racing game with good graphics and driving physics, NFS Porsche Unleashed is the one to beat. This game doesn't come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC version is really lacking...","review":"The game itself is a lot of fun - it is extremely fast and wild. It is certainly not realistic - you can crash over and over again at high speeds without getting damaged, but it is an arcarde game and not a simulation. The main complaints I have are with the graphics and the controls. I have a very good graphics card (GeForce 5900), but there are no video options for this game! I'm stuck at a low resolution, and it looks terrible by todays standards. Also, there is no way to adjust brightness or contrast, and in a game that takes place primarily in the dark it is often impossible for me to see where I'm going. I don't appreciate having to adjust the displays on my monitor just for this one game. For the controls, I have a force feedback steering wheel, but for some reason I can't configure the use of the gas or brake pedal! Overall, a very disappointing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game To Change The Genre?","review":"\\"Not so good\\" pretty much sums it up. I have a high performance, new computer and it still does not perform well. The graphics are, at best, sub-par, especially in comparison to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City or even to GTAIII. Either of these would be a much better buy for anyone interested in exciting computer games. It was quite smart and a nice feature to have motorcycles and nitrto boosts and the whole idea of the game is quite good especially after the \\"Fast and the Furious\\" movies. However, this game simply does not live up to Rockstar's reputation or previous games.

The commercials showed a very polished product of great desire, but it looks and plays like a game you used to see in the 1990's. Even with a top of the line gaming setup the graphics are very pixelly: there aren't any options to change your graphic settings. When you're driving around the controls on the car offer no realistic experience. When you tap the key to go right, you pretty much take a 90 turn. Compare that to the new Need For Speed Underground, and Midnight Club II looks like something your grandpa should play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Being a fan of urban fantasy, and after reading all of the positive reviews on Amazon for this series, I was excited to read the first book in the series. As described, there's a great plot. All of the Celtic myths are returning to Earth, and technology is failing. A band of five are destined to take part in the upcoming battles. Unfortunately, the story is dragged down by flat characters and limp dialogue. Ultimately, the book was disappointing. I will not be reading the second and third book in the series, because although I'm interested to see how the author resolves the plot, I can't stand spending any more time with the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Urban Fellowship Tale","review":"Urban fantasy meets Celtic mythology. Or the Fellowship of The Ring adapted to modern day Britain.Enjoyed this novel, found the characters believable and the story gripping at times.I liked how the myths were represented as awe inspired and terrible. Not the cute, \\"Disney-esk\\" treatment of some romantic writers.These were the stories as they've always been, warnings and characters you should be afraid of - be very afraid.The group who form this fellowship have nothing in common, some are not sympathetic personalities and all are flawed.In true epic fashion they embark on a journey and face all sorts of dangers along the way.The author does an excellent job, showing how authorities in this day & age would handle a supernatural event that is too visible to cover up - the spin that is given to carnage as a \\"mass pile up\\" on a motor way - when infact a dragon let loose with firey breath among heavy traffic.I look forward to the next installment in the Age of Misrule."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rollercoaster of Excitement","review":"I whole-heartedly enjoyed this book. The characters especially linger in my mind for they were not what one would commonly consider heroes, they are merely people struggling with their own internal conflict and coming together against the greater evil.The plot is not predicatable - although the characters do spend an awlfully large amount of time running away (which is reasonable given the unsurmountable odds rising against them). The seemingly excessive amount of vomitting and falling unconscious did detract somewhat from my intense enjoyment, but all-in-all, I found it a highly addictive, unpredictable read. And the ending is just the sort of ending I enjoy ^^ But I'm not giving away any hints except to say - I want the second book and I want it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change of pace","review":"This book was different than most of the fantasy books I have read. If I had to describe this work I would say a more sophisticated Stephen Lawhead.With that being said, the reason this book did not get 5 stars from me is because I felt that the book was extremely long winded. I realise that the author was laying ground work for the trilogy but there was to much fluff and not enough action.I will definately pick up the second book to see how he evolves the characters but at this point if book two doesn't move along a little faster I will probably pass on book three."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Premise - Reads like it is written by a 16 year old","review":"This book is readable, but the writing is hackneyed and a bunch of the narrative elements are annoying.

Finally all the elements dealing with any sexual tension or encounter seem gratuitous and extremely awkward.

This is one of the best histories published regarding Latinos in Texas. He does an excellent job of joining the available archival information with previously published research. A must read for anyone who wants to know more about Texas history. This is not just a story about ethnic differences, its a story about land, violence, and power.I first heard about the Plan of San Diego at a Hispanic genealogy conference in Texas about 20 years ago. A now famous academic had given a talk at the conference -- we had a long conversation afterwards and he told me about the event in South Texas. I was shocked, thinking I knew so much about Texas history and did not know about the Plan, Luis de la Rosa and of course the 5,000 or so that were killed in retaliation for the insurrection.Johnson did a great job of presenting this part of lost history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Fabulous","review":"Finally a book that makes sense and has real world application!

We will see.As for the color, they create a standard yellow light. The Sport version of this same bulb is a nice white color and somewhat brighter, but the rated lifetime is 450 hrs or 50,000+ miles.For an on sale price of some $20 for two, these are a reasonable choice.

Those bulbs, though, lasted less than a year.This GE bulb is the same color as OEM, but GE claims 30% more luminance than OEM.

Through Oliver Baldwin, his shipmates and other characters, factual and fictional, one can clearly see and feel the action of battle; the peacefulness of the starry sky and calmly rolling sea as witnessed from the deck during the night watch or the power of the sea during a storm; and feel the excitement, fear, anxiety, honor, glory, and maturation of the 14 year old lad from Philadelphia to the able seaman and man of honor. A great read that leaves one awaiting Mr. White's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song! #1 love song","review":"This single of C��line contains 2 songs The Power Of Love and No Living Without Loving You.

Yes, there aren't that many songs on here, but you can still get that great feeling from watching Buddy explode onstage with G.E. Smith ans the SNL band.

There are only two animated stories which are weird (stupid) to say the least. On the menu, the voices don't match with the choppy animation. I was so disappointed, I threw the DVD away.

The next two stories were read aloud over still pictures that changed occasionally. The last story was an old episode from the Aladdin series on the Disney channel. I suspect the Ariel story was an old episdode, too. They weren't even good stories! I would have preferred all the stories to be the still kind if they were at least original.

Ariel and Jasmine's \\"short stories\\" are literally one of the shows taken from their corresponding mini series (\\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Aladdin\\") that aired on the Disney channel a while back. Poor quality and confusing story lines. The other two are just images taken from the movies and are told in a \\"story book\\" format. No animation, just the princess' voice.

Please pay attention to the common thread in all of these reviews posted so far... this is a money-grab of re-hashed and utterly lame content. It looks awful, too... like they created the DVD from some Disney employee's VCR tape of old episodes (and the only two animated stories here are just that - old episodes of previously broadcast junk). The only new animation here are the animated menus... and there's nothing special about them. Stay away from this one! I'm not looking forward to volume 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie is not worth buying. It has four stories and only two are actually animated.

BUT, I found 2 very long stories (one of Jasmine and one of Ariel) apx 30 min each (the other two stories were apx 10 min each and very poor animation), both were very frightening for a 2 yr old. The DVD did not have a rating on it (like G, PG, etc) and there was no description on the back explaining the stories had monsters and scary scenes in it. I feel it would have been better if the DVD had listed a short decription of each story on the back and a suggested age should have been printed as well. I would say this DVD is good for 9 and up.

The fact that the marriage remained unconsumated for a very long time, that her husband would be that tolerent with this annoying female was unrealistic. The whole book was just boring, unbelieveable and lacked any spark...skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot weak and book full of contradictions - heroine total b****.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The heroine, Jennifer, answers an ad for a mail order bride, and travels all the way to Montana from New York City, to then want to return almost as soon as she reaches her destination. She is a witch to her husband, and I actually was hoping he would get an annulment so we could move on to a more likeable heroine.The hero, Luc, starts out as being an obnoxious bully, but soon turns into an extremely caring and patient man. He was so patient in fact, that I found it hard to believe he would put up with his wife's behavior, especially when she leaves him to open a boarding house in town. I thought he would be shouting, \\"Hallelujah! and good riddance\\" from his roof top and shaking her dust from his doorstep when she left.All in all, I was very disappointed with this one, but I would recommend this author's other works, as they are far better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic early 70's funky sounds...","review":"Bubbly and cohesive CD which reminds me a bit of the Meters or the Neville Brothers stripped of a bit of their gumbo.

The goggle has a two-speed fan. Using in Hi does not improve the problem.The Smith Knowledge goggles have a top of foam around the small fan. I believe is to allow the forced air to escape with the moisture from inside the goggle. When the foam get wet it clogs and the moisture keeps inside fogging the glasses.I bought a no fog cloth from Smith also, trying to minimize the problem, wiped dry the glasses as per the instructions. It didn't made any difference, the glasses got foggy anyway.The Goggle in the actual picture does not match the product, the picture shows the OTG ( over the glass ) with no fan model.Not worth the more than $ 100.00 it cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meticulous science","review":"It's good to see a book on nutrition that has applied the principles of science so vigorously.

Also, there are two extra \\"street\\" pieces that I suspect would be used to connect other Radiator Springs buiding sets to this one. However, when added to this piece by itself these pieces have a tendancy to come off of the main building, so we set them aside for when we buy more of the town.

This particular book is about the pioneering of southern Florida, a subject that must have interested Powell, because he retired there in his later years. In this story, you'll find the characters not only battling each other, but also the elements, as souther FL must have been difficult country to tame. Read this book. You'll enjoy it from cover to cover, and like most Powell books, wish it would never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game that is cross platform.","review":"This is a hybrid game combining first person/third person shooter elements with real time strategy. One person can become the commander of the forces placing buildings while everyone else may fight on the field against the other team. There can only be one commander on each team. This game was created by S2Games, and you no longer have to purchase it (in fact it is better that you don't as this will no longer work online as the community version does). S2 Games has also released Savage2, and it too is free for download, so you should not purchase this game anymore. The game is good for LAN parties as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Times!","review":"I purchased this because I was curious to know my blood type and it sounded like a cool way to do it yourself.The steps are simple to read and follow, the tools used are easy to handle.I psyched myself up and couldn't prick my finger so i had to have my sister do it for me. I think she enjoyed it a little too much. At first blood was not coming out but I pushed from the base of my finger to the tip a few times to work some blood out and plenty came. I had to do that for each test circle and it was no problem. That's the only thing they don't tell you, to massage the blood out of your finger tip.I'd recommend this for anyone who isn't afraid of a little blood because it's easy to use and doesn't take long.By the way I am A Positive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Needle did not work, difficult, if not impossible, to get results.

My two options were (a) this card for $13, or (b) a lab test for $100.The card was the easier of the two options, as I suspected I have a 'common' blood type. If you suspect you have a rare or unusual blood type, you'll have to pony up the cash. The card will do basic ABO and Rhesus +-, but the Rhesus test isn't super sensitive.The most important part of doing the test yourself is: Read. The. Directions. Then read them again. The ones I got were probably translated from Dutch to German to English, making me scratch my head a few times. So make sure you _understand_ the instructions.Once you know what you're supposed to be doing, it's easy. The lancet is surprisingly effective. I was expecting a small puncture but it made a decent sized hole.

UNFORTUNATELY, I couldn't get enough blood (despite warming hands, despite picking the thin-skinned side of my finger, despite squeezing) with that pathetic, one-shot lancet they put in. No, I'm not a retard - I've use similar kits other times. Problem with this is: you need 4 big drops, but the single lancet they provide is too small and one shot. Thus, they need to put in a 2nd or 3rd lancet.

You're paying $14 basically, for a piece of paper. At least jazz it up and make the packaging nice. But no, it was very plain. Strike 3, no results. My girlfriend is an acupuncturist, so she did have spare lancets on hand. She was able to prick herself and draw plenty of blood, but her blood didn't react with ANY of the circles. In the directions, they said that this \\"could\\" happen. And if it did, just go to your doctor and get a blood test done.So, overall, horrible experience.

First of all, the lancing device did not work; I twisted, I pulled, I pushed- there was no needle. It must have broken off with the cap. Luckily, I have a diabetes test kit and used the lancing device from my own kit. Still, I simply could not get enough blood flowing out to do the test. Maybe I just don't bleed very well, but I usually have no problem testing for my blood-sugar level. Eldoncard's test does ask for a whole lot of blood.

This has been a hit, not only with my grandson, but the whole family. We can readily see what coins we still need to collect, and he has actually enjoyed learning the details about the individual states (which fits well with his fascination with highway maps).

Maybe Sharon's was defective, but the quarters fit perfectly in the folder I got. :-) They only require slight pressure from your thumb to make them fit tightly. If you need to remove them, slight pressure on the back will raise the quarter enough to pry it out with your fingernail.

I'd have to say that it was only a matter of a day or two at the most that I started to see growth. Within a week flowers started to appear and a short time after that, a few berries emerged. The plants are very healthy and the berries are coming. Runners have also started. Out of 26 plants, 25 made it and are doing well. I would definitely buy these plants again.

This book is autobiographical and introduces the reader to an incredible woman. To know her is to have been touched by an unforgetably alive and creative personality.

I'd have to agree with the Producer, Nick Gold who wrote about his experience recording these artists: \\"A song would end and you'd realize you'd been holding your breath, hypnotized\\".This is exactly the reaction I felt. This music puts you under a spell.There is very little vocalization. There is the guitar, the Kora and on occasion, an additional instrument or two. It is an amazing accomplishment that this CD was made with no second takes. Nothing was edited.

Sorry to say, I found it disappointing and bordering on irritating.While the production values are wonderful, with a warm and plangent sound, there's only so much you can do on two chord harmony. Tracks 2 through 5, plus a couple of others later on, are basically long improvisations on two chords that are played repeatedly by Tour�� while Diabate plays beautiful filigree over the top. If that's your thing, buy this album and you'll enjoy it. But without even the benefit of vocals to enliven the harmonics, I found myself fast-forwarding to the next track, and then fast-forwarding again. Some of the later tracks sound like reworkings of tracks from Talking Timbuktu. Altogether, too repetitive for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for My Headphone Amp","review":"I was using a Little Dot MK V Headphone with Senn HD580 Headphones.

I tried an isolation gadget for theRCA connectors connected to the headphone amp. This worked, but I was using this setup for playing a digital piano through my laptop andcould hear a change in timbre in the bass notes. Makes sense, right? An isolation transformer on a signal line can act as a low-pass filter.So next I tried the HumX between the headphone amp and the power strip. Problem solved and the group loop hum was gone.

I opened the package, read the short, simple directions and plugged it in. Amazingly, no more hum. There was no loss in sound quality or volume. In fact, it sounded the best it ever had.

I received the Hum X two days ago, inserted it b/t my amp and power center and the speaker was dead silent, so much so that I checked my amp to make sure the power was on.

If you're used to assembling tents and semi-prebuilt furniture, you won't have a problem with putting this together. However, don't expect a young child to be able to assemble it, and, as the toy is marketed towards being transportable when unassembled, the idea of a parent repeatedly reassembling this playset every time junior totes it along with him doesn't particularly thrill me. The toy also comes with a single-projectile shooter (which may be lost), a thread rope for Batman to swing from, and a chute to fall through. Batman himself comes with multiple points of articulation (head, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, neck).

I mailed the camera back to Canon for repair and less than six months later, the lens broke again while I was changing batteries.

This camera is highly recommended for those looking to have a camera to just have around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overall Camera","review":"This camera is great. Image quality at high resolution is great! The movie mode is a nice feature for the outdoors, but quality indoors is not great. Menu option are fairly easy to learn. If you are not a camera expert the auto mode will adjust all the settings for you. My only complaints are that the 8MB CF card that comes with it is too small (only about 11 picts at high res) and the batteries that are shipped with the camera won't last but a few hours. I plan to get a larger CF card and rechargable NiMH batteries.

Despite having a built-in mike and even having an icon on the display to represent a picture with an audio attachment, you cannot do voice annotation.

The best skit on there by far is the Creature Comforts and it's only 5 minutes long. Hardly worth it if you ask me.

The film was done by the creator of the popular \\"Wallace & Grommit\\" series. It is an documentatry style interview with various British zoo animals about their living conditions. Very hilarious. My favorite is the Brazilian big cat (panther?) that discusses needing space. Although the turtles are a close second with their antics in the background.The other three shorts are watchable, but only so-so. I would not recommend \\"Adam\\" or \\"Not Without My Handbag\\" for children. \\"Creature Comforts\\" would be okay -- but the humor would most likely be over their heads. The remaining \\"Watt's Pig\\" is okay for kids (I guess) but a bit boring for adults.The DVD had the opportunity to show how the art was done, etc... which would have been very interesting.

I think the book is a good introduction to the language for beginners or those who know just a little ordinary VB, and who are willing to spend the time going chapter-to-chapter.

Script was shoddily written and character development turned out to be very weak, not to mention a complete lack of credibility/chemistry between Wynter & Perez in their portrayal of Alma Mahler's & Oscar Kokoschka's tumultuous whirlwind affair.You'd be better off spending your money on books on the Austrian art scene instead. My top recommendations - (1) Wiener Werkstatte: Design in Vienna 1903-1932 by Christian Branstatter (Abrams) and (2) Kokschka and Alma Mahler by Alfred Weidinger (Prestel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting revelations...","review":"Although \\"Bride of the wind\\" focused on the romantic adventures of Vienna's renowned femme fatale Alma Mahler, it also provided us with interesting data on such famous artists as Gustav Mahler, Oskar Kokoschka, Franz Werfel etc... The cinematography could be considered a bonus, but what I particularly enjoyed was the charming music score. On a side note, this was Sarah Wynter's first leading role after \\"Lost Souls\\", \\"6th Day\\"..., and her European-style beauty was quite fascinating -- especially in the steamy love scenes (...) Only after watching this movie did I look up Ms. Wynter's profile on IMDB to realize she was born in Newcastle, Australia. Another pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bride breaks wind...","review":"A pretty but pretty dreadful movie full of nyah-ha-ha acting that trivializes some of the most brilliant people & movements in art & music of the 20th century. Walter Gropius (the giant of modern architecture & leader of the Bauhaus) suffers in particular from a particularly fatuous impersonation while Jonathan Pryce gives his usual petulantly effete performance as a very Bloomsbury Mahler. Worst of all is the actress who plays Alma. In no way does she convey the temperament of a woman of the epoch of Freud & Mahler to say nothing of someone on intimate terms with them. Lord knows what Kokoschka or Mahler or Gropius or Werfel would have seen in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"average success","review":"Folks, i wanted this movie to work. The austrian art scene of that era was very interesting, and fireworks should have sparked.I'm not sure if it was the screenplay or the editing which failed here. Period pieces can succeed when executed well (i.e. Merchant/Ivory productions) and being helmed with a firm director's hand. Alas, the film only succeed in its parts and not as a whole.Regardless, its always good to see Jonathan Pryce, and the Perez character seemed to walk in from a far more interesting production going on somewhere else down the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least Tom Lehrer had wit . . .","review":"This film is nice to look at and has a nice score. All in all, the production values - the set design, the costuming, the score - are wonderful.But - the script is poorly written; it seems as though the author found a collection of quotes by the various characters, and then set out to write a movie about Alma, casting her as a victim.But Alma was no victim - she was beautiful, intelligent, and in possession of an innate ability to attract men of the highest caliber - and she wasn't afraid to use it.Ms. Wynter completely fails to capture the wit and intelligence of Alma, and as a result, she comes off more like a fin du siecle version of Paris Hilton.Will someone please take the sets and costuming of this film, and give us a movie which shows us the real Alma - not this wimpy, self-pitying emotional midget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but the reviewers were right!","review":"Many Amazon reviewers seem determined to rescue this film from the \\"savage\\" reviewers. Sadly, though, the reviewers were mostly right. At times the film can look quite well. But the script is so banal that it invites parody. And as Alma, a woman who fascinated a series of the greatest artistic figures of her time (and by no means only the three that she married), Beresford cast an Aussie \\"girl next door\\" who was pretty enough but projected not an ounce of charisma. Perhaps the best spirit in which to watch this film is as a case study in how an experienced and frequently-successful director was able to get so many different things wrong in a single project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I got this for my daughter when she was six months old.She played with it, laughed at it, and ate it until it wasdestroyed.

As an Arab woman with a psychological disorder, she is an outsider.As Salwa Bakr notes in The Wiles of Men women are often seen as silly and crazy when they have psychological disorders.Although the depiction of the war may not be as detailed or accurate as many wish, that is not what Al-Shaykh is trying to convey with this novel.She is showing how the war is a catharsis for poor Zahra. While everyone's attention is towards the gory and war fears, Zahra is not pointed out as crazy and strange, she is able to live her own destiny.This book is a page turner...highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book That Fails to Live Up to Its Story","review":"The Story of Zahra is a book that could have been great but ends up being a mishmash of cliches and stereotypes. Not only does it not accurately portray Lebanon or its history, it also incorporates most of the Orientalist stereotypes about Arabs and Arab culture.The character Zahra is not a sympathetic or even empathetic character and is reduced to being a very one-dimensional victim. She is a very pale shadow of the main characters of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Siri Hustvedts's The Blindfold. Zahra's monolgues are badly written and reminscent of a teenagers diary ramblings. None of the other characters have any dimension, being flat caricatures.The ending of the novel is quite shocking and powerful, had the author focused more on bringing the rest of the novel up to the level of the ending, it would have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled novel about Lebanon...","review":"Hanan Al-Shyakh's \\"Story of Zahra\\" is a bit muddled, and tries to be a feminist book, but it only manages to make Zahra look like a perpetual victim in an misogynist part of the world.

Then she flees to a war-torn Beiruit, and falls in love with a sniper. Love, violence and death then ensue.

Even if it were to happen, it would happen to one in a million. I wonder why she got so much attention over a lame book. To me it was more like a lousy re-write of an American novel.

My purchase arrived last night and I was blown away that it only included the boom (no spraying unit). I had looked at a very simular product at Agri Supply that included the entire unit. I have not tried the boom out yet as I guess I will have to buy a sprayer unit for it to work. I have ordered many things thru Amazon and have always been 100 percent satisfied. This is very upsetting. I feel like the product was not properly represented.

The plot is weak and barely believable. The details of the interactions of the corporate leadership of the HMO and the physicians has no basis in reality. The assignments of the nursing employees and physicians to various departments of the hospital is not realistic - a highly trained nurse would not rotate his or her assignments in and out of an ICU nor would a physician spend time in an outpatient clinic, emergency room, operating room and ICU. These persons are too highly trained to work in several different areas each of which demands a high level of expertise and training. The conclusion likewise is almost an afterthought that would not occur in real life.I have enjoyed Lescroart's other works.

It's hard to tell much about the book because I concentrate so much on Robert Lawrence, the reader. I thought at first that things would get better, once Lawrence became familiar with the work. It's as if he is reading for the first time. He pauses when conversation does not warrant a pause, as if he were turning the page every couple of minutes, pauses, and continues reading.

My problems with this book are :1 : The author spends about 70% of the book talking about the sorroundings of Rennes-le-Chateau, telling us about lots of small villages and paths. But there is no map in the book!!!This makes it impossible to follow the author unless you actually live in the area.2 : The model mentioned in the title only occupies the last 30 pages. This is a shame, because it seems that this is where the author has some superior knowledge.3 : There is a lack of structure in the book. It seems like a conversation has been written in form of a book.My conclusion(!!) : Buy this if you own all other books on Rennes-le-Chateau. It has some speciel knowledge. But otherwise avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have used Cetaphil cream for years, and it's the only thing that's keeps my body moisturized.

I'm allergic or sensitive to every other product I've tried but this. I will continue to purchase this product at Amazon until it becomes too expensive or I develope a reaction to it. I've used it for two years now with no problem and I have very sensitive skin!

This works great-try it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for dry, sensitive skin","review":"I have tried tons and tons of different moisturizers. I don't even want to know all the money I have spent on products. I have sensitive skin and my legs get irritated from shaving. I also dont like to wear really heavy lotions that leave me feeling sticky. After basically using lotions a few times and then going on to the next one, I decided to try this. I heard so many good things about it. It has a really nice thick consistency, which scared me at first. But it wasn't heavy and didnt leave my skin feeling sticky, at all! It left it soothed and smooth feeling. I just started using it under my eyes instead of my expensive under eye cream, and I swear it's doing a better job! This stuff will also last you a long time. No more switching around and throwing 1/2 used jars away anymore! I found a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Defense of Carson Napier","review":"This was the first book in Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"Carson of Venus\\" series. It was the last major series that ERB created, 20 years after he created \\"John Carter of Mars\\". In this book, Carson Napier builds a rocketship and sets out for Mars, but ends up on Venus. He has a series of episodic adventures, and falls in love with a beautiful princess along the way (which happens in just about every ERB book). Fun stuff, if you are a fan of this sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Firefly alive","review":"Good reading material for a fresh outlook on a series that should still be in existance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Purchase","review":"Firefly is fast becoming a pop cultural phenomenon, and Finding Serenity is a vital addition to any fan's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, brief, and brutal","review":"I chose this book on a whim. I enjoy essays, and I thought it would be a pleasant way to spend an evening. I found something more. This book is entertaining, funny, and interesting. If you do not agree with a writer, don't worry, another will start in a few pages. All of the essays are well-written and most have their tongue firmly planted in their cheek.Granted, if you are not a fan of Firefly then this would be wasted on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers to so many questions...","review":"This book really digs right into it - Where did Reavers come from? Why is everybody speaking Chinese and yet we rarely see any Asians? Should Mal be shoving people into the engines? Did Fox really kill the show or was the mixture of sci-fi and The Old West doomed from the start? Yes, yes, but the old Star Trek wasn't REALLY a mixture of sci-fi and western.From the Tick, to gender issues, to could the crew of Serenity kick the butts of the crew of the first Enterprise this book is tons of fun. The movie, of course, answers some of the questions for us, but the book is still great anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing how far you can get ripping off someone else.","review":"A scholarly work on the content of Firefly? Amazing how far you can get from just ripping off with very few minor changes the concepts behind an anime called Outlaw Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll want to watch the series again.","review":"Since this book was released we have seen the Serenity movie, and many questions raised herein have been answered. That being said, the essays in the book point out many obscure points that a true fan will enjoy. After reading the book, you'll want to watch the series again, and will pick up much more. This book made the movie Serenity and the Firefly series all the more enjoyable for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides some closure for fans","review":"The thing about this book is that when it's good it's really good, and when it's bad....well it's awefull. It is a compilation of essays from various people about the show Firefly, meaning multiple authors. Now when you have multiple authors your quickly going to find yourself loving how some write and detesting how others do. So the parts you enjoy never last long enough, and the parts that you don't enjoy, well they drag on. This is certainly a worthy purchase for fans of the show, and will give you some closure, especially the writtings of Jewel Staite(Kaylee). However some of the essays are garbage, pompous, and frankly I sometimes wondered if these people where watching the same show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Beautiful","review":"Heard the cover of Love Will Tear Us Apart on a Mojo Magazine sampler and went for the full album, So beautiful.

This is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors should be skeptics","review":"I will only rate this book based on the author's experiences in a place I have known intimately all of my adult life: Iquitos, Peru. Shah, an experienced traveller, was completely taken in by one of the most utterly transparent charlatans in Iquitos. The gringo ex-pat scene there is not unlike other tropical spots, and one would think the author might be aware of the tall-tale spinning, incompetent types he was likely to encounter. Not so, apparently! But on behalf of all who know the area, a hearty thanks to the author for providing us with hours of belly laughs! Poor fellow really got taken for a ride. If his fact checking on other portions of the book was similar, I can only say, \\"reader beware!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Draft for British sitcom","review":"Allegedly experienced writer and traveler expects us to believe he was a dunce taken in by expensive, unnecessary equipment and an unscrupulous first inline of potential guides; and then, when he gets to the competent, interesting guide and the other (potentially good stuff), gives us little about the interesting people and places because he's too busy letting us know he's a kind of wimpy and pretty much ineffective and dependent inquirer into the mystery he went after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"I am apalled by how bad this book is. Tahir Shah seems more motivated in his travel by finding shrunken heads or consuming ayahuasca than any other deeper reason. His observations lack any depth, his disdain for the cultures he meets is unbelievable, his motivations are based on the most basic and childish facts, which he does not even try to explain. Reading the book I could not stop wondering whether he had actually been to the places he so lousily describes.Certainly he is no anthropologist, or ethnographer or any kind of scientist, but the lack of substance is unforgivable for even your average tourist... He claims he hasn't found the answers to his questions about ayahuasca, tsantsas or whatever in the libray, so he embarks on a journey to find out for himself. He could have documented himself a little better beforehand!!!Avoid at all costs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling Book","review":"The authors \\"Indiana Jones\\" approach to everything he observes, his exagerations of the facts of Peruvian life, and his absolute lack of professionalism as a \\"travel writer\\" and \\"researcher\\", border on the absurd. It is really hard to believe that anyone could suffer from such stupidity and naivet��, and it makes trying to read this book more than tedious. Written supposedly as a book of non-fiction, one wonders whether the writer is deluded enough to believe that what he states is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"fairly preachy","review":"main point of book is to breastfeed as over half of it dwells on that. also, references are often repeated as they are provided at end of eacfh heading. interesting read but no mysteries solved..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for.","review":"I bought this book after hearing great things about it from my other new mom friends. I don't know what they were thinking because this is nothing but a collection of preachy, pointless tales embroidered around a well-worn (and already well-documented) parenting philosophy that is not even the author's own. If there is anything good I could say, it is that it didn't cost much to buy. I would have gotten more parenting inspiration from a block of wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerant tone turned me off","review":"I was really interested in attachment parenting, which is why I picked up this book. But even as someone with a really open mind, I came away feeling brow beaten and my child isn't even born yet! I mean, am I really such a bad parent if I don't planning on nursing my son till age five?I agree with previous reviewers that the authors frequently refer to Dr. Sears's books and you should do the same. Dr. Sears is much more balanced and gentle. 'The Baby Book' is thorough and well worth the money.The only reason to get this book is the great list of resources (links to stores, interest groups and forums) at the end of each chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about Attachment or Breastfeeding?","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Over 100 pages were dedicated to breast feeding. I have plenty of books on breastfeeding, I wasn't buying this book for that reason. I think the name of the book is a misnomer it should be called breastfeeding and attachment. I wouldn't buy another book by this author.I would have appreciated much more information on the fundamentals of attachment and the family unit.Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not add to my knowledge in any way","review":"I found this book to be really redundant, dogmatic and frankly, insulting in its lack of new information. It just did not contribute any knowledge beyond the other books that are widely available, and that are better-written. Most of the information in the book is a rehash of stuff from Dr. William Sears' books (which I love) and from Our Babies Ourselve, by Meredith Small (another great book!). Please check out those much more interesting and informative works instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!! Long overdue!! Thank you, Katie Allison Granju!","review":"If you just bought an expensive new baby crib, or \\"baby bucket\\"/stroller combo, hope you kept the receipt!! This is the best gift for parents to be (include a sling and you have the perfect shower gift). The book is loaded with resources for support and encouragement. It is time that parents get back to basics and listen to their hearts- and their babies. You could not find a better deal for $10 anywhere. I wish she had included more about natural birth, and the effects on labor drugs on infants, but overall the book is incredibly refreshing. It will make you laugh, and cry, but it will also make you fall in love with your newborn and experience a bond that is not very common between mothers and their babies in our culture. I give this book an A+++ and have already purchased 4 copies to give away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read More about this wonderful book ..","review":"I found a web page from this author with lots of great info on attachment parenting and even some excerpts from the book. After reading her stuff, I immediately ordered this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject matter, but preachy and lacking originality","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I was already an attachment parent before reading the book, and hoped it would be a good book for me to recommend to new mothers (and maybe even learn something new myself). But while I already had read a lot of attachment parenting literature and didn't expect to learn many new things, almost everything in the book was a rehash of materials already published by Dr. Sears, La Leche League, and others. In addition, I found it to be so preachy and judgmental that it was a turn off. As someone already converted to attachment parenting, if I found it too preachy, I definitely wouldn't want to recommend it to a skeptic. I'm giving it two stars just because I'm happy to have more books on the market about the subject, but this is not among the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent all-around resource for any new parent","review":"This book will now join Meredith Small's _Our Babies, Ourselves_ as one I give to every pregnant woman I know.Apart from being the single most comprehensive guide to attachment parenting, it is one of the few general childcare books that discusses the concerns of the entire family - mother, father, grandparents and all. Babies do not grow up in a vacuum, and _Attachment Parenting_ recognizes that and addresses many of the questions of the people who together form a baby's world.It is also remarkable for the quality and quantity of the outside resources it recommends (websites, books, catalogues, mailing lists, real life support groups, etc.).The style is clear and accessible, the numerous quotes from real parents as well as parenting experts are enlightening, and the issues this book raises are timely and relevant. I can't think of a better general resource for any new parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!!! Biased and intolerant.","review":"I bought this book because I already have some of the Sears' books (which I mostly liked) and I decided to try a new author. It was a BIG mistake. I was looking for solid information on the child's emotional development and how does bonding and holding affects it. Instead, I got a book mostly about breastfeeding, (I already had a couple of excellent books on breastfeeding), very redundant, and based mostly on the author's opinion and not in substantial facts. Besides, this book is very intolerant to other lifestyles different from the \\"family bed-hold your kid 24 hours a day\\", ridiculing it and making you feel stupid if you are not getting it \\"right\\". Also, a word on family bed: it is not for everybody, you don't have to do it just because some third-world societies do it, and it is not a guarantee for a better night sleep. Don't feel guilty (as this book makes you feel) if it doesn't match your lifestyle. Hope this review is useful for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow this book from the library","review":"This book serves as a good reference for products and other books related for attachment parenting. There is so much more to attachment parenting than this book presents. If you borrow this book from the library you can read it in an afternoon. At the end of each chapter is a list of other references. Attachment parenting is so much more than just breastfeeding, co-sleeping and baby wearing. This book is fine but not exhaustive on the subject. Dr. Sears' books are the ones to buy and keep for day to day referral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book and bad writing style!","review":"I was so excited to read \\"Attachment Parenting: Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Young Child\\" that I overlooked the negatives comments some reviewers left about this book. Boy they were right! I get the impression that the author feels she knows more than you do about how to care for your baby. In other words, she sounds very condescending and rude. Too bad because the attachment parenting topic is very empathetic and it should be. But here she is, giving you advice on how you can apply these principles; yet she sounds so bitter and harsh. Also,I dislike the fact the I felt I was watching the local news channel, so much infomercials. Please, we don't need propaganda in our books, we have enough of that in our television/radio (sadly). Maybe she gets paid for that, I don't know for sure, but I find it patronizing and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best parenting book out there.","review":"This is definitely the book I want all my pregnant friends to read. As the mother of a nine month old, I have found myself referring to it again and again to reassure me and answer practical questions. It is unlike any other parenting book I've read (and I think I've read them all). Along with The Baby Book, by Dr. WIlliam Sears and So That's What They're For by Janet Tamaro-Natt, Attachment Parenting is a book all parents should have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds you how to parent with respect and love","review":"I was lucky enough to recieve an advance copy of this amazing parenting book. With all of the books that have come out in the past few years teaching you how to train your baby and child this is a refreshing change. This book is a guide to raising your children with respect and love. As an AP mom myself I can honestly say that it works. I plan to give this book to all my friends who are expectant and new parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Was hoping for an in-depth book, but subject matter was glossed-over. Not enough substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attachment Parenting:Instinctive Care for Your Baby and Youn","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book. Much of what I read I had already learned for Dr. Sears' Baby Book. The rest of it seems hinged around breastfeeding. I was very dissapointed with the whole thing. I feel I wasted money I could have used to by a toy for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about parents of multiples!","review":"I first tried to get help by writing to the author herself about the need for real tips and plain old help on how to attachment parent when you have two (or more) babies screaming for your hugs and you only have your two arms, however she chose not to even respond to my email. My husband and I are very much for an AP approach to the way we love and care for our twins. But I have yet to find a single AP book that gives more than a token \\"Oh yeah, you should do this with your twins too\\" kind of chapter ... if even that. Come on, you so called experts! If you are truly convinced that this is the way, then do some REAL work on AP with multiples and put some real life tips in your books on how to implement AP for parents of multiples."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book insults \\"thinking\\" mothers and fathers","review":"I consider myself an \\"attachment parent\\" - my son is exclusively breastfed, he sleeps in the Arm's Reach cosleeper and I carry him whenever I can. And, believe me, I love Dr. Sears as much as the next mom. But I found this book to be nothing more than propaganda for Dr. Sears. On top of that, the author makes you feel guilty and stupid if you don't follow her ideas to the T. This book left me feeling like my son would be scarred for life unless I did exactly what it says. Sorry, but parents and children are more complicated than that, and I prefer to think for myself.If you want to know more about attachment parenting, skip this patronizing and insulting book and go straight to something from the Sears library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for baby bonding, bad for SIDS aspect.","review":"I was very excited about this book, until my baby died of SIDS. I think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on SIDS is simply incorrect.The author, like Dr. Sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. back up this study. Since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. See the SIDS Alliance web page for more information about SIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit an older parent","review":"Well I must say this book is written by a very narrow minded MAN.I am an older mom (52)- I cannot breastfeed or wear the twins in a sling ( for fear of breaking my back). We need rules to come from us the adults- not what the babies want. There is a bedtime as well as mealtimes. We keep a schedule and use bottles. The twins are thriving- 8 months old now.These babies are attached to us and we use a live in caregiver too."},{"rating":"1","title":"High on the preaching, low on practicalities","review":"This book would make a great shower gift or source of information for those curious about what attachment parenting is. However, if you are already sold on the idea and are looking for a nitty-gritty how-to book, this is not the one. It spends most of its time justifying the methodology, and not enough time explaining how to implement it. Skip this book, for example, if you have already decided to breastfeed--its main focus is to convince you to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book about babies","review":"Ever wonder why your instinct is to run to your baby when he cries? Ever wonder why you and your baby both want to fall asleep after nursing? Ever feel guilty for bringing your baby to bed with you? Ever hear information about babies or breastfeeding that seems wrong, but you don't know why? Ever wonder why crying it out to sleep doesn't sound right to you? This book will give you everything you need to know to feel confident in following your instincts with your baby. Buy this one and also Dr. Sears The Baby Book and The No-Cry Sleep Solution and you'll have a perfect library for the first two years of your baby's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed every word","review":"I resonated with each word of this book. True, attachment style parenting can also be called intuitive parenting - but so many of us do not listen to what our hearts tell us or @ least we need the reminder to listen.

If you like the style and size of this watch, then you will be very happy with it. It is a great looking watch that is very well made and functions perfectly. At this price you can't go wrong. I have had the watch for a little over a month now and I'm completely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Yourself by Living--Not in this boring and foolish book","review":"It amazes me that a well-educated person like Dr. Phil can try to sell to readers the idea that finding the self can be accomplished by reading one of his books. Nonsense!!! In my view if you want to find yourself invite some friends over to your house, go out to dinner with a loved one and find some romance. Perhaps Dr. Phil needs to find himself--since the old Dr. Phil, the one who wrote a couple of good books before this one, has somehow disappeared!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The funniest American comedian! :D","review":"I never get serious reading his book or seeing his show on tv.

His show should be in Comedy Central though."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless repetition - could've been cut in half","review":"The exercises and tests in the book were of some help, they helped me realize a few things about my life, myself and my current behavior. However, I found it very repetitive and too obvious, at times. It's extremely simplified, almost so much that it gives the impression of having been \\"dumbed down\\" for the general public to grasp. The book could've used more depth and elaboration, in my opinion. I felt that most things he suggested were behaviors I already practiced on a day to day basis. I couldn't relate much to it, although it made some good points and reaffirmed me in my ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting My Phil","review":"Oprah is no D'oprah, and I got to admit, the lady knows good advice when she sees it. I just finished this book along with two other books-- \\"Life Strategies\\" by Dr. Phil and a book called \\"Breaking the Pattern\\" by Charles Platkin...and for the first time in my life, I feel like I've got great control.\\"Breaking the Pattern\\" helped me realized what sort of patterns my life has fallen into and how I could get out of them, while \\"Self Matters\\" helped me to understand that I'm worth the fight to get out of them.I usually dont read \\"self-help\\" books, but after the success of these books, I am seriously going to need a self-help book to help me break my self-help book addiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed? Buy this to get further depressed","review":"(Even one star is too high of a rating!)I'm not as qualified as other reviewers but here I go any way. This was the first book I read by Dr Phil and what a disappointment. I 'was' a fan of his TV show until I read this book!I found myself getting depressed while reading 2/3's of the book and simply stopped reading it. We all know our past experiences impact who we are and how we got where we are. He really did not need to take up 120 pages telling us that.I turned to \\"Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential\\" by Pastor Joel Osteen to pick up the pieces. :)It's a matter of preference but if I want to feel better about who I am as a person I'd rather not read something to make me relive experiences that I have already come to terms with.If you want to get positive about life, go for something POSITIVE. But it is NOT this book!Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Begin the Healing","review":"Dr. Phil's latest book tops them all. Self Matters helps get to the core of what's keeping you from a fulfilling, happy life. His tell it like it is style helped me take a good hard look at myself and how I could begin the healing. I have been going through a rough time in my life and Self Matters has helped me to stop feeling sorry for myself and start feeling good about what is good in my life. For the first time in a long while things don't look so bad. This book is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Very informative it is definitely worth reading. I do wish he had more of his books on kindle instead of just having books and audio books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to Know Yourself","review":"Dr. Phil wrote this book for you if you are constantly trying to live up to others' expectations of you rather than to your authentic identity. If you are unsure of the person you really are, his exercises can help if you do them. He has you list your Ten Defining Moments, Seven Critical Choices and Five Pivotal People. The exercises really have to be done to be useful.

Thank God! I usually like watching Dr. McGraw on TV and maybe he's a good counselor, but this book was awful. First of all, it was boring. Secondly, it was poorly written, and thirdly his advice seemed to me to be heavy handed and simplistic. There are better self help books out there, there just have to be. And for those other reviewers who wondered how it got to be a bestseller. Can you say Oprah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I spent a lot of time on the first half of the book only to discover that when you get to Chapter 7, Locus of Control, there is no information on how to score the tests in appendix A and B and yet the chapter is all about how your score affects you. I am very disappointed and have emailed Dr. Phil in hopes that he will at least put the test scoring information on his website. Meanwhile I've spent a lot of time on the previous chapters and now feel like I wasted my time and my money. I must say, I feel quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Matters","review":"The author is entertaining as a guest on Oprah. He often is insightful on TV.This is not the case in this book.

This is just the bookto help them justify their selfishness. It is important to examine our lives and see where we may need healing from past hurts that are holding us back from reaching our full potential. For this purpose the book could be helpful if it's potential for harm were not so great. However, this book is based on a faulty assumption that people are basically good until they are hurt in some way. Under this assumption, if we heal the hurts, we will again be basically good. No, we will still be basically selfish! If you are looking for a book to justify your selfishness, you found it. Just what our culture needs, more justification for selfishness.

The title put me off to begin with...in a world so much in distress, it says a lot about the western world's inwardness and self-obssession. The book is more of the same psycho-babble that has been pouring off the shelves since the 1970's; offering no more than silly answers to a deeply neurotic, isolated society. The book however, could be used successfully as a model of how to exploit one's professional field to a large and needy audience-- and become very, very wealthy in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another fat piece of trash that thinks he can play God","review":"It always amazes me at how desperate people have become in our society. It's even more hilarious and shocking that people will throw away their dignity and respect to allow some fat piece of trash like Dr. Phil tell them what their problems are in front of millions of people. Whatever happened to people's sense of self-respect? Then again, with shows like Jersey Shore and The Biggest Loser bringing in millions of auidence members from across the nation, I guess the word \\"desperation\\" has become a big focal point of popularity. In short, I guess Dr. Phil fits perfectly into spectrum.Dr. Phil is nothing more than a egoistical freak who likes to play God. It's funny that we have yet to see any evidence that he's even a real Dr. I guess TV allows us to be whoever we want right?Maybe he should allow me on his show. I've always wanted my fifteen minutes of fame. And, outsmarting a moron isn't difficult at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real People!","review":"While the excercises in this book might make you look closer at the influential people in your life. I do not like the overall self help stand point. You can not change your entire life with a book! This book could be interpreted the wrong way by the already self centered person (that doesn't realize it). My overall review of this book is, it is not for me & be careful not to take what you read to literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was looking for a pick me up and ended up feeling worst","review":"I, a huge fan of the Dr. Phil TV show, was shocked that this book was horrible. Dr. Phil assumes that the reader has extremely low self esteem. Which is fine, except how he writes this assumption. For example...The reason why you think you are stupid is....etc. As I was reading I felt emotions of defensiveness. I don't think of my self as stupid or a loser. Once I read past being the many knock downs from Dr. Phil, there was no good substance in this book. None!

I knew where the doc was going by the end of the second CD. All this book did for me was to reaffirm what I already know about myself. I guess it can be helpful to those who feel lost or find themselves trapped in relationships or situations they really don't want but it did very little for me. As well the doc's preachy voice got to be annoying after a while and his good old boy attitude just turned me right off. Like most self help books out there the people who right them assume everybody is the same, they come from the same background, socioeconomic status, race, sexual orientation and so on. In short, if you are more or less close to the lifestyle the doc lives this book might be helpful. I borrowed this one from my library and I'm glad I did. My recommendation, do the same.

In fairness, I didn't complete the book, after I gave him the benefit of slugging through half of it.

A great self-help book, but not an easy journey to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Over Mind","review":"This book is a marketing piece--not a well thought out, provoking book that can change your life. What is so amazing is that Dr. Phil thinks we have multiple selfs and that just by shere will alone we can go from our untrue self to our real self. Ridiculous! He gives a layman's definition of self that philosophers would cringe at and goes on and on with stories that fill the page, but don't further the subject matter. He paints the self as stagnate, but it seems to me that it is fluid. I mean, afterall are we the same people that we were 10 or 20 years ago?

But then you got too bogged down in telling readers what you wanted to share with them.It's probably more of your editor's fault. He or she should trimmed down your message with half the amount of verbage. I'm busy and don't have a lot of time or patience to wade through repetitive material.

But why stop there?This time round it's:- Your Ten Defining Moments- Your Seven Critical Choices- Your Five Pivotal People- and a Five-Step Action PlanNot to mention a good smattering of the sort of psuedo-psychological self-tests that are usually reserved for magazines like Cosmopolitan, etc.To end with, then, here's another list:1. If you seriously believe that all of life can be reduced to a set of trivial rules, and that self-denigration is a valuable learning tool, then buy this book - it will tell you exactly what you want hear.2.

Phil really carries on and on in an attempt to help strip away ones unauthentic self and find happiness. Although peppered with his colorfully redundant Texan talk, I found this reading/learning experience pretty worthless. After all of his rhetoric about being more real with themselves, Phil does not seem to follow his own advice. In the few closing paragraphs, Phil attributes his success (at breaking away to a better life) to having a great wife....So maybe we all ought to do is go out and buy one of those instead of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Dr. Phil seriously the Author of this book?","review":"This book was very disappointing. I was about 2/3 of the way through and I finally had to quit. I've been impressed with his other books and am so surprised that he really authored this book.

After all, Dr. Phil is a 5 star guy, and his appearances on Oprah! are five star quality too. But somehow, this book just is not the same. I can't put my finger on why. Maybe the brash, insightful, get-to-the-heart-of-the-matter style that works so well on TV just doesn't translate to the page. Or maybe the writer had too much time to think, to edit, to revise. Perhaps what makes Dr. Phil work so well in real time, is that he jumps right in and does not look back. The book is too tame, and does not grab the reader. If you are still interested, try the library first, and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get the CD version!","review":"I borrowed the CD version of this book from the public library after listening to the cassette version of \\"Life Strategies\\" on my daily commute to work and liking it a lot. What a disappointment --- Dr Phil wasn't the reader! The reader has a very nice voice, but I felt cheated hearing Dr Phil's stories, words, phraseology, etc. from someone else's mouth. Being so familiar with his vocal patterns from watching his show and listening to the previous audio book, I was so distracted I couldn't really follow it. From what I can gather, the reader is on the unabridged version, so maybe the abridged version has Dr Phil reading it.

That Mayan deities represent astronomical bodies, as did the pantheons of Egypt and Mesopotamia, is equally validated by Jenkins. His emphasis on the famous Long Count calendar shows that when the rising sun on the December solstice of the year 2012 conjuncts with the Milky Way's galactic center - or birth canal of the Great Mother of us all - a new age is expected, one in which humanity will mutate spiritually into a new relationship with space-time and the material universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Full of interesting facts about the Mayan civilization, how they saw the earth and their brilliant understanding of the Universe.

Here's hoping that this is a fluke and that future releases, under whatever pen name, return to her usual standard of good storytelling, interesting plot lines, humor and romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of the road","review":"I won't be buying anymore of Jayne Ann Krentz's books. Although I was a huge fan. This book is incredibly formula driven. It's the same old plot she's done again and again and the stereotype of the librarian/heroine as sexually repressed is offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story that I enjoyed very much!","review":"Smoke in Mirrors by J.A.Krentz is a wonderful story with mystery and intrique on every page.Loved the characters and the plot of the story. Easy to relate to and easy to follow.I thought the concept of an old mansion surrounded in mirrors being center stage in this story was quite unusual and interesting.J.A.Krentz is one writer that has never disappointed me no matter what name she decides to write under."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This is not her best work. I had read more compelling book by her. The plot was too convulted. The characters didn't impressed me. The ending could of been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for a rainy Saturday","review":"I really enjoy JAK. She is one of the few writers I know I can trust to give me a story that I will enjoy but not have to get too involved in. She is sharp in her technique and style. However, although this book was a fun read, the story is weak. The ending is even weaker -- everyone else up in happy coupledom except, of course, for the killer. This book is perfect for a rainy Saturday or to keep around for when the weather is too cold to go out and do much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Has Happened to My Favorite Author?","review":"This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book. What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me? These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines. I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales. I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies. Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up.

I am looking for more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I've read several of her books lately and liked most of them. This one was just not as interesting. I didn't like the story line. The gothic atmosphere of the library and the information about mirrors didn't hold my attention. As far as the characters went, there wasn't enough meat here. I couldn't feel connected to them. She is a witty writer and I loved the Eclipse Bay series, but this one didn't cut it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!!!!!","review":"I think I have just about everything Ms. Krentz has ever written and have always enjoyed her characters and plots. I was sadly dissapointed on this latest novel, \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\". There was no chemistry between the main characters. No strong but sensative male and a rather tepid female. I think I will just have to go back and re-read all the oldie but goodies and wait for the paper back to come out from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it at the library. . .","review":"if you really MUST read it. But, really, this \\"novel\\" isn't even worth getting at the library. (Thank God I did, though!) Every cliched description and conversation, as well as lines from previous Krentz novels, make up this adolescent effort. The \\"love\\" scenes are painfully embarrassing, the plot line weak and contrived, and the ending is ridiculous. Krentz has never had the talent that Roberts or Crusie can claim, but many of her books have been at least entertaining (I'm thinking of her Eclipse Bay trilogy). This effort is truly irritating and immature. . .or could it be that Krentz is tired of her chosen genre? This book would seem to indicate it. I'd prefer to give it half a star for the description of the mirrors but that option isn't available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uninteresting...","review":"First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future. For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying. I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees. The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one. I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke in mirrors","review":"Started off slow then caught my interest about half way thru. Not Jayne Frantz best violinist still good reading. Need more books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bethany Unmasked","review":"Like, I suspect, many readers of the Bethany series, the changing of the guard in the White House from a republican to a democrat caused the Tom Bethany character to be unmasked. Where, in the earlier works, Bethany is portrayed as a man cynical of government (note his references to Albert Jay Nock's early works) it becomes apparent in the novel \\"Half Nelson\\" that the character speaks out against government only so long as there is a republican to be despised.Doolittle fumbled the ball, in my view, by allowing his glee that a democrat occupies the White House to show through into the Bethany character's personality, changing Bethany's attitude from that of a free thinker who despises government corruption into that of a partisan party supporter.I'm glad that the author dropped all pretense and revealed himself, the series was becoming tiresome anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Metallic","review":"Unfortunately, these shoes are just a little too metallic for me.

The shipping went good with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big finish to this fine Trilogy","review":"Superb - I may have liked it better than the other two in the series. The big dog and Isaac's love interest added greatly to my enjoyment. The parts about the buring of our capital and the bombardment of Baltimore were particularly timely in light of the September 11th attack on our country. Most people, me included, have little understanding of these events and White's book - and the others in this series - have brought them to life. A really easy way to learn some history about our great country. I even checked a few of the details for historic accuracy and they were right on. I hope there will be more of these historically accurate stories from this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome Super Special!!","review":"Once again, Ann M. Martin does it again in this 3rd wonderful Super Special. I wish my schools had trips like that. What bothered me is how racially prejudiced people can be.

But who's to say that she'll have had a successful experience? So far, as Secretary of State, she's had one failure after another, which was to be predicted, for if the world doesn't like Bush, why should they like her?

I may not be a fan of Ms. Clinton, but Mr. Morris is such an admirer of Ms. Rice that he dismisses the many reasons why she would be unqualified to run for President (without ever having held an elected position beforehand). I find it astounding that Mr. Morris assumes that someone who has never run for public office and has always been appointed to positions, is nontheless the best qualified Republican candidate for the top political position. Whilst I realize it is a very appealing thought to Republicans to be able to break the stranglehold that the Democratic party has on the African-American voting block, I don't believe it is in anyone's best interest to promote any candidate without giving genuine analyses to the weaknesses of their candidacy.

I learned more about them, and I liked the head to head comparisons. This analysis suffers from two things, however. First, Dick Morris knows Senator Clinton much better than he knows Secretary of State Rice. That is obvious, and that influences the balance of this analysis.Second, Morris doesn't seem to like Hillary very much.

It is just so refreshing how they can cite the pros and cons of bill and hillary, their strengths and weaknesses, so objectively... I was seriously astounded.When the authors talk about how what drives Hillary, how she justifies her actions, and that she really believes in what she is doing (the ends justify the means) it just makes so much sense.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. He seemed to take one simple thought-\\"Just Enjoy Today\\"-and stretch it into a book, albeit a very quick read. I did not feel the content was inciteful or useful beyond the one simple statement made above, which we've all heard before. Anyone can quote a concept, but few people can make the concept workable. Johnson leaves out the \\"how\\" part of living in The Present by giving example after example of how everything will just be wonderful if we would just worry about today.

After that huge hit, publishers couldn't get enough of Dr. Johnson's writings. But what's a one or two-hit wonder to do when you've already used up your best ideas? Go back to the well and redesign something you've already written as something new.That's what happened with THE PRESENT. The \\"book\\" is THE PRECIOUS PRESENT retold with a few new bells and whistles. That's all. The parable-approach of the \\"story\\" only has one message and keeps repeating several times throughout the \\"book\\".At one point in the \\"story\\" it says of the central character that \\"He was who he was\\".

It is packed full of historical information as well as Greek/ Hebrew definitions and is excellent in all of the other additional information it provides. Despite it's age, it is a MUST have for ministers or ANYONE serious about God's Word. In my opinion, it will always be a timeless classic for all those who are seeking to enrich their lives with not only the information of God's Word, but also assisting in understanding HIM better and drawing them closer to HIM (that's really what it's all about anyway).

I agree that Scott MacMillan's writing is not up to par with his wife's, but that isn't to say that the story is not engaging. I have enjoyed the books, although a globe-trotting millionaire homicide detective on the trail of Nazi vampires can seem a bit much sometimes, especially with his spur-of-the-moment sexual encounter.

Are the MacMillans listening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment all around","review":"A major disappointment for Kurtz fans, this book shows none of her excellent characterizations. Unlike her Deryni series, none of these characters inspire a feeling that you want to know these people better. Not James Drummond, the protagonist, who apparently gives up his charmed, bachelor life working for the LAPD. Not the order of crusading knights who somehow felt that the desecration of the Grail Shrine in the Holy Land by vampiric Saracens could be cleansed by nailing the lead vampire to the shrine wall and drinking his blood using the cup of Christ. All in all, the work was clearly a lesson in writing for MacMillan, who got his characterizations down better by the book's end. But it's scarcely worth the read for Kurtz fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was quite disappointed with both these books. As others have noted, the characterizations were disappointing, the plot seemed a bit thin ... and while they held up tolerably well for one reading, they have no re-reading value.

I slogged through the first fifty pages of A Very Private Gentleman in search of a story and gave up. (My wife gave up even sooner than I did, and she almost never puts aside a book she has begun.) There is not only not a story begun in the first fifth of this book, there is no hint that a story is soon to begin.

A mi parecer, esa interpretacion es mucho mas sensible e introspectiva que la version original. Este disco definitivamente debe ser parte de cualquier coleccion seria de Charly Garcia.

I was also dissappointed that the book did not contain very much original writing, instead it was mostly a compilation of interviews. Most of the women profiled had experienced multiple losses. I have experienced one loss and the last thing I want to imagine is going through this 3 or 4 times more! If you have experienced multiple losses, and are looking for \\"honest\\" rather than sugar-coated answers to your concerns, this may be the book for you.

When I read in this book about a woman who had chosen to abort because her baby had Down's Syndrome, I felt like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. It shook me up badly and made it difficult to focus on reading (I finally just set the book aside).So, if you, like me, are very hurt by and sensitive to references to abortions, be aware that there are a few mentions of it in this book.However, if you're *not* bothered by references to abortion, I can recommend this book without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only useful if you get pregnant again","review":"A friend just lent me her copy of \\"Trying Again\\".

It is an easy read but delivers little. The Cliff Notes version, if there was one, could be summarized in 2 or 3 paragraphs. Many of the authors predictions are based on silly analogies. In the book he compares electricity to information technology. He mentions a few electrical related job titles that are no longer part of corporate America but fails to mention that there are still plenty of Electrical Engineers, Electricians, Electrical Contractors, etc. still employed in our economy. He takes a small segment of technology and predicts it's commoditization. Big Deal! Technology is ever-evolving and his predicitions are not that revolutionary. What makes this book ridiculous is his prediction that all of information technology will eventually be a commodity. This book is an obvious attempt to create a controversy to sell books.

The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again. A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed. The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels.I found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops. No spoilers, so I won't elaborate other than to suggest \\"Gathers the Storm\\" or somthing similar might have ben a better title. Hopefully \\"A Meeting at Corvallis\\" will be equally entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Drags","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book \\"Dies the Fire\\" it maintained a good pace.This book however, just drags on. Almost the entire book is devoted to life on the farm, with little or no action. While some of it is interesting, it does start to get real monotonous completely unlike the first book.I found myself browsing through these parts and then reading when it got interesting, needless to say I browsed almost the entire book, 75% anyway. There is just way to much filler. The songs do not really add to the book.As mentioned earlier the first book was very good, this one was a sleeper.

While I am catholic my fiance is not exactly Wiccan but close (she doesn't follow any of the formal stuff, is not part of a group etc)...at any rate I felt the Wicca stuff was just silly wanna-be SCA type stuff. I told her about some of it and she said it's the stuff like that that makes her keep her mouth shut about her faith. She just finds it embaressing. I certainly do not appreciate the bashing of Christianity either - believe it or not we are not all judgemenetal Jerry Falwell watchers.Plus - it was kinda boring.

It should be titled \\"Prelude to the Protectors War\\", subtitled \\"Buy my next book, please\\". This book is nothing like the original. When I saw it in the book store I was excited. I just finished it and that excitement has turned to disgust for spending money on such a bad book.Take out the overly long descriptions of everything from war cloaks to cama lillies to leaves on a tree to every meal eaten and the book would be twenty pages at most.

Maybe they made a simple mistake. Mr. Stirling's work is among the best ever. The first read or the fourth read provides the same wonderful experience of entering that particular world, leaving this one behind, not noticing where the time goes and waiting impatiently for the next book. Mr. Stirling's work provides the rare experience of the words on the page vanishing into a world in my mind's eye where I see the action in the book, understand the logic behind their actions and it is all so real.So very,very real. Bravo, Mr. Stirling from a most contented and highly grateful fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Wiccan for three or four books","review":"The first volume in this trilogy was entertaining and interesting. This volume is godawful. The premise of a society suddenly losing electricity and other higher forms of technology is intriguing. Too bad it is overwhelmed by the completely unbelievable elements which include 1). large numbers of people becoming Wiccan and abandoning established religions, 2). people blinding following Tolkien-like ceremonies and calling people \\"Lord Bear,\\" and 3). the ease with which everyone is able to manufacture and master the use of swords, armor, jousting poles, etc. Halfway through the book I kept wondering when something was going to happen and dreading turning the page because yet another Wiccan ceremony or poetry was going to appear, preventing any sort of plot progression. I recommend Stirling's other books, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Protectors Bore","review":"While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook. I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful series","review":"OOPS I think I put in my other review, on Dies the Fire, that this was a trilogy. It is a series and an excellent one at that. If you like reading about apocalyptic scenarios followed by the rebuilding of the world this is for you. The author uses good historical references on the things they used, how they made them, what things they scavenged to use in different ways and he does it in a way that keeps the pages turning. There is love, hate, jealousy, and everything inbetween and wonderful characters to enjoy it all with. The first 3 books of this series that I read were big, fat, hardbacks and at first they looked a little overwhelming but once I finally picked up the first one it seemed like the pages just flew by.This author is the kind of storyteller that just pulls you in to his world and when the book is finished you just want to stay a little while longer.

I realize that it is fiction but believable fiction would be a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"future history\\" read","review":"Excellent continuation to the first book in the Emberverse series. Stirling's character development is amazing. The story takes place about 9 years after the change. There are some new characters introduced from England that really add to the story. Rudi starts to develop as a character now that he is 8 or 9 years old. More of the mysticism is starting to show up as they get farther from the actual Change event."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age fluff","review":"Unfortunately Mr Sterling uses pages and pages of nonsensical New Age fluff to make up for a rather astounding lack of inspiration.The excruciatingly detailed description of Wiccan invocations, ceremonials and what have you, far from helping any, seems rather cheap padding for a plot that is quite trivial.I do not believe I have ever read such a novel where a ride through a forest lasts three pages, a tavern brawl four pages and so on.Why such an accomplished writer as Mr Sterling should fall so low is a mystery.

I found there were too many character/location threads and shifting back and forth through time, scattering the pacing and confusing things. The chapter headings with locations and dates only underlined this rather than easing it.The wholesale snatching of an historical-legendary scene (Alexander with Oxhead) was off-putting, and then the book was suddenly over a scant chapter or two later.On a visual note, I could hardly stand the font used, which had punctuation so small as to be barely distinguishable--all the more of a pain as Stirling used a minimum of three semi-colons a page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This is a wonderful, interesting book.

The ball does not seems to bounce off the paddle in the right proportion to your exerted force. Since them, I had gone on to purchase many more paddles and there are much better ones out there for about half as much. If you search hard enough, you can find a five-layer with carbon for much less or a seven-layer with carbon plus titanium mesh for only slightly more expensive.Do your homework.

Like all London's work the tales concern struggles not against nature but respect for the force of nature itself. Unlike Hemmingway who chose to try to defeat the environment through hunting and fishing, London chose to understand it.This piece isn't for everyone. The style and content may prove to be to specific a genre for some. But taken purely on it's story lines and fine writing ability these are all well worth reading. I'd especially recommend this for a novice London reader. It's a good way of getting to understand the style in a short, easy to read book.In conclusion if you like arctic styled adventure or stories of human drama (man against the elements) this is right up your alley, if not, I still think an author the caliber of Jack London is always worth the read.Jack London's Stories of the North"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life","review":"I liked this book very much.

Kluger writes not as a lawyer or historian but as a journalist who is witness to the multitude of events which he depicts.Besides the numerous civil rights leaders and soldiers the reader encounters, the author provides an intimate account of Supreme Court justices and the process of decision-making.

One of the things of interest to me was how people during that time, both black and white, thought about the issues. I don't mean the hardcore abolitionists, or \`civil rights-soldiers' so much as the common white and black man, and also those political leaders, including the more powerful ones like President Lincoln who were somewhat more indirectly involved in the changes that eventually started to take place.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books ever written","review":"This is certainly the best book ever written -- the best book that ever will be written -- about race, law and American society.

It turns out that it was produced by a company called St. Clair, which is famous for re-recording hit songs many years after the songs were on the charts and releasing them on compact disc. Usually, 1 or 2 of the original recording artists perform on the re-make sessions. The sound quality is usually poor and the instrumentation and singing are never as good as the original recording that you heard on the radio way back when.This St. Clair DVD is typical of that company. None of these music videos show the recording artists at the ages they were when these songs were on the charts--they are way older. And the sound quality is just as poor as on St. Clair's CDs.And, just as you'll often find on St. Clair's CDs, the artists' singing voices have degraded considerably with age--Lynn Anderson's being the most obvious here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as intended, powerful.","review":"Our building rendered other 2-way radios and walkie-talkies useless from one end of the building to the other and from inside to outside.

She promises her loving aunt that she will get in touch with her ex-husband, and the head of a private security agency, for help. Between the stalker and the love the two still have for eachother, the book really sizzles.I enjoyed the book because the two have some unresolved issues that they have to work through and despite their attraction, they care enough about eachother to know that getting more intimately involved would be a heartbreak waiting to happen.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, ugly.","review":"Marcello Alvarez is about as harsh and unlistenable a bellowing tenor as you will find. Grates on the nerves like the cheap, ugly \\"chicken wire\\" fence that provides the visual focus for the production. Stark, drab, black/white \\"scenery\\" and costumes underscore the overdoing of Rigoletto as monster insect [canes attached to both arms as he \\"crab-walks\\" about the stage]. Gavanelli seems to have a good voice, but once you have heard Sherrill Milnes in the part, with his beautifully expressive voice, giving us a Rigoletto as flawed, but touchingly vulnerable, you will probably be unsatisfied with crude black/white versions. Is the director on an absurdly tight budget, or is he afraid that current morality might miss the point that the Duke and company are immoral?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Goes To The Movies","review":"When Jonathan Demme approached Bruce Springsteen to write a song for his about homosexual discrimination, Bruce had never written a song for a movie before. His first effort was good enough to earn him an Academy Award. \\"Streets Of Philadelphia\\" is a song that not only captures the spirit of the movie, but is a striking song that touches a chord. The single is worth buying not only for \\"Streets\\", but because it contains a version of \\"Growin' Up\\" from the MTV Plugged concert that was not broadcast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hadda Brooks is a true gem.","review":"In Hadda's extensive recording career, this was her first cohesive album.Her beautiful voice is dark and rich.\\"Dream\\" is a triumph. \\"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere\\"written by Hadda, is a swinging hit.Her version of \\"The Thrill is Gone\\" will haunt you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive item title","review":"The title says that this is raw cheese, yet the ingredients begin with pasteurized milk.

I watched it again 2yrs later and still didn't care much for it. Too bad, because I really like Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. I dont fault the actors as much as I fault the script. There are variations of humor out there; some more appealling than others. Kind of like the difference between Jay Leno and Dave Letterman's humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about a satire with balance?","review":"I'm a huge fan of comedies, and I realize this movie has been strangely heralded as a \\"comedy classic\\" by many, but count me out. \\"What About Bob?\\" is unique in its attempt to satirize a relationship between a psychiatrist and his patient, but ends up beating a single gag to death for 90 minutes. Seeing Bob attempt any means possible to be with his vacationing shrink, from faking phone calls to suicide, seems out-of-place in a comedy. Watching his shrink lose patience again and again gets tiresome, who never seems to deserve the extent of torment subjected to him. Bob's favoritism, at the expense of his shrink, is a bit overloaded on the satirical edge. Overall, Bob manages to be more annoying than amusing, particularly as he alienates his poor shrink from his family and literally everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most irritating comedy Murray Has Been In","review":"This movie was one I looked forward to watching so much I bought it without seeing it first after loving Groundhog Day so much. Big mistake, I laughed once through the entire movie, It wasn't all horrible, but that's only because of the two leading actors, Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. There was no real funny content in the movie, I mean, it was a story line that seemed to flat line after the first 15 minutes. I don't expect a comedy movie to have an outrageously great storyline, but this was simply dragging on without any unpredictable humor. It's amazing how many people do enjoy this movie, but if you haven't seen it first, don't buy it, rent it"},{"rating":"1","title":"What about Bob?","review":"Delivery of this item was excellent.

Consequently, I thought the movie stunk, and I also distinctly remember not being sold on the least on the idea that Dreyfuss has been driven to insanity in such a short period of time. He goes from annoyed to murderous without much of a transition. At the same time, it's hard to see why Dreyfuss' family keeps inviting Bob into their homes. But a years-later viewing showed that the movie definitely has the potential to grow on you; while I'm still lukewarm on Dreyfuss, Bill Murray has some of the funniest scenes of his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"what about bob?","review":"I ordered this dvd.

At this point, it is amusing just to see something from way back in the early years: the clothes, the acting, a tone reminiscent of the old days. As usual, Murray is phenomenal, and now I know why everyone quotes \\"Baby Steps....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a much better movie","review":"With well over 100 reviews written for this movie, a plot review is probably not needed here. The reason that I couldn't enjoy this movie very much was that I had too much sympathy for the Richard Dreyfus character. Most of the time \\"Bob\\" was annoying to me. It was difficult to see why Dreyfus was the only one that was bothered by him. Nothing about Bob's personality that endeared him to the doctor's family was made evident. I think that most kids would have found him goofy, weird, etc., and would have avoided him at all costs.I think that Bill Murray's protrayal of Bob was too \\"broad.\\" If his actions would have been more subtle (without taking away his \\"fear of everything\\") he could have seemed more normal to others while still driving Richard Dreyfus crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Zero starts!","review":"Worse Bill Murray Movie Ever!

I didn't watch it all the way through, that bad. Murray was not funny, just very annoying. I kept hoping Richard Dreyfuss, who lived near a lake, would kill Murray and dump him in the lake. That would have a least made the movie worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a terribly disturbing movie","review":"Dr. Marvin goes on vacation for a month. His newly interviewed patient decides he needs more therapy so he calls for Dr. Marvin. When he is unable to reach him, Bob lies to the answering service to get his phone call through. He continues on lying to find out more details about the location of Dr. Marvin's vacation home and stalks him there. Bob will not leave Dr. Marvin's vacation home and Dr. Marvin's family enables Bob to intrude on their vacation time. This is disturbing because Bob is a stranger who needs psychological help and should not be stalking his psychologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Went Wrong With What About Bob?","review":"Renting this movie was one of the major video mistakes of my life.

I say funny in the sense that it's hilarious to watch, but it would be far from funny if I was Dreyfuss' character.Bill Murray once again shows why he is one of the greatest comedic actors in cinematic history. Richard Dreyfuss plays the serious lead and does so to perfection. It's so easy to dislike him in the movie and love Murray, but like I said if I was in Dreyfuss's shoes I would have gone crazy long before he did. The supporting actors are great, and I loved the old couple who were always the thorn in Dreyfuss's side.The movie is directed by Frank OZ, yes, the frank oz, and he shows his vision as a comedic director is nothing to laugh at.The movie is clean with no nudity, violence, and very little language. I think most families will love this movie and watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahoy..... Is this a fake hang up......

Each time I watch this movie I find something more to laugh at, whether it be the dialogue I missed or some facial expression or simply the hilarious situations that the characters weave.Not to be overlooked is the classic performance of Dreyfuss, his flawless acting is the catalyst that sets the comedy in motion.I wonder if Bob will write a sequel to his best seller \\"Death Therapy\\" my suggestion, \\"If I fake it, then I don't have it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough to drive you up the wall","review":"This is one of the funniest comedies Bill Murray has played in.

His newest victim/doctor, the megalomaniacal Dr. Leo Marvin (Dreyfuss) just wants to enjoy his vacation with is family, but Bob refuses to go away.At first what appears to be a light hearted, goofy comedy, actually turns out to be a fairly smart and warm hearted film about a man who just wants to be loved, even if he is a bit overbearing, and the dismantling of one man's ego...so badly that he goes into a catatonic state.A true comedy classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST SEE FOR ALL!","review":"What About Bob ? is literally the best movie that has ever been made.

Only such an audience would know Ellen Datlow for example as anything other then a competent editor, or want her picture.

The only thing good about it is that it is very light weight, and doesn't take up very much room in the trash bin.The handle is small, thin and hard to grasp, The trigger I'm sure will break if you try to pick up anything more than a few ounces.The jaw only opens 2 1/2\\" and doesn't meet together at the closed end to pick up flat items off the floor.

What arrived is a book that I can go to any bookstore and pay $15 to $20 dollars for, not the $40 nearly $50 something that I just paid for this book. We wanted something different to have around the house, not something that looks modern. I am so angry! The stories inside are wonderful and couldn't get any better. If you don't understand what your buying when it comes to Grimm's Fairy Tales then I truly don't know what to say however, the product itself is a true disappointment and I think we will just be sending the book back and ordering a different one.

I am not giving it 5 stars because he is my brother - in fact, he wrote another book, \\"Sex is Not a Four Letter Word\\", that I would only rate 4 stars (a little to 'professorial' for my taste, Charles). I have used a lot of journals from organizations such as FranklinCovey, Maxwell Leadership and the Leadership Challenge and this one ranks right there in the mix.It is a perfect mixture of thoughtful insights and writing space. Unlike many journals, there is an opening section that helps set the stage for the journaling adventure which explans how to have success from the inside out - at the core.If you've used other journals and are ready to go to another level, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"Love this book. hard to put down.easy to read and easy to follow.keeps yous guessing to who is guilty."},{"rating":"2","title":"stillwatch","review":"very enjoyable book,i could not put it down.i just wanted to turn to the next page to see what was happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Mary HIggins Clark fan","review":"I love Mary Higgins Clark she is a very clean writter that can get your attention right form the start of the book and keep you reading all the way to the end to see how everything ties together.

I had heard wonderful things so I bought this novel with high hopes and was deeply, deeply dissapointed.The plot was dull. The love story was not romantic. There was no suspense. I am easy to scare yet this book didn't arouse any fright. The mystery was entirely too easy to figure out. I actually was laughing towards the end of the book because it was so bad. I couldn't believe I had spent money on this dull novel.Seriously, don't waste your time or your money. Maybe Clark has some other great books, but this one was not one of the good ones. Too bad I read this one first. Now Clark is ruined for me. I doubt I'll try this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalist or Propagandist?","review":"I have two major problems with this book. First of all, Pat Traymore is supposed to be a journalist- implying that she will be objective. Yet, throughout the book, it seems that her boss is more concerned with portraying Sen. Jennings in a positive light to sway the vice-presidential pick. If Pat is trying to influence the political system in favor of a particular candidat, then she shouldn't have been portrayed as a journalist. Mary Higgins Clark should have written her as a campaign operative.Second of all, Pat is the victim of a serious crime- stalking. Yet her boss and the Senator routinely criticize her for creating \\"bad publicity\\". I'm sorry is a stalking victim supposed to ignore a crime and not call the police because it might upset her boss? The attitude displayed by her boss is offensive and irrational.I usually enjoy Mary Higgins Clark's books, but this book left me frustrated and unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"It was the best book.

I read it several times and it seems to get better with every new read.Great atmosphere, fascinating story. A keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel, mainly for the way in which the author intertwined the different subplots. There is quite a mystery involved, as well, as we try to uncover the background of the protagonist and how it ties in with the rest of the main plot. I found myself caring for what happened to the characters, a definite plus when evaluating a novel. The only thing I have to complain about was that the bad guy was more or less identified quite far from the end, making the ending somewhat anti-climatic. Worth the read nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I told you not to come....","review":"Pat Traymore has come to Washington, to film a story on the life of Senator Abigail Jennings, the possible first female Vice President.

The amount of detail is admirable as well; it is small enough to be noticeable but discreet. Overall it looks quite delicate but considering it isn't involved in anything strenous, it should be fine.

Writing really thick books, he uses a million words, but I have not been able to do a single bolt calculation using any of his books. There are no examples, no case studies and no actual well defined/well outlined procedures in his books. The author quite actively gives short week long classes that cost thousands of dollars to attend. I finally figured out that his books are advertisements to gather students for his short high-priced classes. He has no intention of teaching you anything in his 150 dollar book. If you want to do a bolt calculation, use the good ol Shigley. For complex geometries use a Finite Element program. No need to buy any more John H Bickford books. And no need to attend high priced short classes (you will forget the material faster than the duration of the short training class)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction","review":"Overall a very nice, concise account of the life of Peter the Great.

This is the 'Stank's best since they first showed up with \\"Crawling in the Dark\\". Like usual, the lyrics are uplifting and well written, and the instrumentation is simpl, yet highly effective. \\"If I Were You\\" is a better version of \\"The Reason\\", and \\"Born to Lead\\" is another great starter track in the vien of \\"Crawling\\" and \\"Same Direction\\".

The good songs on this album are First of Me, Moving Forward, First of Me, Good Enough, and If Only.

Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, and the other writers really stepped up to the plate and produced some superb scripts. As interpreted by the wildly talented quartet of Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, they deserve to be ranked among the most classic television comedies. \\"The Parking Garage\\" and \\"The Subway\\" really stand out as prime examples of this show's philosophy of being about nothing, but every episode is a gem.

For the past year I have kept my coolpix 995 on the automatic setting, as I am unsure about all of the other settings. While the manual that came with my camera explains all of the different settings it is very difficult to understand, and therefore so intimidating that I give up. Within the first few paragraphs of Cox's book I was instantly thankful for explanations of confusing terms like \\"ccd\\"! I am not finished reading the book, but wanted to let everyone know how great it is. On top of very conversational reading the pictures are astounding!

In examining \\"liberty and virtue\\" in the revolutionary era Mr Olasky allows his religious bias to show through. He neglects to mention Thomas Jefferson, mentions James Madison once or twice, forgets Thomas Paine, and accuses Benjamin Franklin of being a Satanist in London! Olasky instead concentrates on the more conservative proponents of the Revolution, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Patrick Henry,etc. Now all were great and worhty men, but Olasky is attempting to down play the more radical revolutionaries by neglecting to mention them. The book has a \\" christian nation\\" theme with the Founders portrayed as devout christians, even though many were deists.

The first three (Split Infinity, The Blue Adept, and Juxtaposition) are a wild ride through a very interesting world(or should I say two worlds?) which I recomend reading but the story, I feel was finnished with those. The last four(Out of Phaze, The Robot Adept, Unicorn Point, and Phaze Doubt), though with some interesting aspects, for the most part add needless complication to the story and are a testament to Mr. Anthony's greatest flaw, the ability to quit while he's ahead. These books only drag a good idea into the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This book was a pointless 7th book to an otherwise excellent 6 book series. There are some times when giving an audience what they want is a bad idea, and giving his readers more of his Phaze and Proton characters was a bad idea for Piers Anthony. In general, the rest of the books make a good read with somewhat original storylines and some interesting twists and turns. This book is so awful, I'm ashamed to even admit I read it. Take my advice and leave off with book six, it makes a good end to a decent Anthony series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been FAZED OUT! after book 3","review":"This and the three that precede it are some of the worst books I have ever read.

Like many of David Lanoue's haiku, his novel about Haiku Guy is a simple story with a lot of hidden text under the surface. You don't need to catch all the subtext or know the details of Buddhism to enjoy the book, but it's even more fun when you do. I recommend this book very highly and I'd suggest you savor it rather than devour it quickly. I also know that David has at least two more novels in this style in manuscript form. Somebody out there needs to contact David about publishing them. I want more. I think a lot of people do."},{"rating":"2","title":"1987 sounds like yesterday","review":"Though simple, this seems to have aged surprisingly better than other 80's electronica.

I found his conclusions believable, his theories refreshing and very interesting. He has approached this presentation in the same manner as would be done in making an intelligence assessment using all the known facts, grading levels of confidence, and speculating about a reasonable outcome. He does this very well and I am impressed with his efforts. Worth reading again. It surpasses any other material I have read so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Arthurian analysis to come around in a long time!","review":"King Arthur: A Military History is one of the best analyses of Arthurian Britain to be published in a long time. Michael Holmes begins with a rather scientific approach to the subject: Roman Gaul and Roman Britain were nearly identical, but greatly different by the beginning of the Middle Ages. Narrowing the divergent influences to the interim Dark Ages, he then uses Gaul as a sort of \\"control group\\" to detect Arthur's presence and impact on English and British history. He then undertakes to outline Arthur's career, which I think he has done very well, including offering one of the best, most scholarly analyses of Mordred's role in history that I have ever read. Excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy as history...","review":"This book takes on an amazing task: How did King Arthur fight his many battles and win? There are a few inherent problems here that are barely addressed by the author. #1: We don't know when Arthur lived. #2: We don't know where the battles took place. #3: We don't know anything about the size or constitution of his forces (or those of the enemy). Barring that, this book might be plausible as a reconstruction of potential military strategy and tactics in Dark Age Britain, but as an exploration of \\"truth\\" it is a farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music that would make baby Jesus cry","review":"Their basically what would happen if you took P.O.D's lyrics, and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about God and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice, so you have a band so bad it makes God himself want to commit suicide. The song titles are also annoyingly bad, obviously made so they sound artistically genius (but instead monotonous).And to everyone who thinks these guys are metal, they deserve to be buried alive.

The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad.

Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity.

This Underoath band is sooooo heavy i love when the singer screams, it shows how HEAVY the band is!Who cares if they sound like every other band? or cry like a little girl? or play the same 2 riffs throughout an entire song??

These guys do it as good or better than anyone else in the metal world right now. You have great songwriting, and thats what sets them apart from most of the crowd.There is definitely a trend here. No one can deny that if you have a Killswitch album album you're likely to dig unearth. The list goes on and on, but whats wrong with that as long as there is some origninality in the song writing. As long as I don't think I'm hearing a specific metallica riff, or lyrics almost exactly like pantera I'm alright. And I coudn't pin down any particular song with these guys.So if you're not jaded on metal core hardcore whatever other label people come up with, then check this album out because its a legitimate part of good heavy metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Egh... 3 1/2 stars.","review":"Well... what happened? This is emo core at best. Their new singer, Spencer, is kind of... hm. Let me put this one way: old Underoath was a ground-breaking metal-core band on it's way up the underground with incredibly passionate, personal, and sincere lyrics. The new Underoath is just a somewhat bland, middle-of-the-road, stick-to-what-sells band. I really don't think this is terrible stuff, but it's just so unoriginal. This is very driving emo, I guess you could say. It has a good amount of screaming, no doubt, but the music is incredibly emo-oriented. This reminds me a lot of Finch, A Static Lullaby, Dead Poetic, and Funeral For a Friend. In fact, it took just about all the elements from those band and tried to fuse something original, and they were unsuccessful.

Yes, you heard me - beautiful. Its a masterpiece. Reinventing Your Exit and A Boy Brushed Red are the two stand-out tracks.When I first downloaded these songs a couple of weeks ago, I was so shocked and disappointed by the dramatic change in the sound.

Why can't you just pick one? If you can't pick either one then just touring, making music and really decide if this band is what we want it to be. So my advice is don't get this cd! Its not worth your money unless you have ur friend burn this crap. NOT worth your money wait for the remixed or remastered version and thats proly not gonna be for a while.

If I wanted to hear screams I would just go to a nearby playground with kids, but then again you'd hear laughter as well from those kids, as far as Underoath goes the only laughter would be how unbelieably crappy they are. I know they have a newer cd out and I didn't bother looking at it, but maybe they've grown up and realized that people want to hear lyrics, not just screaming.

Some Christian bands start of writing about Jesus (like POD and MXPX) and sell out completely.Then there are those who have Christian members but just want to write tunes about everything. Being Christian in a rock and roll worl can sometimes be like playing with fire cause you always have people breating down your neck. Expecially if a band member is seen doing something not so Godly (like Sonnie from POD saying curse words at Ozzfest) people are bound to jump on that and say \\"thats not so Christian now is it!\\" while wearing a Marilyn Manson shirt.Bands out there do have Christian members but try to keep the whole religious thing at a low for reasons like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coolest thing since Stryper!","review":"Banal, trite, unoriginal, and lame.

I expect the next time I pass a church on Sunday morning to hear the pastor banging on a bunch of pots and pans and screaming out his sermon to his enthralled audience in a lame attempt to appeal to the younger generation.

I'm not really into all the different genres and what not, but it seems to me that they went a little too emo for me. I like some emo but I wasn't expecting to hear it from them. But it is a really good cd even with the singing. And I really like the lyrics on number 10.

If you like hardcore, dont even bother. The guitars and drums are so pop-punkish it makes me want to puke! The vocalist has a good emo voice, but he screams for no reason, and there is nothing to back it up. It sounds empty instead of aggressive. The bottom line: Emo fans, try it. As for me, i want quality hardcore, and this just isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did all the metal go?","review":"When i became a fan of Underoath a couple years ago, I was drawn to them by their heavy songs and original sounding keyboards. It created a different experience from the rest of the metal, hardcore, and emo out there. Well they got a new singer and it seems like they completly lost their identity. Now they sound exactly like every other screamo band out there. Track 2 is hideous because you can tell the some of the lyrics in it are trying to appeal to 13 year old girls. The music itself is so bland and nothing at all stands out. The vocals seem to be the main focus. Underoath probably figured they will gain new fans by taking this route, but they also lost alot of fans too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If liking this album is wrong, i don't wanna be right","review":"I'm a self proclaimed metal head, and in the past have been very vocal against emo/screamo bands. Well, I've been trying to broaden my horizons and a friend of mine recommended underoath. Naturally I was skeptical, but I was very pleasantly surprised with this CD. Is it absolutely amazing? no. Are they a revolutionary band full of new ideas? absolutely not. Do they make enjoyable music within an established genre? you bet your a$$ they do. My complaint, as with many screamo bands, is that all of the songs on here sound very very similar, so it's hard to distinguish between tracks. A boy brushed red living in black and white is probably my favorite track from the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"how's about we stop labeling music","review":"i think it's about time we stopped persecuting good music just because someone wants to call it \\"emo\\". this cd has plenty of good lyrics, good screaming, and great music. if u can't accept the fact that your \\"metal\\" bands are old and out of date, then you're just gonna be stuck in the past with really crappy music. buy this album... it'll change your life"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Q: What exactly is Underoath doing now that any other hardcore band with emo influences isn't?A: Nothing.Thier prior cd \\"Changing of Times\\" was decent, though wasn't quite as great as the old stuff on Takehold Records. I had hopes from the cool cover (though, they should have made the picture with the girl's eyes closed the front, and the one with her eyes open the inside picture) that Underoath would improve on CoTs, but I was sadly disappointed. A few songs were nice enough, but only track six did anything that made me happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under written","review":"The cd has great sound quality. That said, it's fairly easy to write music that is not going to sound all jumbled or may be at such a strict tempo that it's more interesting. I believe the band has the talent to explore a more modern style with their talent using less formatted song structure. Anyone who can play power chords could be in the band, another way of saying that is the guitar players lack their own style making ability that other bands guitarists' are known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Underoath","review":"I like Underoath, but this album just doesn't live up to the older material in my opinion. It isn't even the same band doing this album. They had a complete line-up change, and it is very obvious if you listen to the music. Underoath used to be heavy. This isn't Underoath, the band died when Dallas left the band. If you want to here some of their good material check out \\"Act of Depression.\\" Overall it isn't a bad album, it's just not anything too special, they sound like a lot of other bands out there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ok Album","review":"I heard that their first cd was much better that this one.

It is a crying shame that UnderOath would think of this horrific mess of music. As a previous reviewer posted, maybe it isn't fair to compare it to the first two albums but I am. We loved them the way they were, and they have disappointed thousands of fans. We didn't want a completely new band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underoath ehhhhh","review":"This CD is basically unlistenable.

SPENCER IS THE ONLY SCREAMER THE BAND HAS EVER HAD HE WORKS AT SPENCERS NEXT TO HAWT TAWPIK HE IS SO HARD CORE... HE EVEN WEARS BANDANAS ON HIS BACK POCKET TO LET GAY PEOPLE KNOW HOW HE LIKES IT. I THINK THE LAST SONG IS ABOUT SATAN AND THEIR LOVE FOR HIS DARK MAJESTY. seriously this cd is horrible i will never let this grace my ears. d00d go for cries of the the past or act of depression. thats good underoath dallas blows spencer out of the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"What a disappointment. I have old versions of songs off this cd before they decided to rerecord the entire thing. This cd would be a waste of $15 and hours of my time. Maybe you guys should look into old Underoath. Especially all of you \\"nerds\\" that are in love with the DVD that probably have no clue about the old heavier side of Underoath. You probably wouldn't like it anyway though, because it's not screamo. So nevermind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Mediocrity","review":"The only word that comes to my mind when hearing this album is \\"meh.\\" This band is extremely overhyped. Granted this band is extremely catchy as a lot of \\"emo-core\\" out there, they are far from innovative and sound like a majority of the popular hard rock bands that are prevalent today. Some of the guitar riffs are decent yet typical, and the singer has an amazing scream but a singing voice that is comparable to a handicapped person. This cd gets 2 stars instead of 1 because they're a decent band that can improve in many ways. Anyways, the bottom line is if you're looking for a satisfying and catchy album with minimal talent, pick up this cd.. you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never stops being amazing....","review":"Underoath is one of the most famous names right now in hardcore music and the new cd doesn't bring them down one bit. I am a big fan of hardcore and kinda emocore sounding music and Underoath has always been at the top of my list. Some might say that the cd is too soft and not good anymore, but there are few of these people and they are downright wrong. If anything Underoath has probobly trippled its fan base by making the music more accaptable but still just as heavy and inventive as anything else theyve ever produced. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"This us Underoath's 2nd album, and an excellent one at that. The only brand new song is Ten Friends and a Crowbar, and the other songs 3 are demos of other songs on the cd. The album art is a lot cooler than the original version, and there is a dvd with bonus stuff (I haven't watched the dvd yet, too busy listening to the cd haha). Definately worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay","review":"I know alot of people are saying things about kids not knowing of the other 3 cd's. I'm 14 and I know about \\"act of depression, cries of the past, the changing of times\\". I have liked underoath for a while now. I know what there old music sounded like with the grungy growls and the awesome breakdowns. Personally I like the old underoath alot better. But if you are into the screamo type stuff then you will like this cd. I have this cd and I think its good even though they changed there old sound. Anyways I hope underoath comes to there senses and goes back to there old music. Spencer is awesome but they have to get Dallas back."},{"rating":"2","title":"and a good Christmas was had by all","review":"With only BB King's Christmas Celebration being what might be considered \\"well known\\" this compilation of obscure and never before released Christmas songs is a fantastic addition to your festive playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Low Cost Net than I Expected!!!!","review":"Terrific, well made, robust net system, much better than I expected.

Now for those who only like the widescreen Blu Rays,The movie was ORIGINALLY FILMED IN 4:3 RATIO. (\\"Wide screen\\" ratios did not exist until a few years after this movie was made, or were too costly at the time.) I was a little surprised when I first saw this as many movies of this grand scale are of the wide screen variety, but that was just the technology of the time.

The film actually presents a surprisingly good story. There's a man and a woman working together without any obvious female chauvinism attempting to emasculate the man or put him in the shade.However the original book presented the romance between the returning missionary and the habitual drunk, it's an innocent love story in the movie.

This is one of the best movies of all time. When the spinster missionary woman (Hepburn) must TOLERATE Mr. Arnaut (Bogart)in their life-threatening trip down the river in a beat-up old boat, The African Queen, the fun begins. She can drum up no respect for this man--until she realizes that he is an intelligent person who may be able to save their lives by his cool wit. He good naturedly sloughs off her constant criticism, while she endures his slovenly ways and colorful language. At some point they start developing a strong like for each other.

Most of the illustrations are maps of the areas where a sample fossil was found or drawings and pictures of actual fossil bone at the site where found.

I love a good date movie and am prepared to accept a certain formulaic quality from the genre. But I'm afraid this offering fails to meet the required standard.It's the usual plot: star figure skater needs new partner after his established partner is injured. He plucks an unknown out of nowhere -- they train together, fall in love, have a romantic crisis and end up winning the gold.To make this enjoyable, the lead characters need to have chemistry and the movie needs to make at least some minimal effort to avoid cliches.Unfortunately, almost every line in this script is a cliche -- my wife saw several coming before they were uttered -- and the leads, while attractive don't exactly melt the screen with their passion.Pretty harmless fare -- just not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cutting Edge-Chasing the Dream","review":"I was led to believe there were seque;s to The Cutting Edge.

I enjoyed watching it even though it was a little predictable. It was a bit of a role reversal compared to the previous 2 movies, with the skater in need of a new partner being a guy, and the new partner turns out to be an amateur hockey playing girl. I think that Alejandra was cast perfectly, as the actress who plays her portrays the perfect amount of attitude needed for a hockey player, but also the slight timidness that is found only if you search beneath the surface. My favourite is still the 1st, The Cutting Edge, with this coming in a close 2nd for me. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tansforming Love","review":"it WAS ENTERTAINING AND ALSO GOAL ORIENTED.

While the actors are engaging, this is a repeat of the first movie; they even do the same Pamchenko move at the end. The only difference this time? Instead of the male being a poor, hockey player and the female being rich, the female is a poor, hockey player and the male is rich. The pair even sneaks into the big contest by placing one out of the money and then an incident happens that lets them squeak in.

I borrowed both books from the library and read them simultaneously. Don't bother with Walking the Bible - it is silly and self-indulgent and just made me angry. I am going to buy the Dalrymple book and insist that everyone I know read it.

It is imperative that we all make ourselves aware of the injustice our country has been supporting.

He was talking about the origins of agriculture in the middle east and his complete ignorance of the subject was painfully obvious to anyone who has even dipped into the topic. Ignorance did not stop him from spewing misinformation with confidence and fluency. I'd be surprised to learn that he knew any more about the other toopics in this book than he does about how farming began, and I certainly don't have the time to waste finding out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking The Bible by Bruce Feiler","review":"Bruce Feiler has a gift for combining his personal experiences with scholarly works. Mr. Feiler starts out trying to prove the authenticy of the Bible by confirming its locations. He ends up caring more about how the Bible brings meaning to our lives. We can see how he changes as the book progresses. Mr. Feiler and I have read the same scholarly books on the Bible. He can interpret the books in a way so everyone can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected!","review":"I admit I was skeptical. As one who has traveled to the Holy Land and experienced it firsthand, I doubted Feiler's ability to capture not only the land, but the people, both present and past. To his credit, he does a good job of seeing the physical and spiritual, as well as how they are intertwined. This is a fun read and well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traveloque rather than religious study","review":"To be honest, I was expecting more of an light archeological study rather than a simple traveloque. So I was perhaps disappointed by the lack of depth.It started out sounding a little like some Zionist literature, with the \\"maybe its in my DNA?\\" and interviews with Israeli settlers in the occupied territories. No discussion of the alternate political views - e.g. why should they be allowed to take land that doesn't belong to them. But this is done without much overt political agenda and is not offensive; just doesn't necessarily fit with the exploration of the Bible.Most of the book wasn't like that though, but was just kind of boring. I took a class in college that reviewed the \\"Old Testament\\" with the perspective of history and anthropology which was great and I was really expecting something more like that.So probably a good book for some, but not what I was looking forward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error by ommission","review":"Feilor writes a readable travelogue but manages to travel through the middle east drawing historical conclusions but (conveniently?) ignores most of the Arab cultural contributions made in a packed couple of millenia. Most of the Arabs who appear in the book are \\"extras\\", typically presented as ignorant laborers, or obnoxious children. In the light of the Israelis' aggressive and violent encroachments onto Palestinian territories on the West Bank, this viewpoint serves only to foster the myth that the current and recent historical occupants of this area are \\"non-people\\". Feilor, however, does not come across as mean-spirited: only callow. Don't read this book for insights into Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, or Egypt: go ahead if you want to better understand Israel's perceptual difficulties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheds new light on the stories of Abraham, Joseph, Moses et al.","review":"I agree with some reviewers that Feiler is not a great prose stylist and that some of his descriptions of places and things are either overwrought or banal.However, I found the book fascinating as a secular Jew's face-to-face encounter with the chief document of his religion. Feiler certainly does not find a connection to the Divine in a blinding flash of insight, but he acknowledges, sometimes begrudgingly, that the biblical narratives are remarkably consistent with what archaeology tells us about life in the ancient Near East.Archaeology cannot prove the stories true, of course -- but many biblical critics have given them so little credence as to argue that they cannot possibly be accurate. Feiler's book, although not a scholarly work, should at least give pause to these thinkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Testament comes to life!!!","review":"This is a dynamic journey that was a true hearted pleasure to read. Bruce Feiler reenacts and covers the terrain of Abraham, Noah, (Mt Ararat) Isaac and Jacob and brings these places back to life as in the time of the Torah. If you enjoy the Old Testament this book will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"it will open your eyes again","review":"I bought this book on a whim, and I'm glad that I did. When it arrived, I wanted to read it as a companion to reading the first five books of the Bible again with new eyes. After a couple chapters, I looked forward to having the time to read it increasingly more. I love the way Bruce combines narrative of his trip across the region, archeological history, and Biblical narratives. About half way through the book, I wanted to find pictures on the web of sites he describes. My understanding of the Bible was definately enriched by reading this book. I highly recommend it for someone who has not given much thought or attention to the beginning of the Bible, but instead focused solely on the Gospel... it will open your eyes again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful documentary","review":"Though not light reading, Bruce Feiler's written documentary of his trip through the Holy Land is very interesting and readable. He appears to have made his study of Moses with an open mind and heart. While he didn't find absolute, archeaological confirmation as he sought to prove Moses' existence, Mr. Feiler's travels showed that all the stories in the Pentateuch are quite believable based on other archeological evidence from this time period. I enjoyed all of the interesting evidence and stories he presented from his interviews with many people living in both the Jewish and Arab countries, as well as his confession of his own enlightenment. If you are interested in Biblical history, this is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!","review":"Feiler's account is sensitive and goes deep.

I read all the parts about Egypt before we got to Egypt, but couldn't finish it in time for Israel a few days later.Anyway, I finished it now ( a few months later) and I thought it was a great addition to my travels.Bruce really conveys what it means to travel in these countries spiritually. I highly recommend this book to anyone of any religion that has or dreams of these travels. Issues being what they are nowadays, I'm thankful I had the experience over there. It's a lengthy read but well worth it!

But, unfortunately, the public loves to believe the worst about the NY Police, and the author exploits this fact. However, as a former member of the SIU, 1966-68, I can tell you that most of this never happened. And the minutia that was vaguely true did not happen the way the author has stated. I was most amused at how Kelly conveniently leaves himself out of the story. Yes the French Connection dope did disappear. But NOBODY, I mean NOBODY, and certainly not Gerald Kelly, knows where it went. His theories are pure fiction...sprinkled with comedy. Don't waste your money on this rag.

When I find myself reading only the first sentence of each paragraph, as I often did in this book, I know the pace of the story has fallen virtually to zero. If it was cut by one-half to two-thirds in length, it might move at a better pace. It also needs to focus on some interesting problem or conflict that a reader is interested in seeing resolved.

Although part of a series, Flynn does well to keep new readers in the loop about what is going on. Readers who are new to the series can dive in with this book without feeling lost. Unfortunately, I found the book lacked a great deal of intensity. There are multiple character story lines, but it is a terribly long read with not much in the way of plot development along the way.

I've read that this actually gives you MORE visual data than the theatrical version (as the film was supposedly originally shot in full-screen and then had the top and bottom of the screen lopped-off in theatrical rectangular shape -- and was presumably shot with this intention. And as such, the full-screen version is as good or better than what we'd get from a widescreen format.)Turns out that all of the above is not true. The full-screen version is in fact Uber-cropped.At any rate, despite the miscasting of Judd Hirsch as the ex-'60s-radical-turned-father, the movie itself is one of those rarefied things that's so good it tends to escape hype --- or even adequate attention.

I don't even think it was digitally remastered, as it looks no better than a VHS copy.

These people are not Web masters so then need to have the background information before understanding how the whole program works.In my opinion this book is a great overview of the Adsense program.

Ostensibly it is supposed to be about making easy money using Google's AdSense advertising program. The book is written as a narrative of characters attempting to build a web site that will make them money. It is truly a strange approach.Instead of sticking to the subject of the title, the author instead takes the reader through the mechanics of building a web site, including registering a domain name and --- I kid you not --- \\"finding the perfect name.\\" He then launches into a primer on basic HTML. Very weird in a book supposedly about Google AdSense.Perhaps this book would be useful for a person totally inexperienced in just about everything, including tying their shoes. As a primer on Google's AdSense program, it is very lightweight. There are far better books on the subject.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS BOOK","review":"stay away from this book. i couldn't even finish it, it was so bad and ignorant. where people come up with their ideas i don't know. though, if you want to hear someone ramble on about how to take any worth, passion, or spirituality away from the bible, than here's your book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"Purchased to upgrade my existing home theater projector and am very happy with my choice.

The book also explained a great deal of the political turmoil that Gandhi found himself ...forever foundering in.A great and spiritual man no doubt. Shades of a contemporary Jesus, Buddha, and Mother Teresa all rolled into one. A great spiritual icon but one who struggled to overcome those nasty little demons (i.e.: jealousy, anger, lust etc.), that affect all of mankind.He trained the \\"Tiger\\" to overcome the \\"Lion\\" by non-violent civil disobedience. Ironically, \\"non-violence\\" spawns \\"real violence\\" and the results are...sadly the same.It was not England that killed Gandhi, but the same \\"Tiger\\" (India) that he had nurtured from it's captivity to it's independence.A very good and informative book for anyone trying to understand India and those who lived it's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in many areas!","review":"I purchased this book on Gandhi as an intro to his life and works. I did not realize that it was written over 50 years ago though, and it shows. What I mean is- if you are looking for a very human portrait of the man, look elsewhere. I just couldn't get through this. The first 20 pages alone skip around so much and leave out years of his life- it leaves the reader feeling lost.

This is not a good history book - historical analysis has moved on considerably since this was written and I doubt that the author was even aware of the current scholarship of his time. The book is more fiction and opinion than anything else. Early Irish myths, for example are taken as historical fact and his work on later Ireland, especially the eighteenth century, shows a real lack of knowledge of what was actually going on.

A wonderful introduction to the kabbalistic \\"Tree of Life\\" or Sfirot. Each chapter is dedicated to a sfirah or point on the tree and they are described in great detail. Beyond that, the author takes the theory out of the abstract metaphysical realm and uses illustrations that apply to everyday life and we see how the metaphysical interacts with the physical. There are some wonderful, practical meditations in this book that I still use often and share with others as often as I can.

Its clues on ancient navigation could provide vital keys in understanding trans-oceanic contact prior to the age of Columbus. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Fun!","review":"This work stands at the threshold of a new age of discovery. Erikson and Zapp deftly take apart the conventional view of history as Eurocentric and recent... with the Americas as a barbaric afterthought to civilization. The authors reveal a multitude of sites in Mesoamerica that hearken back to Plato's description of Atlantis. They reveal an ancient world that included seafarers from Africa, China, Polynesia, and the Mediterranean that met in a virtual melting pot in the Americas. The fun part is that they describe the locations of these ancient sites and their legacy in stone and myth. Some are as enticing as the awaited undersea site off Cuba.

It does provide a rather concise history of the time period. There was considerable dispute over control of various segments of the French countryside. Events were compounded by disputes between Henry II's sons. Individuals wanted power, and often entered into outside alliances (always hazardous). To quote an old expression, \\"a house divided cannot stand\\" and, in the case of the English monarchy, the French king reaped the crop resulting from the seeds of turmoil among Henry II's family. The main problem with reading the history of a particular king is that it is taking a part of history out of context. To understand the full situation, it is necessary to read both the preceeding history, and the history that followed.

I'm afraid that there is nothing in this book that is even remotely helpful. While there are all sorts of tips about how to set up an office (e.g., which software to use, how to set up phones, etc.) all of the tips are so simplistic as to be worthless. The information in this book is just far too elemental. I expected to see more detailed information on things such as advertising, dealing with the administrative aspects of running a law office and growing the business. Instead, the author spent way too much time on which word processing software to buy and the various types of telephone systems.

That was a good way for me to begin a realistic assessment of what it would take to go out on my own. I own Foonberg's \\"How to Start and Build a Law Practice\\", too. I found that book more helpful once I had already started my practice. For me, Foonberg was too detailed for the stage of thinking about starting.

It's really heavy. It's very unbalanced, with all the weight in the shovel head, making it very heavy to lift. I cannot get ANY leverage with it. I live in Maine where you're often having to lift the snow to pile it up on a snow bank (sometimes banks that are 3 to 5 feet tall), or dump it over the railing off my porch. I find the bent handle means I'm having to lift much higher and it takes a lot more twisting to get the snow off. Also, it's very difficult to lift the snow off my steps with it, and the bent handle makes it hard to shovel them from above, so I have to trudge through the snow down to the base of the steps and shovel from below. This is a lot more effort!When I use traditional shovel,I never experience any of the back pain that folks are talking about.

It is another to just bang away so unmusically.I couldn't believe how horrible the 1st movement of K.310 was played. The loudness of the left hand many times made the melody played by the right hand practically inaudible. I couldn't even make out the main theme the first time through.I got so turned off that I forwarded to Mozart's earliest pieces. Here the recorded volume was so low that the background noise of the clavichord was as loud as the music itself. Raising the volume only made things worse. This was so distracting that I just had to stop playing the CD.Do not purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I first saw this on amazon.com and fell in love with it at first sight!

In this novel, their boyfriends both leave for college, and they are both left to complete their senior year on Kwaj. Cass must deal with her mother's pregnancy. A new boy, Sam Steele, comes to the island, and makes friends with Cass and Tabitha. One of them likes him, and who will it be? While Cass is filled with remorse at the departure of Logan, Tabitha is relieved that her boyfriend, Micah, has left. This book deals with the changes many girls encounter during their teen years. I enjoyed this book, even though the diction is not very good. It strongly enforces Christian views and moral behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Must Be Said.","review":"This is a free Kindle ebook version of an old Norse epic poem.

It's a good read, just be prepared to spend a lot of time on this as I have read a paperback version and the style of reading that you use on Kindle actually slows it down.

The ethics of this authors, are Christian not pagan, and there is much nonesense to be found in their books (including Gavin Bone) when refering to Deity from a Christian pespective.Which in a way is rather hypocritical, they include rituals for the Goddess Hecate, yet they strongly oppose hexing!!??, I pity the poor souls who might be the recipients of the astral slime of this three!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly I must disagree","review":"Sadly, this book has a number of inaccuracies and is poorly researched. It is obvious that the Ferrars rely to heavily on Robert Graves and his mythological theories, many of which have been debunked by better scholarship. The rituals were bordering on insulting, especially the Greek ones. It is obvious that they have never read a book on greek religion.

It's all a bit predictable and slow. Still, to be fair, most of the acting is top notch (Colin Firth, Timothy Spall, James Wilby in particular, although the usually excellent Bill Paterson is something of a hammy characature). I know it's a period piece, but it's also a little hard to believe that 18-year old boys as this naive and awkward, even those with a sheltered public school upbringing.

The book starts off cruising on an endless stream of pop culture references, slides into flashbacks and time travel, only to come to a halt with a couple of fight scenes and plea for forgiveness. There's a lot of detail here, but not a lot of depth--the boys may be back in town, but I hardly felt that any of these main characters really cared about what they came back for. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for high school nostalgia, but this reads more like the Cliff Notes version of true feeling and memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars for 'The Boys...'","review":"Christopher Golden has come a long way from his vampiric novels. This outing manages to mix together the angst of high school reunions, long-distance friendships, and family ties in a way never-before-done by an author not named Stephen King! The supernatural elements are deftly woven into the novel's framework a little at a time, and don't take a prominent position until about 175 pages in. By that time even a jaded critic of horror novels will care enough about the characters to keep on reading.A well-done outing, and one that's going to keep you up later than you want to be. The pages will keep on flipping, but it's not due to magic, it's due to Golden's magical touch with the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden does it again..","review":"From the very first paragraph I was hooked into the world of Will James. The twists, turns, side steps and dark alleys kept me on the edge of my seat. Christopher Golden took a story about a high school reunion at a small New England high school and rewired it with shifting realities and memories.

As their relationship grows, so do Cal's guilt and sorrow, until, in the end, he is forced to make a sacrifice of himself in order to gain redemption.

Some people mentioned that the cartridges are not genuine HP. A couple weeks ago I went to order some, and they were listed at $40, so I ordered six. It said they were original HP cartridges.

He also showed me the bad welding work that was done to either repair or just build the valve.

Not so with the Christmas box. I was so taken with the simple beauty and truth in the story that I couldn't put it down. I think I scared the Attendant when, not noticing the passage of time, she startled me, and with tears in my eyes, I answered her, \\"I'll have a coffee, please.\\" I was compelled to explain to her that nothing was wrong, but that the book was amazingly touching.

My paddle still gets little indentations because the case is not hard enough to protect the paddle from pressure.

It's a collection of tongue-in-cheek illustrations, but not only do they not teach you how to massage your cat, they would actually be physically damaging (like \\"pull your cat's arms out to the side and give a sharp tug\\"). I could recommend the book, but buy it ONLY as a joke, and then also buy one of the many other books on the market that really do teach you how to massage your cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK AND DISTURBING","review":"I don't care if this is supposed to be a joke.

Plus its recommended by the ASPCA.If we can fall into this trap, so can others. Other people might not see the obvious \\"joke\\" that this book is and really try some of the \\"techniques\\" and end up with a seriously injured or dead kitty.I can't understand why books like this are still being published.

If it could be rated a negative 5, I certainly would. There are a lot of psychologically disturbed people out there who WOULD think it entertainment to torture a cat or other creature in this manner; others may attempt it innocently as noted in another review.I speculate the same folks who lauded it, also enjoyed Jeffrey Dalmer's life story for its entertainment value.If one is seriously interested in massageing a cat or dog, please read one of Dr. Micheal Fox's caring books."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistitled","review":"This book should have been named \\"How to torture your cat.

I'm sure any potential buyer can get the gist of what the book's about from reading these reviews, so if this sounds like it's up your alley then go for it.I do think it's silly to claim anyone who doesn't like this book is an idiot. The images do depict an animal being hurt - certain people will never like seeing pictures of that, even if they know it's a joke. So some people are turned off by violent images in general and others don't mind as long as it's all clearly in absurd good fun - that doesn't mean one group has no sense of humor, or that those who are not bothered by the images can't enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My three cats and I loved this book!","review":"I love my kitties.

Overall, the book is well organized. The vocabulary is not exhaustive as should be expected for a beginning-level book. There is no general glossary, but word lists are found in the back of the book divided into sections corresponding to chapters 11-30. (The first ten lessons cover the basics of greetings, farewells, numbers, and so forth.) Unfortunately, the book has yet to be updated for the euro as it still uses the franc as the French unit of currency, and other updates should be included to reflect today's students' experiences... this edition is from 1991 when cellphones were rare, computers used diskettes, and so forth. There is an accompanying cassette tape of the conversations which I have not heard yet... cassette tape?

It's easy enough to use. I've used it with SD cards, thumb drives and an MP3 player. If you're listening to a track on a card or thumb drive, it restarts the track every time when you cut the power to the transmitter. This is not a problem with an MP3 player as the source.The transmitter power is not the strongest--it works well for voices, but music suffers from the lack of power.For the money, this is a good product.

It has no playback functions except \\"play\\", \\"next track\\", and \\"previous track\\": no shuffle/random or any other features. Also it doesn't work well, dropping the connection (to the FM radio) every few minutes and starting the track over from the beginning. Finally, the sound quality is inferior to CDs, not surprising since it's broadcasting over FM radio. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than I thought it would","review":"I've owned a few of these gadgets over the years. This one actually works better than all of them. There are a few issues:1) The included cable is very short - like 6 inches. It's basically useless. Since I've already had these in the past, I just used one of my other cables.2) It appears to transmit in mono. This is just fine for me since I don't really expect hi-fi in a rf transmitter transmitting MP3.On the bright side of things, you can choose the transmit channel to find a channel that doesn't have any traffic. Like all of these things, you will need to max out the volume on your MP3 device and crank up the volume on the radio. The output to my radio is clear and loud enough for me. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with iPods","review":"This does not work with iPods as they claim. Perhaps it will work with a iPhone or the absolute newest i-something.But, it does not work with any of my iPods, or my Creative Zen or my Samsung device.Anything I tried to attach by way of the USB or the mini-jack did not work.It does work with a miniSD. And it did override the FM station I tuned it to so that I could hear without radio bleed-through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"It worked great at first and it was very to use with a SD card which I also purchased with this item.

When I first pulled it out of the package, I knew it probably wouldn't last long. It felt sort of thin and fragile. If you decide to purchase this, do not attempt to use the headphone jack to plug in your phone or MP3 player. The part that you plug into broke off inside the device, which then shorted something out so that it doesn't work even if I use the card slot or USB.

For the cost of a fast food meal this gives you some outstanding flexibility in Car Audio. The very idea of being able to play MP3 files from an SD card (plugged into your cig lighter) is outrageously clever and it works.I've used this with a few MP3 players and as an SD Card standalone player. The sound quality is limited mostly by your own pre-installed equipment, and in finding the best possible frequency to sync up on. I covered the cost on this by sacrificing a few visits to Starbucks during my first week of ownership.This is not for people with a critical ear, and yes it is something of a novelty, as others have said; but it works as advertised and is indeed a very fun \\"toy\\".

That's how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy","review":"I was looking for a bargain FM transmitter, and I regret this purchase. Evidently the seller also knows how bad it is as they refuse to reply to my e-mail asking why the thing won't even work. The device is shoddily made and will look close to broken the minute you take it out of the package. Its ability to transmit a station is so poor, I would actually label this product as a Static Noise Transmitter.

I would recommend reading it along with an audio version of the book. I've never done it before, but i actually liked it! Another review stated that the book got boring, and it really can be if you are too involved and are looking for a really gripping read.

As a result, I got a new auto insurance policy and saved $500.00. The book has definitely been helpful for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching stories","review":"Stories to touch the heart about those who came before. A true perspective of life, the ups and downs, trials and joys, with the focus always on Jesus first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Great, exactly what i ordered.","review":"Nothing special to note, fast shipping and they are exactly what i ordered. The cables work well, are made solidly and look like what is in the images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"There's not much else to say, except that the cable worked for my CD-Rom drive that was missing the audio cable. It is extremely long, so it should work in almost any computer case. In fact, it is almost too long, and I had to make sure to zip tie it so my computer wires were not so cluttered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar Songbook","review":"An expensive book for what you get. Although it has many popular songs that you know. Many of the songs' guitar chords are incorrect and strumming technique was not what the famous artist used. Simply put... except for the melody notes, many of the music is wrong.Good beginner book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What a Rip Off!","review":"This book is a complete waste of money. Half of the chords listed are just wrong. I tried playing the book version along with the real version on cd, and was pretty upset to find the two were completely different. Also, the melody written is not the guitar part, it's the vocal part. So if you don't want to play chords and only want to play the vocal parts with your guitar, this book may be okay for you. If not, I suggest checking out some real sheet music. Don't waste your time and money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for my husband!","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my husband who would like to brush up on his guitar playing skills. He was pleased at how many great songs are in the book as well as how easily he can see when and what cords to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Guitar Player Songbook met my expectations","review":"This volume was in excellent shape. Notes and words were large and easy to read. Few page turns (important when both hands are busy.) Wish most songs were in lower keys. Not everyone is a tenor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Guitar Player Songbook, Omnibus Ed. 2","review":"\\"I was disappointed in this edition. The open book depicted on the cover suggests there is detailed strumming information for each song, as was the case with the earlier books, but instead there is only a very small graphic showing the strum pattern. I thought the picture on the cover was misleading.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Language delights; denouement does not.","review":"Graham Greene's mastery of diction and description is evidenced in the first 180 pages of this book. The ending, however, is rife with histrionics; it's a cheap out to an otherwise engaging read. Though some may equate this with Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (and Greene properly chastises the reader for this mental comparison), Greene does not rise to Conrad's stature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mid-life crisis stinker from briliant writer","review":"Imagine this for a plot:Unable to withstand his immense popularity with young, married women in Europe, and heartily bored of his work, the misunderstood aging Artist flees to Africa. He wanders up the Congo before settling down at a leper colony, where the quaint Catholic missionaries adopt him into their fold and allow him to be himself: moody, introspective, and manly.Soon, a parade of jealous fools makes him their hero, until a young woman married to an expatriate factory manager falls in love with the Artist, liver spots and all. Hijinks ensue, and the Artist withstands the rigors of public scrutiny by retreating into stoic posturing.I won't reveal the end.Basically, if it weren't for Greene's skillful prose, this book would be an absolute stinker. As it is, it earns only 2 stars. I recommend this book only to die-hard Greene fans. For those looking for a better Greene novel, start with \\"The Quiet American,\\" which is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use of Religion in Burnt-Out-Case","review":"We consider Querry to be more \\"religious\\" than the Fathers of the Leproserie. The Fathers keep doing their job because of a vocation by God and not for the sake of the lepers. Querry first doesn't have any motives until he feels needed by the lepers. He acts out of his empathy which he found again in Africa. That's the reason why he's much more honest compared to the Fathers who want to satisfy themselves by helping there. This fact shouldn't be the motive of Christian Love. Without the aim of becoming Christian, he developed Christian characteristics. Graham Greene might have used this plot to criticise those who are sure of their Christian behaviour towards God and the society."},{"rating":"2","title":"mixed feelings","review":"Very readable, quite trashy. All melodrama, funny how in youth it might have seemed profound, now riddled with casual racism and trite nihilism. Still he could tell a story that greene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best by any stretch","review":"Tough read that ultimately fails. A celebrated architect retreats from the world by moving to a Leprosarium in the middle of the Congo. His rebellion against himself and society seems like an attempt to show him as a better Catholic than a true Catholic. The religious angle is interesting but SO played out in Greene books -- he uses it to a much better affect in his other works. The character of the leper Deo Gratias (yeah really, he went THAT far) is particularly grating.Unless you're a hardcore fan, you can pass this one up without missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greene knows Humanity","review":"A terrific novel about a man who wants to drop out of a celebrated life, and chooses the most remote place he can think of for his retreat. Greene writes human nature so well, and there are so many passages to highlight and quote that sum up truths about human nature as Greene is so keenly able to capture. A little bit \\"Lord Jim\\", a little bit \\"Heart of Darkness\\", but with a sensibility more akin to the modern age. Take your time in reading and savor the insights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"moonstone earrings","review":"These are excellent every day wear with everythingearrings. Comfortable and stylish.

I've only just begun my lifelong pursuit of jazz appreciation and this book really is a great tool for this. It creates a mental visualization of the artist for us. This is the only way to actually see most of the great artists that have left us, the only way to actually see into the world they lived and played in. So much of the music that they've left us was inspired by their surroundings and their daily interactions. Lowe has done an excellent job in creating this visual walk through the history of such a great artform. This is highly recommended to all those who appreciate jazz for the great artform it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO THE *$$#*^!!

It's only an hour long! I'm a huge fan of Aaron Rosand and everything he did on the violin, and have been for 20+ years, and I know he still teaches even though he's retired. If the publisher can find it in their hearts to take a little less revenue, I'll purchase. This is all very disappointing because Ray Chen is a truly remarkable young violinist whose playing directly reflects his teaching from Rosand - as those of us who know Rosand's artistry well, can attest to. And it would be nice to be able to see that teaching for a reasonable price. Perhaps the producer/manufacturer of this video feels that it's worth the price they're asking, but they need to make their prices competitive or they won't see much in the way of profit. Oh well. I hope someday I do get to see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch video my son watches over & over","review":"This video took my 3 and a half year old from a \\"trains-only\\" boy into the space age. While it would seem that much of the material is too technical for him, he loves picking up whatever can every time he watches it. He's probably watched the library loan video 20 times, so we're sure to buy it to have a favorite ready at any time.It's educational and yet engaging enough that my other children and even other adults are sure to learn plenty, even if it's a repeated viewing.I'm a stickler for videos that are fun or educational; this one's both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"father of 2 and 4 year old","review":"Fantastic.

It has engaging video, graphics, and music. It also has an appropriate and thoughtful tribute to the Columbia and her crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked by toddler's interest","review":"I watched this with my 3 yr old & 2 yr old sons. It is technical enough to interest an adult, yet they were just glued to the TV the entire time!They would watch it all day if I allowed it.The video has multiple narrators, both children, males & females. I think that keeps their interest. It also bounces quickly from one topic to the next. It discusses space camp, astronaut training, experiments in space & much more. It seems a tad dated to the adult, but kids don't pick that up. It gives all kinds of facts that you will assume are rolling right over your toddler's head until he looks up into the night sky & states \\"maybe we can see the shuttle...it's 180 miles up from the ground\\" Then they will put their toy logs together & \\"drop their booster rockets when the fuel is used up\\" & send their toy boats to save them from the ocean depths. Amazing.Highly recommend. I only wish there were more quality children's videos like this available."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 year ofd love it","review":"Bought this for my 6 year old son who's shown an interest in space.

But this gets a bit long in the tooth after about 20 minutes. I learned a lot about the shuttle program from this but my three year old looked like he was sitting in Charlie Brown's classroom. Maybe he'll enjoy it more when he's older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview, can save a lot of time","review":"This book will give VB programmers a good head start in evaluating three popular (non C) Palm development environments. It is not a reference manual, nor does it delve into the advanced capabilities of the languages. But by using the same example for all three packages, the reader can quickly decide which package he/she is most comfortable with. Kilburn stayed pretty neutral in his approach, which is commendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two stories in one book...Past and present","review":"I devoured the first 3 books of this series. They were moving and wonderful. This book is just as good as the other 3. In this book, we find out the story of Cahira O'Connor. A brave young woman who stood up to her father/king and an opposing force for the man that she loved. We also finish the story of Kathleen O'Connor, who has been doing the research on the descendants of Cahira. She is in Ireland for the wedding of her best friend Taylor and his fiancee (whom she introduced) Maddie.This book describes the journey of Kathleen's faith, and how she comes to rely on herself for her own happiness. She realizes her own role in the Cahira tradition is not to chronicle the stories, or to take up arms to fight, but to live. She finds her own way in Ireland, and the ending of the book brings everything full circle and to a satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"book 4","review":"All of The Heirs of Cahira O'Connor are an excellent read. I recommend them for anyone who needs to relax and learn a little history at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween Costume Jewelry","review":"This item was cheaply constructed. I would not recommend buying it unless you are going to use it as part of a halloween costume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear tool dedicated to be used, not to fill shelves","review":"No over in-depth technical descriptions but the right amount of easy-to-understand (and easy to teach) gestures, clearly linked with the numerous (but classic) drills provided. Every aspects of PLAYING baseball is covered, except pitching. As a pitching coach, I strongly regret this fact. Developping a COACHING philosophy, a training schedule, managing players are not covered by this book. This practical tool knows the limits of its subject and plays its role within them. Not a \\"bible\\" but an helpful reminder, with drills easy to set-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund please","review":"As I dove into the book, I was waiting for the actionable jewels of wisdom from this author of deep experience. Through the first few pages it sounds like an infomercial for itself giving you the impression that the meat is just around the corner. Forty or fifty pages later I realized there was no meat.The outline asks some great questions and leads you to believe that the book answers them. After flipping anxiously to the page to find the answer, you are left feeling empty and cheated.Not only would I like my money back, I'd like the author to compensate me for my time he wasted. Maybe the hidden value of this book is the lesson I learned about not being suckered in by a single rave review probably written by someone known to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this shoulder rest","review":"Its cheap in every aspect.My daughter decided she would rather not use a shoulder rest than use this shoulder rest.The vinyl covered foam was very uncomfortable for her. Our violin instructor just couldn't find a way to make it comfortable.The grip (part that connects to the violin) is covered with this plastic thing which is horrible and seems like its easy to slip off. If it does slip off you can guarantee scratches on your violin.We ended up buying a Kun violin rest which is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is a really good book for any counseling student.

As I haven't grown up with American Football it gives me a fascinating look at the behind the scenes action and also how some of the great players literally got a start in the game. It is also amazing how the players and coaches can be so easily heard during games and what types of things they say and concentrate on. First Class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Compilation!","review":"I was very impressed upon viewing the 2001 Patriots Episode broadcast on NFL Network and just had to see if there was a compilation on DVD. Sure enough there was this AMAZING 40 Disc set. These are the most perfectly designed, well put together documentaries of the NFL and I firmly believe it always will be. This set is packed with over 40 years of NFL history spanning from the mid 60's to early 00's. This is a 40 disc set, with each episode plus extra interviews, stories, highlights, and history regarding the team for their respective year journeying to the Superbowl. This is the ultimate quencher for any fan during the off-season. In fact, no true fan would be without this compilation. A terrific collector and an NFL masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas gift ever","review":"I hate to conform to gender stereotypes, but I do. I got this item for my husband for Christmas and he and my 26 year old son love it! I am even a hit with my brothers in law for being the most thoughtful wife ever, not so much a hit with their wives, though.I have seen parts of this series and find it has enough human interest material to keep me entertained. I had hoped it included all the games, in their entirety. but it doesn't. It includes interviews, some game footage and documents controversy surrounding each game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"A quick read and decent insights but not something I would recommend to lovers of essay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD!","review":"This lost gem is just mind-blowingly beautiful and glowing iwth positive beauty. Breaking ground by incorporating sounds from Africa and blending them with modern dance New Age beats, the result is a very remote but very upbeat and uplifting classic that will stand for years to come.My favorites are \\"Hunting\\", \\"Nightbird\\" and \\"Forest Hymn\\". I especially love the last song with it's slight Gospel-like undertone to it. The Ambient Mix of \\"Lullaby\\" is very pretty too.Go out and find this if you can because from what I'm aware of, this CD isn't carried on U.S. retail markets as of at the time of writing this review. It's worth the hard search! I guarantee it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifiting music for work or play!","review":"I first heard this CD years ago in a store while \\"Hunting\\" was playing. I was entranced. I had to have that CD regardless of the cost and I haven't regretted it! While \\"Boheme\\" and \\"Comparsa\\" are equally compelling, this recording remains my favorite. Still one of my all time top ten favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best!!!","review":"This DEEP FOREST cd is so difficult to put down.

This music features Baka chants of Cameroun, Burundi, Senegal, and of the Pygmies. The music is peaceful and relaxing to listen to. Visions of tribal communities helping one another exist come to mind. I highly reccommend this CD for New Age chant searching buyers. \\"Sweet Lullaby\\" is especially appealing to the ears of Deep Forest's listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eco-Techno-Mondo Funky","review":"What an interesting an bizarre concept that really just seems to work! One can almost detect the primordial ooze seeping though the CD player! Pygmie chants and synth music make DEEP FOREST (and pretty much all their subsequent CDs) an \\"eco-friendly\\" listen full of dancy tunes! This project is a product of today's interests and is a happy look into some cultures that may never have given the listener an open door into which he/she might peer. It is unique and definitely worth a listen. If you are into Deep Forest, you might also want to consider other CDs by groups such as Enigma and Dead Can Dance, which are a bit less peppy but great for the unique way in which they all fuse many different sounds into a thoroughly modern mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Lullaby Is The Only Song I Like!","review":"I bought this CD when I heard Sweet Lullaby on my Pure Moods CD, well the only good song on this Deep Forest CD is Sweet Lullaby but since I have it already on my Pure Moods CD than it was a waste of money for me since I don't like any of these other songs, the rest of the songs are kind of too new agey or something for my personal tastes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There is only one good song on this entire CD- track number 2- \\"Sweet Lullaby\\".The other songs have good beat and are down right boring.If you heard \\"Sweet Lullaby\\" on the radio back in the early nineties, and you think the other songs are just as good, you are sadly mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butterfly1","review":"I ordered this CD and I received it in great condition even though it was used.

It so moved me that I couldn't wait to buy it when it came out on DVD. But, upon viewing the American DVD I noticed a few mminutes was missing from the show I saw on History Channel. Particularly, about ten minutes dealing with a group of children being locked into a school building, and the building set afire.I see that the American DVD runs 290 minutes...while the Netherlands DVD runs 300 minutes. Could it be the missing footage is in the Holland version???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Interviews","review":"I think this documentary was I great one because of the (for me) novel approach to the Nazi History: Why? and destroying the myth that the only evil ones were the SS.It was ordinary people who did much of the terrible things. The interview of ordinary people (yes human ones) were chilling. They don't show remorse.And that's the scary lesson: The atrocities were not just done by \\"sychos\\" (SS) but also by \\"ordinary\\" people...willingly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another propaganda film.","review":"The standard propaganda crap. Interesting, but not to be taken too seriously. The writers and producers of this series would have us believe that Hitler was worst than Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan and the Devil himself; that the so-called 'Holocaust' was the single most important event in history... Did they forget the millions more that were murdered by Stalin and his Bolsheviks? The World was a very different place back then. Racism, Imperialism, antisemitism, Darwinism and eugenics were popularly held beliefs throughout Western society and elsewhere. In the USA, great land of freedom and democracy, Blacks were segregated and treated as second-class citizens! Concentration-camps were a British idea from the Boer War; collective-punishment and mass execution was the typical manner in which the Colonial Powers dealt with insurgency, the German people have been unfairly singled-out. The Nazis were merely a product of their time and must be viewed in the proper context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"A very detailed history of the Nazi movement in Germany. that led up to World War 2!The interviews and the filmwork were most informative.Anyone with an interest or curiosity about the origins of this would be well advised to acquire this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nazi Book","review":"Not at all like his first book The White City, not as fictional style even though it is factual.

Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very let down....","review":"I felt all this DVD did was create propaganda to vilify germany. It completely left out all the outside support for germany and further acted as if germany only discriminated against jewish people? I am not german but am very familiar with history and this seems more of a hollywood script than literal history of the time. Needless to say, avoid the DVD and wait for the movie, you will save $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"The Nazis - A Warning from History is an attempt to vilify every German who lived in the 20th century and to systematically categorize them as \\"evil\\". Obviously this is some effort to deflect current controversial political issues onto some past event and \\"learn again\\" from History. Well, no one has ever \\"learnt from History\\" and it repeats. America claims to be a nation of \\"democracy\\" when it has spent the last six years creating bloodshed in the middle east, all for the control of oil reserves. The book should concentrate on the political and economic forces that shaped the 1930 German state and not debase the German people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of the Nazi state; very well done.","review":"This series is very good a zeroing in on individual Nazis to show how ordinary people did terrible things within the framework of the larger state. It also does an excellent job of explaining the Nazi world view. It pays well deserved attention to the importance Hitler placed on \\"art\\" and culture as well as the way in which social Darwinism was twisted into a culture of lawlessness where the strong were encouraged to exploit, if not destroy, the weak.Episode 4, \\"The Wild East,\\" I found particularly thought provoking. Its portrayal of Gauleiter Arthur Grieser is disturbing and truly \\"A warning from history.\\"I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"rating","review":"very excellent dvd, very informative and very scary.

I found the dvds to be very informative and added information I had not known before. The rise of Hitler to power was brought about by being in the right place at the right time, saying the right things. It is amazing how easily a nation can turn on itself ie against the Jewish population. Also how easily they believed they were intitled to the lands of other nations. This is probably not the best review ever written. Never wrote one before. But if you want to learn about the rise of Hitler and/or Nazism, this dvd set is an excellent start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary","review":"For the price this was a very well done documentary. The interviews with German citizens after all these years was moving. My only concern is that the piece did not touch upon the Reich's disarmament policy or gun control that set the people up for slavery and tyranny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space saver printer stand","review":"Good space saver printer stand, great value. I needed a low stand for my huge printer and this worked perfect, and it also looks very nice.The only problem I had was that there was a chip on one of the corners, but since the chip is on the back corner I didn't want to bother with the hassle of the exchange process.

I highly recommend that it be re-introduced."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best role of wesley snipes' career...","review":"i think wesley is a much better actor when he's playing sensitive ,intelligent males. not just guys who live by their guns. the supporting cast is also very good. notably robert downey, jr. as a dying gay man. natsssia kinski looks lovely as always. there was some controversy when this film was released about wesley's wife being an asian woman instead of white woman. he said they didn't want to offend the black females who would be watching this movie.and cheating on an asian woman with a white woman would make black women less offended? go figure. still a good film. i pity the reviewer who made the \\"mandingo\\" remark a few reviews back. only an insecure, jealous white male would say something like that. people should be free to love who they want."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was so moved by this movie that I had to watch it again.","review":"The combination of actors used in this movie are brilliant ! Wesley got to me. I think he is so sexy. The movie plot flowed like a wild river. It keeps you wanting more; like what's coming up next. I thought that Robert was so cool; his abillity to play many kinds of roles within one movie is astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ebony Fantasy","review":"I liked the movie because it surprised me at the end. This movie is no great work of art or an effort that challenged the acting abilities of the participants. It is just something that people who like Wesley Snipes movies will like. (Unless of course you are a black female) Black females are not represented at all in the movie as I recall. The movie seems more like the fantasy life a black man might have of career and sexual success that for some black men is probably a reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great cast can't save this movie.","review":"Empty and pointless story. Poor screenplay. And worst of all, characters that the audience just doesn't care about.The final plot twists lack purpose and leave the viewer thinking: \\"So what? \\"This movie strives to be insightful, full of suprises, and make the audience think... Unfortunately the story is shallow and fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"It started out looking like it would be interesing although the trailer left me wondering - another 'man leaves family for a something different' movie? There was the non-depth of the characters that never sorted itself out. Why did this take so little thought or so very little emotion, I wondered. Then the acting. Karen - was this a really passive come on or just an undefined character? In the end you have her casting fond looks at her once-husband (played as well as the non-character chould be played) as she had earlier cast looks at Max and you wonder if it's about to happen all over again. And why did Max just suddenly wake up one day and find his energetic, explosive wife with personality so uncomparable to the limp Karen who has silent orgasms? The ending is no surprise at all even though they really give it a very obvious try to be clever. Lame. I give it 2 stars rather than one for for the orange story's presentation by Charlie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Downey Jr. is the reason to watch this film.","review":"This is not a movie that I would purchase, but it is most definitely worth renting. Robert Downey Jr. steals this movie from the other actors. His performance, given from a hospital bed, is mesmerizing! Every other actor in this movie melts into the background when Downey is on screen. He has to be one of the greatest actors, albeit greatly troubled, that the silver screen has ever seen.Ming Na Nguyen is nice to look at in her nude scenes, but you'll have to overlook the acting. Not good...but she has a very nice body and I loved the way her breasts looked in this movie.Overall, the movie doesn't rate 2 stars, but Downey's performance rates at 5 stars. It's worth renting simply for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time & Money!!!!!!1","review":"This is one of the worse films ever done..... What was Wesley thinking playing in this movie???

So, I assume they used paint that cannot withstand heat of the brake. If you are going to buy this caliper, you better paint whole caliper before installing.Even 6 year old original OEM caliper had very little rust.Bolt head size of the caliper hose is different from original.And clips included also look very cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, yet sweet","review":"Every cat personality is illustrated in this book.

It was completely useless. No matter how many times I tried to plug it in, it didn't work. Then I discovered that it's not recommended to use a converter with flat irons. Well, it would have been nice if that was in the description of the converter before I bought it, given that most of the electronics don't need a converter and you can use them just with an adapter.

I was nervous about using my curling iron because I read several horror stories about damage to your hair or curling iron if you don't use the \\"right\\" type of convertor and adaptor (not to mention fire hazard). I used mine several times with no problems. I did adjust the temperature to a lower setting than I use at home just to be cautious. Did not use with a hair dryer though (our hotels had their own hair dryers). The box is a bit bulky and heavy though. The kit did not come with any real instructions, so do your homework before you travel to know how to and when to use the converter with the adapter plugs.

Some dialogues have focus on very interesting concepts, dealing with a lot of different points of view about cinema, literature and human behavior.

So for anyone interest on this movie don't buy it save your money get something better this movie doesn't deserve this. The Plot on this movie is has no sense, there's alot of questions that leave you thinking or doubting even if you know Dragon Ball you get thrown out of the movie with no answers of what's going on, the special effects look really cheap they didn't take this movie seriously.

If you aren't familiar with Dragonball Z skip this and watch the anime.

Ouch, Dragonball Evolution is too much of a mess to be campy fun.Evolution will be totally weird and confusing to non Dragonball-philes, since nothing in the movie will explain much of anything. In fact, for those who are familiar with Dragonball the movie tells the story from the beginning, using characters and the ending from the middle.To make matters worse, the film is riddled with cliches.

Akira Toriyame's story was destroyed when it was decided that this film would be a poor blend of the beginning and end of the anime, they might as well have thrown the Mona Lisa in a fire place!However some interesting stunts were performed and some extraordinary special effects were used, FOX should have put the money elsewhere as a promising film was given to butchers and torn to pieces.This film should never have seen the light of day, it was worse than home alone 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies ever made!","review":"this movie is lame and dumb and stupid this movie is terrible from begining to the very end dragon ball evolution = epic fail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun if not accurate","review":"I saw how many people reviewed this movie with one star.

(I walked out of the theater angry because of that)And all the actors reek!The fighting is sloppy. The writing is garbage. The Directing is beyond terrible.There are many rip-offs (Spiderman,Star Wars,Avatar TLA,Matrix)This has the name Dragonball on it but don't expect anything of the sort! It's a DISCRACE!!!

This live action rendering does no justice to the DBZ franchise and heres whys:1) the fight b/w picollo and goku lasts one minute and has no detail. In the cartoon, entire episodes were devoted to long drawn out battles between the hero and the villain.2) the special effects are mediocre.3) the actor playing goku doesnt have charisma for this role.4) too much screen time is devoted to goku and his 'trying to be cool' and him 'trying to get the girl'.5) the plot is weak, has many unexplained segments, and doesnt really go with the time lines laid out int he cartoons.Avoid the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonball De-Evolution","review":"I would not buy this movie, even if you don't know much about Dragonball or Z. This movie is a very poor adaptation, FOX went with a low budget for the film, they changed Goku's behavior around 180 degrees. It is a bit entertaining but that surely dies out real fast. The special effects weren't very good either. Save your money for a better movie then this, you'd just be wasting it on this pitiful of an excuse so called Dragonball movie.

The acting is pretty cheesy and the fighting is mediocre, however the special FX was pretty cool. If you erase from your mind that there is no such thing as an anime then i give the movie a 2 out of 5, but as a movie inspired by the anime? well its certainly gets a 0 out of 5, the movie is pretty awful and i am happy it did not do well. They will need Marvel or the makers of the Matrix movies to rebuild this movie. The price i bought this for, which is $4 is the price this movie should have been from the beginning.

The story was poorly translated and, the action was absolutely nothing stellar. Trulya waste of time. This was a series created in the 1980s with exceptional stoy telling and action scenes, This is 2009 in the USAand the movie certainly did not match up to the show's charisma, that captivated millions, at all. Which is why it was pulledout of theaters and got the poor treatment by majority of fans and others, which it deserved. A VERY cliche and rushed storyline. Dragonball Evolution was child abuse, it felt like it was written by the director's five year with crayola crayons. Seriously the dialogu, even for a PG rated movie was PRETTY CHEESY. This movie is like the demon child of Power Rangers and High School Musical (Without the music.)

A good movie is a good movie regardless of what it's based on and Dragon Ball Evolution is not a good movie. The plot is nonsensical,the story cliche ridden and the dialogue is absurd. The effects are just plain laughable, they look like B movie effects from ten years ago. The only good thing about this movie was that it ended.STAY AWAY FROM THIS ABSURDITY!

Look elsewhere","review":"Do not even waste your money on this 'slap-to-the-face-of-db-fan-movie'. The story is so rushed that half the time one wonders what just happened? The special effects are so cheesy. Goku never went to school. Goku was never supposed to know what a girl is. Goku was never supposed to know cities existed.To summarize the whole movie. Basically over 150+ episode were crammed into this 1hr+ movie, which translate to failure, rush, characters appearing out of the blue. Very very poor movie.

The movie's acting and story is horrible, it does not follow the origins it's taken from faithfully (and not in a creative way; I don't protest to improvements or \\"evolutions\\"), and all in all a boring and horrible movie. This movie is just an example of Hollywood taking something amazing, stripping it of its glamour, and throwing it back at the audience purely for the sake of creating more $$$.Simply put, DO NOT BUY!

But if I remember correctly...please correct me if I am wrong...Goku did not learn to drive until much later. His grandpa died before Goku became a teenager...and I dont remember ever going to school. He was oblivious to it all.

An attorney does not have to prepare it and I only need 2 witnesses to sign my will and does not have to be notarized, but if I want, it can be notarized/affidavit from witnesses (so they don't have to search for these 2 witnesses if I die--that may tie up my will in probate)...again, just research a bit before you buy, but for the price, this was the best choice for me and my husband (we have 2 young children)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not create a living will","review":"I purchased this software specifically because I wanted a living will in accordance with the laws of Georgia.

I've had a lawyer write a detailed will for me, but wanted to make changes and decided to try this, since I knew what to include, etc. Well, it was written for a toddler, and kept yammering meaningless garbage. Moreover, it is totally inflexible (i.e., you can't return later to complete certain segments; it just locks up). By way of example, one of the first questions is whether or not you want to be embalmed, and locks up unless you answer it then and there.

Well, I did get one or two sentences to print before it just started producing blank pages. Tried it again a few more times, same thing. What good is a will if you cannot print more than a couple of sentences?It's not like I'm computer illiterate or ran out of ink. Solving computer/technical issues for my clients customers is how I bring home the bacon. This includes printing problems. This software is sadly lacking.

It has NO alternate navigation, NO help buttons, NO documentation, NO e-mail address, NO URL for a Web site. It's unusable and user-hostile.This shows the limits of programs for idiots: Maybe it's great if you don't hit a bug or a snag.

It is easy to refer to and after finishing, I went back and high-lighted parts I felt I would need to refer to later.

Most of what the book covers you can learn from taking classes with your doctor prior to surgery. What would have been nice is to find a book to talk about the real feelings folllowing the 1st two weeks after. That for many is the critical turning point for experiencing every emotion under the sun, joy, depression, pain, hunger....this book didn't touch on the real emotions, and how every person may be different in what they can eat after surgery, instead they gave basic recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell binding!","review":"I admit that I bought it because my prof wrote it.

Not just re-re-reiteration which can be useful sometimes but exact cut and paste duplication from one paragraph to the next. This book could have been half as long without the repetition. Also it needs some better more realistic examples to illustrate how the UML works outside of some extremely simplistic situations.

I shall relate what my students have to say ... The reactions from my students is that the Booch book lacks depth (my students work in embedded systems, workflow, CAD ...), repeats itself and is unsuitable for serious work. Booch's earlier books did have some real applications (for example, the Home Heating System). In particular, his use of state machines was good. Today, they have been scaled down somewhat (they are mostly of the so-called anthroposophic kind and thus useless). Concluding, it is a pity that someone with the wealth of knowledge and background that the author has has not taken the effort to produce something of more value. After all, novice developers look up to the 3 amigos as being the 'gurus' of UML."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"Book is complete waste of money.

That is, to be strictly a UML users guide.The next books should be generically titled UML Interactive Tutorial: Intermediate.If you are a computer language theorist, this will not be the reference you need because it does not technically address those issues.

And on. I always try to get at least the first 100 pages under my belt before I draw a conclusion. As I turned the pages faster and faster, I realize I was bored silly by the laborious descriptions and the tedious dialogue. I figured the remaining 200+ pages would probably be no different. Perhaps all these enthusiastic reviewers have more patience than I do, but I'm still a bit surprised that so many people wanted to wade through this literary swamp populated by a most unsympathetic character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of an Invisible Man","review":"One of the best books I have ever read!

First, the author seemed to want us to follow the beliefs of the American Indians. I have known many American Indians and Christian missionaries to the Indians all of my life. I know that they would have been disturbed about the spirituality of this book. It is one thing to enlighten the reader; it is another to accept those beliefs into Christ's message.

It was always a huge privilege to be invited this Festival.The acclaimed Budapest String Quartet was invited to play with the Master cellist, and the result simply could not be more successful. This musical symbiosis bought with it one of most reminded musical testimonials of Prades Festival. The supreme musicality may be felt even for the most new coming listener. Recorded in 1959.And finally, the master played with Horszowsky the most extraordinary performance ever released of the Variations Op. 66 on Mozart's \\"Magic Flute.\\" There are no words to qualify this memorable and enriching experience.

What I found is that using it is actually more of a hassel than my disposable Gillette razors.The battery life doesn't last long and when it's 'dying' it slows down significantly so you don't get quite the shave you should be. It also misses some spots and the shave is not as close as you would get with a typical razor. It actually takes me longer to shave with this thing.Now I'm back to using the disposable blue Gillette razors. They do the job and anything closer and you'll be drawing blood.

As I stated in my review for Night Thirst, I usually only read short story horor and science fiction but I have had to add Mr. Whalen to my small list of authors of whom I will read other than short stories.

Monastery is set on an island in the Pacific Northwest where the Monks who maintain an old Monastery guard an ancient evil force. When the inevitable happens and this evil is released upon the island, the only man who stands a chance against it is a solitary professional assassin. The lines between good and evil become somewhat grey in this story and by the end, you know that the final battle has not been fought.

The product description is CORRECT in ststaing that this is the 18 track Japanese pressing. The track listing is INCORRECT, stating that there are 22 songs. The 22 song version is the more exspensive Korean version (that Amazon also has conflicting information for). Just thought I'd clear this up.As for the album, I was pleasantly surprised. Not being a huge fan of AWK's other 2 albums, I was expecting more of the same. WRONG. There are so many more sounds this album. Lots more instruments and better song arrangements.

And his new lyrics make even less sense. \\"i want your face because everyone says I look like you\\". And there's a song about wanting to go on a date where he says \\"let's go on a date\\" and \\"i want to take you on a date\\" a bunch of times. I think it's called \\"Let's Go On A Date\\".

It sounds like it was recorded in a toilet on a hand held 80's style tape recorder. Andrew's voice is well off as well. Half the time it doesn't even sound like him.

And it's a perfectly catchy tune, from Plavka's vocals to the acoustic guitar riff. Its bassline spawned a thousand cheesy trance sons, but it still sounds gripping here. The instrumental version places greater emphasis on the guitar, making it more flamenco than ever, even down to the castanets in the background. But it's \\"Follow Me!\\" which garners more attention, with its pure trance and the deep beat that lends itself to a hypnotic state, until the horns starts sounding about 1/3 of the way through, signalling an imminent change in direction from the minor key to a major one, as well as a significant uptick in the beat, going all out rave-strength for its final third (with a minute's worth of comedown).

Both ladies did a sterling job in playing their normal aged selves, then in switching over to their opposite ages. Barbara was so full of youthful energy, and Jodie was more mature in her attitude. Plus, I grew up in the 70's and it retains that 70's atmosphere. I still love FREAKY FRIDAY 2003 the best though, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, as they totally rocked the theater with their excellent acting skills and they also were EXTREMELY FUNNY!

I think the original was the best movie they could make on this subject some 25-30 years ago, but they were able to bring more to bear later.

As a mom of 3 boys, you never know what they will bring home on their shirts after school. I have been using this product for at least 5 years. It has even removed greasy/buttery stains left on shirts that had been previously put in the dryer. I have never had it ruin any or leave marks behind. The smell is a bit much, but after a wash and dry, the scent is gone. This is my go-to stain remover for greasy stains on clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow in Seattle?","review":"I purchased this shovel-pusher because of the unusually heavy snow fall in Fall 2008 and winder 2009. It is a great blend of the pusher I had and the shovel I broke this winter. The metal leading edge protects the plastic. There is enough of a shovel to lift and move snow but not so much that there is likely to be a back injury. Worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book for RF engineers","review":"This is a very good design guide for rf engineers and students involved in microwave components & circuits. Pretty comprehensive, but costly though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!","review":"First may I say that the above 2 reviews do not exaggerate in the least! I have never read a book with such deftly drawn characters! The description also amazes me; I feel like I know Elizabethian London as if I lived there and I never get bored of reading more about it in this book, whereas normally I am dying for it to end so I can get on with the real story! Kit is a fascinating character, as are the rest. An amazing book, all in all. You must read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Classics","review":"Hello,The item came as requested - very nicely packaged chock full of some of my favourite songs. I enjoyed it very much! What else can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mm-mmm! Mango-ey.","review":"This is the best of the Goya jams for my money. Not cloyingly sweet, but sweet. Not overwhelmingly aromatic, but undeniably mango. A judicious dab on toast gives a happy start to the day without kicking the calorie count. Clever wife makes a tangy-sweet salad dressing with lemon juice, mango jam and some other magical incantations or stuff. Nice going Goya."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Sold!","review":"I'm totally smitten with this new novel by author Lisa Jewell. Her previous book \\"Ralph's Party\\" was good....but, this new one is GREAT. I love the chemistry, charm and all around good humor in this book. As a young (well...fairly), single, working girl....I find these types of books (By way of the British Invasion) great fun. I love to escape into a world that never involves my paying off credit cards, the over abundance of dirty dishes under the bed or the fact that there is no one taking out my trash (but myself) This book is full of wonderful characters, great story, and great charm. I loved it! And, I think you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a twenty-something reviewer","review":"Great book! I couldn't keep it down. I loved the situation that Nadine and Dig got themselves into. Dig turned thirty. He wasn't pleased. He was especially unhappy with the fact that the women he seemed to attract were teenagers. Nadine was a successful photographer who had a hard time committing to a nice man. Her free-spirited personality got in the way. Dig and Nadine made a pact: to find a substantial relationship and -- this is the tricky part -- hold on to it. So Dig rekindles his relationship with his high school girlfriend and Nadine runs into her college boyfriend. The novel got better and better. I thoroughly enjoyed Ralph's Party, Jewell's first novel. Thirty Nothing, however, is much better. Even though Lisa Jewell isn't quite as gifted as Marian Keyes and Helen Fielding, she is still able to write fun stories. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying....or reading.","review":"As a fan of modern British fiction, I am always on the lookout for new books to read in this genre. I had already read Ralph's Party, which was okay but nothing special. However, I had heard great reviews about this book so I decided to pick it up. Unfortunately, I don't think it lived up to the hype. Predictable, silly and boring are some of the words that come to mind when I think of this book. It was not witty in the least, and the sickly sweet ending is way over the top. Buy anything by Marian Keyes, Nick Hornby or Helen Fielding instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid characters...","review":"I usually read books in a sitting or two, but this one didn't hold my attention very well - it took me a week of stopping and starting to get through it. The characters didn't invoke much sympathy - to my frustration, I found them to be incredibly shallow and entirely lacking good judgment. Even worse, the entire plot was predictable. My advice? If you want to read this book, borrow it from the library or purchase it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to Lose","review":"This is a wonderful story of two friends who are on the verge of their 30's. They are handling it w/a mixture of aplomb and terror. Both Dig n' Dean run into their \\"first\\" loves and realize that you can never go home again. They have to get over old hurts and look at what's always been right there. The result is a realistic look at saying goodbye to your madcap 20's and realizing that settling down is not \\"settling\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Didn't Get It or Care","review":"I loved Ralph's Party so of course I had to read this sophmore effort. Talk about your sophmore slumps! Obvious from the beginning but worse yet not an enjoyable journey to the inevitable. Dig and Nadine weren't even likable characters, their machinations were predictable and the plot thin, if not implausible. I didn't enjoy the long flashbacks, I found them disruptive. Glimpses of their teenage years with more adult reflection would have been more effective. The major plot device that brought about the conclusion is just plain hackneyed.Read Ralph's Party, skip this one and hopefully her next book will be as good as the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I was disappointed by this book because there was no mystery to how it would end. It was formulaic and run-of-the-mill. I know the premise of the book was basically spelled out in the reviews but it was not as funny or creative as I thought it would be. Even if you're looking for light fare, this book is silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jolly good time!","review":"Thirty Nothing is a fun romp through the city of London with the main characters, Dig and Nadine. They're a wacky duo who have been friends forever. They've reached the age of thirty and realize that they have some commitment issues and they really need to sort out their lives. Lisa Jewell takes the characters from one zany episode to the next. Delilah and Phil, the first loves from Dig and Nadine's past, are also thrown in for comedic effect and place everybody involved in some very funny and touching moments. As the reader, we know that Dig and Deen are meant for each other, but the journey that we get to see them on makes for some very funny reading. The ending is how it should be.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and it had some laugh out loud moments. If you're looking for a comedy, something to take you away from the mundane in your life, then this is the book you need. Laughter is the best medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good fun read","review":"I picked up this book while in a black mood. I started reading it, and was immediately sucked in. I even did something I can't recall ever having done before: reading the last few pages before I finished the book. I just had to know if it all worked out. It's a romantic comedy, so of course it worked out. But I still had to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"Dee and Dig have been friends since grade school, but their wires keep getting crossed when it comes to something more. Enter Delilah, the beautiful, centered woman we all love to hate and the catalyst for some soul-searching on both Dee and Dig's part.A fun read, though I got a little impatient with the last few chapters (you know what's going to happen, so it's like get on with it already!), but Jewell's wry descriptions of drinking, models, and especially Delilah kept me into the book. I read the whole thing on a rainy Sunday, even though I really should have been studying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and light summer read","review":"I read Thirtynothing right after finishing Ralph's Party, both of which I enjoyed. If you're a fan of the vastly popular single gal in London genre galloping on the heels of the Bridget Jones sucess, then you're sure to enjoy Thirtynothing. The novel features a loveable cast of characters, fun and clever writing, and even a bit of mystery. This is a perfect book to take along to the beach this summer, or for a bit of relaxing weekend reading. Also recommended is Marian Keyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Fun reading!","review":"Hey all potential buyers. I just wanna say that this is a great book to spend your days with and a wonderful excuse for not doing your homework. I'm from Holland and I bought this book on a trip to England and I'm reading it now. It's about some people in London who mess up with there love life. Very funny how Lisa Jewell describes the relationship between these people. It's about love, sex and friendship and again... it's fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very \\"zeitgeisty\\"","review":"The first chapter was so descriptive that I got worried. Would this be one of those books that focuses on details of scene and costume and food at the expense of plot and character development? But my fears were soon put to rest. This is a well-written, enjoyable fling of a novel, not great literature, but a nice escape if you're a single thirty-something or thirty-nothing in search of a little fun and a little hope all wrapped up in a \\"Very 2000\\" blanket of description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny modern romance","review":"Nadine and Dig are best friends who are perfect for each other, but unfortunately, their romantic timing has never worked out. As Dig turns 30, it looks like this finally might change, but then Delilah, Dig's high school girlfriend, suddenly reappears, and all of the problems she caused for Dig and Nadine in high school resurface. What follows is the usual story of miscommunication and missed chances, but of course, there's also the usual happy ending.Although the general plot is familiar, there are some surprises, particularly with respect to the character of Delilah. In addition, author Jewell writes with both humor and warmth, which keeps the story interesting (her next book, One Hit Wonder, is even better). Overall, a good light read if you enjoy reading about the mishaps of modern romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid nonsense","review":"I should start by saying two things: I love British comic novels, and I'm approaching the age of the main characters of this book. Therefore, it seemed like a natural read for me. I found myself extremely disappointed at how vapid the characters were, even for books of this type. What's more, there isn't a sympathetic character in the book--you will be shouting yourself hoarse every time they make a stupid decision (which is about every other page). For a fluffy book like this to work, there has to be something to like about the protagonists--there just isn't here.I became tired of this book long before it ended. If this sounds like a book you might enjoy, skip it and read \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" instead. It's in the same genre and features an intensely likeable, if somewhat scatterbrained, heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"very tepid","review":"I have to disagree with most reviews I find here. Don't expect any fantastic writing or surprise ending. The ending was sweet, but predictable from almost the get-go & the writing is just okay. This book can't hold a candle to BRIDGET JONES or even THE GIRLS' GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING. Read it for fun, if you must -- maybe if you're a thirtysomething & single. If not, pass on it for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money..","review":"The plot is almost entirely predictable, the parts of the plot that aren't predictable are just ridiculous. The characters are annoying, if not totally unrealistic. The story is saccharine sweet and offers not even a morsel of wit to top it off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dumb","review":"Dig and Nadine are great characters -- people I'd want as friends -- but boy, the plot is silly. I also found it a bit galling that a book this fluffy would use a rape as a plot point. And, as other reviewers have said, you can tell what's going to happen at the end just by reading the cover. If you like contemporary British fiction you're way better off with Nick Hornby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Barely Average","review":"I don't get why people love \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\".

Added gospel flavor and arrangements that are not on the original. Definately worth the effort to find and the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless song with a remix not found anywhere else!","review":"I got this just for the remix I can not find anywhere else but on this single cd. The first mix on the cd is by far the one I like the best from Mariah and her vocals take you to a dance trance. The soul in the mix is not something you always get from Mariah and wish she had more in her music. She let's it out and really shows everyone what she can do and showcases her highly gifted vocals. Mariah fans will enjoy this mix to the fullest and those who like a good dance mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fantastic album.

Thanks for being my #1 singer and hero in my heart,even past the end of time.CRT FOREVER"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars","review":"Okay, there weren't any of those \\"problems\\" in this one that get solved by a paragraph of explanation (my usual complaint about this author's stories), but there really wasn't a coherent plot either.The actual romance could have been a short story, not even a novella--and Indian boy and a white girl are friends as children; they vow eternal love at ages 14 and 10; then his parents are killed by her stepfather and he runs off. Eleven years later, they're reunited when she's driving a stagecoach disguised as a man.There are other plot threads filling out the novel, like buttons made out of human bones, and an evil white man who kidnaps her, but nothing's really connected.The characters are all 2-dimensional stereotypes, and boring as heck.On the plus side, the chapters are short, and the font is big, and I got through this one in record time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A century later it works.","review":"The study of price as it relates to volume is IMO the most necessary info to know in trading. Wykoff is the father of such studies and he hasn't been inproved on except in charting technology. However charting has greatly improved in it's ability to pinpoint where volume enters the market. Therefore, RW's pictures of tape readings and exhortations to record time and sales can be passed over in lieu of volume histograms.Great bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good set","review":"This set has everything you could need in a handy case. The case seems sturdy enough. It might take a second to get the tools back in right but very good set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"I almost didn't read this. It takes part in what seems to be an Asian setting. . After reading fantasy for years, the plots get that old feeling. What a joy to read this story. The plot is described in the editorial reviews, so I won't go over it again, but this book was refreshing. A hero you feel for, bunch of sidekicks who are for the most part normal and magic underneath everything. Stayed up all night to finish it and I haven't done that in a long while. The story never drags, the characters are well developed--in that you care what happens to them--all in all a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it....","review":"I can't connect with this author's style. It's like he has confused points of view. He's taken 3rd person omniscient and bled some of that omniscientism into the supporting cast of the protagonist (but leaving the protagonist unscathed by this external blessing of knowledge). What this means is that there is alot of internal dialogue by the protagonist with mysterious unsolocited answers by characters in the book that are taken for granted. Because they all (ok not all... a large portion) share this \\"line-of-reasoning\\" with the protagonist, it is hard to define the edges, boundaries, and distances between the different characters. It's still good enough to want to know how it ends, but the experience is not as fun as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read!","review":"I just finished this book and have to agree with many of the other reviewers that it is a must read for fantasy fans. The setting has heavy Asian overtones, though there are some European items as well. The characters are good, though I think as a main character Llesho is a little shallow so far, but first books are often the worst of the series. The plot leaves a bit to be desired, with \\"luck\\" and \\"strange benefactor\\" prototypes abounding, but last part of the book does a good job of providing (some) answers and laying the basis for the next book. I would definitely recommend you pick it up, as I'm guessing the next book will be even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gender equality means equal responsibility and self-honesty.","review":"Pearson, an award-winning journalist, presents contemporary social science research that belies the cultural myths of female powerlessness and innocence - blinders society must remove for women to be understood as inherently equal and human, with all the freedoms and responsibilities this entails. The continued myth of feminine mystique and innocence must give way to a recognition of common humanity, with all of our fatal flaws and saving graces. As a counseling psychologist, I welcome the honesty and mutual understanding of which this book and other efforts are social harbingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this television in 2006.

It's as if they didn't contemplate what would be convenient for the user. The second problem, is that it's hard to get a secure attachment to the valve. And the third problem is that the pump doesn't give you any leverage. So this pump can take you 20 minutes to do what another pump can do in 30 seconds.

Beware, it is your typical \\"made in China\\" kind of product/plastic.I loved this thing, when it worked, got the cats going and focused and worked great in that respect. The line is weak and you'll spend a lot of time retying it, and you will learn about the inner workings of the reel because it gets jammed on the regular. And now that it's broke and the whole thing is garbage and not reusable, I'm disappointed.I highly recommend the lures, and I will continue to reuse them.

My cat loved it, but how sad that it constantly broke down - the line gets wound up inside the reel cover and casting is impossible until you get out your tools and take it all apart, cut the line & re-attach it. You hands will also get very greasy. AFTER 10 DAYS OF FIXING IT, THERE WASN'T MUCH LINE LEFT AND THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL GROWS EACH TIME YOU HAVE TO FIX IT - EVEN THOUGH YOU GET PRETTY GOOD AT THE REPAIR AFTER A COUPLE OF TIMES, IT'S JUST CRAZY TO SPEND MORE TIME ON REPAIR THEN PLAYING WITH YOUR CAT!Not worth any money but if they could fix it, it would be great!

I re-tied the mouse and away we went.The reel works just like the crappy ol' Zebco reels I used as a child. The line got a little tangled after a break and I had to unscrew the cover and pull the line out until it was untangled.

But this time, I was sorely disappointed.In general, the other reviews are correct. This story lacks...almost everything. There are a few extremely creepy vignettes that are tacked to a wall, with a thread we could call a story strung between them, but the story is gossamer and weak, and the characters are equally bad. The conflict is intense, but meaningless, and essentially devoid of interest. The setting had personal interest for me, but it was hardly generally viable. Essentially, the book is about a man whose wife goes crazy, and he is trying to save her. Both characters are vapid, uninteresting and act bizarrely.But, there are so many things about the book that never make sense. What does Moloch have to do with anything? Although there are attempts made to answer these questions, they are so superficial that they may as well never have been made.I wouldn't recommend this to...anyone really.Harkius"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine story from a master of horror and suspense.","review":"Golden's work rivals that of Peter Straub and early-Stephen King.His imagination and unique writing make shim a major player in storytelling.He will astonish you and strike fear into the deepest part of your soul.--Joseph McGee, author of In the Wake of the Night, Phil's Place and Darkness Won't Rest: Phils Place II"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised a lot, deliver little","review":"Golden starts off his usual manner, creating a mysterious background to his story. But unlike his previous books, this book collapsed dramatically towards the end, and the whole plot becomes to imaginative that it is confusing and lack sparkle.What started from a missing girl unbelievably was linked to ancient curses and the house which stores all the secrets look like houses in fairy tales rather than a horror tale.This was not one of his better one, but with the promised delivered in the beginning, still deserved a 3 star.

This book dispels that notion by telling the history of an unknown immigrant group in the city -- the Italian Americans.The book has nearly 100 family photographs collected from the Italian community in and around Albuquerque. Many of these photographs have never before been seen, and it is refreshing to see them used creatively to tell the story of an ethinc group and its contributions to new mexico.Each photograph is heavily researched, and the result is a compilation of a lot of information about the history of the community.Hopefully this book will set a precedent for other books showcasing the visual history of Albuquerque's many European immigrant groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture is not what you get ...","review":"so i ordered these and got something else sent to me.AND it's not the company's fault since it was drop shipped from LADYBUG themselves! ... the sellers worked with me and apologized for any error; they are great to work with!!

The cable is long enough to wrap around the top frames of two or more bicycles (depending on the carrier you choose). When not in use, the cable slides down into the hollowed-out tube of the Yakima carrier and stays in place until you need it again. As an additional plus, when I ordered this cable lock with the locking hitch pin as a set, I was able to use the same key to access both locks. The only way you could beat this system is with a cable cutter, but that is probably highly unlikely to happen. This item is a great anti-theft deterrent and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design flow","review":"Bought this item to protect my bikes.

Even the \\"official\\" govenment statements reveal that they plan to use this super-powerful electron array to punch holes through the ozone layer -- just for the sake of some vaugely defined experimental research!

They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels. The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.

The Dells are a well respected group but the sound and the conduct of one or two members were unprofessional. The show would have been more appreciated if The Dells were musically represented by perhaps \\"Boys to Men\\" or a respected younger group. The Dells were one of my favorites in the 70's.

It was sad to watch the men I remember as lively and vivid in concert many years ago, and it is a pity that the soul singers I lovingly remember were not captured in their prime. This attempt does them or their leagcy no real justice; it was a shell of their talent. Too bad they could have not maybe told their story amid original renditions of their many hit songs or archived tapes. The memories of the members in their more vibrant youth will remain in my heart and head as strongly as the wonder of the songs and harmonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"my heart meted","review":"THIS DVD WAS SUCH A DELIGHT!

I'm not a prude but there was really no reason for it. Their performance was lacking in itself as though they had stayed passed their prime. They could not hit notes. Overall I was very disappointed and most likely will not attempt to see them live. We threw the DVD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting investigation of a created anarchy (phew!)","review":"Nichol's Nghsi-Altai Tetralogy is basically about an anarchistic society in Central Asia. (first of all, true anarchy isn't punk nihilism, but more like perfect socialism, where everyone is equal and has a say). The story follows three important Western thinkers (Blake, Kerouac, and I forget the third guy), who must completely recast their ideas of socialism and egality to understand and be accepted in the culture of Nghsi-Altai. I've only read the first and half of the second books in this tetralogy, but so far it is really interesting in its depictions of an anarchy. Nichols isn't exactly the best writer (LeGuin's The Dispossesed\\" is a better written, but certainly less detailed depiction of a utopia), but one should read these books for their ideas, not for their lyricism. Overall very thought-provoking, though complex!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want power look elsewhere","review":"The speakers make a cute accessory if cuteness is what you're looking for.

I also like gay culture, so I was much less favorably inclined. On the whole, the book is humorless and fairly boring; the authors never really wrap their minds around the full implications of gay culture for modernity. The essays vary in quality, but most of them are competent. Only on occasion are they genuinely thought-provoking. Actually, a few of the \\"reviews\\" from other reviewers strike me as better critiques than anything in this book. As for the view that we are entering a \\"post-gay\\" age, that's pretty much whistling in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Gay, Anti-Schmay","review":"I was excited about what this book had proposed, a big slap in the face of the moribund state of Gay Culture (coming soon to a circuit party near you!)

I will do better. But this magnifier was so nasty that it prompted me to write my first review.This magnifier minds me of the 70s made-in-China junk. Horrid quality...distorted plastic lens and the plastic handle's battery cover comes off like...a cheap 70's made-in-China junk. The old \\"made-in-China\\" looking box it comes in has magified view of map of China showing Shanghai...This is not a Duro-Med brand magnifier but \\"Hori\\" brand (or some similar sounding name...I've returned the darn thing already for refund.) This is a magnifier you might find in some corner alley hole-in-the-wall store in China for $1 and even then it'd be worthless junk not fit for a child's toy.I have no clue what magnifier the previous reviewer gave 5 stars but it couldn't have been the same one I received. That's totally misleading. Ok, nowI'm done with my rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was pretty bad, and I don't usually complain","review":"I have to admit, this thing was pretty bad. I have written one review in the past five years and it was to praise a product. I don't usually complain, but this item was well below expectations. The light assembly on mine was broken when I received it. I've got it downstairs trying to glue it back together, but the design is weak to begin with. It also looks and feels cheap. There was extra plastic from the manufacturing process that I had to trim off of every piece, like a kids model car. Lastly, the finish around the lens on one side is so bad I don't know if a trim ring came off or that is just the way it looks. No other parts were floating around in the box. This is the only thing out of about a dozen orders in December that Amazon flubbed. I'll cut them some slack, it was a $5 dollar item, worth only $2, so if the glue doesn't work I'll just trash it without a return. You don't have to make my same mistake though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Yes it is a magnifier. But the plastic literally broke taking it out of the box. I know a lot of reviewer exaggerate when they don't like something. But this thing truly did break right away. It is way overpriced for the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Kettlebell + Cardio Intervals","review":"Amy tops the list of instructors for me. Her personality is just great and she is really good at creating advanced workouts. This one alternates kettlebell moves with cardio blasts which makes this a very effective routine. She uses a 20 lb. kettlebell and one move even uses 2 kbells - wow. I'm a heavy-weight junkie, so this is right up my alley. Some moves I have to modify or switch to a lighter kbell, but I love the challenge. Also has some premixes and an abdominal section. Amy is always creative with her ab work and this is no exception. If you love kettlebells (not the whimpy 4 lbs that is) then this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"who is this for?!","review":"If you're a kettlebell beginner, this is NOT for you. It says as much on the DVD case.If you're experienced with kettlebells, you won't learn anything new - her form on swings isn't great, and even youtube has much more and better kettlebell content than this does. Most of it isn't even a kettlebell workout (!!) - it's just aerobics.I don't know who (what fitness background or goals) would use this. It's just a bunch of exercises thrown together, with minimal use of light kettlebells.\\"Kettlebell\\" in the title is really misadvertising. I'm skeptical of the glowing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I have read the Bento has a lot of fans, but it was not for me. I like hardcore moves that flo. I didn't really feel the energy in her workouts. I am very advanced, runner, triathlete and love Hiit training. I wont be buying anymore Bento DVD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"Pretty disappointing. The reviews suggested the work out would be difficult and the DVD is described as advanced, but when you factor in the warm up, stretching, and cool down - you are really only exercising for 12 or 13 minutes. Additionally, Amy uses different kettlebell weights and sometimes 2 for certain workouts. If dont have a library of kettlebells to work with, you have to improvise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout.","review":"I'm relatively \\"new\\" to kettle bells but am finding myself loving them and wanting to get as many different workouts with them as possible! I'm currently doing kettle bell workouts 3x/week and am seeing results!! I really like Amy's kettle bell workout because it's a little different and the moves are just as her title says....\\"dynamic\\". I don't get bored with this video in my rotation. It's not an overly difficult workout to get through but I do find that I get a good overall workout from it. I like the many options that the DVD offers so I can do all 3 workouts if I have the time or the mini-workouts if I don't. Only complaint (and it's nit-picky but it bugs me): she messes up on her count frequently and you end up doing more on one side than the other with some of the moves. Also her cueing is not great at times. Since I'm used to it, I know it's going to happen and I can adjust for it. Other than that, I do like this kettle bell workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DMHO Christmas","review":"I really enjoy Denver and the Mile High Orchestra's Christmas CD. Most of it is very lively and the horn section is reminiscent of the band Chicago from the 70's and 80's. A couple of songs go a little too long, losing some of their effect. Overall, this is a group of amazing musicians and a singer that would have fit in well in the big band era of music history. If seasonal music is not your thing, check out their other music, including their CD for children. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless - and ageless","review":"This Christmas CD will appeal to all ages.

I used it as a prespray for a stem cleaning application and was totally disappointed. The spots I had before were still there, it may have removed about 10% of the the spot and I believe that is being generous. I cleaned other carpets with a product called \\"Awesome\\" that is for steam cleaning carpets that costs $6.30 a gallon with a lot greater success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pre-treatment on grout cleaning","review":"I used this product as a pre-treatment on some really dirty grout. This was a light cream colored grout that had turned almost black over the past 11 years. I cleaned one bathroom floor, (the grout wasn't too bad here), without Formula 212 and was pretty happy with what just steam could do. When I got to the really dirty part I used this stuff and, WOW! What a difference. Don't get me wrong, cleaning grout is a labor intensive task under the of best conditions. I highly recommend Formula 212. One trick you can try is to wet down the grout and let soak in for an hour or two then re-wet the area and your cleaning speed will double with a good steam cleaner. I'm talking about using a real REAL high pressure steam cleaner not warm water in a K-mart carpet cleaner; rent the real deal if necessary. Also, you can save a ton of money if you can find a source for the dry powder version of this product.

The same piece of wood, when I used bosch, it was very smooth cuting edge, and this miter saw blade is not that smooth.

Is it because they may come in contact with the blade?Why is the lazar on the one I HAD so hard to adjust that I never did move it in fear that it would break? Is it because you can still use the saw without the lazar that is going to break someday anyway?The saw I HAD came pre-set to build Toontown.

It's really difficult to find a band in our days with that exceptionnaly well fusioned Acid Jazz - Funk - Pop style as Jamiroquai. Since Stevie Wonder no music band could ever reach that level of musical quality in what respects funk. The tracklist offers us a great variety of different sounds, coming from When you gonna learn and Too Young to die both famous and revolutionary money making singles to intrumental (latin-jazz style) Music of the mind. Jamiroquai finds the key for 70's rebirth true a bass, a guitar, the drums, a trumpet, some keyboards and a didgeridoo.My favorite tunes: When you gonna learn, Too Young to die, If I like it I do it, Music of the Mind and Revolution 1993."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Dated","review":"Jamiroquai\`s debut was a critically aclaimed record when it came out in the early nineties, yet I fail to understand why. This is hardly innovative and original stuff, just a rehash of some sounds from the seventies with a couple of more contemporany and recent production details. \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\" mixes funk, lounge, soul, pop and even a bit of jazz, trying to sound fresh, hip and subtle yet it ends up being unmemorable, slow and tiresome for the most part. The first songs are somewhat promising, but as the record unfolds it only gets boring and drags for way too long, becoming useless elevator music.

Let's watch how media personnel manipulate events. The characters manipulate each other too, but no one seems adversely or otherwise affected; they go out (in one way or another) as they came in: gregarious, self-aggrandizing, and analgesic. This video lost me when the three main characters survive a jet plane crash & look no worse for wear than if they'd just attended a 3-hour management seminar. I never watched \\"Cheers,\\" but I'm convinced that Woody Harrelson is becoming one of the premier character actors of our time: his brief but brilliant Sgt.

My tail didn't wag an instance...","review":"Clearly by the rating you have to be expecting some sort of negative positions on the film, and you'd be right. Because in my opinion this film was trumped up to comedy gold, only to realize itself as nothing but a false laugh in the back of an empty theatre. Yeah, I don't know what that sentence entirely means, but I do know that Wag the Dog lacked realism (except for the end, but assuming there's a chance you may actually watch this I figure I'll be nice enough not to spoil this.)The plot centers around DeNiro, who is a political mind who is supposed to help control public opinion in the face of a presumably soon-to-be leaked sex scandal. To spin his magic DeNiro teams up with a Hollywood producer, played by Dustin Hoffman, who plans on making this cover-up the masterpiece of his career.Well, that's the story.

I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs.

That's Pathetic, and so is this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film grows on you ......","review":"When I saw this film at the cinema I thought it was a half decent parody of the Clinton administration, and the devious behaviour of politicians in general. As an ex civil servant I thought it was an extreme piece of satirical commedy with a clear message on the dangers of \\"spin\\". Had I rated it at he time, I would have given it a strong 3 star rating.Given the events since the film, it's message and relevancy have become more important. The writers and director weren't intending to be prophetic (unlike Chaplin's the great dictator), but real world events have given this film a second lease of life! Great example of reality imitating art ......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter and accurate political satire at its best . . .","review":"I'd make room on your DVD shelf for this one - \\"Wag the Dog\\" deserves a place alongside Kubrick's \\"Dr.Stragelove\\" with its cutting-edge political satire. Few films give such an accurate vision of the spin-doctors at work creating the imagery that we see on the news on a nightly basis.I will say that this comedy is not for everyone. The pacing is slow at first, and much of the humor is dark satire. Fans of slapstick comedy will find no amusement here - this is a fairly sophisticated film satirizing the modern media climate. However, if you've ever wondered what goes on behind-the-scenes, this film shows a very accurate view of the public relations wizards at work changing public sentiment with well-placed rumors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wag the dog","review":"The director of hte movie\\"Wag the dog\\" is Barry Levinson. Most important two cats are Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffman. The movie is from 1997 and it is made in USA. It is about the election campaign in the USA. It shows you how and whata President do who has got a sexual affaire with a little school- girl.I think this movie is for all voters in the world but specially for voters in the USA. The reason is that most of politician do not say allways the true.In my opinion the movie isvery realistic. The last elections in the USA prove that alltoughBush makes very bad things he won the elections, like in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Documentary Disguised as a Comedy","review":"Many people have compared this movie's plot to what's happened with Clinton. Fair comparison, I suppose, but what the movie is really about is the political process, which seems to be entirely about spin doctors and media frenzies, and this transcends any single administration.The dialog in this movie was spectacular, as were the performances by Hoffman and DeNiro. The only really disappointing casting choice was having Woody what'shisname play a crazed sociopath yet again.This movie is not for the person who still believes in our politicians or those who report them. It's also not appropriate for those who are prone to have accidents when they laugh too hard. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"The movie was just plain boring and the plot line never moved. Deniro was very out of place in this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"\\" Barry Levinson's comedy... \\" comedy? satire maybe. while certainly funny at times,the movie could almost be scary if one were to casually embrace (or discard)the idea that we can be that easily manipulated.a previous reviewer suggested the ending was \\"weak\\". my first impression. however,the outcome that seemed so predictable,was presented only by the crackling radio voice of the very same media that facilitated all the previous manipulations.superb. also:interesting allusions to john wayne's The Green Berets (not even counting the \\"men of the 303\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not buy the premise of this film.","review":"Everybody seems to like this movie, but for me it seemed such a far-fetched premise that I couldn't buy into it. How is it possible for one Hollywood producer with a short strip of film covering one scene able to fool the entire news media industry? How is it possible that no other news organization would not send a reporter to verify a war? How is it possible that no one would have a pang of conscience about misleading the public to hide molestation? Dustin Hoffman jumped around in this role like he was trying very hard to believe this premise but couldn't really bring himself to do it. I had to shut it off after forty minutes, it seemed so contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally improbable. Leave your brain on the shelf.","review":"Ripped from today's headlines! Timely yet timeless! A great story with great performances! Ooops, that's what I WISH I could say about this movie. Yes, there are very good performances from all the stars (although Dustin Hoffman is his usual annoying self). However, the basic premise of the move is SO unbelievable, that I wanted to turn off the VCR (I didn't, because I needed to see how ridiculous it could get), and tune in a grizzly news story about real war atrocities. Do yourself a favor and watch this to see how a bad concept can waste millions of dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever screenwriting plus great casting For The Win!","review":"I don't rate this as an all-time gtreat movie like \\"Gone With The Wind\\" but it is great entertainment that benefits from being well crafted by seasoned pros. The principals -- De Niro, Hoffman, Heche -- give great realization to an entertaining screenplay. Each of these actors does a great job at intimating awe of the others without revealing that they are all playing catch-up with various aspects of each others abilities. Heche in particular gives her role as the wide-eyed virgin by way of the confident d-girl (a stereotypical development and communications professional) a very credible rendition and she completely holds her own among these two acting powerhouses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the News","review":"This movie makes you wonder what really goes on behind all the political media hype. I saw this shortly before the 'conflict' in Kosovo. That conflict was near election time, and I felt compelled to actually check a map to see if there was such a place.I also thought it curious that I rarely saw this movie in rental stores or for sale even as a VHS. Maybe it made the government and media people nervous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush's study guide, too","review":"This is an excellent movie for showing the ways in which members of unquestioning and geographically illiterate media can be manipulated into working for the benefit of major political figures. There are many similarities between the plot of this film and Clinton's handling of his sex scandal; but there are also striking similarities with the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq crisis (\\"Old Shoe\\"--the \\"soldier we left behind\\"--comes to mind). It is a dark, nonpartisan, humorous look at the unholy alliance between Info-tainment and politics. This is not to say the movie is perfect; but Hoffman, DeNiro, Heche, Harrelson--even Willie Nelson--are perfect for their roles. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wag the Dog","review":"This DVD has very poor sound quality. I played it on two different players & the volume was so low that I had to turn it up to about three quarters of full volume.

It is interesting to watch before a presidential election to remind oneself how far the campaigns might go to try to get your vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better on the small screen than the big screen.","review":"I would have given this film 3 stars if it wasn't for De Niro's chracter. Robert De Niro is a great actor, but his character could have been better. Also, this film was too fast and unrealistic. De Niro's character sounds like a mental retard because he talks so fast (no offense to Robby, as I said, he's great). What makes this film satisfying is Hoffman's character, and the great one-liner \\"this is nothing!\\". You have to see this film just because of Dustin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad We Didn't See it at the Theatre","review":"My wife and I never got around to seeing this movie at the theatre, even though we wanted to do so. Good thing. Finally, we rented it and were pretty disappointed. It was a good idea, but the movie seemed like a bunch of clever lines loosely wrapped into a disjointed roll of celluloid. And while I know much of the Washington political scene doesn't make sense, a lot of this movie made no logistical sense; i.e., surviving a plane crash, Woody Harrelson's background going undetected by the nosy media, etc. Perhaps the movie was just a vehicle to put Hoffman and DeNiro (or DeNiro and Hoffman) together. All in all, a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wag the Dog","review":"Great movie Dustin Hoffman does a wonderful job as the producer who is asked to make a fake movie about a war in Albania.

An error occured in downloading the program from Amazon needed to view the video. This error occurred on two of my computers. Since I had to watch the video that day for a class, I could wait another day for a response. I paid for the same video twice and Amazon refused to make any refunds. Sure I was out only $5.98, but the time and frustration far exceeded the cost. I will probably not use Amazon again for video viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to avoid this movie","review":"This movie is really awful. It presents itself to be a witty, humorous look at politics and Hollywood, but it fails in both attempts. I have yet to see a movie that explores the life of a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) that is interesting, and this hasn't changed my mind. The scenes where a bunch of people come up with \\"brilliant\\" ideas are really annoying. Also, Willie Nelson is on the screen a lot, which attests to just what lengths the director had go to. If you want a movie about politics, \\"Primary Colors\\" (the best) or \\"The Contender\\" (the best serious politics film) are my recommendations. An added plus: neither of those two have Anne Heche."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could have left","review":"I could not get up and go home. I wanted very much to walk out.I read that the movie was done in a very short period of time. It showed in the quality of the dialogue and overall content. I believe the movie would have been a complete flop without the Clinton/Lewinsky situation. I enjoy satire. I didn't find humor and satire in the dialogue as much as another attempt to exploit the Clinton and Lewinsky situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dirtiest movie ever by onkel leck mich am arsch","review":"Hallo i just wanted to say that this movie just sucksi dislike the actors the writers and also the producers.It is like teasing with nails on a black board for the pupils who have to watch this movie. for me it was the dirrtiest movie ever i just want to say its against the law to tease pupils with this movie the only lightspot in this movie is ROBERT de NIRO he is the king in this damn movie he kickz asses all the time.

I watched a half hour or so of it, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Then I looked at him, and he clearly couldn't believe it either. We watched the whole thing; it was like a car wreck. The plot stumbles on endlessly. The dialogue and acting are awful. The violence is as pointless as you could get. But the funniest thing about this movie is that it is obviously written, produced, and directed by \\"fat cats\\" (this movie provided me with the only occasion where I've ever been tempted to use that term) who have a dim idea of how to be \\"subversive\\" that they probably got from watching other movies the week before this travesty was conceived. This movie is like a parent trying to use teenage slang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Deal.","review":"I have to agree with everyone here. These shirts are outstanding. I workout six days a week and I like, better than anything else, clothes that don't wrinkle and don't look gnarly. This is totally true of these champions. I heard from a bunch of people that the Under Armor ones were great, but they were cost prohibitive.

It will snag on anything, from a callous on your finger, Velcro, a small chip on the edge of a wooden table. Once it snags, it will all too often pull, ruining the shirt instantly. I just to two throw away because I was playing catch with my daughter, and the Velcro covered baseball we were playing with stuck to the shirt. When I removed it, it pulled a string straight out leaving an actual gap in the fabric where the skin showed through. I had only worn the shirts 2-3 times each. Very frustrating, as the shirts have an excellent look, fit, and feel. But the material is not friendly to daily wear.

Anno does weave one hell of a good tale that is packed full of mecha action, character development and the best animation on earth. i promise you, you'll be up late at night re-watching each episode, finding new things about it and yourself all the time.

Many philosophical books were written about it in Japan, and there are many different ways to interpret the series.

Also, I would have given it less stars if I was able to find a place that sells Japanese imports of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troubled teen meets sentient mecha..","review":"A twist on the old 'giant robot' genre, Evangelion's main character, Shinji, is quiet, shy, brooding, and absolutely nothing like the usual spunky heroes that hop in their machines and run off to face certain doom. This series is incredible, and I'm not a huge fan of mecha series. It gets very cerebral at times, and somewhat disturbing at others."},{"rating":"2","title":"GAINAX rules, and Evangelion proves it again!","review":"I honestly wasn't expecting a lot from Evangelion, because I usually don't like overhyped series, but holy hydraulics! I haven't seen this type of plot and character development since Wings of Oneamis -- you care what happens to these people. Gainax's story and character designs are, as usual, a brilliant font of consistency that have made this title stand out among its peers like no other (at least the subtitled version does - I haven't seen the dub). The combination of sci-fi and philosophy would do authors like Bob Heinlein proud. Gainax is the best anime studio out there, and I'm glad to see they're eager to show us why. Oh, and anyone that thinks Gainax's clean, powerful animation style is ...less than average... is probably one of the clique that watches Akira to see people's heads explode. Bottom line: If you like good anime, and care about what you watch, Neon Genesis Evangelion will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding.","review":"Neon Genesis Evangelion is worshippable.

And just when everyone thought that the genre had been done to death...The voice overs were well done, though in my opinion, Shinji had an awfuly high voice for a 14-year old. After seeing even one tape of Evangelion, you're hooked. The music is well done, even for anime, especially the opening theme, wich I especially enjoyed. I highly recomend this beginning of one of the most controversial and amazing anime sagas of all time, to anime and non-anime people alike. Face it, GAINAX and Hideo Anno have a work to be proud of. So get turn off your computer, go out into the world, and buy it. I'm sure you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and wonderful art!","review":"A must for a collector of highly stylized anime. The storyline is intriguing and rather complex.

The animation quality was so-so, the plot was alright, the complete redefinition of every religious term was kinda weird, and most of the attempts to build the intensity of the drama put me to sleep. And is it just me, or does anyone else out there find Shinji's whimperings incredibly annoying?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST ANIME!","review":"I have never gotten into an anime as much as I have for Neon Genesis Evangelion. I own all the videos(including bootlegs of the movies which ADV films is not planning on releasing \\"NOOOOOOOOO! \\") The story might be boring for some, and you can't start watching from the middle of the series or else you won't get that involved in the story. The characters are amazing and althought the EVA fights aren't that long, they are still great. But the anime is more focused on the human (and non-human...\\"dum-dum-dummmmmm!\\") characters of the story. Its almost impossible to explain the story to your friends, you have to watch it to understand. The story starts off on a happy beat more or less but as the tapes go on, the story starts getting darker, and darker, and even more twisted...oh, if only ADV would release the movies!

I mean they even have a cute animal masscot!Ok, the dub was good and I alot of the voices fit.

Relating to man's desire to touch the face of god, and figure his place in the universe by guaging the plan of the father is very heady and quite a cunning choice of a central plot line.

The words combine a subtle mysticism with an earthy sensuality, that are well suited to the intense yearning of the music. Recently this song has come to life once again in the voice of Marina Belica which went to #1 in Rochester, New York and aired for several months and the magic still there, along with Julie and Emil October Project has reborn .

Thankfully with this release, the film can be seen and judged on its own merits. Silly but very likable songs, and great performances all the way around help the TRIFLE of a story work it's way towards a typical Disney ending.

Gave it 4 stars because I watched on Amazon Instant Video and the video quality was poor and the sound was not synced with the picture. Should have downloaded it first. Tested my internet connection about halfway through, and it was rock solid with a 5 Meg download and upload... so something screwy was happening over at Amazon Instant Video.Update:Amazon noticed from my review that the Instant Video streaming produced a poor quality viewing experience and automatically issued me a refund for the rental. Can't speak to highly of Amazon's excellent customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If we could only go back...","review":"I was a kid when this movie was made. It was magical, musical, fun, sparkling clean and entertaining. We all walked home from the theater singing, dancing or both. How I envy my parents that they didn't have to worry about screening a movie before we saw it. Fred MacMurray was always a sure winner, Tommy Steele was AMAZING, and Leslie Ann Warren was so beautiful! I taped this movie years ago before it was available for purchase. My own kids who are now in their 20's can still sing the words to \\"By-Um-Pum-Pum!\\" I shall buy them a copy so that they can share fun musical times of an era that is truly missed.

I bought this version then sold it again. I would buy the old one if it was available."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst musicals of the 60s.","review":"High expectations following MARY POPPINS were bitterly dashed with the release of THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE from the Disney Studios. In 1967, the era of cultural and political revolution, Disney presented us with Fred MacMurray and tried to pass him off as a free-thinking eccentric. In spite of the lavish production values, the entrenched conservatism of the mileu and the dated hi-jinks offered up fail to make this spiritless enterprise sparkle. Tommy Steele and Hermoine Baddeley prove that they, at least, know what they're doing, but nothing in this picture remotely \\"works.\\" This video company presents this best-forgotten picture in a multiplicity of formats and yet Warner Brothers has yet to release Judy Garland's great A STAR IS BORN in widescreen in ANY format.

I have hunted high and low even through Disney itself to find a copy to no avail. What a great family movie. It has become a must to view this at least yearly in our home. Who says it has to have a deep plot or story line to be enjoyable? What happened to just pure entertainment? Do your self a favor and see this movie, it will certainly give you a lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Family Video teaches Great Family Values!","review":"I am a fan of Fred MacMurray and so I love this film. However, aside from that this movie is great because is portrays a family that is very close. They are unique and proud of it. The children are taught that being different is good and that the family is most important. I believe that one of America's major problems is that the families are so divided. I love the relationship Cordy has with her father and the relationship between the parents. Cordy's life does not revolve around her friends. Those types of relationships are needed in the world today. The father does not come off looking like a goofball with a wife who has to \\"fix\\" him and make him socially acceptable. It is very refreshing to see a Disney movie that is portraying famliy values. I also love the fact that it is a musical by the Sherman Brothers. It is based on the book \\"My Philadelphia Father\\" by Cordelia Drexel Biddle. I read the book and loved it. The video is very similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"family favorite movie!","review":"This movie is a family favorite so when I saw it on amazon I couldnt resist.

But when you hear it is the sequel to THE EXORCIST, you brace yourself for a horrifying (but fun) experience. This book is not of the horror genre and will probably only scare the most weak-hearted readers. I saw the movie first, and admit it was pretty scary, but the movie is only based loosely on the book (which was very hard to find). You will be okay though, if you pick up the book, looking only for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Lead Character","review":"Legion's Lieutenant Kinderman is one of the more enduring and fascinating characters I've had the pleasure to follow through a novel. While Legion does suffer from a lack of focus at times, Kinderman's pursuit of both the solution to the baffling murders and his own relationship to God are nicely entwined and carry the story along. This is as much a mystery as a horror novel, and the whodunnit aspects along with the spiritual quests make an entertaining melange. I too saw the film, but I was disappointed and felt George C. Scott was miscast. I always envisioned Kinderman as more of a Rod Steiger type. I completely disagree that the ending seems unfinished. The final scene in the restaurant ties the loose ends together and caps Kinderman's search for spiritual meaning. Legion isn't up there with the classics but it definitely is worth reading for fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the Exorcist!!!!!!!","review":"This book is okay. But if you're looking for great horror read the Exorcist, don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible for young kids","review":"This is read by a voice that has no animation and very monotonous.

I had to read this book for a latin class that I am taking. I must admit that when my teacher first told us we had to read this long book, I was not excited. But once I started reading it, I simply could not put it down. It was not like most other novels that you have to read in highschool, it was actually exciting. Steven Saylor does an excellent job of keeping the reader interested in the book. While he tells a wonderful mystery, he also mangages to describe much about the Roman civilization. I learned a lot of details that I had never known about Rome before. But the best part of the book, was the mystery part. I love mysteries and if you like them too, you will surely enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a school assignment","review":"I thought that Catilina's Riddle was a great book that I would recommend to anyone intrested in life lessons. Not only was the book jam packed with politics, mystery, confusion, and utter excitement, but it had a sentimental side that made the characters come alive. This compelling story was one that showed the true complexities of the Ancient Roman family and government structures. I was amazed by Saylor's personal characterizations that made the characters and the plots very believable and relatable to us, in the new millinium. I found myself looking forward to the next page, on the edge of my seat waiting for the adventure to take another wild turn. Read this book and you will find yourself drawn to the themes, and relating them back to your everyday struggles. This memorable book makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"not so bad","review":"Catilina's Riddle was not the worst book I have ever read. The story itself is very busy, which helps because if you're not too intrested in one aspect of the book, it quickly switches to a story line which hopefully suits your taste better. The book is classified as a mytery. As a mystery, I must confess that the book is a needed breath of fresh air which branches away from the normal whodunit. The plot is very thick, and resides not only with a family, but with an entire city at war with itself. IN ALL, the book is pretty good, but like most books of it's size, it can bore the reader with an occasional lull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Saylor historical novels","review":"Steven writes a very interesting historical series of novels about ancient Rome. I love the details of the food they ate, the clothing and housing. I also love the stories about cities around Italy and can relate to them after visiting Italy in 2010."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Roman Feast!","review":"This is the first of Saylor's Gordianus books I have read, and I intend to read all of them. Saylor's description of the Roman political milieu was superb (politicians haven't changed much!). And the sexy, charismatic Catilina...Wow! I was in tears at the end. This book has inspired me to read more about the Roman Republic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not much of a mystery novel","review":"Catalina's Riddle is my favorite of the three Steven Saylor mysteries I've read so far, yet the mystery content seems almost tacked-on. There are some fascinating insights into Roman agrarian and political life, including some information I'd never heard of before. Saylor really makes you think about the opposing characters of Cicero and Catalina, and at times it's difficult to reconcile their characters with what classicists and history have to say about them. If Saylor had sold this as a simple historical novel, I'd have given it a 10, but as it's supposed to be a mystery, it loses a few points. Definitely recommended to those who are interested in Ancient Rome"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best in a Stellar Series","review":"O.k., I admit it. Ever since I read ROMAN BLOOD, I've been a confirmed Gordianus-aholic. But I gotta tell you, this is one of the best yet. Saylor takes a notorious character from history, and not only brings him vividly to life, but makes you like the guy, and feel sorry that he's gotten such bad press for the last two thousand years. While less strictly a \\"mystery\\" than some of the other Roma Sub Rosa series with the ever fascinating Gordianus the Finder, CATILINA'S RIDDLE is no less compelling for its lucid tale of Roman politics gone horribly awry, and one of the most moving battle scenes ever written (or filmed). READ THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different look at the Cataline Conspiracy...","review":"I am a fan of Saylor's other books in this series, but this oneis truly monumental.Anyone with a smidgen of knowledge about the later Roman Republic knows of the sinister Catalina the Conspirator, and his plot to destroy the Republic.Saylor takes a look at what was really going on, and asks who was really conspiring: fans of certain Roman politicians much beloved by American conservatives will not like Saylor's take on this.Saylor states in his afterword that he is not trying to rehabilitate Catalina the way some authors have rehabilitated Richard III, but he does a good job of it nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb in every way","review":"Saylor's third mystery set in ancient Rome is more about Gordianus the Father than Gordianus the finder. Yes, there are some headless bodies that show up on Gordianus' property, and a significant portion of the story centers around this mystery, but this novel is more about the intrigues of ancient Roman politics and family life. The novel is superb in every way: there are memorable characters, especially Catalina; the plot is suspenseful; it is well written; and you get an entertaining and informative look at ancient Rome at a crucial time in its history. I highly recommend this for fans of mystery and/or historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Thin","review":"The idea for the book has great potential--and some of the children's letters are very cute--but the book itself is simply too thin to merit the rave reviews that others have given it.

In this book, children under the age of ten share their innermost thoughts with God. The innocence of them all!! I was almost in tears at the thought that one day I was saying the same things. Even though the words are sparse, the meanings are deep.Some people may not see the beauty in this book, but it is the sweetest thing I've ever read. Kids share their thoughts on how they think that God should have done things diferently, and how they want to know things like where babies come from and what they want done with their problems, and all sorts of things. I just fell in love with this book, and with the kids who wrote their very own, unique letters to God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really enjoyable book.

The long stand allows for lamp cords to be neatly wound around, keeping the critter area clean, neat and free of hanging cords and makes it easier to maintain temp requirements.Note: One of the user photos shows the stand holding two lamps - I must note for others that these are mini lamps, not regular full-sized lamps. We purchased a second lamp stand for the nighttime light, but because it is nearly 1/2 price @ Amazon.com compared to our local pet store, it wasn't a big deal. Just wanted to make sure others noticed that those were mini lamps - I totally missed it when I was considering my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect stand!","review":"I was extremely hesitant to purchase this at first. I really wanted a screen for my dome lamp because I didn't trust a lamp to be hanging over my aquarium that has an open top. I am incredibly pleased with this product because it is very sturdy and I have never had a problem with anything becoming loose or falling into the tank (thank god). The two turn knobs allow you to position the lamp as high as you want and extend it forward or backward as much as you want. I highly recommend this product for anyone using a single dome lamp. However, the double dome lamp with this stand is a different story considering you will never be able to get the domes to stay straight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought I was ordering","review":"This product would've been fine if I knew it was just a stand and not a lamp... guess it was my own fault because it did say \\" lamp stand\\" on it.. but the picture of the lamp got me..lol Must say that I returned this item back to Amazon and it was easy and they had the money back in my account quick with no hassle!!!

The main problem with this video is that the majority of at-bats are NOT shown. So you have no way of really following how the games developed. Only key plays are shown, but usually you are just dropped into the situation (runners, outs, etc.). The rest of the time is filled with some truly awful musical sequences of players and fans.For the baseball that is actually shown, this video is a lot better than nothing. You get some great moments with Whitey, Ozzie, Willie, and a the rest of the Cardinals 80's-era greats. But you also have the pain of watching the Cardinals loose two of three World Series.For the record, I'd like to say that Don Denkinger's call at first in game 6 of the '85 series was completely and utterly wrong.

About two years ago, the packaging indicated that the bulbs were manufactured in EU. I'm not sure what EU represents. Subsequently, the life span of the bulbs began to diminish to the point that it lasted only 3 months or less, far less than the rated 3000 hours.

However, I was extremely disappointed with the electronic version. There are no page numbers, which makes the book very difficult to use in classes where some people have a hard copy. The pages turn extremely slowly, which is fine for reading, but horrible when trying to flip around and locate information. In-text citations conveniently link to the bibliography, but if the citation happens to be close to the edge of the page, the page would rather turn than direct you to your citation. Basically, if all you want to do is read the book, the electronic version is fine, but using it for class discussions or writing papers is tough. There are a lot of other things I could say, but the final result for me was that I returned this version to buy a hard copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not reccomend","review":"This is as listed: a cheap product.

It is a tiny little thing that can easily fit into the back pocket of a pair of jeans with plenty of room to spare. I would like to be able to say that this tiny book is packed with information but, sadly, this is not the case. There are a few pages at the start giving some general, but pretty sketchy, information about the 'dim sum' experience, and then 40 odd separate pages each showing a picture of a common dim sum dish along with the English name, Chinese characters and the Cantonese transliteration. Not only is Pinyin not included but there isn't any sort of description or other interesting information about the dish in question. On the whole I found it very disappointing and not worth the ten or so dollars I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity revealed","review":"I have loved going for dim sum for years but the collection of tasty edibles has always been a varied crowd.

The chromium crusher was like $25, the Sweetstone I got for free but its msrp is $40, and the Sharpstone I got at a Hookah Hookup for like $45. All of these grinders were great and lasted long, minus the Sharpstone (bc I lost it). I had never heard of Smart Crusher, but decided to give it a try. It comes with a keif scrapper and 5 parts, i.e. two screens. It is pretty heavy due to the material it's made of - non-aluminum, so I just use 4 of the 5 parts.

My nephews love this and so do their grandparents who take them to the park in it.

Does not do so well on sand with a full load at the beach, but it will haul your child(ren) and then some. The canopy is not well made though. The plastic ribs that add curvature to the fabric, break easily and the whole design seems to make it harder to get the kids out. Watch out for the handle, if the seat right behind it is folded down and you let that handle fall backwards, it will hit the little ones head. Radio Flyer should redesign that with a stop that halts the backwards motion. Other than that, it's a cool ride! You might want to purchase the mini trailer that hooks onto the back. You can haul more stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wagon","review":"I bought this wagon for my 14 month old daughter and she loves it. The wagon is huge with lots of storage space.

Our almost two year old and their 18 month old loved it and we used it everyday - on the beach, on the boardwalk, at the kiddie amusement park, going for walks. It's \\"special\\" to the kids and like an adventure plus you can have them hold their pails or books etc giving you some extra carrying potential. I purchased one from the Amazon mobile app on our way back home so we could use it throughout the summer. It's awesome! I also purchased the add-on pack and that is invaluable. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves this","review":"We got this for her 1st birthday and she absolutely loves riding around in it. The 5-way flip seat is a great idea, and useful for organizing/toting things around. The seatbelts are easy to adjust. The canopy is really useful for the bright/hot days here in LV (of course it doesn't shade at an angle so you have to be conscientious of that) It was VERY easy to assemble - it's usually my husband's job to put stuff together but it was so simple and fast that I just did it myself. The turning is REALLY great, no tipping, easy steering, don't have to keep backing up/adjusting for narrow turns. The only reason I gave it 4 vs 5 stars are the wheels - they're cheap plastic. For the price they could've made the wheels out of rubber. We also have Radio Flyer's Discovery Wagon - the wheels on that are rubber, and really make for a more comfortable ride and better traction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome!","review":"This wagon is fantastic! I had the little bit of assembly done in less than five minutes. My son absolutely loves it, and the canopy definitely comes in handy on those hot sunny days. I would recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Wagon, but.....","review":"I absolutley love this wagon! The only things I have a problem with is the canopy top - the middle rod I always have a problem with getting to stay up, but once I figured out the \\"secret\\" to it, it works like a charm. Also that it's too big for my Sedan! Otherwise, I think this is the greatist wagon ever! I get compliments on it wherever I go. I love the storage space and the canopy top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wagon","review":"I spent lots of time reading reviews on wagons before purchasing. I got this one because it had the best ratings and am soooo glad i did. Our neighbors have the Radio Flyer Pathfinder and when comparing ours to theirs, the wheels are so much bigger and look more durable, it appears there is more leg room and it seems to sit up slightly higher. I love that you can do so many different things with the seats and the uv cover is an added plus. Great value for the price and so glad we got the Ultimate Family wagon instead of the pathfinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wagon!","review":"We bought this wagon first and foremost to cart our kids around when we go places like the zoo. It replaced another, smaller wagon that wasn't nearly as nice. This thing just flat out rocks my socks off, at least as much as a plastic wagon can.Assembly was very straight forward, took me about 15 minutes, including an interruption or two from the kids. I was very apprehensive about a wagon that uses free-spinning front wheels, not tied into the handle, but now I'm a believer -- this thing handles great.The seats are nice and configurable, allowing you to have the kids face each other, or sit facing the same way, storage that neither kid can reach, and even has the canopy you can optionally attach.The price tag, while a bit steep, isn't unmanageable, and I'd recommend this without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans and cleans and cleans!","review":"Excellent hand wipe!

Nice to be able to clean your hands off before eating some lunch on the boat. Great size and since they are in sealed pouches they never dry out like the big plastic containers do.

This is an RPG only because there is a character development tree, which is overly simplified at that. Let us also not compare this to another pseudo RPG Oblivion, because that's like comparing gold paint with gold magic marker; both claim to be something they are not.This is an action game with some character development stuck into a loose plot line, terrible voice acting and particularly mundane dialogue. I would not have been so disappointed if the marketing hadn't played up the games release so much. The graphical style of the game obviously comes from an outdated graphics engine being pushed to its limits. The bombastic theme music that comes up for no reason at all makes it feel like a Monty Python skit in parts.

Broken gameplay and even more broken quests and combat is plain awful. The claim was \\"Most Epic RPG of all time!\\" however after seventeen hours of this garbage it has nothing to show for it.I apologize to the developer who probably had positive intentions, but the only thing this game can claim to be epic, is failure. If you are looking at this game after coming from The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion you will not find a good game in Two Worlds.Try Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Age of Conan:Hyborian Adventures, Oblivion, or Fable: The Lost Chapters before you waste your game time with this rush-released trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH LOOKING AT","review":"As people are always comparing this with oblivion and say oblivion is way better, I'd give them a break considering southpeak is a smaller European gaming company and they are not exactly set in the mainstream of the American Video Game Market.I'd say this game is a mix between Oblivion and Dungeon Siege, with the innerworld freedom and graphical luster of Oblivion and an item and menu arrange the mimics Dungeon Siege.The only negative things I can say about this game is that it takes some time to adjust to, it throws you into this new world without any initial introduction to familarize you with it. Same with the controls, it takes some time to get used to them or adjust them to your own liking.Besides that, it has great RPG gameplay, is fairly addicting like an RPG should be, and unlike Oblivion, it has MULTIPLAYER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk","review":"Someone took TES III Morrowind and Fable TLC, chopped em up and put em in a blender and out popped two worlds.

I have never actually encountered a game that i was so dissappointed with that i had to uninstall it and throw it away but this game certainly deserved it. To be blunt, the graphics sucks, the voice acting sucks, the controls suck, the story sucks. All in all it is a massive waste of money and time. Although, there is nothing more hilarious than hearing the characters speak of the \\"Taint\\" in such a serious manner.

The subplots are overly simplistic...everyone gets their way by sleeping around. A plethora of sex and nudity is added to each episode because this show has nothing else to offer. Shallow, simple, unchallenging...that's House of Lies. The dvd extras are a major let-down. They are very brief and offer no depth and insight.

Unfortunately there was nothing new in this book... I mean, yeah, big deal, everyone has a second mortgage these days, right? No epiphanal moments or breakthroughs into inside information and the root of envy.

It makes me question his own likeability.What I usually like about Carolyn Davidson's heroines is that they are plucky, and true to their hearts. They show strength under difficult situations, and this woman here is engaged to one man, and so easily seduced by another. And then she expects her fiance to still want to marry her.

However, the stories were incomplete, unbelievable, and awkward to read.The main theme in the book is to reward the child for being clean and dry, not for using the potty. That makes sense, and I will try it. However, if I give as many rewards as the book suggests, all she will be doing all day is eating or getting rewards.

If you are a true Heartland fan, I suggest this book must be on your bookshelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book for anyone who likes the stone ages","review":"As a student under Dr. Jochim, I have taken his courses again and again. He is very interested in this region in these time periods. His book is no exception for his lust of this age in our history. If you are seeking to learn what the Cro-Magnon man and early Homo sapien did to survive, then this is a must have. If you are reading this Dr., I am Miles Robertson and I want to say thanks for the many classes I have had with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listening","review":"I have known Russ Reinberg for several years, but I had no idea that he is such an accompoished musician, as well as composer. This debut CD truly reflects his classical training, with great sensitivity. And his collaborators -- Larry Koonse on guitar, Dave Stone on bass, and Ray Brinker on drums -- perfectly compliment Russ' bluesey style.The music which Russ chosen is a pleasing mixture of some old standards and his own compositions which blend perfectly. This is just the type of music to put you into a mellow mood, and would best be enjoyed before a warm fire, with a good bottle of wine, and your significant other."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for anatomy!","review":"Studying anatomy and physiolgy is usually overwhelming.

However, we downloaded five or six songs to it and she listened to them twice. After that, the dumb thing would short out and not work.

Although, if you think of it... If being an adult means you cannot immerse yourself in the world of someone else's imagination and chew on the implications of the ideas and scenarios thereby presented, you must definitely be of a certain age to enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story line","review":"I await further chapters of the story.

With vocals similar to Jason Loewenstein and rocking music like that of 764-Hero and fellow Up bands of the era, Calling All Monsters takes the best from a great genre and cuts a wide swath through the heaps of boring 80s revivalists currently being marketed as \\"indie\\" to impressionable youths. This is a truly great new band who deserves more attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I take this book with a grain of salt, i.e. not as gospel truth.

It deserves 0 stars, but unfortunately, that is not an option. For any educated and confident person, this entire book is sheer nonsense. The premise is that to make a relationship work, the woman must deprecate herself to make a man feel secure in his masculinity (i.e. power and dominance). A relationship based on the principles of this book is not one worth having. Please Note: Man of Steel and Velvet by the author's husband is the companion volume and equally ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete... hopefully","review":"I found an old copy of this in a thrift store and was so intrigued I bought it. Possibly my biggest waste of a dollar yet! Now I'm just glad I did buy it because it will keep some other poor sap from reading it and taking it as the gospel truth. Granted this was written many, MANY years ago when things were very different, but this book is absolute drivel. Basically it tells women that they are useless without a husband and a family to raise, and teaches women how to be subservient and act weak. Gag! Recommended reading only if you are in serious need of either: a) a laugh, or b), a brain transplant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"This is a great book for any girls or young women beginning their journey through the complexities of being female. The author discusses generating respect from dressing modestly and protecting one's reputation. Men often translate signals from women much differently than her intentions. This book teaches girls how to remain in control during situations with men by remaining in control of themselves. Carefully thought out reactions work better than knee-jerk reactions.One of my favorite parts of the book was that it emphasizes that single women should be thinking about upgrading themselves for themselves. You should look pretty for yourself and let men reap the benefits of catching a glance. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful even for a non-Christian","review":"This book is certainly Christian-oriented. But I still found plenty of good advice. I've read it over and over, and wish it were longer. What makes this relationship book different from any other one I have read, and I've read almost all of them, is that half of the book focuses on how to look, how to act, how to treat men, etc, but the other half of the book is about being a \\"girl worth having.\\" This means being a good person, having good values and morals and a positive attitude, not talking badly about people behind their back, not thinking that you're much better or much worse than anyone else, etc. Even if you don't necessarily agree with the value-system espoused in this book, in the world of relationship books, this is radical advice. Yes, it does go on about having good domestic skills, but as this book is outdated and geared toward a certain demographic, you can take this advice or leave it, although I don't know any men that want a woman who can't cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone to a second edition","review":"This book was really interesting and useful, for me, but if you look on the UK site you will find a second edition version which has a lot more material in it (more than 20 extra pages) and still at the same price as the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING BEATS THE ORIGINAL","review":"Playing an Elvis monopoly game is not as fun as the original.

After replacing all my suction piping, foot valve, etc. and $1,000 later I called a local plumber to have him bring out a Goulds pump to try. Worked as soon as it was hooked up.

I read this book some years ago and feel the author didn't really interview or research thoroughly for himself the people being written about. As far as I'm concerned there is no such group as \\"tri racial isolates\\". We lived in a community and interacted to an extent with the surrounding community. He makes the people in the book as something out of the ordinary, when most people are more than one race or nationality. I am related to both the Mayle's and the Menerd's.I gave it one star, mainly because it is a book that can be read and people can see how bias others can be. And yes, we are Native American."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not quite there with this album","review":"The music is well produced and nice arrangements, but I can't quite see what all the fuss is about. It makes me think of Justin Timberlake doing an adult contemporary singer-songwriter album. The lyrics are a bit trite and the singing reminds me of American Idol style pop with adult contemporary music.Was this guy really a thousand miles from his home when he was writng about being in the arms of a woman? That song's lyrics are to close to being a corny cliche that they almost go into parody of a down and out but sensitive (!) singer-songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album too short, great artist but not worth the $$","review":"I saw Amos in concert with Bob Dylan and was impressed.

My reason for going was to see, firstly, Bob Dylan - arguably the greastest songwriter who ever lived. Secondly, Merle Haggard was on the undercard. This was an added little bonus to see two icons before they croak. But a funny thing happened, as I listened to the heavyweights late that night. I couldn't get the soulful voice of this other cat out of my ears. Amos Lee opened for these two legends on (correct me if I'm wrong) his first national tour. If that isn't an endoresment of one's talent, I don't know what is. He was amazing; I quickly (when payday finally rolled around) found and bought his album. I turned my girlfriend on to it, and a few friends as well. Great for laying around late at night, peeling the layers off the day. Lookin' forward to what else he can cook up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You heard it here first","review":"Get this CD and be the first to tell your friends who will receive the Grammy for best new artist.Amos Lee proves that less is more in this must have, impressive, impressive, impressive debut album.

Not everybody agrees on everything, but when the majority says \\"amazing, outstanding\\" there's usually something to it. Fortunately for me, I have discovered a very talented, outstanding musical artist in Amos Lee thanks to you. I dislike the cookie-cutter, radio repeat music that one can hear anytime, all day, every day. This is quality music. I'm excited about this wonderful new artist. Thank you for rating the music @ Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and Unique","review":"It's acoustically pleasing, balanced, beautiful and original. Sure as one reviewer stated it's only about 30 minutes long and I would concede that it does leave you hankering for more, but I'm happy to pull out the Van Morrison, Missy Higgins or Norah Jones type of albums that while not quite the same style lend towards that peaceful bit of escapism one seeks at the end of a hard day. There are similarities with the above mentioned artists as the music is at times bouncy and at other times quiet and gentle with great attention to subtle details that help make this a great little album. It's an excellent debut that I would recommend to any audiophile who appreciates a fine performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amos Lee","review":"Every time I go on a trip I have to buy a new CD to listen on the plane. I was looking around and I saw this album. I hadn't heard any of his songs before and the only thing I had known about him was that he would be going on tour with Bob Dylan and if Bob Dylan likes you enough to go on tour with him then obviously they have to be great. This CD is truely beautiful. It's so poetic and full of life. I highly recommend this CD to anyone whos a fan of Dylan/Coldplay/Radiohead etc. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait!","review":"I saw Amos Lee open for Norah Jones - had never heard of him before and was just blown away by his lyrics and his \\"easy, laid back\\" style! I bought his EP after the show and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this CD. Although if you own the EP some of those songs are included here (different versions)this CD is worth the SMALL amount of money it costs!

So I slapped it in the player expecting to blues riffs and some guttural complaints about love. Instead, I got a much softer side of what I would call Folk Music with a tinge of blues and church music. While my expectations weren't met I was still intrigued. Rather than using the guitar as an angst maker, Amos used his voice and lyrics to get to place of open hope and made the guitar understated. I like the acoustic approach and I think it does even more to bring the lyrics and tune to the focus. Amos has perfect voice for the music he is singing. All the songs follow this same process with a hidden blues notes sneaked in here and there. The bulk of the CD has songs worth listening to multiple time. Amos is able to connect with the song and lyrics to put himself in your blue shoes. Good Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful, smooth and a nice first release","review":"Thirty-two year old Amos Lee's self-titled debut is impressive - soulful, souring vocals, methodical rhythms, all sustaining songs that plant themselves firmly in Folk/Mellow Rock territory, all seasoned with R&B.; The production is distinctly low-key and bare bones.

Unbelievably smooth, easy listening, with songs that both lift you up, and also infuse this feeling of melancholy that, surprisingly, soothes the soul.A brilliant album - it's the only thing I've been listening to for the last few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"amos lee is my new fiancee","review":"I fell in love with Amos Lee after seeing him on tv. I just got the album and I can't stop listening to it. His voice is beautiful and his lyrics are inspiring. His style reminds me of John Mayer crossed with John Legend. A couple of the songs are on the corny side, and personally I prefer the soulful side to the folk side. But aside from that this guy is amazing all around. You can really feel his soul come out in this album. Can't wait for the next one!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than chocolate","review":"Beautiful and unexpected, like a gorgeous man with a well-worn library card. Thanks to hearing \\"Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight\\" on a Paste Magazine sampler, I sprang for the whole album. So glad I did! It's all good, both for close listening and as music to work by.

He has such a beautiful voice and his songs are some of my favourites ever. I honestly cannot reccomend this album more, because he is amazing.

To make a long story short, bought the CD and LOVE IT!!! Anyone who likes all the combinations of music mentioned above will love or like this CD. Happy listening!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and unique","review":"This is an excellent album; the kind you seem to find yourself playing over and over and getting lost in the moment. Amos's music has a lot of variety to it... it would be hard to pigeon-hole his style under one genre or another, and that is what makes it so unique and refreshing in my view. Amos has a great charismatic stage presence as well, making for very entertaining concerts. Therefore, I would highly recommend trying to catch him on tour if you have the opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic easy listening music","review":"When you hear this for the first time, you'll swear you've heard it before.

It covers all the basics: convolution, linearity and why it matters, and the frequency domain, via the Fourier transform. After covering the basics of the Laplace transform and its inverse, Schetzen gives a very clear presentation of its use describing a system's output and conditions for stability.This book, by intent, omits all of digital signal processing. The Nyquist sampling theorem, for example, never arises. That's a perfectly reasonable choice on the author's part, but creates a few gaps in getting to techniques commonly used in computer or DSP systems. Still, this book is an effective introduction or refresher.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great looks, product catalogue feel","review":"Well laid out and some great ideas on how to incorporate color in a minimalist look. Drawback - most of the items are new and there's a helpful list of where to buy them - suggesting this is little more than a catalogue of things for sale. Many of the pictures are STRAIGHT out of the relevant manufacturer's brochure - for example see the Charles sofa by B & B on the classic black floor. You can get all these pictures for free from the relevant companies. Would have been nice to see pieces that looks great but that perhaps aren't available or suggestions of things you can make or adapt yourself to achieve the same look. Overall my feeling was this is a product catalogue sold as a book.

It was very dated-- made in 1989, it felt almost like 1979 in quality and storyline, which was very predictable. For parents: I didn't think it was entirely appropriate for a middle schooler.

This book offends no one, yet educates us all with humor and common sense. One must read it, to understand. It was with great pleasure that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"This book expresses many of the thoughts of the \\"silent minority\\". The presentation of religious beliefs/analyses in a straight forward manner sprinkled with humor provided many thought provoking situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Tape is a Must","review":"For those who have experienced trauma and seek insight as to why they act and react so many days, weeks or even months after the event, this tape is a must. Mind, body and spirit experience the same trauma, but not all three aspects of our lives are addressed. A trauma needs to be integrated before healing takes place.The physical exercises, the suggested questions for discussion and the explanations of the chemical changes, which take place after trauma, are rooted in reality and are informative. Practical and clearly understandable, this tape is empowering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't complain about the price","review":"Anybody that complains about the price should not be looking at this gun solely for the fact that this gun is meant for real airsofters; people who take the sport seriously. If you want a \\"toy\\" that looks cool and shoots stuff, go look for a CYMA piece of ****. They'll run you $10 to $30. Any decent AEG costs roughly the same amount as this gun so if this is out of your price range, then you are obviously in the wrong market.The CA G36C is a good weapon though."},{"rating":"2","title":"It fit and was made for it","review":"Got one for my Ford Mustang, and it does what its suppose do \\"fit above the window to deflect the rain\\", but don't get me wrong, take your time installing if your doing it yourself.

This novel is sophisticated, intelligent and stimulating. The author draws you in with her powerful story of love, hate, betrayal and control.

It provides the conclusion to Secrets, Portia's Story; another treasure penned by Ms. Holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selena's Revenge","review":"I did not like the first book in the series, Portia, and this book is even worse.

When I was studying Italian, I listened to everything I could in Italian and once I reached the level where I could understand song words, I knew I was fast approaching fluentcy. Total submersion was my key to learning Italian. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"This novel had no style and very little substance. From its \\"It was a dark and stormy night beginning\\" to its too-straightforward account of the trial, it did not capture my imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story of love and war","review":"This book was a little slow starting out and then when it got going it was hard to put down. It kept you reading to find out what would happen. It was a story about a death of a fisherman that after investigation became a murder trial. The main story was the trial but it had numerous stories on the side that was about the life and loves and other things of certain people. These smaller stories kept you interested and reading and reading. It was set in the time of WWII so there was a lot of racism over Japanese. So the \\"murderer\\", who was Japanese, faced a lot of racism. This book was probably accurate on the treatment of them and they were treated bad. This book was very good and I would recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have to read it, leave it on the bookshelf","review":"I was bored out of my mind reading this book. I thought it was slow paced and the vocabulary gave me many difficulties. It didn't like the content of the book. The storyline made me very confused and the flashbacks were also hard to understand. I would not recommend reading this book. To me it is aimed at the adult audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a wonderful novel, if it is read to the end.","review":"The book is exceptionally well written. It is a gripping reality of what Americans put the Japanese American people through during, and even after, World War II. At the same time it tells of a forbidden romance between two people of different race, and of a trial that holds a Japanese American man accused of murder. If you are planning on reading this, read it through to the very end. It does have a few uninteresting points, but as soon as you reach about half way through the book it gets really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinite detail like snowfall covering lack of plot","review":"I agree with the other readers who gave this one star. There is a total lack of cohesion to the story; many trivial things are put in for no reason at all. Great writers thrill their readers by making amazingly complex threads tie together at the end, this book fizzles into nothing. Great writers make you care about or at least understand the characters, these characters are two-dimensional and uninteresting.If you think this sounds like great writing, maybe you'll like the book:\\"Well, thought Ishmael, bending over his typewriter, his fingertips poised just above the keys: the palpitations of Kabuo Miyamoto's heart were unknowable finally.\\" Unknowable finally? What? Why is there a colon in the middle of this sentence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I got extremely annoyed with all the stereotype description of the characters. David Gutterson tries to lengthen the very thin base of the novel (the murder and the accusation) with unnecessary long memories, detailed description of strawberry fields and snow falling. And I thought it was very irritating the way he switched from the memories of all the different characters. I think he wrote the novel with the intention of getting it filmed. I thought it was a waste of my time but I wanted to finish it anyway (which is the one positive thing I can say about the book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"Could hardly get through this book. Horrible. Over descriptive. And I HATED the main character, actually let's just say I hated all the characters. Hard to like a book when you don't like anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an eye catcher, and a great seller.","review":"This was a great book. It tells how a Japanese American is judged by an whole island. The Japanese American, Kabuo Miyamoto, is being charged of a fisherman's murder. I like how the story first takes place in the courtroom. While I was reading it, I felt if I was watching it on television. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat making you read more into the book. This book is a mystery, a thriller, and love story wrapped into one novel. If you like mysteries and you want to find out the truth of the murder, then I really think you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aweinspiring","review":"Damn you for beinging so good. At one time I felt I might be a good enough wordsmith to pound out something that people would enjoy. Not anymore. You are so good that I am embarrassed at my feeble attempts.

Damn you for being so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Falling Off a Cliff","review":"I liked the great amount of detail Guterson went into with this novel. However, it was getting to the point where I wish he would have gotten on with the story. It was just way too long for the point he was trying to get across about this small bigoted town in Washington in the 1950's. I think that he should have gone into more detail regarding the conclusion than everything else in the novel. When I got to the end, I was like, \\"this is it?!\\" I read 400+ pages for this!!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Although the writing is beautiful and one can picture the landscape perfectly, I thought that Snow Falling on Cedars was pretty boring and quite predictable. I often enjoy courtroom drama, but nothing really happened in this whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Falling On Cedars taught me a ton about prejudiceness.","review":"I was recently assigned to read a novel of my choice. When I first recieved the assignment, I thought that it would just eb another boring language arts project. Little did I know that when reading this novel, it taught me a lot about life in general. When Kabou was arrested mostly because of his race, it showed me that people can be so heartless, when someone is to blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move Over Tylenol PM","review":"There is a new sleep aid in town: this wonderfully dull novel. About 400 pages of the book are meaningless yakity-yak yak about absolutly nothing imbelished with useless diction. The characters are about as alive as my left shoe. Also, i think Gutterson has some sexual issues judging from the twisted contents of some of these very descriptive paragraphs. I haven't finished the book yet, and I'm not planning to, as I firmly belive that it will put me into a coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving, bad charactor deveopment","review":"The plot had some nice ideas, but to much irelevent information (which I wouldent have minded if it had been intrusting). there was also a compleat failear to devolp the ideas into an intrusting story. The language is good, but a touch pedantic, and that is no reason to read the book. i would not recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars is what i would really give","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend who's sister read it for a History class at college. She loved it and her sister loved it too, but unfortunately I cannot see what is so special about it. I think the book tries to be about the unfair treatment of Japanese Americans and their internment. I think it also tries to be about the differences in culture, tradition, values, and social behavior between the Japanese Americans and the people of San Piedro Island and the difficulties caused by these differences. However, I don't think that the book actually achieves either of these goals (assuming that is what Guterson wanted to achieve). In it's place is a very flimsy book taking on important issues and wrapping them up in a half-hearted love /murder/war story that never really goes anywhere. The book left me with a feeling of 'yes, i have managed to read the whole of it, but no, i don't think it made me think about anything in particular-what a waste of time.

It really seemed like it was a screen play. The courtroom especially was very Perry Mason. Some of the period details seemed off. For instance I believe people running to the store and wiping out everything in sight didn't happen in the 50's whenever there was a blizzard. You know there wasn't TV then to hype every weather event. I also don't think every car on the road would wipe out because it was snowing.

On the contrary, I could not stand his sexist's, prejudiced viewpoint againt Asian women and could not finish reading this book. Whenever Hatsue appears in the scene, it is about SEX; as if her only role in the book is to provide SEX.

Nice cover art, but other than that....a waste of time. The little mistakes ruined this book. Mulberries grow on trees, not hedges. There was never a \\"redirect\\" during the questioning in the trial...not even during closing arguments. Finally Lutherans do NOT pray for a deceased person's soul. They beleive the soul goes where it is going at the time of death and one cannot pray TO or FOR a soul. One of the major points made by Martin Luther at the time of the Reformation and this was actually a huge issue in the era that this book took place. Author needed to do alot more research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story flows as natural as water rushing down a stream.","review":"I've never felt more like I was in a story, observing it from a special secret place, than when I read Snow Falling On Cedars. The characters are all unique and memorable. I caught myself reading slower the longer I read because I didn't want it to end. I'm sure this book will become a classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Falling on Cedars","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars is a compelling novel about prejudice, heartache, and absession. it deals with a ten year old romance of Ishmael Chambers and Hatsue Miyamoto. While Ishmael is still in love with Hatsue, she is trying to deal with her husband, Kabuo, being on trial for murder. The trial takes place in the 1950's, right after World War 2. There is a lot of prejudice feeling going around about the whole trial. I thought the author did an excellent job describing scenes in the story but couldn't keep me captivated in the begining of the story. i had to wait till the very end of the story to discover why they even thought Kabuo Miyamoto commited the murder. I wouldn't recommended this book unless you wanted to devote a whole lot of thought into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I felt the plotline was thin and there wasn't much depth. I know the overall reaction to this book is of a superior nature, but I was positively underwhelmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This was a good book. The story was interesting and the imagery and writing was strong. Gutterson's portrayal of the suffering and prejudice that the Japanese experienced was incredibly done. Definitely a book that that opens your eyes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, subtle, haunting","review":"I dare any book fan to read this and not feel that they have tasted the sweet sugar of the strawberries, the musky-warm aroma of pine and cedar bark, and San Peidro's rare sun kissed touch on ones misty cheeks. A book you don't merely read but experience. Will the movie live up to the novel's flawless depiction? Proablly not, but we are all in for a treat if it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtfull & evocative","review":"A very enjoyable read; from the first few pages, it was like putting on a cosy old sweater. Guterson did a great job of conjuring up the sights, smells and feel of a quiet and isolated misty island. I cared for most of the characters. Some of the metaphors were interesting: the storm, through the entire book, disturbing the lives of the islands inhabitants just as the winds of war disturbed the lives of Ishmael and Hatsue; Ishmael himself - one-armed - only half the man he used to be, both physically, and emotionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be any more boring?","review":"At first glance of the cover of Snow Falling on Cedars one would not expect a love story, but this is exactly what the book is, a love story. Although the books' cover claims it to be a mysterious trial of a man named Kabuo, that is just a small part of the story. Instead, the story is really about Ishmael and his love for Kabuo's wife. Snow Falling on Cedars is a very well written book, but tends to be too descriptive. If you are looking for a fast pace book with a lot of twists and mysterious characters, Snow Falling on Cedars is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough hype already!","review":"This book is better than the hordes of single-girl -in-Mahattan short story collections and boring memoirs clogging the current literary scene; hence the two stars. But standing alone, it barely deserves that. Guterson's writing is hypnotic, but the pace is slow, his descriptions occasionally laughable, and the love story simply bored me to tears. In addition to being boring, it was also more than slightly offensive--the Ishmael character's heavy-breathing fascination with an \\"exotic\\" Asian woman deserves a critique all its own. The plot also seems to take the easy way out, giving the ending an unsatisfying (and frankly unbelievable) tone. As for being politically correct, this book jumps from issue to issue faster than those old 21 Jump Street episodes. Guterson does do an excellent job of evoking place--but he doesn't do justice to the folks who live there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying novel","review":"I stayed away from this book for a long time because the movie version never appealed to me. I am very glad I gave it a chance because it really fulfilled most of my requirements of a novel. The story was interesting and plausible both at the same time, the characters were appealing and multi-dimensional, and the setting was really fascinating (both in location and time). The story is a courtroom drama and mystery, but the novel is really about the havoc that racism and injustice has wrought on a small community. In that way it is a bit like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". I was happy to see a novel address this shameful bit of American history in such a way. The author approaches it honestly with out any sensationalism. I hope other people will give this book a chance like I did. I look forward to reading more of his fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Falling On Cedars","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars is a book set in the 1940' s-1950 on a small Island off the state of Washington.

I've obviously missed something. I bought it on specific, unprompted recommendation. I'm not a half-wit and I read it during a long 2-day Canadian train journey, so I wasn't far off, geographically speaking.It's . . . , well, it's just . . . so, so.And it's obviously a 'set book' in colleges. Good for that, I suppose. Quite a high word quotient. Good value for money.

The characters were very realistic, and the story was believable, with acurate historical evidence. I thought that the story of Kabuyo Miyamoto was sad, yet heart warming in the end, with all of his love confessions and deep thoughts.Another heart-breaking reality that you come face-to-face with is the harsh racial boundaries and segregations in the American community, eventhough that war has long since past. it's amazing how people can continue to be so racist and cruel to their own neighbors.Overall, I thought that this was a very good book, with inspiring emotions, and good supporting evidence.

Meanwhile, the author was so intent on showing the reader how well he did his research that he constantly used unimportant nautical terms few are familiar with, added prolonged environmental descriptions,long and excruciatingly detailed flashbacks that constantly drained the flow of drama, and extensive character development that often weakened the plot instead of strengthening it. This story could have been told succinctly and dramatically in 200 pages. I felt constantly distracted by this method of presentation, was annoyed that the drama was interrupted so often by unnecessary detail, skimmed through half the book, and still was able to retain the crux of the tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A matter of region","review":"It is interesting to see that most of the negative comments were written by New Yorkers and people from Massachussetts. Should that mean that educated people from that side of the country have developed a more acute critical mind? Well, for sure, they are far more down-to-earth and skeptical, and the beauty of the descriptions in Snow Falling on Cedars didn't touch them as it did to more sensitive readers. Nonetheless, good book or not, it has given way to a marvelous film. For that, credit needs be given to the author, and praise, to the film producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing But Dirty Story","review":"This engaging story has some terrific writing and spendid characterization.

This is a one hundred page edited version for children still learning how to read books. The real Snow Falling on Cedars is closer to 400 pages.

I think it will be my first movie of the new millennium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"snow falling on cedars","review":"Unfortunately, this book reads more like a screenplay than a novel. Other than the romantic scenes in the book, the author gives the reader little intimacy with the characters in the book and does more descriptive writing than absorbing character creation. Since the author did have wonderful plot and storyline, it was disappointing that it was written with little reward for the reader. There was a lack of consistency regarding the view of how the plot and underlying prejudice of society was to be portrayed. If the author would have created the story from one character's perspective, it may have been a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving","review":"I read the book \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" for my 8th grade literature class in which we had to choose to read a historical fiction novel. I got into it, and soon enough, I was almost finished! It was a very powerful story which deals with the discrimination of the Japanese during and after the second World War. A Japanese man is on trial for the murder of an American man, and a very interesting case comes into play. One by one, you learn about the characters' pasts and how they are all connected to someone else's: sometimes in more ways than one. The connections aren't always good ones, and it shows you how some events really do come back to haunt you. David Guterson really kept me in this book, and his enticing storyline really gave me a lot to think about. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn a little about life and about the past during a time when all men weren't thought to be created equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"This book is deeply moving. The reader is immediately drawn into the book's events, namely the tragic romance between Ishmael and Hatsue and the murder trial. With everything that occurs in the book, the reader can fully empathize with each character's feelings. Guterson does a superb job of making each character unique and well-developed. The descriptions of San Piedro Island are perhaps the most beautiful and romantic. This story is compelling, emotional, and intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Falling on Cedars","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the ending is disappointing. I believe the first half of the book could have been deleted, or at least summarized, and saved a lot of trees! A true waste of paper. However, I must admit there was one point where it peaked my interest (just past the half-way point) but then let me down again. Let's hope for something better next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy and graphic but beautifully written","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars is reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird in that it deals with a man wrongfully accused of a crime and the prejudice of the community regarding his race. However, because the main character of the story is a disillusioned war veteran, the tone of the novel is much edgier and more graphic in its descriptions of events and emotions. I really enjoyed the book but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. The author does not hold back in his descriptions of sex, murder or war. Ironically, the novel is also very beautiful. I could picture the snow cedar forests of the Northwest. I could even smell them. The author also gave rich detail to each and every character making them three dimensional. As a reader, I felt that I knew them, and I cared very much what happened to them. A worthy read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot to Like","review":"This is a wonderful novel about a murder trial on an island off Washington state in the 1950s. All at once a murder mystery (complete with forensics), a period novel, a culture/history novel (Japanese-Americans and their WWII internment are key figures/events in the story), a geographical novel (weather/land/water play a big part) and a star-crossed love story, Guterson manages to blend it all together with an easy grace. But mainly the theme is human nature under crisis, about which Guterson provides a lot of insight. My only quibble is with an opening chapter that spends a little too much time setting the physical scene (the \\"snow falling on cedars\\"). I found this part to be slow going, and it might discourage some readers from continuing.I highly recommended \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" to readers of all ages. Teenagers may especially appreciate the book as the protagonist/narrator is a journalist looking back on his life as a youth and teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Falling On Cedars!","review":"David Guterson turned a simple murder story into a fantastic novel introducing themes of love, justice, racism, community, and conscience. Many issues are bought to the surface in the way we look at the world of the text and the way we see our own world. The way Guterson wrote the novel, always going into flashback lets our views of the themes and issues discussed be questioned. Also, because he [Guterson] introduces so many different characters we see all the different view points from so many people. If Etta Heine for example had not been put on trial we would not have known how prejudice against japs she was. We would not also have known the true facts of what happened so many years ago getting her and her husband's views. This book in writen in such a specialized way that we get many different novels in one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"snow falling on cedars","review":"If this is the standard for a great novel nowadays, I know I'll never be able to write one. The novel is interesting to the end, and I think fairly balanced, giving the reader reason to understand the emotions of both sides and how they came about. However, it seems to me this author is overly concerned with the male sexual organ, in a few paragraphs, for some reason or another, without adding value to the story.Finally, this book would be an excellent Cliff Notes' candidate, as his descriptions and use of adjectives can easily be described as superfluous. This book, like many could easily be condensed. One misses nothing by merely glancing over whole paragraphs. It can also be seen, however, that the author spent a great deal of time on this work and and must have gone through many a draft to perfect his wording and plot. He is surely a very patient and gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated! save your $$$.","review":"Though I found Guterson's descriptions of strawberry fields & island life beautiful, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because some parts of it were very boring.

I really tried to like this book more, being from the area. Maybe the movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.C. hype leaves everything to be desired...","review":"I had \\"heard\\" that the book was an excellent must read. I was disappointed not only by the slowness of the story itself, but by the redundancy of the text. He has many descriptions which I felt were goobledegook attempting to hide a weak story. The book could easily have been 100 pages with nothing lost. Gutterson seemed detached from his characters, a writer merely describing thoughts, feeling, emotions etc. which made me feel detached from the characters, as well as the story. It's interesting to see how one good review can often times illicit an emperor's new clothes mentality. There are so many excellent books out there, this is not one I would have spent valuable time reading had I read an accurate review. I finished it because I had high hopes it would improve based on inaccurate word of mouth and reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was boring","review":"This book could have been much better if there weren't so many unecessary characters. That made it very hard to keep each one of them in line with their part in this book. This book could have been hundreds of pages shorter because there was more information that we DIDN'T need than information that we did. I like more exciting books that grab your attention in the first few pages. This book definitely did not do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"human emotion","review":"this book is reality of the inhuman way the Japanese were treated during the bombing of our Navy forcesin Hawaii - the emotions continue with prejudice -"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I need to see the movie","review":"Seemed like a fine painting out of focus. Beautiful character development and imagery with no spine. It just wound down to nothing. This is an over rated book, but I am excited to see if the author can get it all working together later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was a terrible book. I read it and It was mediocre. i was expecting a surprise ending but it turned out not to be a mystery at all. the imagerie was the only good thing about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distant novel","review":"The books reads like the snow falling on cedars...slow and cold. The plot drifts and seems very detached. Didn't like it very much. I liked the attention to detail and the novel approach to race relations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"This is an enjoyable book. It is well written, you feel like you've grown up on an island after reading this, the detail. I did not find it suspenseful though, I don't know why the reviewers thought it was, for me the ending was obvious. The flashbacks were a little confusing too, just keep in mind there are a lot of them, and almost everyone has at least one. Overall I still highly recommend it, if not for the plot and writing, at least for a glimmer of what Japanese Americans went through during WWII, which was good to gain an understanding of."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story is so wordy and repetitive. Overrated!","review":"Although a few interesting characters are developed, the author's pace is painstakingly slow and repetitive. I skimmed the book, finished it in a couple of days, and didn't feel that I missed anything. The prose is not so wonderful as to be forgiving of the author's verbosity. The plot line is also not strong enough to hold the reader's interest. Ismahal's torch for the defendant's wife is also a bit unbelieveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strawberry Fields Forever and ever and ever","review":"This novel skims over the surface of a lyrical world without ever descending into passion or conviction. I cannot recall the last novel I read where the characters are rendered with such glum and humorless earnestness. The novel's sympathy for its characters is admirable but by the end, they're all just cardboard cutouts in Guterson's wordy morality play."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should give it away","review":"Snow falling on cedars - how boring is that? And so is the book. Trees trees, trees. I think he has a fetish with trees.It was incredibly painful to get through but I wanted to find out what happens in the end - NOTHING! That has to be the worse ending of anything I have ever read or watched.I now know to see if any of the 5 star reviewers for this book have rated anything else I look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Beyond Belief","review":"I finally somehow managed to finish Snow Falling on Cedars after reading it on and off for months. Guterson is a master of verbal torture, he somehow manages to find a way of describing even the simplest of things, like a snowy tree, using five paragraphs.Eliminate these redundant and tedious descriptions from the text, and you'll probably be left with about fifty pages (I'm serious). When you're finally near the end, and are anticipating the the surprise ending that may make all the painful reading worthile, Guterson slaps you in the face with an ending so predictable it'll make you feel like an idiot for reading the entire book.I wonder what the readers who gave it five-star reviews (which made me buy it in the first place) were thinking. Have they all never seen snow before?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought that the book was boring.","review":"The novel \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" is a boring book that I would not recommend it to anyone. The love story between Ishmael and Hatsue was just about the only thing that interested me. It was the only thing that motivated me to keep on reading. I was curious to what would happen between them. This book only got two stars though because it just had too much boring information in it. It gave so much useless information on each page that I almost fall asleep on every page I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to read in the winter","review":"I liked the book, it seemed to draw you into it. I found myself reading it late into the night and not wanting to put it down. I found it very interesting how the writer move the reader from past to present as he did. He seemed to mold your thoughts and emotions as if he predicted how you would feel when you read lines in the book. The weather in the story really controlled my thoughts also, as the lines in the book did, I really think that this book is a book for almost anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"After the glowing reviews I had received from others, I must say that I was a bit let down with this book. Granted, I wasn't expecting an action-adventure novel, but I did expect to become engrossed with the plot. Throughout the whole novel, I was waiting for the plot twist that never came. I found the book to be predictable, both in its story line and its message. Also, I wasn't able to connect with any of the characters, nor did I have any opinion either way on the verdict of the trial. Maybe I rushed through the book or maybe I'm too used to the trash-adventure novel, but I didn't think that this book was all I was led on to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the Plot?","review":"Darned interesting story line. The problem is that the exciting climax takes only three pages at the very end of the book. The rest of the book is spent setting up the mood with vivid poetic imagery. The author spends hundreds of pages setting up the story and three pages finishing it. It's almost like falling off a cliff when you get to the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mockingbird Clone!","review":"This book, while combining a masterful account of the Northwest in the mid 1950's, Is merely a pitiful attempt to repluck the heart strings that had been strummed by 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. At best, this novel shows while the duplication of great works is possible, recreation is beyond reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"Love, history, work, life, prejudice, aspirations, fear, community, spite, ignorance, small towns, honesty, fishing, farming and journalism all play roles in this fresh story of 1950's Northwest US coastal life.Like snow falling on cedars, this novel starts slowly and builds up imperceptibly, adding weight, reducing visual clarity, bending branches and emitting the clean scent of pine. Lives intertwine. A murder drama unfolds. Good and evil clash.The book is a page turner. There are layers and depth to this story. The historical description of a time, place and cultures (Japanese American and local) is rich and distinctive.The CD version is too abridged and the voice too quiet for enjoyment while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great murder mystery judges mankind as well as a murderer","review":"A great murder mystery judges mankind as well as a murderer. In \\"Snow Falling,\\" that judgment falls on individuals, on a community, on ways of life and philosophies of life.The author does all those things, while at the same time drawing images of the setting that are both starkly beautiful and beautifully pertinent to the plot. The island becomes a metaphor that describes and encloses all its people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provided insight into Japanese American History.","review":"I, like many others, found the author's description of the sceneryenchanting. I have visited this area and can picture it all. I easily felt for the characters and found myself wrapped up in their individual lives. I have also visited Japan and respect their simple but efficient way of life. This book brought out some truths about prejudice and the consequences of it. I now look at Japanese Americans with a renewed sense of respect for their cultural heritage. A great book. It would make an excellent study for students of Sociology."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets to the heart of personal vs. national identity","review":"The manner in which the author deals with the aftermath of WW2 and the treatment of Japanese-americans was inspiring. Prejudices on either side lead to misunderstandings, and lost innocence. This novel stirs the emotions and causes the reader to get angry at the injustices.The end seems to drop off suddenly; wrapped up neatly in a few final paragraphs, but otherwise an excellent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A matter of region","review":"It is interesting to find that most of the negative comments come from New Yorkers. Should that mean that New Yorkers actually have a more acute critical mind? For sure, it seems that they are more of the down-to-earth and skeptical type. Good book or not, Snow Falling on Cedars gave way to a great, unique film. Credits need be given to the author and praise needs be awarded to the film producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Not Published for USA Market","review":"I would not have purchased this particular edition of Snow Falling on Cedars if I had known it was published for the European market. I gave the book to an American 13 year old who is still learning rules for grammar and punctuation. Although the story is the same, the punctuation reflects the rules of Oxford English therefore, I had to tell her to ignore the punctuation so she would not pick it up and use it in her own American classroom essays. It is a learning experience, of course, but a needless one at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Descriptions!","review":"The character descriptions in this book were just amazing. He made you feel like you reall yknew these people of Amity Harbor, San Piedro Island in Puget Sound. A Wonderfully Written Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars is one of the best novels I've ever read. Guterson has a way with descriptions that is incredibly realistic. For example, in the scene where Ishmael watches the snow gather on the windowpanes of the courthouse, I actually got shivers while reading it! Not only is this a great murder mystery, but it is also a beautiful romance, and a history of one of America 's darkest actions from World War II. Snow Falling on Cedars is a perfect mix of all these genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLLYWOOD","review":"Overall the book is OK I guess. Not a complete waste of time. It is suspenseful, but the ending made me sick. It was so predictable that Ishmael would turn over the evidence that I was sure no great writer would ever have that happen. It would have been far more depressing, but far more realistic to have Ishmael just toss the evidence into the water. It was like the writer was in a hurry to finish up this book and send it off to Hollywood to make a film. The 'feel good' ending is sometimes the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point of reading this?","review":"How could someone write about so many themes and not take the time to delve into them? There's love and war and racism and countless others in the novel, and yet no real connection with life in the '50s or even life today. The reader cannot connect with the characters and so cannot be involved in the story. I heard lots of wonderful reviews for this novel, but when it comes down to it, it is not what a high school junior should be forced to read. How could the book end like this? All the character description (pages upon pages) just to end in 3 little pages. And is the last line supposed to change the whole novel? Simply a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you must read it, it's one to skip","review":"I was shocked that this turgid and boring work won the awards that it did. I am also astounded at the number of courses that are assigning it as required reading. There is zero character development and almost as little plot development. The sex scenes were unnecessary and a bit embarrassing, even for this liberally educated reader. For a moving World War II drama, try \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Falling On Cedars","review":"This book is beautifully written. The discription is exceptional. The characters are so well developed through the discription that you feel you know them and are pulled into the novel experancing everything with them. Guterson demonstrates as a practical memorable author. After reading this book I don't think the mystery will ever leave my mind. This book is a scrutiny of racisim, forgivness, and love between people. The symbolism that Guterson uses is incredable. He uses fog to demonstrate mystery and he lets your mind imagine what is going to happen from the beginng of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all, pretty good.","review":"Beautifully written, superb prose, and a joy from begninng to end. Superb character depiction. Court room secnes are usually boring, but not this one. Dramatic racial tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable....","review":"After reading some of the other reader's reviews I was a bit surprised that they didn't enjoy it as much as I did. The obvious reason being that most of those who rated it poorly went in with preconcieved or hyped-up notions. I had none of these obstacles. I went in thinking I was going to read a novel about the Japnaese/American's treatment during World War II. What I wasn't expecting was a court room drama & continuing saga that spanded generations, races & cultures. I was impressed with it and I recommend it, admittedly I didn't give it 5 stars because the ending did leave a bit to be desired...but just a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"objective yet touching","review":"this book explores the many cultural differences and prejudices that we face in the usa, as well as just being a wonderful tale of strength, friendship, and dedication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second half of the book did not stand upo to the first half.","review":"Guterson's imagery is superb throughout the book but the drama of the court room fell short when the wife failed to tell what she knew and the japanese fisherman refusing to talk. That was lame and in need of some form of \\"deus ex machina\\" and not the predictable newsman coming up with the solution that somehow evaded the sheriff. But I am on to \\"East of Mountains\\" to see if a seamless plot is possible for Guterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was...","review":"I think the book was pretty good. It was thought provoking and deep...but it wasn't profounding to the point where I had a cartharsis. I really enjoyed reading it..and the way the characters were slowly developed. I've read through a few of the comments placed here and they said that the characters were not well developed...well I think Ishmael, Carl, and maybe even Hatsue were quite remarkable characters. I'm proud of Ishmael..and his mother playing a great part in his life (even though it was the ending half of the book). However, I do agree that the book was slow...and parts where I fell asleep. But that was what made the book beautiful; the way he described the setting and was descriptive of little parts of nature that never really seems to awaken any of us. And I think there might have been some symbolism in parts of his writing. Nonetheless..I think this book was wonderful to read. I enjoyed it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Romance Mystery Abound with Imagery","review":"I found the pages of Snow Falling on Cedars turning quickly as I became engrossed in the story of Kabuo, Hatsue, Ishmael and the isolated island of San Piedro. Though at some points the numerous details get a bit tedious, Guterson's beautifully written descriptions of the island, weather, and the young romance of Hatsue and Ishmael formed vivid images in my mind. He was successful at capturing the very spirit of the forest and the sea, and it is possible to see how these elements of nature had such an effect on the lives of the islanders. The plot built up steadily, with just enough suspense to keep the reader looking forward to the next pages. This novel brings out the passionate nature of humans, as well as the power of conscience and the goodness of the human spirit. It can be seen as a tribute to nature,the human race, and love, for it carefully weaved these elements into a tale that is sure to touch the hearts of many."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Novel David Guterson is our modern day Steinbeck","review":"I read Snow for a book report in my English class. Read half way thru then saw the movie. It is powerful stuff. The theme of racism and prejudice,fear, love and hate are well developed in characters so full of life they seem to be real people. The love story is especially touching. Ismael and Hatsue and their forbidden love affair. But also Ismael's war experience, the Japanese suffrage and the murder trial that spands through the novel. It's a romance, a mystery and a powerful novel of human trials. I recommend the book. And the snow falling is poetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"He didn't want to waste the research!","review":"It seems that Guterson did a lot of research for this novel and was reluctant to \\"waste\\" any of it. The point, surely, is to use only what you need. The few brushtrokes of traditional Japanese drawing: economical and sure, seem an apt comparison here. It's repetitive, it has a made-for-Hollywood ending, but underneath all that a good editor could find an excellent novella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guterson himself has not departed from racial biases.","review":"Yes, this was a well-crafted book. However, it was not _well-written_ because Guterson utilized \\"essentialist\\" words to describe Asian American qualities in his book. Let me explain. Did you notice that Guterson used words such as \\"grace,\\" \\"tranquility,\\" and \\"patience\\" to describe Asian Americans? He also used telling phrases such as \\"his strength...an inward matter\\" (87) or \\"I understand just now the deepest beauty\\" (92) in order to capture the seemingly essential, or \\"primary,\\" qualities exuded by Asian Americans. Look throughout the book: Does Guterson ever use these types of words to describe the non-Asian population of San Piedro Island? Guterson himself has not departed from racial biases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it, but had a concern","review":"I was looking for SOMETHING to read, and saw the movie previews for Snow Falling on Cedars. Thought, what the heck. The previews look good. And actually, I enjoyed the book. We get rich characters and scenery. I felt like heading down to the docks after reading some of the fishing scenes. The main character did something I found annoying (can't reveal it -- that might spoil the book) but the main character doesn't have to be infallible. My one concern was the author's inexplicable preoccupation with the male sex organ, specifically, in mentioning it several times when it was unneccessary. For that reason, and the descriptions of sex, I wouldn't recommend this book for teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Gratuitous","review":"This novel is bloated, callow and meandering -- without purpose or effect. It certainly doesn't work as a murder mystery! It's shallow melodrama about distinctly unpleasant people. Generous dollops of gratuitous sex and violence. (The sex scenes, actually, are queasily embarrassing to read, because they are so inappropriate and out of place.) When I was done I felt that I'd just read a self-important Danielle Steele novel.I do agree with the other readers who liked the cover. Very pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this book because everyone else said they loved it. The book was very difficult to get through, the first part moved so slowly. I kept reading on, hoping I would develop an iota of sympathy for this guy, but never really did. Hopefully in the movie version, Ethan Hawke will be able to portray the character with the depth that was lacking in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-written, thoughtful, horribly sexual","review":"The suspense of the trial was masterfully drawn out. People should read this book beacuse of its good plot and accurate history. Why the need for such explicit scences between people whose love and relationships did not even figure into the plot. Carl ans Susan Marie had quite a very steamy time in this book. If you aren't prepared for detailed sexual images, don't read it. However, if you don't mind this sort of thing, the book is redeemed by its Romeo-and-Juliet romace and an intriguing mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal highlight in 1998","review":"a pageturner, a book to dive in, dream away, go back to 1954 and more, learn about the relationship between Americans and Japanese-Americans before, during and after WW II."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good book","review":"Well this is not a good book if you don't like to read. Over all it was interesting yet frustrating at the same time. It had great progression from begining to end and even in some of the sceens I thought was realy there it was so discriptive. It turned out to be quite an interesting book in the end. It was so good that it seems like yesterday that I started to read this book. I think that the author should be put up for a prize or somthing. I just can't wait for the movie to come out so I can rush to see it. I just can't beleave how well all the charicters were tied together and ended up all happy in the end. this is just a great book and I can't stress that enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody, atmospheric tale","review":"Moody tale of pain and longing -- so beautifully written that it makes you feel as if you are on the island with the characters and witnessing the critical events. Contrary to what the publisher states on the book jacket, it is NOT a mystery -- it carries no suspense -- but well worth the read if you are in the right frame of mind. It should also be a great film -- directed by Scott Hicks, the same director who made \\"Shine.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My College Class Gave Good Reviews!","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars captured our college class and lent itself to great discussions!

A GOOD READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ached to leave this desk behind and set to sea!","review":"Guterson's imagery just took me away. Can't decide whether to now go be a fisherman or a strawberry farmer or both! Great read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak in some areas, strong in others.","review":"As a winner of the Pen/Faulkner Award, I expected more. The book's most entertaining aspect was the snow storm. The author did a good job making me see and feel it. Ishmael's mother's kitchen seemed especially cozy in the storm.On the negative side, I wasn't riveted by the plot. There was enough interest to keep me occasionally picking up this book until I finally finished it after several months, but I could never get excited or passionate over what was happening. The author didn't fill the characters with pulsing red blood, not for me anyway.The book was also too wordy in places, especially in the first half."},{"rating":"1","title":"NBC Movie of the Week","review":"This is how this book felt to me. The characters were shallow and the narrator was intrusive and sappy. I didn't know what this book was about before I opened it; but, coincidently, I started reading it immediately after finishing \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", which has many of the same plot elements. This made it pale in coparison to great literature even further. Living in Japan, as well, made the stereotypes seemed all the more laughable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, great interesting history lesson","review":"I figure that it is fine for someone who has time to learn about that stuff but someone who is reading a book for something useful nowdays or a novel that excites throughout, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read \\"Snow Falling On Cedars\\"","review":"Snow Falling On Cedars by David Guterman is arguably a staple of American literature. I disagree. Set on an island to the north of Puget Sound in Washington, Snow Falling On Cedars is a story of a murder trial of a man of Japanese descent. A story of racism, with examples that persist to this day, some would argue. In reality, it is a novel with little to no believability. Guterman's characters are shallow, and aren't developed throughout the book. Ishmael Chambers, a newspaper editor, is one of these. While supposedly driven by love in Snow Falling On Cedars, he is also a war veteran and yet as evidenced in the final chapters the sense of duty the Armed Forces drive into you is nonexistent. Admittedly, Guterman's story of racism in Washington has merits, including showing the awful effects of racism and the flaws of our judicial system, but these merits do not outweigh the sheer perversity and unbelievability of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawns falling on Cedars","review":"This book had some promise in the beginning but then the writing gradually became more awkward, the characters less believable. The courtroom scenes had all the emotional tension of softly chewed gum. Character development -- just didn't happen. For those who loved this book -- congratulations for mastering probably the most challeging piece of literature you have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up, and although I enjoyed it somewhat, I was in the end disappointed. The author seemed to be trying too hard to convey too many messages (but none effectively). He deals with prejudice, post-war societal wounds, forbidden love, and murder. It seems that all these things must fall into place with some sort of deep meaning, but they never do. If you pick it up, you'll probably finish reading it just to find out what happens in the murder trial, but that's really not enough to save this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated and disappointing for Puget Sounders","review":"The only convincing parts of this yarn are about fishing.Guterson knows nothing of Japanese growers on the Sound. The letter from the Jpanese mother is as unrealistic as the description of the lack of supervision of Japanese american girls. Too politically correct to be meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Falling on Cedars","review":"It was an alright book, but the author seemed to go off and talk about things that had nothing to do with the plot line, therefore losing my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good! it was one of the first book of our book club it as an excellent choice because the story is unpredictable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Ok I know all of you \\"older\\" folk are going to be saying, \\"those dumb kids wouldn't know a good book if it smacked them in the face!\\" Personally I think this book royally bit!! I was forced to read it and make stupid and totally irrelvent comparisons between the book and some corny themes!! I feel this is a 406 page novel about absolutley nothing!! Guterson drags you threw this love sick triangle of obsession, heart break, and sex. Lets just say Guterson has got some serious issues!! I am also extremly disappointed with the ending you make me read all that and then when guterson makes me think things are getting good they start to suck again! I think this is one of those books that when you finish reading it you say \\"WHO CARES!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"In lovely Puget Sound... a spa vacation for your conscience","review":"I was taken in by the hype and bought this book. Don't do it. The writing is OK and the whodunit is fair to good, but overall this book is a dog. The characters are all wooden stereotypes: the crusty reporter with a painful past; the prim German-American housewife who's a secret sex fiend; the heroic, hardworking Japanese-Americans. This would be OK as camp, but the book takes itself very seriously. The treatment of interracial love is especially hamfisted. The love scenes were so embarrassingly voyeuristic I could hardly get through them, and I'm not usually squeamish.So save your money, unless you are a suburban matron who still doesn't know about the tragedy of Japanese internment during WWII. In that case, you will get to wallow pleasantly in guilt (keep your mind on the scenery!) and have it all washed away in the end, in less than 500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"more mindless mediocrity for the mainstream","review":"This book was dull and formulaic, fit only for the truly inexperienced reader. There is nothing special about this book other than its popularity, which serves as a reminder just how intellectually undemanding our culture seems to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snowbound","review":"After eagerly starting to read this book, I found myself bitterly disappointed. I began rooting for the snowfall -- the only realistic character -- to build up around the courthouse and entomb all the characters and put me out of my misery. It's as if the author took all his research on fishing, the northwest and strawberries, threw a little literary fiction spin on it and slung it against his computer screen. The characters were wooden. What promised to be a good story spun its wheels in the snow as Guterson jumped from love to murder to racism to prejudice. I gave up on this disaster about halfway through, angry for having wasted a single second on it. If this is the sort of drivel that wins awards and becomes a major movie, then there's hope for all writers. Mr. Guterson, go back to your day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Devoid of humor, mired in minutia","review":"I found the book hopelessly grim, awash in meaningless trivia and description. It read like a technical manual distributed during a funeral ceremony.The \\"mystery\\" was dull -- I could have cared less what happened to any of the characters -- and the Japanese internment was a canard thrown in to add poignancy where none existed.A joyless, plodding book. Pass me an aspirin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserving but not for everyone","review":"Don't Don't Don't read this book for the plot--because there really isn't much of one. YOu could really summarize the key points of the story in about three sentences(I don't want to spoil the book by doing it). While others reviewers have stated that the book is rich in characters, I would tend to disagree. I found the characters stale,very one-dimensional and totally predictable. Especially Hatsue, who had no personality whatsoever.The saving grace of this book is the atmosphere, Guterson is clearly from this area and truly brings it alive for the reader. However, my last negative :)--it's not for weak readers, the language is dense and hard to get through at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love with in a Trial","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars is one of the best novels I've ever read: romance, mystery, forgiveness, betrayal, and fighting. Guterson is a very talented writer. You can imagine everything so perfectly. I especially loved how he writes the ending. He gives the story a little twist. He puts the fate of the defendant's life on his wife's first love. This is definitely a book, that every page you turn you're in for a new surprise. I recommend this to readers who love to be challenged. You have to follow this book closely to see how every little detail ties in together. I enjoyed being challenged when reading this book, and i hope you will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Very good tale touching themes that Americans not always like to face, such as prejudice against immigrants, who ultimately built this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written novel.","review":"Compelling narrative with interesting characters, fantastic descriptions, and lessons about the human spirit. The book slowly unfolds, but you won't be in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.C. hype leaves everything to be desired...","review":"I had \\"heard\\" that the book was an excellent must read. I was disappointed not only by the slowness of the story itself, but by the redundancy of the text. He has many descriptions which I felt were goobledegook attempting to hide a weak story. The book could easily have been 100 pages with nothing lost. Guterson seemed detached from his characters, a writer merely describing thoughts, feeling, emotions etc. which made me feel detached from the characters, as well as the story. It's interesting to see how one good review can often times illicit an emperor's new clothes mentality. There are so many excellent books out there, this is not one I would have spent valuable time reading had I read an accurate review. I finished it because I had high hopes it would improve based on inaccurate word of mouth and reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"good writing from a mediocre writer","review":"Difficult to get into. Clear, fully formed characters. Well constructed plot. However, somehow it all falls flat. It left me longing for three books that easily surpass this one on three levels: The Perfect Storm: on the topic of life and death at sea; Serpentine: fulfilling the page-turning murder mystery catagory, and A Prayer for Owen Meany: for SUPERIOR construction of historical plot and character strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first, but becomes quite engrossing","review":"Had to read the book for school was very slow in developing, but after a number of chapters, passions in the novel become evident and the novel finishes quickly. I thought on it for a long time afterwards"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow start,rich emotion and description, a bit slow","review":"I bought this book because of the Pen/Faulkner stamp on the cover, expecting something incredible. I was disappointed. The first three-four (I lost track) chapters drag on endlessly. While emotions are beautiful and memories vivid, most of the book takes place in numerous flashbacks, interspaced with tedious courtroom scenes. I have to say I'm glad for the human insight, but expected tofind it framed more interestingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"I picked up this book because I heard all the hoopla. But it was terrible -- and alarming that the breed of American novelists that confuse \\"subtle\\" with \\"saying nothing\\" is growing. I'd rather be thrown into that goddamn strawberry patch and die a agonizing death than have to pick up that book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dull book","review":"Quite why this book has been talked about so much is beyond me.It has to rate amongst the most dull books I've read this year. If a book is going to be this tedious I expect to get some payoff in terms of learning something about humanity but sadly this is not the case.The formula seems to consist of an basic, unintriging detective story which could be told in about 10 pages broken up with page after page of dreary character description. This would be OK if you could care less about any of the characters but you can't. They all seem so mundane. Why do I need to know about the in's and out's and then some of the police deputies reaction to a seeing a corpse. It's not like the author has any real insight into it anyway.I came away with the feeling that the author was trying so hard to be thought of as serious that he just comes up as pretentious. Yes he can write but I question the importance (and definately the interest) of what he has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot and Character Take a Snow Day","review":"Alright, so the novel started out promising. Hissing courtroom heaters, impending doom, and all that snow. But then.... If you love snow, then this is the novel for you. If you're more interested in character and plot development then I suggest something else. Before long I realized that I was reading a sappy romance novel; a Harlequin without the steamy sex. The moral dilemma facing the narrator arrives suddenly, about two-thirds of the way through this slushy novel, and seems forced. It's as if Guterson's first draft was sent back from his editor with a note saying: \\"Add something interesting. Anything. Please! \\" And so he tried. And so he failed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One To Remember","review":"This book was well written. It was very vivid and intense. It showed the part of World War II that many of us would like to forget. The Japanese being forced in to camps and how they dealt with that. The small town was torn apart between feeling of the Japanese-Americans. It shows how a small town slowly recovers and begins to heal from the horrors of war. It was a hard book to read but stretched my vocabulary and imagination. It was a book that I enjoyed reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet book with propelling force.","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars was a gentle book written with astrong hand, a hand that could control each word so thatthe grim seem unthinkable. My 'favorite' scene was thecamp. Guterson bluntly showed the living conditions,the reader feeling the humiliation of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"deeply fascinating story and realistic daily life","review":"I am really fascinated by Gutterson's depiction of every day's life, especially in the flashback of Ishmel's relationship with his forbidden boyhood girlfriend. Also the hardship faced by the Japanese-American during and even after World war II. The interwoven story between Present days and flashback is highly commendable. Congratulations to David Gutterson on his magnificient novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"David Guterson's descriptions of a gill-netter'saloneness, of the scent of a strawberry field, andof the feel of fog delighted me. Snow Fallingon Cedars is a good read about Washington Stateand historical events about which I was ignorant.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Year's Best","review":"I was entrigued by both the cover and ideas of this novel. As a lover of History, I found the topic of the treatment of the Japanese Americans during World War II especially moving. Add Guterson's amazing control of language and his sheer devotion to writing, and you've got one of the best books I have ever read. Snow Falling on Cedars is one of those books you'll want to read countless times, as it is an exhilarating and heart-warming tale of love and betrayal and an investigation of the human soul. It's a great first novel for a writer who is undoubtedly one of the best the world has ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Snow Falling On Cedars all its cracked up to be?","review":"Well,my first impressions of the novel were quite good. The first chapter was interesting and innovative, because the courtcase provided a thrill with mounting tension. However, i found that as the novel went on it got boring, it studied issues about race which is important but then changed to another subject. The flashbacks in this novel were unclear one second you are in the future then you go to the past then it changes immediately to the present. so all in all i think the novel was a bit of a let down, especially after i had seen the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Sucky book","review":"I think that this book was way too long and it wasnt even that good. It was very shady and talked about thinks that dosent even make any sense what so ever. There was definitly no reason for the scene where the poor man got his penis head shot off. Also, I think there were too many sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"what an awful book-please stop praising it","review":"I'm all in favor of giving zero stars. Amazon, please could you make this an option. I am not a japanese-american, but i cannot imagine that this book could be thought of as a good recommendation for a history class! None of the characters are developed to any significant degree and i could not interest myself in it enough to even think of reading it again. I'm surprised that i even made it to the end of the book-it was difficult, i assure you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-altering book","review":"I was so moved by this book. I had always known what was done to the people of Japanese ancestry during WWII, but this really book really brought home to me what it must have been like for ordinary people. The book also works very well as a murder mystery, with suspense up until the very end. I loved the characters, who seemed like real people with the descriptions of their histories and daily lives. This was the best book I had read since Stones From the River."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done many times before","review":"Coming to this site, I am pleased to see that my opinion about this book doesn't stand alone. I don't see why this book has received the accolades it has. The plot itself is manageable enough, but I think that the writer's style was deliberate and slow to the point where I felt he became TOO conscious of his technique, and this became apparent on paper. It wasn't until I was already 150 pages into the book that I determined that I had read too much to simply toss it aside, and that for the sake of the Pen/Faulkner award it garnered, I should try to read it to completion. Now I wonder why I did. I guess the love story was compelling/sad in that manufactured kind of way, but this coupled with the author's contrived style ( of long, rambling descriptions) made it all feel a bit too force-fed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical racial law novel","review":"The book had a common theme. A trial over the murder of a well liked man in a small town with racial prejudices and historical accuracy. Yes. It did teach something, but not something new and thought provoking. I was required to read this book for english, and I have to ask, for what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A piercing, evocative novel about far more than just murder.","review":"I reluctantly picked up this book at the library, mostly because the cover was pretty and I only had two minutes to get to class. Both of my parents had read it, and immediately told me it was \\"the most boring book ever.\\" But I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book is much more than a courtroom drama - it is a beautiful manuscript that examines the psyches of all of its protagonists just as deeply as it examines the murder trial of Kabuo Miyamoto, a character we see from both sides of the spectrum, thanks to Guterson's alternating narratives - and it is this understanding that keeps us is wonder until the very last sentence. This has a lot of symbolism and post-war pain lurking behind the eloquent wording, a feeling you'll find yourself experiencing as well. I would definitely recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong emotional grip","review":"I thought this book was just great. I cant describe how tied into this book i was. Guterson has beautiful narrative techniques in this book and has a wonderful way of bringing in the realities of the of the racism, japenese internment camps, WWII and brings in the feelings of all these characters. It really made me feel for the characters and has an emotional grip on anyone that reads it. I think the fact that a high school student like me, enjoyed this book and its literary importance is definatly proof that its a great book. It has a mixture of a mystery, love and graphic images. I suggest this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something For Everyone","review":"Intriguing, vivid, well written - three terms I would use to describe the mystery-romance novel, Snow falling On Cedars by David Guterson. Although the story moves slowly at times, the twists in the plot keep your attention and cause you to read on wondering what will happen next. Suspense builds up gradually as the plot moves on making the novel interesting. The characters have complex lives and personalities and truly come to life as Guterson describes them. They struggle with moral dilemmas as well as social and physical tribulations. Snow Falling On Cedars contains love triangles, war, and a murder trial which will keep any reader interested. On a deeper level, the book deals with Japanese Internment Camps and the issue of racism. I enjoyed reading this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye-opening..","review":"I read this book for my Fiction class last year, and I had a hard time getting into it. Once I was able to pass through the details and finally \\"meet\\" all the characters, I was hooked. I never considered myself one interested in history, but this story showed me a glimpse of what life was like for those Japanese-Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was amazing","review":"This book deserved all the hype and awards, for a first novel it was beautifully and sensitively written. The imagery was amazing and the characters seemed alive enough to walk right out of the book. Snow Falling On Cedars combined drama, love, war, small town values and prejudices like no other I have read. I know some people who have had a hard time geting into it but it is worth the effort to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful novel","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars is one of the most beautful books I have ever read. The imagery used paints a picture so clearly you can smell and taste every detail. It is beautifully written, and is a must read, more for the way it is written if not for the plot. I am 16 years old, and I loved this book. It is put together amazingly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitively written book","review":"This was an incredibly well-written novel of forbidden love,tragic death, racical disharmony and prejudice set on a small islandduring WW2.It follows the lives of two high school sweethearts, Hatsue and Ishmael, abruptly torn apart by the events of WW2...What I found extrememly interesting was the historic content surrounding the events of WW2, especially the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the resultant prejudice against Japanese Americans and their treatment by white Americans during this period.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but did find the ending less than satisfying - however, this did not detract from my overall enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Falling on Cedars","review":"I listened to the audio book. This story somewhat confusing and the narrator's voice was loud, then soft, then loud, then soft. I had a hard time getting into it and I found the end to be dissappointing. Nothing was really solved or summed up. I would not reccommend this tape to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome, overrated","review":"After a while I just got bored with the endless and pointless biographies of every character that do nothing but interrupt the flow of the book. The love story was obvious, and after a while I just didn't care about the murder mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are so many readers dumping on this book?","review":"While I don't believe that Snow Falling on Cedars is the great American novel, I certainly had a fine time reading it. It was easily my favorite read of the summer and one that I will continue to recommend to others. I actually look forward to read his second novel. Sorry for spoiling the attack party!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Falling on Cedars was enjoyable and kept my attention.","review":"I would definitely recommend Snow Falling on Cedars by David Gutterson to anyone who loves a complex murder mystery. This novel is filled with realistic courtroom scenes, multiple flashbacks, and intriguing characters that kept me reading. Snow Falling on Cedars is one of those books you'll love to finish reading just to see how it ends. Though some might say it was long, I enjoyed reading it because everything was well described and I never had any question as to what was going on. As I said, the book was filled with flashbacks. In the beginning, I was a little leery as to where the book was heading for it kept going back in time, but after the first few chapters you get use all of this. Personally, I thought the book was excellent and encourage anyone, who is able to, to read Snow Falling on Cedars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but a worthy read.","review":"Vivid character and setting development are what makes this novel worthy of your attention. True, as my forebears have mentioned here, the 'whodunit' plot is somewhat weak and predictable. Guterson, in as far as using the court room as a vehicle to tell his story, did nothing to enrich the increasingly bloated library of contemporary legal thrillers. But, to his credit, the author seemed more concerned with carrying on a dialogue with the reader through his able characters about humankind. In this capacity, Gusterson was most successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MADE FOR CHUBBY BABIES!!!!","review":"I purchased this baby carrier for my 4 month old, 20 pound baby. It was too stuffy and not enought rooM for my baby's belly."},{"rating":"1","title":"My hips suffered ...","review":"This carrier is very bulky, cumbersome to put on, and uncomfortable for me (5'2\\") to wear. I used it as hip carrier to carry my 24 lb son around the block. By the time we got home, I was barely able to walk. My hips were numb and sore. When used as front carrier, it was okay, but it still can't beat Baby Bjorn for comfort. I haven't used it as back carrier, but I'm sure I will have to have other person to help load my son in it, which is not an option for running error to the store. Come to think of it, I think I will return this carrier and get regular hip carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars!!","review":"This carrier is AWFUL - it is difficult to put on/wear. The buckles are confusing. The carrier itself is bulky and cumbersome. I hated it and returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Very clear explanation of an advanced organometallic chemistry. There are many new citations and schemes. In addition, almost each reaction is written with mechanism! Very good price. Its hardcover, but the book is not so heavy like other hard cover books, so you can read it in a bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Addition to the Series","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Legion Series so far and this is my favorite of the series. The basis of this novel is the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which has always been a fascinating subject.The politics of the Confederation and the continuation of the Ramanthian threat was excellent. Continuing with the theme of including Hudathan's in the Legion was very well handled in this story. My favorite character in the book was Captain Seeba-Ka.My only complaint about the book was some of the back stories, the Ramanthian plot was a good addition but the sections on the Syndicate seemed like filler to me.With that said I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the other books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"I was really excited about his collar. I loved the idea of a retractable handle, which would make it easier for me to control my dog when going out for a quick bathroom run. Although the collar appears well-constructed, it started to fray almost immediately. I am constantly trimming away loose threads. Not only is this annoying, it's shoddy workmanship. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea, but ineffective","review":"I've tried this brand in addition to a few others with the same end result: they quickly wore out and broke.This one last about 3 months before the elastic finally gave out, and it was the most solidly built one that I tried. I really wanted to use this to be able to cart my big dog from the house to his tie out cable without needing to leash him. This was great while it lasted, but it's short lifespan requires a low star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collar with a handle to guide your dog","review":"We order the bamboo quick control collar in extra large for our 140 pound St. Bernard Mix. The collar is thick and sturdy. The hand is a nice bonus feature if you need to grab your dog quickly although sometimes the collar rotates so that the hand part is down by the dog's neck and difficult to grab. Under that handle there is a little name address tag. The adjustable collar has sturdy belt like clasp but when the collar is set on the smallest setting the left over strap has no where to go and sort of sticks up a bit. So far it seems like a nice quality collar that will last quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea","review":"This is a great idea for a collar. I loved it when I first received it. The next day I noticed the collar was starting to fray quite a bit, which continued to get worse. I finally had to throw it out after about a week. I'm not sure if this was a fluke or not. I have an English Mastiff, who is a large lazy dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not very robust","review":"My 7 month old dog plays with the neighbor's 75 lb Malmute / wolf puppy and somehow they managed to chew this collar off! This didn't happen with my dog's previous collar, which was a cheap 1 inch collar purchased at Ross's dress for less. It's a good design idea, really helps to control your pet with gentle guiding when a leash isn't handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Raise Any Cain For Me","review":"John Lithgow is a decent actor who has made good acting roles before but this is a bit of a strech for a man of his talent. In this over the top and viloent film about a pair of twin brothers who will stop at nothing to procure children for their father's scientific experements. Lithgow has all the attentin in a moronic script that is somewhat similar to Hitchcock or even Welles. Laced with blood and Chills this film doesn't add up to much. Best scene was when Lithgow keeps changing his mutiple personalties to hide his guilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"i give this movie 2 stars for the acting of john lithgow but the whole movie is a ZERO","review":"mr. de palama is once again raiding the grave of hitchcock to make yet another slick(or sick if you like) thriller where if you think about the idea for long you can see the whole movie come apart.this is bottom of the barrel film making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Directing...Can not be compared to Hitchcock!","review":"I don't understand all of these great reviews. This movie was awful. Lithgow doesn't at all seem derranged or scary. There was only one scary part to the whole movie....Terrible, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, silly, and unbelievable","review":"I agree with the review below by Steven that says this is the worst Brian DePalma film ever. The plot is completely ridiculous. The cinametography is distracting and takes away from what's going on. And the action isn't really all that much fun to watch. It's just gory and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TRAILER'S GREAT BUT THE MOVIE AINT","review":"John Lithgow was great in the film but the other characters were so insipid, vapid and stupid that by the end of the movie you were praying for the serial killer to wipe them all out in a painful and greusome fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinson Fulfillment Services","review":"The price was unbelievable at $2.90 and I received to book 2 days after I ordered it!

Fast and easy purchase and delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed: Lacks practical application","review":"This was my first Kay Arthur book. I am comparing it to the impact Philip Yancey's and Max Lucado's books had on me. I even listened 2-3 times through to make sure I wasn't missing something. I gained no deeper perspective of covenant with God, nor was I able to glean anything from the tapes to make 'practical application' in my life. Most disturbing was her reference to Jesus Christ going to hell after the crucifixion. This is just not true. Christ did not 'descend to Hell' to pay any 'debt' we owed. It was all finished on the cross, thusly He proclaimed, \\"Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!\\". Also, the gospel of John records Jesus as saying, \\"It is finished\\". I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Going back to before the series as we know it began and getting history on some of the characters gives the book another dimension. This book would be interesting reading in and of itself, but as an avid fan of the Midnight Louie series, I was thrilled. I can wait to read the remaining three from the beginning of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, great fun and fast moving.","review":"I have all of Carole Nelson Douglas Midnight Louie and Irene books.

No both of these bulbs are HIGHLY faulty. Neither filament has burned out but the bulbs have both stopped conducting already each within 2 weeks after starting use of them. Neither works in any light fixture in my house.They were on roughly 10 hours per day, when you consider the fact that prior to using these lights I only changed his heat bulb once every 3 or so months.

NEVER buying these \\"European quality for longer burn life\\" bulbs again, they are crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality.","review":"Did not last long at all and I did not use it 24/7.

In this instance I was not. This has to be the lowest quality bulb I have ever purchased. I bought it because the price seemed very attractive and now I know why.

It worked just long enough not to be able to return it...too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"This is a joke, right? I received the bulb, and within a few hours after installation, it was broken. The glass bulb had broken off of the metal fixture. I emailed the company 2 times (once via amazon and once directly to the company) to complain and ask for a refund, and I have received two email replies from the Mail Delivery Subsystem saying that my email was being ignored.

The other great thing about it is that it uses the original rules and values, now considered to be the \\"Classic\\" Monopoly. The newer Monopoly boards bought in a place like Walmart or Target are cheap, and the rules are slightly changed along with a couple of things on the board. They also fold in 4 instead of in half, which I feel diminishes the quality of the board as it requires it to be cut halfway through, throwing off the balance. You must instead look for the \\"Classic\\" edition which costs 3 times the price(You get what you pay for). The Peanuts version is not the cheap one, it is bi-folding like the Classic set and a great buy for any collector or Peanuts fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Peanuts game.","review":"Just like regular Monopoly, with fun Peanuts twists with every roll of the dice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple wireless security walkthrough","review":"I've read a number of books on wireless security. None have made it as plain and simple as this one. Even though the title says AirPort the text covers any wireless router.

A must buy for anyone looking for easy and practical walkthrough of basic wireless network security."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will suit almost everyone","review":"This little book provides a lot of information. Basically, it provides a simple walk-through of installing and setting up a wireless network.It starts by comparing old and new Airport base stations, Airport Extreme, Airport Express and non-Apple stations. It then goes on to guide you, step by step, through setting up a simple network, securing it and installing a shared printer.The book progresses to more complex tasks such as connecting to your ISP by broadband or dial-up connection, configuring DHCP and Panther Internet sharing, printer sharing and how to map individual computers and ports onto private networks without causing disruption to your ISP's network.It covers the use of base stations as repeaters and how to set up networks with wired backbones.The book covers 99% of what users want. However, I can only give it four stars because I seem to be one of the other 1%.

Don't read this book if you don't want the truth being told. And don't get this book if your thinking on becoming a JW. This will bring you to Christ the Biblical way without the JW faith.This is one amazing book by some people who stopped reading the handed magazines by the JWS and starting reading the bible for themselves. They converted to Christianity and found Jesus the Bible way. I don't know them and I'm not affiliated with them accept that we love Jesus also. And know who Jesus is. This book will shed light on the truth about the Watchtower movement, the followers and the stuff they don't want you to know. Its powerful get it, its a must read for anyone.

I would have preferred a shorter version for home use, but I'll take this over the flimsy rack we had previously. My only gripe is that some of the bolts needed for assembly were screwed in too tightly. I finally had to use channel locks to grab the head of the bolts to loosen them so as not to strip the head. The holes on one bracket were slightly misaligned; I had to enlarge them slightly so I could get the bolt to screw in.

A hundred dollars wasted!I will never again buy any electronics made by Magnavox. I always believed that when you buy cheap you get cheap. This was no exception.

Sad to say this, the only first-person account of the band, from drummer Nick Mason, is not exactly a page-turner. The only interest to me was the wealth of previously unseen photgraphs. The text is another matter. As dry as the British sense of humour has ever been, oh so dull and with nary a whiff of kiss and tell or anything truly relevatory. Details are passed over in such a way that leads the reader to believe Mason didn't want to step on any toes or betray any loyalties. There is a terrific Floyd story to be told, I am sure of that. This, however, is not the place to look for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a microscope to read the text!","review":"This would have been a great book if they had made it into a larger format and made the text legible!

I think a lot of the people reviewing this book are forgetting that it was put together by a rock and roll drummer. The book may not go terribly deep into the psychological nuonces of the group, but it sure does lay out one hell of a collection of images for you to make what you will of their career. This book is kind of like looking through Nick Mason's photo album and reading captions he wrote to remind himself of what was going on in the pictures. The text won't let you in on the stuff you would've missed by not being there, but the photos give you a glimpse of his memories and experiences. Don't treat this book as a Pink Floyd biography, it's best viewed as a giant booklet included in a giant box set, the box set being Pink Floyd's entire musical career (which most people buying this book probably already own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I purchased this item for my son who has been a Pink Flyod/Waters fan since high school.

Excellent Pictures.!","review":"Nick Mason's \\"Inside Out\\" is a nice history of the band with excellent pictures and written in a personal yet professional manner which makes it an enjoyable read. Although, I think there are a few better written books out there most notably \\"Saucearful of Secrets\\" and \\"In the Flesh\\" this book is a very close third and definately worth picking up if you are a Pink Floyd fan. The pictures do make the book the best from a photograph/story point of view and Nick comes accross as very astute even if just a little guarded. It's nice and very thick so its worth the money.

Nick is the only member who was in the band from start to finish(?) so I respect his perspective. He certainly doesn't gloss over the more tempestuous moments in the band's history (i.e. Syd Barrett's departure and the infamous schism in the 80s) but he's extremely diplomatic and even-handed so those looking for the juicy details are bound to be disappointed. The book is more a celebration of the band and on that level it suceeds marvelously. Nick is an excellent writer (assuming he wrote it all himself) and a sharp, witty guy. All that would be enough for me but it must be said the pictures alone are worth the price. This is a large, luscious volume that I enjoyed a lot. I only wish Nick hadn't let the other Floyd members add their revisions; this contributes the heavily \\"authorized\\" feel of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Pink Floyd fans must have it....","review":"The day I knew that Nick Mason was lauched this book I bought it....It is a beautiful book, with lots of photos and the viewpoint of Nick Mason about the history of Pink Floyd.

Exit being the term pre-eminent in economics: when a product is too expensive or not good enough, the customers silently walk out. Voice belongs to politics: its about interacting to change something that is not liked. Loyalty stands for a delay of exit on the expectation that at least someone will invoke voice to change something.Much existing socio-economic theory - well, as of 1970 - is included in the discussion. The result is a lively reframing of theories in these three basic concepts which helps to detach these theories from their original formulations and thus to activate their vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple but powerful theory","review":"Hirschman's Exit, Loyalty, Voice theory is incredibly simple but also incredibly powerful. In a way, this book does a disservice to the theory because it focuses largely on its application to firms and consumer markets.

Kell was adorable and funny enough as usual but the story was flat. There were few laughs, it's obvious that it was shot with a cheaper quality camera, the acting was so so but we'll just blame that on the script.

Believe in the only true God. Jehovah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really dosen't matter. Man decides his/her own faith.","review":"The book is interesting and well written, however ,I was looking for an understanding of fundamentalist views. Instead I find entertainment. Religions are inheritly good. It teaches ethics and morals. The problem is man cannot control himself. He distorts and manipulates religion for his own greed. The result has made religion a poison in society. It has brought life pain and nothing more. If you believe in God, living lies you created from the Koran or Bible, then expect to be punished. All suicide bombers(or murderers), greed driven men and abusers of the innocence of earth will be punished. Me I'm an atheist and don't really care. It's just sad people kill each other over dirt and a God that allows you to suffer. This book will convice you of man as a hopeless case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good read","review":"This book is a good read for those of us alien to Islam.

But what it covers it does well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Fraud?","review":"The answer to the three questions raised by the title of the book are 1) Islam is the only true religion, therefore Islam will conquer all other religions 2) American power will diminish since all civilizations rise and fall (Rome, Greece, Persia, etc) 3) Allah's predictions will soon come to pass since we live in the \\"Last Days\\".There are in the book interesting sections on Islamic religious and philosophical schools through the centuries, and the various sects of Islam; also a short section on Muhammad (not a man to cross!).However, if you are looking to buy this book based on the title, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but somewhat faulty","review":"The book is very interesting and I learned much about the history and development of Islam as a world religion. I totally disagree that the United States will fall apart like the Soviet Union. Obviously the author has not studied the history of the US or totally rejects how we became the nation that we are. To even suggest that the states will secede like the breakup of the Soviet Union is fantasy based on his own interpretation. But overall, the book suggests that it is written by God. Other religions say more or less the same as Islam but who does know the truth? Clearly God has not spoken to anyone lately and if he has, who would believe them? I recommend the book but only as an insight into a great religion. Other than that, a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Duh-wayne Follick","review":"In case you don't know (which obviously you don't) \\"Reviewing a book\\" means you actually have to read it first.Nice try at intellectualism though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort Music 2","review":"I bought this CD after having purchased 2 others from the same series.

Omerta comes close to indulging the reader into the suspense of the underworld. However, the indulgence is short lived due to many twists in the story that can confuse some readers, not only that but the twists themselves seem too coincidental that it degrades the overall \\"underworld mystery\\" that is taking place. Overall, however, I really enjoyed the story, it keeps you on the edge of your seat one minute while describing a romantic love scene the next. The feel of the story as a whole felt very much like a combined Godfather and Last Don. This story makes a decent ending to a wonderful series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another irritating book from Puzo","review":"This is Puzo's third sell of a tired and worn out story line, a mafia family trying to go straight. The characters are larger than life as always is the case in a Puzo novel and the dialog is corny. This book is a complete waste of paper. The only time Puzo's work can stand up is when Francis Ford Coppola salvages it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Read!","review":"This book could not possibly been written by the author of The Godfather! The dialog was juvenile; the plot trite and the characters totally unlikable, unremarkable and amoral. Really, Mario Puzo could not possible have penned this piece of garbage.

It is 316 double spaced pages of cliches and poorly developed characters. The main plot and various subplots defy belief and, if Puzo's name was not on the book, I would have thought that the book were the work of a first time author. There is none of the subtle color or detailed character development that have characterized Puzo's prior books or screenplays. Major figures in the book are introduced with just a line or two and Puzo rarely goes back to fill in the blanks. This book left me very unsatisfied and wishing the Puzo had not written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omerta","review":"This book reads more like an outline than a novel.The characters are scketchy at best and the story is very weak.It was as if Mr.Puzo knew he was running out of time and couldn't flesh out the book.Someone should take the book and finish it and it might be a passable novel.Save your money wait for the movie.It might be the only time a movie is more developed than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but a bit short ...","review":"As an avid fan of all the Godfather movies/book, The Last Don etc I was thrilled to see the newest Mario Puzo book.

The story kept my attention all the way through. It is filled with action and suspense, and it's loaded with interesting characters. Puzo drills home that Omerta is the code of silence that is enforced. However preventing betrayal proves difficult for the Don as the story moves back and forth from New York to the early times of Sicily. It's a great story not as good as The Godfather, but still great and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian Tradition","review":"This is a great Mafia novel about the Italian honor. Mafia and honor, sometimes its difficult as outsiders to understand the code of the Mafia. All of the great stories like this one illustrate the respect of tradition, familial ties and honor, but they also include murder, treachery and merciless vengeance.Puzo tells the story of a don's family and their struggle to survive after his assaination. And as usual he does a fantastic job of drawing in the reader into another great tale of Mafia family and obligations. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After having just finished The Godfather, I looked forward to reading Puzo's last novel. What a disappointment!None of the (way too many) characters are very likeable. The plot, if you can call it that, is both unbelievableand hard to follow. I finally had to give it up about a third of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"4-1/2 stars if I could","review":"Great escapism. Stylish and well crafted, Omerta is a top-notch paperback if you want to read a different type of mob / crime book.Puzo does an incredible job with the main character, a boy with true mafioso genes who is secretly trained in his youth to be a protector for a mob family trying to become legitemate. Puzo's description of the boy's character is very insightful and believable. He is the most favorable mob figure since Don Corleone, perhaps more so.The story is very good, but it's Puzo's ability to create believable characters that steals the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment but lack in substance","review":"This book is great for pleasure reading. It is the first book I read by Mario Puzo, and it got me busy turning the pages. However, when I finished the book, I felt like something was missing.

That's what I'm planning to read next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altogether too snappy","review":"Did Puzo write this? Most of its chapters read like summaries of action, not like stories. I felt like it was on fast forward most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzo's farewell novel is a winner","review":"This thrilling tale of Mafia connections, intrigue and revenge is a fine coda to the author's work of powerful families and complicated and contradictory weavings of people, law enforcement agencies and organized crime. Avenging a hit on a retired Don is the plot and sinister forces are at work to convince a nephew of the late patriarch to sell the family's interests in banks to powerful mafiosos and drug dealers. The FBI and the NYPD are portrayed none too favorably as they try play off the influential Aprile family against the powerful Portella family and South American drug cartel members who also have diplomatic immunity. This novel cannot compare to \\"The Godfather\\" but is nonetheless an interesting read by a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book bad epilogue","review":"It is an excellent book, here you can see how does the Mafia works, how does the FBI works to fight the Mafia and how could be corrupted the police by the Mafia, the end before the epilogue is very good, you could never imagine that end, but I took off one star just for the epilogue, is the worst epilogue I ever read, if you read this book, just DON'T read the epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality Puzo Book","review":"I can't believe this is the same author who wrote Godfather. The writing is weak and filled with cliche's. Very implausible, mildy interesting, ridiculous characters. None of the characters in this book seem real, the author did a poor job creating them. Mostly they are super characters able to do everything (the mark of a poor writer) or are just immoral and boring. The women are all [prostitute]..., the men are all tough, blah, blah. This is the kind of work I'd expect from Puzo if he were 14.

Margaret Mitchell b. Harper Lee c. Mario Puzo Answer: c. Mitchell and Lee, each having written her magnum opus and realizing the small odds of ever producing another book to measure up to the first, wisely did not try. Puzo, on the other hand, has tried repeatedly to recapture the magic he possessed while penning The Godfather. I've read two of his efforts: The Fourth K and Omerta.

I read this book in under three days, but I was disappointed with it. The characters were too one-dimensional and the romance sub-plot was terrible along with the climax and ending which I thought came out of a cheap action film. What was Puzo thinking?? This book does not possess character depth necessary to make the story compelling. Its merely a shallow story that is predictable and not worthy of a premier writer. Its as if this was written to be a tv show with no character development. I had no trouble putting this book down. I could hardly believe I was reading a Puzo novel, it read more like a first attempt e-book. This book does not even compare to The Godfather or The Last Don. I must say I was very disappointed. It seemed like I was watching a cheap mob movie. As a big Puzo fan, I could tell that there was something lacking when he wrote this. I'm not saying I'm an expert, granted, I'm only sixteen, but really, he could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"On top with Puzo's best","review":"I don't understand why they are giving such a low rating to this wonderful book (less then 5 stars when this review was written!!!). I give it a five stars best! Puzo is a master and this book shows all of his skills. The hook is on the reader as he turns page 1. It is Puzo's last book and the end of the great Sicilian stories of the century. Omerta (which by the way is the Sicilian code of silence) is as breath taking as the Godfather and it even goes deeper into the Mafia world of terminology and its culture. It stands right beside the Godfather and The Last Don. On top, with Puzo's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Page Turner","review":"I have read most of Mario Puzo's books and this is one of his least satisfying.

It reads like a Puzo pastiche, and I have a strong feeling that, as this was Puzo's last book, it was finished (if not significantly ghosted throughout) by someone else.

Not recommended-- read anything else by Puzo first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzo Has It Till the End","review":"Omerta is the second Puzo novel I've read.

The fact is, it's just a bad book, and even The Fourth K is better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"\\"Omerta\\" is an unfortunate jumble of characters, tedious plot lines and lazy writing. The largely unoriginal mafia intrigue is appealing on some easy-reading level, but mostly everything about this book is phony, overwrought and dull. The most disappointing thing to me, a first-time Puzo reader, was that the characters did not have histories so much as they had stage personas. The smooth, calculating hero who can't bring himself to kill women. The vicious South American druglord who has the morals of a spider. The happy-go-lucky hitmen twin brothers who live like underworld yuppies but meet a terrible end. Trite, trite, trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Letdown.","review":"Maybe the realism of the Sopranos coupled with the actual decline of the mafia makes this book seem so very unimportant. The writing itself is pitched at the average fourth grader and Puzo is the master of using the trite expression.The world view put forth is that everyone but everyone is crooked on this planet so by the time you put the book down you are exhausted with the duplicity. Frankly, if you MUST read this book either go to the library or wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a good editor and rewrite","review":"After Mario Puzo died, he left Omerta as an unfinished novel. It is given to us in a largely unfinished form. With lots of inconsistencies and repetitive phrases, the book could have been at least polished by a good editor. The estate would have been well served to have hired a writer to develop the characters, now just flat 2-dimensional caricatures. The plotting is servicable and at times quite exciting. The novel could have lived up to promise had Puzo been alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzo?","review":"I'll never believe Mario Puzo wrote this story. I know he was severly ill for months before he died. I tend to think someone else wrote this story from Puzo's outline and drafts. The story is so weak, it's just not Puzo. I'm upset that I paid $25 for it! I kept reading and saying to myself that it was going to get better, but it never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"The souls of black folks you need to read you definitely need to read it's really good, read the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"This is cheaply made. You get what you paid for. I bought hoping to use it to add a little air into my motorcycle and car tires. The first time I used it was to add some air into my sister's suv tires before we went on a trip. The pumping didn't bother me as I expect to pump a lot, but the cylinder pop off of the base a few times as I was doing this. By the time I was pumping the 4th tire, an audible leak developed at the base of the hose where it connects to the wire.I probably try the more expensive sturdier look pumps available on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered new pump, Amazon shipped used pump.","review":"I ordered a new tire pump, and received the shipment on time. But when I opened the box, there was a tire pump without factory packaging or a content list or a set of instructions. I lifted the pump out of the box and noticed the dirt on my hands. The product label on the tire pump was worn. I realized this was a used pump that Amazon sent me. This was unbelievable to me. How could their shipping department have sent me a used pump? The only packing material to protect the pump in shipping was a sheet of brown kraft paper. I might understand if this was the busy holiday season, but it is the middle of January.The pump itself might be in excellent working order. This review is to show my disappointment in the shipping from an Amazon warehouse. I wanted to make potential purchasers of this pump aware that they might be sent a used pump instead of a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars, I would","review":"First use - perfect. Second use - destroyed. What a waste of money! I'd send it back but I already tossed the package. Buyer beware: the bottom plastic can crack (very easily) when you're pumping and after that, this is only god for the garbage can because all of the air comes out of the bottom of this thing instead of into the tire. I even tried duct tape - nope...the pressure is too high for the tape to seal it. Save your money and fill up at a gas station or service station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After 3 Tires","review":"Do not buy. I was afraid of purchasing after reading mixed reviews and will be sending back to Amazon for return. Can tell cheap manufacture, do not recommend and no gauge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"adequate","review":"I looked for a product which was \\"Made in USA\\" and found this one.It does pump car tires, but otherwise is somewhat disappointing.As delivered, the cylinder is not well secured to the baseplate, sothat routine use can pull it out, if you are not careful. It isnot hard to push it back together, but I'd rather not need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on first try","review":"This is a terrible product. It broke the first time I tried to use it; the bottom cracked, letting the air escape, and rendering it useless. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"good pump","review":"use this pump all the time no problem,good flow of air,good quality.can even pump enough air in car tire to get you going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud of a product","review":"It makes a popping sound when the metal tube separates from the plastic base it is inserted into, under 20 PSI of pressure.I don't understand how those other people could have given this a product good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letters from Cicely","review":"First of all, let me confess; I have not watched Northern Exposure. I've heard friends and family rave about how awesome it is, but since it never comes on TV (anyone know a channel it comes on? Please leave info in the comments) and the DVDs are expensive, I haven't seen it. Hope I can soon!At first, the book was a little confusing because it consists only of outgoing letters - we never see replies though often we understand them because of later letters. It took me a while to get who was who, especially since occasionally someone would sign a different name (i.e. Maggie, Mary, Margaret).But despite some confusion, I quickly found myself getting to know and liking these very eccentric characters! It reminded me a lot of family stories about Alaska, and made me want to hop a plane to go there! This is a hilarious, light read, with lovable, laughable characters. I think most Northern Exposure fans will enjoy it and even those who haven't seen the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very disappointing.","review":"I was so excited to get this book! I thought: at last, new adventures with my favorite characters! What a disappointment. Not only is the premise ridiculous, but the characters are written as caricatures of themselves. Joel is only barely recognizable; do you really think he would close a letter with \\"Yours in Chutzpah!\\"??? Would Chris end a note with \\"Supremely Conscious\\"??? Please. Don't hit us over the head with it! Another irritant is the fact that whenever Joel, Maurice, or Holling sends a letter to a place of business, the personal address reads \\"Gentlemen.\\" The Northern Exposure series was always exploring issues of gender with thoughtfulness and insight, but this book simply reiterates the cultural undertones of sexism. If you're a real Northern Exposure fan, don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letters From Cicely","review":"A must read for any Northern Exposure Fan! I thoroughly enjoyed every page. It is a shame it wasn't a script for a two hour movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Wow Cows","review":"My three year old who absolutely loves everything about cows does not like the video at all. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about over-rated","review":"just because he had some great songs in the 70's and a few in the 80's doesn't make him out to be a legend.in fact he hasn't had a good good song in almost 20 years not since lets dance.it's been mainly image.his business smarts are ahead of the turn with the music bonds but his music nowadays just lacks any kind of substance.he writes and plays instruments and is the king of image make over but that hasn't got a thing to with the music.this to me is the only thing worth owning by this artist.he is a good stage act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good songs but awful vocals.","review":"There are songs on this album that any artists would be proud to write. There are also vocals on this album that any artist would shoot himself over. Space Oddity, Starman, Heroes are all good songs, great(maybe) but Bowie\`s singing is only comparible to that of Ian Brown\`s of the Stone Roses. His seeming inhability to sing high or low notes is frustrating but why he chooses to talk himself through a song is beyong belief. He should have written the songs and sat back while someone else stood in the limelight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, Perfection Thy Name is Emily","review":"A perfect Regency! A humorous plot, great cast of characters, and the POV changes from H to h so we get both sides. Marvelously done. This novel was well-crafted. All the characters were sympathetic though I personally enjoyed Lady Sara best. I also enjoy a good dark Hero and Myles was that to the letter. While the novel was a nice length I certainly regretted that it was over as soon as it was. An epilogue would have been lovely. Highly recommended for all Regency Romance lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I loved the Price of Glory, and Blood of Heroes was a great continuation of the adventures of the Gray Death Legion. I liked the shift of main characters, going from Grayson and Lori to their son Alex, McCall, Caitalin, and DeVillar. Alex is a good character, although he's kind of a spaz in a mech, with the slugging match he takes his Archer into against a Battlemaster. Not too bright. I loved the book, and I can't wait for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter is hooked on these sewing cards","review":"These sewing cards are the absolute best quality I've seen. I bought the first set several years ago when I worked at a special education school and they were offered to us there. The set is heavy duty, contains several cards with sewing strings, and comes in a sturdy box. The colors are bright and attractive. It's such a delight to find a quality product when so many toys these days are cheap junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Amy touched on every topic a parent would have to school their child on, she took the book in sequence and did herself proud.
