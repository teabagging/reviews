It seems well-made and it sounds great. The only reason I gave it four stars on the sound was cuz I'm guessing most of us are used to having bass control, etc, and this radio doesn't have any of those kinds of bells and whistles. What it DOES have though is superb reception, better than any other radio I own, including my CC Radio (which turned out to not be such a great radio, after all, but I digress). And it runs for days and days on my rechargeable batteries (but did come with the cord to plug it in, which I use, too).My only complaint is that the am/fm switch is on the back of the unit. And actually I barely care about that.Just FYI re the color of it, it looks more tan-colored on my monitor than it does in person where it's more of a gold-tan. I like the actual color better.I love this darn radio so-o-o-o much, I'm definitely getting another one as a backup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional, but \\"vintage\\" look is cheap sticker","review":"The radio performs well and does what a radio should do, but it's highly disappointing in person.

Unlike many Bibles I've seen, the textual interpretation notes are collected at the end of each book. I prefer this, as I tend to get distracted by these notes when I'm reading. The lectionary at the end is useful for previewing the readings that will be proclaimed at Mass. The sides of the pages bear index tabs, but the Catholic books (e.g., Wisdom, Sirach) are not included on the tabs (the books are included in the Bible, but you'll have to remember their locations in the Old Testament).The one caveat with this Bible is that the pages are quite thin - I end up turning the pages very carefully.

It will lead to responsible food choices and muscle gain if you follow the workout regimen carefully. It will NOT result in the promised weight loss unless you specifically treat this as a diet (i.e., strictly limit portions, no snacking other than what is allowed in this book). The book actually encourages cheating as a way to stay sane on this diet, but be careful, since any progress can be erased if you do cheat. For many, unless portions are severely limited to the point of being hungry most of the time, this diet WILL NOT WORK. By eating 6 times a day, you can minimize the periods of hunger pangs, but unless you do so, you can pack on a fair amount of calories and fat by eating the 12 powerfoods discussed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is TERRIBLE. It spends the first 75 pages trying to sell you on the idea which is stretching it from the start. I already bought the book just get into it already, is what I felt. After reading the book twice the only concept I could really garner was to just eat smoothies forever and occasionally a modified version of the Atkins or South Beach Diets, which is funny that he uses so many high protein lo/no-carb recipes, since he takes a few pages to bash each of those diets to begin with. Stay away your money is better spent elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much flab","review":"There's some good sense in this book, though most of it is borrowed from other places, like the South Beach Diet.

After taking a spin through it, I can see why-it's a diet book that talks about how to eat right and exercise right, as opposed to all the other books that either do one or the other. Pretty funny to read, too. If you want to lose weight, buu this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but somewhat unrealistic","review":"First off, this book is great for anyone who's sick of such garbage as the Atkins or South Beach Diets. Although it is more of a man's \\"diet\\" due to its rigorous exercise program, it is universal for the most part. The diet itself is somewhat unrealistic seeing as most Americans cannot eat Zinczenko's almonds and bizarre snacks every couple of hours and eat the prescribed foods when eating out or on the go. For example, fast food is terrible, but it is nonetheless an unfortunate reality for many time-pressed Americans - even those with 6 pack abs.The book earns its keep and 4 star rating largely upon its helpful photos, explanations of training regimens, and lastly for its actual \\"diet\\" information. Recommended only if this is to be a lifestyle choice for those serious about fitness, not merely a fad diet that you will abandon after merely losing 5 or 10 lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Abs Diet","review":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!!This is the most entertaining, informative and doable diet and exercise plan I've ever read.

Basically there is a list of foods to base your diet on and they're no big surprise. It is what you would expect to eat. Recipes are basically no-brainers - lots of smoothies and egg dishes. Has some good exercises with pictures which was nice if you don't know what type of exercises you could do to strengthen your abs, but I have an extensive collection of exercises so a lot were duplicates of exercises I already have. I bought the book used, so I got my money's worth. I would suggest getting a copy from your local library before you spend any money buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diet book that doesnt feel like a diet book","review":"This book is a good book if you are looking to lose weight the right way.

Unfortunately, the Kindle version of this book is very hard to use effectively.This weakest point of this book is its organization. The ideas are great, but you have to jump around a lot to reference the workout plans, exercises, diet concepts, recipes, weekly plans, etc... This wouldn't be a problem in a paperback version of a book (and is usually the strength of Kindle books), but this book is extremely slow to load. For some reason the book is in a non-standard font that takes forever to load from page to page. There are numerous useless \\"skip to page # for more detail\\" notes that have not been linked to the page number, making it impossible for a Kindle user to skip around quickly. Also, the workout section of the book is sloppily formatted for Kindle and has a ton of glitches and blank pages that should have been edited out.Avoid the Kindle version of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Listening to this Diet","review":"Now only if I could follow all this good advice... this is a great diet... easy to follow, good plan that seems sensible... a coworker of mine followed this diet and lost over 30lbs...

However, when David actually does get into the concrete information about how and what to eat, it's very sound advise and helped me out a ton. There is another problem with the book in that although David brings out a lot of facts in his hype speech throughout the book, there's zero citations or references of the information. I sincerely doubt he is but what's saying he isn't just fabricating most of the studies he is talking about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with great insight!","review":"If you want to lose weight and stay happy while you do it, this is your book! I'm telling you this \\"diet\\" plan is so easy and really works. The only negative about the book is the lack of expressed importance of exercise. He says you don't even have to exercise for the first three weeks, which may be true, but you have to exercise at least 3-5 days a week to lose weight at the best rate possible! He even admits to running everyday, which is puzzling to me why he wouldn't stress a little more exercise.

I bought everything on the shopping list, some items were never even used in the recipies! This book contradicts itself several times about 'eating before working out, or eating after working out', '3 alcoholic drinks per week, or 2 per day', etc, etc. The other thing I found frustrating was the fact that most of the recipes if followed directly (which I thought was the idea!) are for 4 servings, so I found myself eating the same thing a lot, or a ton of leftovers and wasted food.I'm just very disappointed and don't recommend it, but then again, everyone's bodies are different so I hope it works for others!(P.S. a friend of mine tried it and had the same problem.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for women","review":"I have followed the diet plan for over 4 weeks now, and have only lost '1' lb.

Then I read this book, recommended to me by a co-worker, and it has changed my life forever.What blew me away was the importance of what you eat. Sure, exercise is important, but think about it: you eat more times a day than you work out, so shouldn't you be paying just as much attention (if not more) to what you eat than going to the gym?Other books I read stressed diet as well, but this book gave the WHY, not just the WHAT. And now, I do not look at food the way I used to. Foods I used to love, like pizza and fries, I now limit myself to them just once a week--if that.I cannot recommend this book enough. I just hope it works you like it has for me. For me, it took three weeks before I began noticing the changes, so this is something you will need to be patient with; this is a marathon, not a sprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"to gross for me","review":"I ,very much enjoyed \\"Baked\\" it was very funny and the characters were great.

He sees a whirling cosmos in every mote, and then zooms back to the zillionth degree and sees our pinwheel galaxy floating in the universe like a speck of infinite possibility. We are opened to worlds upon worlds, light upon light. He is joyous; he is Blakean; he is also as down to earth as a warm loaf of bread. The title poem is a delight and a riot and a metaphysics (keep an eye out for Zarzz, the French existentialist bee, he's my favorite)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"As a beginning student of mandolin, I've been looking at a lot of instructional materials in addition to taking lessons from a professional musician. Perhaps I'm too far along or my teacher is too formal due to a classical education and playing mandolin,fiddle and guitar but this is one of the worst instructional videos that I've seen so far. Some of the techniques shown in this video will handicap the beginning mandolinist as he or she attempts to develop speed and agility on the fretboard. Also, do yourself a favor and learn to read standard musical notation; you won't regret it later when you learn the instrument and can pick up music written for other instruments and turn it into serious mando-pickin'.

The next track... look i could go on and on about each song on the album, but the bottom line is-- If you spend all your time listening to the lyrics of songs dont buy this album.

The novel was written in 1948, in Milan, in only three months. The Italian original title \\"Tempo d'uccidere\\" is a quotation taken from the Bible and it litterarly means \\"Time to kill\\". It's the weird story of a young Italian officer (based on Flaiano's experieces) portraited on the background of the Italian-Ethipian war in 1936. One day the officer suffers of a terrible tooth-ache and he's compelled to set out to seek for a dentist, but, on his way to the hospital, he meets by chance an Ethipian woman: it's the very begining of \\"the short cut\\" towards the discovery of human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor performance","review":"This battery powered sensor bar is almost unusable.

Normally I would say Mila's assets alone would make something this putrid at least this bearable. Alas, Morgan apparently failed his course in \\"Bad Directing with Hot Babes in Terrible Movies 101\\"; he didn't have her appear in one shower scene!Consequently he has created a positively EdWoodian masterpiece of mammoth plot chasms, excruciating dialogue, appalling acting (I anxiously awaited Capt.

Plus, William Shatner has almost become a cartoon character so you can't help but laugh at his part in the movie. Not since \\"Showgirls\\" has a movie been made that is this bad.The only redeeming value of this movie is that it is nearly two hours of the ever cute Mila Kunis (That 70's Show). Anything with her in it for two hours can't have one star...thus the extra star.If it's late at night and there is absolutely nothing else to watch on television, do yourself a favor and turn off the TV, and sit in the corner and twittle your thumbs or something.

Will someone explain to me how a such a small person can impale a full grown man with a broom handle?

The first was a game attempt at capturing the book (a satiric masterpeice, BTW. You should read it) and was an effective, if not great, satire. This is not a satire; more like a documentary on how to make a bad slasher movie. It has a number of unintentional genuine laughs, and you can tell Shatner really thought he was doing well here, which is sad, but also amusing unto itself. But nobody in this film is ever gonna be nominated for a Herman or Ignatz, much less an Oscar. It's just completely staggering how far this film missed the point. Not just by miles, but light years.

Bale is light years ahead of Mila as an actor and besides it's just too difficult to take her seriously after seeing her in \\"That 70's Show\\" and her role in \\"Family Guy\\" as Meg."},{"rating":"1","title":"insert pirate lingo for anger","review":"haveing seen the first american psycho and then reading the book i have a greater repsect for that first movie.but, this...this is an attempt at something. i/m not sure what, but something.millia kunis should have an axe taken to her face or maybe metled with lime in Hell/s Kitchen.shatner needs to be stabbed to death inside Central Park Zoo infront of the penguins.this movie is a great exapmle to why i loathe my generation. they miss the point on anything and everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"Well its a stupid movie with a stupid plot, but Mila Kunis is quite good, I dig her a lot.

This was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miracles do happen - this film getting made is one of them","review":"17 minutes into \\"American psycho 2\\" I fell victim to crippling stomach pains which, quite frankly came as something of a relief. I persisted through the appalling dialogue and commentary, only finding occasional reprieve from the pain via William Shatners comical acting and random swearing. After 45 minutes I was wondering what kind of exceptional conspiracy or super bribery had allowed this film to be in any way affiliated with American psycho. At the films \\"conclusion\\" it became more than obvious that the director had screwed the pooch and would hopefully never work again. As the credits rolled by I found myself lying on the floor, hunched double in anger and agony.My tests and examinations at the hospital revealed acute functional dyspepsia precipitated by the atrocious soundtrack. I feel one day, with careful tuition and support, I could rent a DVD again, but it sure won't be this kind of stomach bending, straight to video pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"This movie deserves 0 stars.I've read the book and watched American Psycho.THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO PATRICK BATEMAN!Reasons NOT to see this movie:1) The entire plot is predictable within the first 10 minutes.2) Barely any Gore, little blood, not a horror movie.3) It has a \\"cute\\" ending.4) Mila doesn't get naked, no nudity whatsoever.Save your money for the book \\"American Psycho\\" by Bret Easton Ellis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie was horrible. It doesn't deserve to be put under the \\"American Psycho\\" name. It had absolutely nothing to do with the first movie. Even if it was a seperate movie, it still would have (been bad). Continuity blew and it wasn't funny like the first one or was nearly as graphic. I recommend that you don't buy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do justice to the original movie and book","review":"This movie is mildly entertaining, but doesn't have the punch of the original. In fact, it really doesn't have any justification as a sequel. If it had been made as just another teen horror movie, it would have been okay. As it is it is a half-assed attempt to cash in on the name of the original, offering nothing new. It is a sequel in the same way that American Werewolf in Paris was a sequel to American Werewolf in London."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie totally ...!","review":"It has nothing in common with the first part - except the title.

Mila Kunis is wonderful in her role and stunningly beautiful. William Shatner does s superb job as the professor and I grew up with his films so it was fun to watch him. The score is awesome, one the the best things about the film is the music. and lst but not least it does not have the highly \\"annoying\\" Christian Bale.

It's a teen slasher that has absolutely no relevance to American Psycho except for a very thin link with Patrick Bateman, which could've EASILY been changed to have this movie stand out as an original slasher rather than a moronic sequel.Besides, American Psycho was made in a way to let people decide on their own if Bateman was a serial killer, or if it was all in his head. This movie completely rules out the possibility, and if at all taken seriously by anyone, makes it's predecessor lose much of it's essence and uniqueness.The only thing that could've saved this movie was Mila Kunis briefly flashing... but i guess they felt they had already hit rock bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fun as a comedy","review":"I watched this movie as a joke. The first movie was okay but that's comparing it with the book. This \\"sequel\\" (only by name) is meant to be a satire I think but it came off as a joke to me. I laughed at it and actually was entertained by how bad it really was. It's a badly made movie by a director who obviously did it for the paycheck (we hope) but I couldn't help laughing and getting a kick out of this movie. This movie will definitely have an audience and a cult following (a small one but large enough to be classified as a cult following) but for most people, it will be horrible. Just take it as a comedy and you might actually enjoy it. Then again....you could make some sort of drinking game out of this movie I bet lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb, absolutely superb....","review":"...Does not describe this film. I would consider myself a fan of horror films, both classic ones and [bad] ones (yes...even Valentine) but i must say...this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. I really loved the book, and i liked the film, but this sequal is the biggest pile of poo i have ever seen. The acting is aweful, the soundtrack is mediocre, and the plot line cometely exploits and manipulates that of the original, even to the extent of CHANGING ITS ENDING. Please please do not see this film, and dont buy it. I rarely HATE films, so not watch this...this is coming from someone who generally sees and enjoys these kind of films (and thats bad enough)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crap !","review":"Sorry but there is nothing positive I can say for this movie. Is the director get paid to make such a crap ? Is he really a director ? How do the producer/director get the money for it and how come distributors are interested in it ? The main actress is full of xxxx and mainly the other actors of this piece of xxxx are.

And there are some good ones out there. I thought M.K. was rather cute in that 70's show, but it appears that WAS her acting ability. Cute fluffy lines and flipping of the hair.I think Shatner threw himself out of the window when he realized what a clunker of a movie this was. Bad acting, bad dialogue. It couldn't make up it's mind whether it was horror or camp and failed at both.No wonder we've not seen her in anything since.

Not what I would expect for the price I paid. The mirror also broke when my kid grabbed the face and turned to look in the mirror.

By creating connections with each other - friend, stranger, neighbor, and relative - we can discover untapped resources. This book is filled with the passion of a man who lives his vision of active, loving commitment to the well-being of all souls, focusing on the needs of the physically challenged, the poor, the elderly, the mentally ill, and members of other marginalized groups. What is most important is that these helping relationships are peer relationships, where the boundaries between gift and gratitude, giver and recipient, vanish.

Kzinti evolution, while only hinted at in the short stories, is unveiled here in a manner both unique and sound. The artwork is true to the mark, depicting all major species with insightful clarity.

It was later I tried to clean a junk lens and moved the pad in a linear direction and tested under light and found the fine scratches in the direction of the cleaning. So I would say that this is not as safe as claimed. It also leaves residues behind from either the pad or the oils that are loosened, but not absorbed so I would only be pushing the oils around.

I recently had a problem at work with the default comparison of two instances of an object in an embedded system, and the only way I could debug the problem was by adding debug trace until I narrowed it down to a bad implementation of the default \\"!=\\" operator in g++ 4.1.2.

Not to mention the 'efficient' way in which the Germans went about the Final Solution - particularly the 'sardine packing' method of mass killing.I won't be reading anymore holocaust books for a while as this one just about gave me nightmares.

Particularly heart wrenching for me since I have a two year old son. Rhodes' book upset me to the point that my wife noticed and asked why was I reading it if it bothred me so? I said any suffering this is causing me is nothing compared to the suffering Rhodes describes.I didn't particularly care for the psychoanalysis parts. Mainly because it seemed somewhat out of place in a history book.I'm sure everyone has said or heard someone say why did the Jews \\"let\\" themselves be killed?

But while it does not traverse much new ground, as a succinct and well-narrated account of the operations of SS \\"special forces\\" in Eastern Europe, it's a valuable contribution to the literature. One disappointment is the failure of the book to substantiate the claim made in one of the dust-cover reviews, that it provides substantial coverage of both Jewish and non-Jewish victims of the mass murderers. The non-Jewish aspect is only touched on; as though that \\"advance reviewer\\" saw a manuscript that's been cut before publishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have read all of Rhodes Books","review":"Disappointed that I could not lend this kindle book.

Masters of Death (The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust) will bring the reader quite close to the horrificly committed mass murders from both the perspectivie of the killers and the victims (of those very few who managed to survive). There is a little pyschobabble near the beginning mixed in with small bios of Hitler and Himmler that does not entirely hold together but it is minimal and, in no way, interferes with the important story told here. The author shows how the killing of Jews in Eastern Europe developed the methods and hardened the men, by making horror routine, to the Holocaust that followed of whiich these first years of killings were a part. This book is an important addition to Holocaust literature by an accomplished writer. This book is both very hard to read and difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"SS einsatztroepen","review":"The expression \\"I like it \\" is not applicable seen the subject.

At the same time this CD is one of the best illustrations of Deep Purple progression covering all their milestones before the 1st split. It is not very long as e.g. 4 CD's set Shades (1968-1998), which is more interesting for collectors, and much more varicoloured than e.g. Deepest Purple or When We Rock... and other 1 CD compilations. Anthology is a perfect variant for those, who love Deep Purple but would like to limit their CD collection by several items.

It is meant to be a two way communication with the Heavenly Father, praising, thanking, interceding, and occassionally, asking. One of the most powerful ways to do this, and a good way to learn how to pray, is to pray the scriptures. The Bible is filled with prayers left by our ancestors in faith. The Rabeys have selected the 101 that have meant the most to them, some of them from the books that many ignore and have to hunt for when the pastor says look up such and so book. The verses are then tied to their own experiences in a way that makes them real and applicable to daily life. In some cases, the story will speak to your heart as much as the scripture does. In this way, they prove that the Bible is a living book, relevant today as it was when recorded. ****Reviewed by Amanda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Old School recordings","review":"Good Riddance, the quintessential hardcore punk band, produces a masterpiece in \\"Ballads\\" If you like \\"Operation Phoenix\\", this album may be not hardcore enough for you, but for all the punk purists, if they really exist, this album is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort","review":"I did like this film, but for all the wrong reasons.

You can get caught up following the life of a guy who must turn to drug dealing to survive, and the surprise ending and acting really worked.

Action games bore me, unless they are multi player games (Unreal Tournament or Tribes2). However this game is different. It's typical in it's action gaming, but untypically it has an excellent story line. The Cutscenes in this game, if all put together could make a rather hilarious movie. The online gaming element isn't bad at all, either. The vehicle riding is quite fun, and though it's not Tribes2.. it's certainly not boring either. I did find myself getting bored of the action in the middle, but that's just me. I wanted to complete this game to check out every cutscene. See the sexy archer, working her way through a man's world. HAHA If I did not know better, I'd say this game was made by feminists. The only low, I can think of for this game is, that the game is so wacky it takes away from the coolness of the action.

The selection of guns and gadgets is good too !! The game is funny too, when you try to shoot a guy then he is like , look out for the bullets !! or they talk in a German/English language and it sounds really funny. Was are sie doing here ?

With excellent graphics, brilliant AI, fantastic soundtrack, hillarious story and a wonderful design, NOLF is one of the games that you just can't stop playing.Everything in the game, from the weapons & gadgets to the level designs, is inspired by the 60s and by the famous super-spy movies and TV shows. The game succeeds in getting the player right into the \\"Austin Powers\\"-style story and characters.As an action games reviewer, I can say that NOLF is the best action game I've played in the last two years, and is my favorite game ever.I wish I could explain why it is so good, but I guess you'll have to see it for yourself: Every mission is different than the others, and the game combines non-stop action with some elements of 'thinker shooters' - makes you think before you shoot.A must-have for all gamers!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"They don't make quality games like this anymore.

We looked around at some sites that suggested ways you could (against the warnings of the manufacturer) manually reformat in a 32k cluster size instead of the standard 4k and solve the problem.

In fact cities like Memel(Klapadia) and Riga were founded by Germans in the 1200 and 1300's under control of the Teutonic Knights. Even when muh of the area came under the Tsar's rule, the elite of the region remained the German noble and aristocrats.

It names nations that promulgate and harbor terrorism (such as Saudi Arabia and Iran) and is willing to bite the bullet where action is required.My sole qualm is that by lack of a philosophical foundation there is a limit to its ideological clarity. Thus it slips into the vogue beliefs of imposing democracy, finding hope for the UN and Islam, and accommodating the foibles of ��allies��.

Ask yourself where we are going to get the people power and the treasure to do these things. Only madmen and armchair chickenhawks would suggest blockading North Korea (which by the way has a real army)--the loss of life there would be tremendous and using nuclear weapons would be out of the question in such a populated area.

It comes across as a poorly-constructed manifesto for a fascistic (not to mention heavily subsidized and unsustainable)monoculture, though it might be put to very good use (hence, deserving of one star)by psychiatrists striving to understand how 'projection' might unwittingly entrap those wielding power in the dubious enterprise of marketing wrongs to make them appear righteous."},{"rating":"1","title":"bye bye miss american empire","review":"Two thoughts cross the mind while reading this book1.

Fox plays Nick Lang, an A-list Hollywood actor who is offered a role as a cop in a new movie. He decides that he wants to research his role so that he'll nail the part in order to be cast in the film. Meanwhile, John Moss (played by James Woods), NYC's toughest cop, is trying to track down a psycho named \\"The Party Crasher\\" (played by Stephen Lang), a man who likes alot of attention when he's killing his victims, and trying to work out his relationship with his new girlfriend Susan. One night, Nick records an interview that has John Moss speaking to a reporter. Nick decides Moss is the perfect cop to take lessons from. John gets yanked off the Party Crasher case, so that Nick, who is incognito as \\"Ray Casanov\\" can learn from him, however, John doesn't want Ray tagging along with him. The only way they'll get along with each other is..The Hard Way. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Warned Me","review":"A co-worker warned me that this movie wasn't very good, but being my usual hard-headed self, I rented it anyway. I should've listened to him. The movie was basically about an actor who was studying for the part as a cop, and he had to go hang out with one particular cop who was NOT interested in having a partner. There were Asian and Black gang bangers who were the worst criminals on planet Earth, and Fox had time to call his friends to say \\"I'm in the ghetto.\\" That one line was pretty much the only time I laughed through the entire film, and that was because he sounded so absolutely lame when he said it. Other than that, this movie was passable. You pretty much know how it'll start, stop, and end five minutes into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual film","review":"This film insults our intelligence. Another shoot them up movie that forgets to define the meaning of a plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hard Way","review":"Nick Lang is a very popular actor starring in big blockbuster films, but he is not happy with his success, there is a role he covets, and is willing to do whatever it takes to get it. After seeing Lt. John Moss in an interview, Nick is convinced that if he spent time with him the role would be his. Using his considerable tinsletown clout, he arranges to be his temporary partner. Moss is angry about his new \\"assignment\\" taking him away from his big case of the Party Crasher. This guy has attached himself to Moss by calling him before he commits his next crime. Moss is determined to ditch Nick Lang, so he can concentrate on what is really important.As these two men spend time together, the inadvertently learn life lessons from each other that help them in ways they couldn't imagine. I really liked this movie! I have always been a huge James Woods fan, and Michael J Fox was surprisingly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-energy action-comedy, great fun film for a Friday night","review":"I've always thought of The Hard Way as more of an action-packed comedy than an action-adventure film. The humor hinges on the dialogue, not unlike the comedy of films like Arsenic & Old Lace -- though the vocabulary of this dialogue is not suitable for the young, naive, or terribly reserved. Mixed with the punch lines, there is quite a punch of action -- which is visual and exciting. If looking for literary storytelling or heavy drama,I'd look elsewhere, but this film is fast, fun, and very entertaining, without a downbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid movie.","review":"you'll see it anyway cause of all the good reviews, but it is pretty lame. i've seen worse, and at least it didn't try to take itself TOO seriously, but then how could it? pretty silly and the \\"action\\" scenes go on far too long. like one of those horror movies where the killer just won't die (and he won't in this movie either), so too this movie just won't end. stick to back to the future or videodrome for either of these actors doing anything worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"I love that Michael J. Fox doesn't take himself so seriously that he couldn't have fun. The interaction between him and James Woods is wonderful as two guys who can't stand each other yet get stuck together. Steven Lang has a memorable performance as \\"The Party Crasher\\", and I wish that they could have delved into his character a little more. I like the humor and the overall feel of the movie. It seemed to break some of the popular stereotypes like a cop living in filth, but embraces some like the Hollywood pansy idea. If you just sit down to watch this movie you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael J. Fox's BEST movie!!","review":"Michael J.

A must see for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has everything!","review":"From the Party Crasher to James Woods' tough guy cop to Michael J. Fox as the funniest, most believable superstar who leaves his ego at the door (mostly and that is very entertaining) to step into cop shoes to research a movie part, this movie has everything you could ask for. And so many of the actors are faces you know, who play characters you are completely immersed in. This is one great movie, and I am reordering for the 5th time, and I refuse to lend it out anymore! This has to be my favorite of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Crap, my name's Nick Lang!!!","review":"No fooling!

The elastic that holds your knife handles in place is extremely tight, so I couldn't fit any of my Wusthof, which are NOT huge handled. I couldn't put any garde manger tools either.

But.... If you own the Ken Onion knives like I do, this bag is not for you. Remember that the knives and especially the handles are slanted at an angle that fits great in the hand but not in the bag. Put one knife in its slot and see the blade set across the path of the 2 slots next to it. And if you place it on the first or last slot, your blade will rub agaisnt the sides of the bag. Sure you can have the knife sheaths on them for extra protection but this is just a cheap fix to a bad design flaw. If you cave the Shun Classics, Shun Pro, Elite, Premier or Shun Pro II or any other straight knife then this is the bag for you. If you have the Ken Onions, or the Shun Alton Brown's then maybe look at another bag.

This film should be re-done and digitally mastered.

During a brief power-outage today we noticed the coffee maker was freaking out and the toaster was super heating almost instantly. My electrician came over on an emergency call immediately. The upshot of the situation is that the generac's voltage regulator failed and was surging power into my home at 330 instead of the normal 220. The surge fried the mother-board on my gas furnace my ignitor (and possible other complications), messed up my invisible fence for my dog, fried a television and an alarm clock. The Generac customer service rep. told me that they are not responsible for complications of their units malfunction and that I should call my homeowners insurance.

While the material covered seems concise the presentation was just not pleasing(the resolution of some of the pictures was very very poor - a better printer and scanner could have helped or even professional help should have been considered).I expected more so BEWARE to others...For interesting work in Paper Tole, I recommend Creative Three-Dimensional Decoupage by Debbie Sellers.

If I could, I would remove even that one star left on the 5 stars and give it a black hole of a rating. It sucked me into the joy and then crushes me when I open it up.I am VERY disappointed in this poorly made craft book.I would like to reinterate a point : it has little content on paper toling - don't waste your money like I did.

The original 1968 version was alive, breathing, filled with passion and beauty. It also showed how even the brutality Congo suffered under the Belgians can be transcended, and a white church made genuinely universal by suffering. Christ does become the expression of liberation after enslavement in the original version. This commodified dreck merely turns the music into a saleable item. Phillips should be boycotted until they bring the origianl out. I have CDs of Debussy's music recorded in the 1920s and it is a joy to the ear.

I picked it up for 50 cents, and ended up wanting to send it back to the author demanding a refund. I spent only two-three hours reading it, but even that was far longer than it was worth.Truly one of the worst books I've read in recent memory, I would recommend this to...no one, really, unless you are a quantum mechanics fanboi who has read literally everything else in science fiction and fantasy. Everything.Harkius"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent attempt at a B-movie, yet failed harshly","review":"When I was in the process of watching this movie, I only hoped it would live up to some great B-movies like Dead Alive or Deadly Advice. While this movie really tried, it was missing some elements. First of all, I wasn't afraid or even in some small fear of the monsters. Though they killed a few people, they didn't do it like other monsters would.

Two men go exploring underground in a mining area, one dies in a fall and the other happens upon an underground civilization and it goes from there. This civilization is nearly a utopia, they are in control of a seemingly \\"magic\\" substance known to them as Vril which be used for destructive or healing purposes. Also when reading the depictions of the women in this world I couldn't help but be reminded of Danish women. Tall, beautiful, strong, intelligent but incredibly stubborn! The story loses me for a short time in a few spots when he goes into some of the intricies of the society he has discovered in the subterranean world but overall this was a good yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"Douglas P was proud to enounce that DIJ were one of the first bands to appear in the former Yugoslavia after the war.

My Mother doesn't have to do anything to get 20 pictures a day sent to her. I have uploaded 200+ photos and 20 new ones randomly appear every morning. They can use any picture I send for what ever they want - I don't care! Hell, maybe I'll become so popular that my face will become a commodity and some one will call me for a $$million$$ contract! (yeah-right) There are several other options one the service, like sending photos on a certain day, locking certain photos so they stay on the frame, etc. My mother lives 1,500 miles from me and has no computer or computer knowledge, so this works very nicely.

Marshall in a reprise of his role in the 60's TV series, John Laroquette, Beau Bridges, Mark Blum, good premise, familiar territory--more than enough for a good-ole courtroom whodunit.But this presentation begins to unnerve almost immediately. Martha Plimpton's upstart young attorney is so annoying, it throws the whole meter of the drama off the rails, time after time.Her dialogue is so trite, so predictable, that it gives the viewer absolutely no room to let her character provide the conflict that's necessary to give the story some depth. Her delivery is so harsh you almost reach for the volume-down button every time she speaks.Lack of subtlety, in the story, and the dialogue are really the major culprits, Even the scenes without Plimpton are clich��, and heavy-handed. Plimpton's performance is merely the cherry on top.It's a real shame"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Defenders \\"Payback\\"","review":"This was a very interesting story. The acting from E.G. Marhsall, Martha Plimpton and Beau Bridges as well as guest star John Laroquette was superb. The lawyers struggled with this case as the defendant admitted that he had murdered the victim. The victim was a rapist with a past of himself being abused. I cannot say that I agreed with the way that the case ended as I feel that the defendant did not get the punishment that he deserved despite the provocation that made him commit the crime. This movie is another excellent example of an issue movie that will keep the watchers of the movie thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for previous Palm or Pocket PC users","review":"I purchased this book after being disappointed by the documentation that came with the HP iPAQ.

What would be the point in taking a third of what you need unless you double your dosage requirement which defeats the purpose since it will last less than a month. More like one thrid of the month. so I bought Stuarts for that reason. it's a bit pricy unless you can find it on sale some where.

However, I had seen other films about serial killers like Gacy and Dahmer. They were rather well done, and I thought it important to have a knowledge of these people.Other reviewers have complained about the dream-like state of the movie. Actually, this is why I liked it so much. You never know what may happen in a dream. Speck gave me that sort of feeling as I watched it.Another thing that really got to me was Speck himself. I don't know if the lines in the movie were his own words, but they were thought-provoking nonetheless. He said that killing was his nature, just like it was a poet's nature to write. Something along those lines.This movie could have been better, of course, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly tells the real story","review":"Having been familiar with Richard Speck and his mass murder spree in 1966 and having read a book written by the Prosecutor who was responsible for putting Speck behind bars, I was expecting a much better movie than this.

If you're looking for a good movie/docu-drama, see Helter Skelter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This was a really awful movie. It could've been better, certainly, but I think that Richard Speck simply isn't a good subject for a feature-length movie. His killings take place over the course of only one night; most of the movie was limited to Speck dragging a girl from one room to another room, where he murdered her. That pattern was literally almost the entire movie. Furthermore, the film was composed of amny wavy, dreamlike shots, which only served to be annoying and boring after a while. Basically, Speck was extremely boring. The filmmakers did a bad job of portraying one grisly night in a deranged man's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"In the world of cheap, poorly-scripted potboilers, this is one of the worst. Instead of a riveting true-crime story, the viewer is subjected to a pointless, boring, innaccuracy-riddled mess.

Coming at the time when Steve was still \\"Wild & Crazy\\", many were turned off by this movie. But this is actually one of his best. The seemless interplay between Martin and the great actors/actresses from the 30's and 40's is genius. Filmed in black & white, Martin plays a gumshoe detective. Rachel Ward plays the love interest. Filmed before computers allowed you to insert anything into a scene, the editing must have been a nightmare. But the end result is worth it. The comedy is dark and satirical. It is Martin's tribute to the great detective and murder mystery films of Hollywood's golden years. Best way to view this film; Wait till it's nighttime, stormy and have a large popcorn.

The camera takes great pictures in sunlight, but if you have to use the flash about half the time you get banding which looks like lines in the picture. Not much can be done about it, that and the tiny 640x480 images (which remind me of picturebooth shots) make it a great camera for the year 1999. I would spend the extra $30-$100 bux and get something with bigger shots and 1.3 mpixel. In the cameras defense I bought it refurbished, but it was probably refurbished for the above reasons. If you're looking for something cheap, you can find 1.3 mpixel cameras now for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"Since the day I got this camera it never worked right. At first it was just the fact that the serial connection did not work. So for awhile it took great pictures and they printed very nice! Then it started draining the batteries. Then it just stopped working. Polaroid has done nothing to help me. Not since the day I bought it. Then I also went and bought another polaroid camera and it doesnt work either. And I inquired with polaroid again, and they still haven't helped me! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY! The are horrid and do not care about their customers. And their cameras dont work.

It will not take a decent picture at all.My entire reason for wanting a digital camera was to own one for myself to learn how to use it and to buy one for my daughter and son-in-law. Christmas of 2001 was the big camera day. Thanks Santa! The kids have now moved to Germany from North Carolina and they are expecting their first baby and my first grand baby.

It'd make a good kid camera, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also had a terrible experience with this camera","review":"I had this camera and took pictures but could not get the software to load. I contacted Polaroid on the 800 number and theperson I spoke with told me they were having problems. He was NO help. I went to website and entered my question. After ONE week of back and forth with so called technicians, they finally suggested that I bring it back and buy another camera. I took his advice and brought it back. After not getting any help from them I also told them I would Never buy another Polaroid! They didn't seem upset, but I have changed all my family and friends away from their cameras. They should just close their website and 800 number if their own technicians suggest buying another camera. Don't waste your time on this.

We have about 70% of them broken now. We contacted customer service over a year ago and no one ever responded. We have been aggressively contacting them for the last two months and still no response. So, the facts are these...the knives are inexpensive, they will not last very long, you will not get a replacement much less a response from customer service, and you will get what you pay for. At the price offered it is not such a big deal to just order new ones as they really are not bad knives while they last. However it is the principle of the thing.

The swivel joint is only .25 inches in diameter and each headphone earpiece is massive compared to the strength and durability needed at this skinny hollow plastic joint. When the phones are rotated for storage, there is no guard to prevent a large lever arm to apply force and bend this joint with any movement. The soft carrying bag offers no real protection. After a number of cycles of use, stress fatigue in the plastic (like metal fatigue) sets in and then ...... SNAP one of your headphone earpieces is dangling by its wire.As an analogy, I offer the example of those plastic model airplanes, you might have made as a kid. To get the individual parts, you bent the pieces back and forth until they snapped off from their molded plastic branches...same principle, but in this case, it results in headphone failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like these headphones","review":"I purchased these last year, and on my first use on a 6 hr airplane flt. the headphone broke. The headband started digging into the side of head above my ears after a while. I took the headphones off leaving them on my seat and when I returned sat on them and one of the ear phones broke off instantly. They were bulky fitting into the loose cloth bag they come with. Not impressed at all with the design, but the noise cancelling feature was nice when I clicked it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what you pay for them!","review":"I have friends with the Bose versions and these sound almost as good at less than half the price.

For example, when you are boarding the plane or when you have to talk to the flight attendant for a minute. The battery life on the noise cancellation is EXCELLENT! One AAA battery has lasted for over 24 hours so far. I only wear them when I am flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, break easily, o.k. sound","review":"The sound on these headphones is o.k. When using the sound isolation you will hear a mild hiss but I have found that to be commonplace on all headphones in the same price range. The main drawback on these headphones is that they are cheaply made. The bond between the two actual headphones and the semi-circular 'connector' on the top is very weak and it broke very easily on my piece within 2 months of buying it.Another big drawback is that there is the volume control and sound isolation control unit that comes attached to the headphone wires is HUGE. It is slightly bigger and more heavier than two old ipod shuffles put together and it is very irritating.I'd recommed shelling a few extra dollars and getting better and sturdier headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily. Drains Battery. Background noise.","review":"The worst part is the 3/16\\" plastic tube where the headband attaches to the earmuffs. It breaks so easily. I have broken both left and right side from dropping them on my thick carpet from 2 feet. You will break it too. I used epoxy glue to fix it but man, that part was so flimsy. I heard the guy left Altec Lansing and started designing Toyota brakes. Everything is plastic on the outside.You do have to clip the on/off battery box to youself or nearby as the cord is only 2 feet.I have replaced dozens of single AAA because I always forget to turn it off. No, I don't use a rechargeable because I already have dozens from Costco.I think it feels good though. I like the padding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Backup, Not Worth The Hype","review":"Noise Cancelling is pretty descent... but when turned on there is a defnite buzz in the background that can be annoying. If the music is loud enough it will cancel it out... but you shouldn't have to worry about that in a quality pair of headphones.They are fairly uncomfortable after any period of time.The audio overall is perhaps slightly above your average pair of headphones... but certainly nothing for an audiophile... as the base isn't great at all, and at high volumes there are definite distortions ina ll ranges.Bottom line, if you can find these for $30 or $40 it may be worth it for you and if you aren't too picky... but if you want a real noise cancelling experience, i would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT ACTUAL MY ALL ORIGINAL CD","review":"I BOUGHT THIS CD AND REALIZED THAT WITHOUT A PICTURE IT ISNT THE ORIGNAL MY ALL CD SINGLE WITH THE PICTURE OF MARIAH ON A TURNED OVER BOAT AS IN THE \\"MY ALL\\" VIDEO.

I bought it so that I could carry my DVDs/CDs back and forth to school with me (I came home most weekends). What a crappy product! The one day I was walking from the car to my dorm (after the zipper broke, I used safety pins to keep it shut!) and the side of pages ripped!!

This is very programmed, boring ambient music.Pick up the Quiet Muisc series, or perhaps investigate his newer stuff which I dont favour. But steer clear of this one.

I like just about all of his recordings (his dark ambient the most, and his tribal stuff probably the least). Structures from Silence is an album I heard relatively recently, and out of all of them, this is what I would consider his most melodic. It's an ambient album that takes a positive spin, without becoming sentimental with tons of uplifting-sounding washes. I enjoy it immensely, despite its receiving only 4 stars from me.The reason I only give Structures from Silence 4 stars is, although I like all three tracks on the album, I find that the third track lacks a certain cohesion with the first two.So, if you like a little melody with your ambience, try this out. Then buy Midnight Moon and The Magnificent Void, and then you'll have what I call the top trifecta from an ambient master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planeterium-premier","review":"Early ambient masterwork is an auditory space odyssey which may lack some of the underlying subtleties that made similar artists compelling but remains warmly engaging and surprisingly undated even at its most monotonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb (if expensive) college teaching resource","review":"This is one of the best cultural-theoretical \\"readers\\" on the marketplace today, and should be indispensable addition to course syllabi for those wanting to teach postcolonial culture. All of the big names are here (Said, Anderson, Spivak, Bhabha, Fanon), and they've been helpfully redacted down to facilitate their accessibility--Spivak's and Bhabha's notoriously pompous and prolix styles have been edited to the point where students can actually discover the important points hidden away in the mire of verbiage.My only disappointment with this reader is that so much has been included into it that it's price is somewhat steep--I think Ashcroft et. al. could've kept the price down by being a little less inclusive.

Instead, as Hollywood filmmakers often do, it makes the minority character a bystander in what should be his/her own story, and pushes a white character into the lead. Like \\"Mississippi Burning,\\" which basically shows us how two white characters singlehandedly kept the Civil Rights movement alive, \\"Cry Freedom\\" shows us how a white journalist battles apartheid. By far, Denzel Washington's portrayal of Biko is outstanding, the best performance here. He receives a four star, but the director and the film receive less than a one star for committing its own apartheid, pushing a minority to the back of the bus -- and unfortunately, Hollywood continues to do this -- just go see the implausibility that is \\"Last Samurai.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Attenborough's \\"Gandhi\\" a very good political film that could have a great one,","review":"In some ways it's a weaker film than \\"Gandhi\\" - a lot of the tensionfeels manufactured, even though the story is true.But on the other hand, the sheer emotional power of the strongestscenes, like the massacre in Soweto, surpass anything in \\"Gandhi\\".While many understandably had trouble with making this the story of awhite man -- liberal editor Donald Woods and his family's escape fromSouth Africa after he was banned -- instead of focusing the film onWoods black friend and activist Stephen Biko, I still felt the film worked,and was an effective plea to the world to do something about South Africa.Both Denzel Washington and Kevin Klein are very, very good, although I'vefound both even stronger in other films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I saw this movie on HBO years ago, just happened to watch it from 20 minutes on.

Margaret Lindauer argues that other authors did not picture Frida in a truly and fair way. She does raise some interesting points such as an opposite view on the general understanding that Frida's was obsessed about having children. The point is that her writing is not enjoyable. I felt as I was reading a text book. I forced myself to read about half of the book so that I can be more sure about my thoughts and I can't continue because I realized I'm wasting my time.

I've never been disappointed with a Polk product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sounding Speakers","review":"I connected these speakers as my front left and right speakers for my home theater room (connected to a Yamaha RX-V661 receiver). These speakers are wonderful to listen to. They reproduce sound (theater and music) very accurately and beautifully. I would buy another pair if I needed speakers. Great sound, great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mucho bang for the Buck","review":"The Polk Monitor 50 tower speakers are just terrific for the money. The highs are clean and well defined and the bass is substantial without being overbearing. Polk definitely has another winner on it's hands with these. Some reviewers have complained about weak bass, but I don't see that as being true. Unless of course you're a head banger and you like your bass seriously and artificially augmented. Then, just add a sub-woofer. These are very nice sounding speakers for a really terrific price. Matched up with the Polk CS1 center channel speaker and you have the perfect surround speakers (at least for the front). Add the Monitor 30's or 40's for the rears! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent sound, perhaps my setup is too weak...","review":"These are well built, and look good. Overall, there is little bass, but I purchased a separate subwoofer anyways. What I want from these speakers are very clear and loud Highs and Mids. They are very clear. But I'm not sure if they are getting maximum power (older Pioneer amp), as I would have prefered these speakers to be louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"first polk i've ever bought","review":"these were the first polks that i've ever bought. i bought them for a secondary setup i have much more expensive speakers in my main setup. but if you are looking for a little bit more bass than what a bookshelf can get i would definitely recommend these. there treble cable be a little sharp sometimes but overall the clarity is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent speakers for the price","review":"Bought the Polk Monitor 50's two weeks ago. They replaced a 25 year old set of B&W DM330's. For the price they're hard to beat. Good clear sound, even at high levels. The reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that you really NEED a subwoofer with them. They are overly strong in the high-end frequencies, and have almost nothing in the low-end. I ended up buying the Polk PSW10 subwoofer and now have a nice, balanced sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are what I was looking for!!!","review":"When I wanted to upgrade my home theater/stereo sytsem first I bought a home theater in a box since its reciever boasted 1000 watts and had HDMI inputs but when it came to the sound it just didnt cut it and was returned. After that dissapointment I did my research and came up with these excellent speakers that I hooked 2 of these up to an older analog Technics 230w receiver and it blew that 5.1 speaker system clear out of the water for less money(although I need a sub). If these speakers can make heavy metal sound lound and crystal clear... anything else will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its Polk. enough said. bought two 50 series and 2 60 series. 70 series went on sale about 2wks after I bought those. what a drag","review":"its Polk. enough said. bought two 50 series and 2-60 series. 70 series went on sale about 2wks after I bought those. what a drag. gd good speakers tho. nice and loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polk audio monitor 50","review":"I bought these beauties along with the 10\\" matched sub from Polk and they sound great hooked up to my Onkyo TX-NR414.

I have had these for about four months now; and although I could have spent more on speakers the sound that comes out of these really couldn't be that much better. The setup was not particularly hard, either.Just as quite a few others have stated, the sound is impeccable. The bass comes through just as it should and the overall clarity of the sound is perfect.The only caveat I can think of is that these are somewhat tall floorstanding speakers. Actually, they stand at just under three feet! At first they looked a bit too tall compared to my relatively small receiver and turntable; but that became completely meaningless after I heard the sound coming out of them!I highly recommend these speakers by Polk. You can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounding Speakers at Low Price Point","review":"I've owned these speakers for approximately one month and they are great performers. I was instantly pleased with the sound and after some break in the highs seem a little smoother. The speakers handle low end sounds pretty well but a subwoofer is definetely needed for a true movie-like experience. The cabinets are small(for towers), very rigid, and the finish job on them is better than most speakers anywhere near this price range. I ended up paying 90.00 a piece for these on a special buy and these are worth far more than that. Anyone who is looking for a surround system on the cheap that is pleasing to the ears can't go wrong with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers for the price","review":"Polk is always hard to beat. They set the bar pretty high.. Just listen to these speakers and any of their products next to the competitions and you'll see what I mean. These monitors are used to complement my Polk Center Channel, Polk PSW505 Sub, and bose satellite cube speakers. These Speakers are very clear. I tried them without the sub to see how hard they hit with the bass as well. They supply enough bass to have a good effect when watching movies or playing games but they can not match what a good sub can do. For the price these speakers are hard to beat. They look and feel well built. I am happy with my purchase and their ability to fill my 24x30 room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polk Audio Monitor 50","review":"I purchased audio speakers for my surround sound TV system. I selected Polk Audio Monitor 50 speakers. One of the best decisions I have made. The speakers perform with clear sound and make a great addition to my system. I would recommend these speakers for any surround sound TV system to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Surround System","review":"First, I am not an audiophile but I wanted a home theater system that sounded really good. I've done a lot of research and I looked at speaker systems ranging from $400 to $3200.I am using these speakers for my front and rear speakers in my surround sound system. They were not by first choice, but decided to go with them as they were 75% cheaper than the some of the others I was considering. I am very happy with them and feel they are truly a great bargain.They are driven by a Yamaha RX-663 AVR and are grouped with a Polk CSi3 center speaker and a Polk PSW125 12\\" subwoofer. Once the calibration program on the receiver was run with these speakers the sound quality seemed to really jell. Watching movies became more immersive to the point that it would be very hard to go back to TV sound.The cherry wood veneer finish is very nice and this really helped when getting WAF (wife approval factor) for adding 4 floorstanding speakers and a 16\\" square subwoofer to our living environs."},{"rating":"1","title":"clever but cheap quality","review":"When I saw this product in the store, I thought it was a very clever idea. But when looking at the pots, the very low quality was quite obvious. The handles are not well attached and very cheaply made.

A new family moves into the house and begin experiencing supernatural events; the events are capture by Luke, the son, and home security cameras. The acting ranges from terrible to mediocre; the scenes where Luke talks to himself are very bad and sound incredibly forced. There are only a few good scares, while most scares fell flat for me. The ending was simply okay. It claims to be real footage, but it obviously isn't. It really doesn't impress or try anything new at all, you've seen this movie before.By the way, there is some nudity and sex at the beginning of the film and only a little blood.

How wonderful to hear of children entertaining themselves, enjoying nature, having the freedom of the outdoors, and using their imaginations with no help from TV, radio, or computer games. The forwards by other authors including Judy Blume and the information at the end of each book explaining how the stories were taken from Maud Lovelace's own life added to the interest of the stories.Maud Lovelace was only a couple of years older than my father. These stories about the early 1900s give a good feeling for that period. Just think about buying lunch; sandwich, milk, and dessert, for 15 cents and going to the library alone for the whole day.The first four books will be a birthday gift to my 11 year old granddaughter.

Things like buying the right cardboard rounds, putting dowels in your tiers so they are strong, laying down foam in your car to help transport and mixing your batter and buttercreams correctly. Dede explains the ins and outs of every step of cake making in a way that is very clear and concise. I have other books that claim to be more definitive (and weigh in at many more pages) but don't go into the detail that she does.My only gripe is that the styling on some of the cakes is a little off. The tower of cupcakes photo shows three tiers that are off-kilter (not intentionally, I'm pretty sure) and there is another cake with sloppy basketweave piping. Lastly, I wish she would have given a chapter to working with fondant. It's too popular of a look to, um, overlook.Maybe in your next book, Dede? :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy!","review":"I could hardly wait to get my physical hands on this book.

In most books they give you one recipe that only yields enough batter for one particular pan size. If you want to make a larger cake then you have to guess as to how much batter and/or ingredients you'll need which can lead to unfavorable results.

First of all, it's the only one to feature Jason Lee as the main character as opposed to the smaller roles he was degraded to in Dogma and Chasing Amy (although he was in that one a lot). Lee is simply brilliant, no one can deliver a line quite like him. I also love all the little things about this movie that you pick up on repeated viewings, like the kid Brodie keeps yelling about in the escalator, and then later on this guys like \\"someone get a paramedic, theres a little boy caught in the escalator.\\" Anyway, buy this movie, and also buy Chasing Amy and Clerks.

It stars the excellent acting talent of Jeremy London (just kidding), Shannon Doherty, the amazing and brilliant Jason Lee, Claire Forani, Michael Rooker, and the always great Ben Affleck.Absoluetly hilarious if you like ridiculousness equal (but different) to that of Monty Python, and wit equal (but again, very different) to that of Geoege Cuckor (I don't reccomend Cuckor or Monty Python to anybody who likes this and isn't as flexible as me) .

Its not as funny or original as Clerks, but still good enough to warrant a cult following.For me, the most fascinating aspect of the film was seeing Jason Lee acting for the first time. Unless you weren't aware of it, Jason Lee was a very prominent professional skateboarder during the late 80's and early to mid 90's. He also jointly owned a successful Skateboard company called 'Stereo Skateoboards'.Jasons also starred in a Skatebording video called 'Blind video days' back in the late 80's.

However the humor is as apealing as in CLerks.However where clerks was intleligent humor, Mallrats is more sightgags. For example the guy who can't see the Sailboat in the picture, or the antics of Jay and Silent Bob. It's deffinetly more sight gags.Over all howver don't judge just because of the change of pace, the movie still holds it's own as a funny title, and a very raunchy, but still very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mallrats rules!

The dvd offers alot of deleted scenes left out of the theater release and VHS edition that add to the plot. Like why T.S.'s girlfriends father hates him so much. I love this movie mostly for the comic relief provided by Jay and Silent Bob. But overall this movie is pretty darn good. It's not Smith's best movie but by no means does it [stink]! Your best bet in watching this movie is buying the dvd with it's awesome extra features. Espically the commentary feature some of the cast which is pretty darn funny initself something that is worth renting to check out. You even get to watch the cast as the comment during certain parts of the film. So if you don't decided to buy this dvd fine but at least rent it.

The stuff cult classics are made of.The critics were wrong and the movie goers must have been napping in late 1995, because this film is hysterical from start to finish.Buy this one, folks. You can't go wrong with a Kevin Smith movie. Buy it for the commentary, buy it for the deleted scenes (over one hour's worth), buy it for the witty dialog of Jason Lee, buy it to laugh at Jeremy London's acting skills; but most of all, buy it for the movie itself.While you're at it, buy \\"Clerks\\" and \\"Chasing Amy,\\" too. And get a copy of \\"Dogma\\" (the best of the four) when it's released on DVD on May 2.Remember: Kevin Smith is the best screenwriter out there, so buy it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD?","review":"This HD-DVD was far from high def.

Nevertheless, \\"mallrats\\" is a great, fun film.The DVD bonus features are not that great. The deleted scenes were wisely deleted as they are not at all funny.Kevin Smith said the studio wanted an 90's \\"meat-balls\\" but smarter. I think that's pretty close to what they got.This is also the first Kevin Smith movie that Jason Lee appears in. His performance as Brody, T.S.'s comic book loving side-kick is probably his best to date.\\"Mallrats\\" is every bit as vulgar as \\"clerks.\\" Fans of Kev's first movie will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets Worse As It Goes","review":"This plays like a bad Kevin Smith film.And it already IS a bad Kevin Smith film. Lame script, cluttered dialogue, amateurish acting. Not one character is interesting or funny enough to garner any sympathy.For all the reviews that criticize the critics or can't genuinely understand why this is considered one of Kevin Smith's worst movies...it's because this movie SUCKS.

I wish he had an imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, Forgettable Piece","review":"I cannot believe people find this movie entertaining. Compared to the others in the NJ trilogy, this one lacks spontaneity, and jokes aren't really funny; I can almost see the author of the script *trying* very hard to make us laugh.

Tons of extras, and in my opinion, Kevin Smiths funniest movie. Better than Clerks and Chasing Amy IMHO.

His other movies like \\"Clerks\\", \\"Chasing Amy\\", and \\"Dogma\\" are really good and worth bying I give all those movies 5 stars,and I can't wait untill \\"Clerks 2:Hardly Clearkin\\" comes out.The only thing that really made the movie funny was Jay and Silent Bob. I like Jason Lee in \\"Chasing Amy\\",\\"Dogma\\",and \\"Mumford\\"(even though Kevin Smith didn't make that one),but in this one he just didn't work for me.I like in Kevin Smith movies how at the end of the credits it says what movie Jay and Silent Bob will be in next, and I'm still a big time fan of Kevin Smith movies and I'm still happy Kevin Smith said he was sorry for making this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest of the Jersey Trilogy","review":"As a big booster of Kevin Smith's, it was with a heavy heart that I had to admit that MALLRATS was a misconceived little ditty that relied too much on slapstick and not enough of the verbal humor that made CLERKS and CHASING AMY such wonders to see and hear. The verbal sparring is present in this film as well, but is often mired in silly action sequences, tips of the hat to comics and other films, and a buffoonish take on the Jay and Silent Bob characters. Heck, even Smith himself took shots at MALLRATS's silliness in CHASING AMY. It seems that Kevin was finding his voice with this one,which is basically a more vulgar send up of John Hughes teen-angst dramedies, yet he more than redeemed himself with the stellar CHASING AMY. Overall, a misfire, peppered with some funny dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snoogans","review":"So what if critics panned this movie? So what if Kevin Smith speaks of it in a self depricating manner? Mallrats is not Clerks. It lacks the profundity of Clerks, and it isnt as DIY either, so it is difficult to swallow some of the acting performances (Shannon Doherty gets top billing, what do you expect?). One of the strengths of Mallrats is the writing. No matter how unrealistic some of the dialogue is, it is at least as funny as Clerks, and is 20 times funnier than Chasing Amy. The other reason I would implore you to check this movie out, if you havent already, is Jason Lee. I consider him one of the most underrated comedic actors out there. His timing and delivery slay me every time. And to top it all off, Claire Forlani is just plain gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kevin Smith movie","review":"I think this might be one of the better Kevin Smith movies out. It is one of my top ten comedy movies of all times. Although the movie doesn't make much sense you just have to understand that Kevin Smith isn't usually trying to make sense, just trying to make you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smith;s love of Comic Books....","review":"Kevin Smith's love of comic books shows in this movie. The best scene is where Stan Lee does a brief camero, and that's it. The rest of the movie is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need to cheer up, watch Mallrats","review":"This movie is so ridiculously original and hillarious, that anyone who doesn't like it has serious problems. The actors are phenomenal with their facial expressions and character acting. Kevin Smith is a genius and you must also see his other movies, Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Dogma. They all have that same sexually explicit drama and the perfect mix of great vocabulary and cussing. It's entertainment that you don't have to think too hard about, but at the same time you won't catch everything the first time you watch it. I've seen it a million times, and I still laugh at the same jokes. Jay and Silent Bob rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"this dvd is a definite must have for kevin smith fans. the movie is so genius that most people can't appreciate it. if you're not a kevin smith fan, buy it and you'll become a fan. the commentary is probably the best of all five commentaries (thats my twin brother...barney affleck) affleck and smith in one room for a commmentary always makes it funny- but the movie is a great waste of an hour and a half if you just want a cheap laugh without much plot, this is a good way to go. 5 stars all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"MALLRATS","review":"MALLRATS is the second entry in the 'New Jersey Chronicles.' The film takes place at a local mall and follows various storylines about boyfriends, girlfriends, enemies, and other assorted characters. Those two crazy stoners Jay and Silent Bob appear to wreak some mayhem at the mall, and there is also a cameo by famous comic-book artist Stan Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"mallrats DVD","review":"I hope everyone who thinks that Kevin Smith had some sort of sophomore jinx with \\"Mallrats\\" will let this DVD change their mind. I suspect that those who pan this movie have never seen all of the New Jersey trilogy the requisite number of times to enjoy a full appreciation of this film in particular. For those who already know and love Kevin Smith in general and Mallrats in particular, this DVD will lead to a renewed love of this movie. I think that the Mallrats DVD is the best DVD of any Kevin Smith movie. It has a lot of deleted scenes with introductions and the audio commentary is the best of any of his DVDs. The only reason I gave this four stars is because a good deal of the commentary is spent apologizing for or defending the film, which I think is unneccesary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a STUPID movie","review":"This movie, in a word, blows.

Ben Affleck should be embarrassed to be in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dear Lord....","review":"There are very few statements in life that are indisputable. One such statement, however, is this: Mallrats sucks. For some reason, fans of Clerks have latched on to this wretched little film like it's a slacker comic masterpiece. It's nothing more than a tired string of gags...It even reverts to a running joke, which is about as lame as you can get. I'm fifteen, so I'm not \\"an old guy in khakis,\\" as one reviewer so eloquently put it--I'm just smart enough to know when I'm being forcefed contrived garbage. Please, all you would be movie critics: Let Mallrats die. Move on.

Despite an ensemble who almost all have progressed well and excelled, they are here spun into annoying over-literate unbelievably intellectually expansive proto-typical 90's slacker almost adults...I lasted about 45 minutes.I do give Kevin Smith credit, he cranks out films he's written and stamps them with a distinct energy and perspective. That certainly positions him as a artist, and a sort of visionary. But his visions in the first 45 minutes of Mallrats are boring, directionally slack, structurally flabby and not entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Smith's worst movie ever","review":"What was Kevin Smith doing starring and directing in this mess. there's no plot or funny bits that makes Clerks and Dogma so hilarious .the cast is good and the the cameo by comic book drawer Stan Lee is terrific,but the movie is so stupid to follow,the plot stinks what plot there's only two slackers that hang at the mall and be stupid,this movie tries to be like Clerks and fails,Jason Lee and Jeremy London take over Randall and Dante's roles that Kevin Smith should have called MALLCLERKS.0 stars for this.watch Clerks or Dogma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This movie shows life as a mall rat.

It's not funny at all, no story and no acting whatsoever. And for all you people who think Kevin Smith is some sort of a Movie God, get real! How can you people even think that the inept Kevin Smith can release worthwhile films (other than films of the Ed Wood caliber) is beyond me. Kevin Smith (blah!)

The movie has so much going for it, I fail to see why it wasn't a hit. It's just as funny as \\"Clerks\\", if not more so. Plus, the quality is much better, as is the acting. And, the biggest bonus: Jay and Silent Bob have a much bigger role then they do in \\"Clerks\\"! What else would you want in a movie?!?See this movie.

The reunion tour was succesfull, and the fans have celebrated together with the band. This show was recorded in Hertfordshire England at the Knebworth Park....Deep Purple reached as the loudest rock band on that night. They had circa 300.000 audiences.

This would be expected in a generic nail or gun, but not using a Paslode positive placement gun, with paslode nails.For kicks I did load them in my bostich PP gun (nail box says they will work) without much better results. The paper that is used to collate them is too high and too thick on the nail for the bostich nailer, and drags on the magazine creating some of the same problems.

This is the first of a handful of dates scheduled around Evans' busy schedule, and with Blue Mitchell on trumpet it's a great hard bop session, full of the pretty passages one might expect from a Bill Evans date, yet not averse to swinging hard, as on the three takes of 'Minority', which opens the album. Admittedly, the song's impressiveness is lessened a bit by Riverside's decision to arrange all three takes one after the other, but such is often the case with jazz reissues on cd. Not an essential album, although fans of Bill Evans will want to check it out, and it's of the consistent high quality of Cannonball's recordings of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Movie","review":"I must not have researched this movie enough before buying the DVD. I was immediately surprised by two things: (1) it's in black & white (the colored cover is deceiving) and (2) it is a French film that is mainly spoken in French although dubbed in English. The big problem with the movie, however, is that it just doesn't flow right. It bounces around too much and is not focused enough. It's just not very interesting, although it recovers some toward the end when the allies entered Paris. My 2-star rating is based on the interesting ending (it was 1-star up until then). I must say that the black & white nature of the film allowed the film-makers to blend in historical footage of Paris during that time period. Much of the ending, for instance, was historical footage of the victorious walk down the Champs-Elysees. It's a long movie, and the wait for the moving end wasn't worth it. I'll probably not watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned by boredom.","review":"This is an amazingly flat piece of propaganda, perhaps government-sponsored, to depict the events in the most flattering way for the French. As usual, a Jewish question is totally omitted while depicting the horrors of Nazi occupation of Paris, as the issue has never existed. I doubt one can speak truth about the war time in France ignoring this part of history. And then, as the movie proceeds, it feels more and more as a farce. The star-studded cast, acting poorly, only contributes to the overall grotesque impression on this film, which begings to feel as a play at puppet theater or a parody, and the music that is clearly plagiarized from Shostakovich Symphony #5 Leningrad makes the final point - if Shostakovich music is truthful, serious and profound, this one is caricature, vaudeville-like and stupid.I feel it is somewhat an insult to the true events and to those French resistance movement fighters who fought and sacrificed their lives for the liberation of their country."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNHAPPY WITH DVD","review":"WAITED A MONTH FOR DELIVERY AND WENT CRAZY USING DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS TO TRY TOWATCH IT BUT IT WILL NOT PLAY.

His general in command of Paris did as little as possible to carry out this order, even advised the allies that they would be welcomed with token resistance. Direct orders to the Luftwaffe to bomb Paris were ignored as well. There was an incredible spontaneous disregard of the Fuhrer's plans to destroy Paris. And when the Allies refused to march to Paris, the French Army left for Paris against orders in the dead of night, forcing Patton to race after them.

The movie is excellent, The acting is wonderful, and overall, i think it was a great idea for the movie. i have seen Loreno's Oils so many times, that i have lost track, and have been so inspired and interested in it, that i have chosen to become a doctor because of it (I'm a highschool sophmore). Also, in my Anatomy class, we have to do a 7 page report on the topic that interests us the most, and of course i chose ALD, Lorenzo's desease, and will also be using clips from the movie as part of my presentation. If this movie can make someone actually WANT to write a 7 page research paper, it must be interesting. i sugest anybody interested in the feild of medicine, or any feild for that matter, watch this movie, just once. after that one time, you'll never be able to stop.

It's a hauntingly beautiful film that would most certainly cause tidal waves of tears for those who are easily saddened. Nolte and Sarandon are fantastic as the couple that would never give up on their own damaged son (although Nolte's accent can be a bit laughable). Samuel Barber's \\"Adagio for Strings\\" is a nice touch as well. I would only recommend this film to those who are interested in science and good drama, but not to those who would NEVER want to see a kid's life being torn apart by a rare disease.

So far, it seems to be a process that works for us until we find something better.Also, there were several instances where coffee grounds overflowed from the basket into the carafe, as well a couple of instances where it made a mess all over the counter. The latter I chalked up to user error where we probably didn't have the door closed enough...maybe.In summary, this coffee maker is tolerable, but it has its problems.

If she had, she would realize that most of the events that drive her plot *would not happen*. The worst part was when after she killed off 4 FBI agents, the rest of the bureau was amused by the heroine.By the end of the book I was convinced that the heroine was actually too stupid to live and I was rooting for the killers to win.

And if you miss who the killer is when he is first introduced, then you have no business reading thrillers. His identity is completely obvious. I kept waiting for the book to improve and had to force myself to keep reading. It wasn't worth the time and the supreme effort. By page 100 I was cheering for the killer to catch Becca and put us all out of our misery. Even the best writers have a miss in their careers. This is it.

The single, most annoying thing about this novel for me was the fact that EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER is this book said the word \\"Damnation\\". It was said at least once, sometimes many more times than once in every single chapter. Who says that? I can honestly say that I have never had a conversation in my life in which someone uttered \\"Damnation!\\" What does that even mean? I don't get it and it just really got under my skin.

The premise of the book, the character development and the prose are something I would expect from a fourth grader. It amazes me that this book ever got published- apparently Ms. Coulter is living off of her reputation. The GOOD news is that according to her website, she only writes one book a year.

It was flat, repetitive, and didn't do a lot to either move the plot forward or develop the characters. Some of it was just stupid. For example \\"I know I'm not dead beacuase I would kill for some water. And I don't believe that if someone is dead, she's particularly thirsty. May I please have some water?\\" The attempts at \\"witty banter\\" or \\"romantic antagonism\\" just didn't ring true at all. I've read a few of her other suspense/ romance novels, and I don't remember them being this stilted. I definitely don't recommend spending your money on this book -- borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assine Plot, Insipid Dialog, Unremarkable Characters!","review":"Help, I cannot plod through this book. The dialog is structured for a ten year old. I have read Ms. Coulter in the past and, while she is no candidate for a Pulitzer, her books have been good \\"beach reads.\\" This, however, is deplorable. People do not speak this way in normal conversation; it is much too contrived. I do have one thing to be grateful for and that is this book was borrowed from my local library. I won't even bother trying to give a synopsis of this book. First, you wouldn't believe me, and secondly, it's much too boring and ridiculous. Better luck next time, Ms. Coulter. This novel fits into the category of a Danielle Steele, and that's no compliment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"I should've checked it out at the library. The story was not enjoyable and left me with an immense sense of dissatisfaction. The characters are not as compelling as those from The Maze ( love that book). The story line was weak in the sense that the mystery can easily be solved within the first half of the novel by readers. The 'surprise' twist at the end is easy to figure out before it is revealed. Steer clear of this book and spend your money else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment on all fronts.","review":"I have read many books by this author and am at a loss for words as to what happened in this book. It seems like this book was written by a elementary school child. This is nothing like her previous books. It was so repetitive and the sentence structure was so odd at times that it was hard to believe it was written by an adult. This book was terrible and remarkably boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riptide Ripoff","review":"Terrible character development, horrible writing/formatting/editing and repetitive, boring plots. This is my first and LAST Catherine Coulter book. The writing is elementary level and I find it very hard to believe this is a \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" author. Must not be hard to be on that list! Throughout the entire story, high level CIA and FBI agents are looking for the villain stalking our main character (Becca Matlock-for some unknown reason to her). Seems Becca could have done the job on her own for all the fumbling stooges they turned out to be! The story is very disjointed and the dialogue is hokey (the term \\"folk\\" is used over and over) and I found myself re-reading paragraphs to try to figure out what in fact they were making reference to. This book is very hard to follow and very predictable. The author is confident you won't guess the villain, because the villain is a character introduced at the end of the story. Lousy writing and lousy storyline - don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just skip it","review":"At the book's beginning the plot is fairly good. As you keep reading it starts to get heavy and dull, but the last 100 pages or so are really boring. The second plot is nonsense and you'll really know who is the bad guy almost as it starts. The main plot is thrilling just the few initial pages, then it gets dull and boring. At least you can skip the last 75 pages of the book or better said you can skip the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe how awful this book is","review":"I came to this site about 10 chapters in, just to see if anybody else felt the same way I did about this book. Thank god I'm not the only one who thought this book was awful! I found it had no flow what-so-ever, I found her writing style very hard to follow, the characters meant nothing to me, and I did'nt really care what happened to them. I finally could not take it any more and skipped ahead to the end to find out who the stalker was - just to end my torture. I have never read a Catherine Coulter book before (this one was given to me by a friend) and I never will again! DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a Dreadful Read - THE TIDE IS OUT AND IT STINKS!","review":"This book is so bad I was moved to right a review. The author neither paints pictures of places or events; no movement, no drama. Not a single interesting character, not a single interesting event. Neither is there a suspenseful or interesting twist in the whole book. I should be commended for finishing the read in hopes of finding something of interest. It's not often I make the effort to share my dissapointments, but spare yourself the effort, even TV reruns of Dragnet are of more interest and suspense. JUST AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As a writer myself, I would hate to get such negative reviews on something I worked hard on; however, in this case, I was so disappointed and disgusted with the read, that I had to voice it strongly. I was really looking forward to reading Coulter for the first time, seemingly in a mainstream setting, and couldn't have been more disturbed that something of this low calibre could have gotten published. Where were the editors? Where was the critique group? This work should have been much more tightly written and edited, for plot structure and characterization, as well as a dialogue overhaul. I haven't read any of Coulter's other books, but I'm hoping her historicals are much better. She seems to have a following, so one would think so. But, it'll be a long time before I can ever pick another one of her stories without worrying if it will be a big waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Having heard some about the author and enjoying a good mystery - I had high expectations. When I have time to read I like to choose and enjoyable, well-written book. Well-written by my standards includes what one might think - good character development and a compeling,engaging plot. While I felt the author had outlined a good plot and had sketched out the characters interestingly - the development of both seemed to stop there. The characters were never more than cliches and paper cut-outs of characters. The plot was predictable and not all that engaging. The author seemed to know and care more about the weapons the characters carried than the characters themselves.I would not recommend this book to anyone. I will try other Catherine Coulter books after reading some of the reviews of her other books - but I would warn people away from starting with this book as an introduction to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real cliff hanger","review":"Catherine Coulter is one of my favorite authors.

It surely kept my interest, and I never anticipated the ending--which was excellentl."},{"rating":"1","title":"book review","review":"Although the book was awesome the quality of the product was horrible. The paperback book literally fell apart in my hands. I had to read it in sections and throw parts of it away as I read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I've enjoyed some of Ms. Coulter's novels featuring Savich and Sherlock, and they continue to be interesting characters. However, the series overall is uneven in quality, and this is not one of the better ones. The dialogue is somewhat stilted, awkward, and just a little odd at times. There are logic leaps in the plot that left me wondering how a character could reach the conclusion reached. ... This book had interesting parts, but after I'd finished it, I was annoyed with it. I know Ms. Coulter can do better, and I wish she would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep this in mind","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who picked this book up without realizing its written by a romance novelist (you know those books that have the half naked people on the front?). The dialogue and believability of the characters were on par with those in romance novels. I didn't find any of the dialogue remotely believable... a few times I laughed. Do people actually talk like that?After just finishing \\"Deadly Decisions\\" by Kathy Reichs, this book pailed in comparison. I don't read romance novels for the quality of dialogue and the character development.. if you catch my drift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riptide","review":"At one time I enjoyed reading Catherine Coulter novels although I have not done so for quite a few years. I was enticed by Ms. Coulter's blurb on the back cover of the paperback and bought it. What a disappointment! I did hang in and read it to its conclusion, but what a waste of time. The dialogue was inane! True, Ms. Coulter wrote the book but what were the editors and publsher thinking? Just because you have a \\"name\\" doesn't mean the public should be duped into reading nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"The main plot was OK but the story was spoiled because the FBI let a civilian, the victim/witness, take over their investigation. I had a hard time swallowing what was going on. In addition, the text and dialog did not flow. I like this author but her heart wasn't in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I have read all of Coulter's books and usually enjoy them thoroughly (at least 4 stars). This book however was a huge disappointment. The characters were never fully developed. There would be a hint of typcial Coulter humor/ personality and then it would fall through. I'm still a Coulter fan but this book did not live up to her standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPTIDE","review":"A VERY BAD AND BORING READ. A NOVEL,YES, BUT STRECHES CREDIBILTYTO THE MAX.

Becca has a stalker on her tail, so she takes off for Riptide Maine.When she gets there,she finds a house to buy and moves in, and it is there that she finds a strange skeleton in the basement.The story then just poops out from there.From that point, comes all these other characters that are strange. It makes you say, \\"What?\\" I couldn't find it worthwhile enough to even continue, and just quit. When you're reading and the story isn't making sense as this one didn't, why continue?Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars is more appropriate","review":"This is probably the most poorly written work of fiction I have ever come across in my life. The prose is just horrible. Absolutely horrible. I don't know how it ever got past an editor. The story could be interesting, but I can't get past the awful writing.Redundancy abounds, along with excessive attempts at 'flowery' descriptions that just leave you confused or wondering why Coulter can't write language the way it is spoken instead of trying to make herself sound profound. This book seems like something a 6th grader would write. I honestly don't know how it ever got published.But at least it gives this aspiring writer hope about her own attempts at fiction. If Coulter can be a 'bestseller' then I should really get in gear and finish my own novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of God, make it stop!","review":"Having invested three weeks of my life to get through 250 pages of this drivel, I am forcing myself to finish it because... oh hell, I don't know why I'm bothering. After reading the other less than stellar reviews posted here, I think I'll put my time to better use cleaning the rain gutters.The dialog is HORRIBLE! I spent most of the past two weeks thumbing back to see if I missed something or to decipher who was speaking (and to whom!). And don't even get me started on the plot. Or should I write \\"plots\\" because there are approximately 17 of them going at once.My mom gave me this book to read, perhaps in retaliation for my teen years..."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Character Type...","review":"I generally enjoy Catherine Coulter's stories, but I am getting pretty bored with her characters. It seems that they are all various manifestations of the same character (regardless of era). They all talk the same (rather stilted, sort of robot-like), the women all like to hit their men (what is that about??), they all seem to have the same likes, dislikes, predjudices, etc... I'd like to see her introduce some new characters, not give the olds ones new names. It's especially tedious when you have 4 or 6 of them together in the same plot line as in this book (Riptide), some of whom we met in previous stories. Riptide is a basically entertaining story, but I don't think I am going to buy any more of her books - I can re-read the ones I have and get about the same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue leaves a lot to be desired","review":"I was very disappointed with the dialogue in this book. The plot was ok however there was too much going on and not enough conclusions by the time the book was completed. Instead of the FBI and ATF discussing crimes one would have thought that these were high school teenagers talking. FBI agents saying we have trouble \\"Big Time\\"? I don't think so.I have never been so disappointed as I was with THIS book. Having never read this author before I must have been looking for something else because whatever it was?? It was not in this book. Patricia Cornwell?? she is NOT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dialogue Ever","review":"While a few of the reviewers have stated that they couldn't put this book down, I found it difficult to pick it up again after the first chapter. As already mentioned, the character development was weak and most of the story line was ridiculous. My main problem with this book, though, is the dialogue. For example, towards the end of the book, Becca's ex-CIA tough guy father then Adam the dashing hero both say \\"damnation.\\" Not that I enjoy profanity, but it seems implausible that these types of men would use such a weak and wimpy expression to describe the extreme frustration and concern their characters would feel. The weak dialogue and poor character development used really distracted me from what could have been a fun (if implausible) story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I have only read a few books from this author but I have never been disappointed. Becca is a woman who has her own mind and does not need a man to complete her life but wants one to compliment it. I also enjoyed the way the characters from the maze were intertwined with the story. Hopefully we will read more about Adam and Becca if futured books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor proofreading and editing","review":"Aside from title of this review I found the entire story line more likely written by a 14 year old and not a \\"noted\\" New York Times best selling author. I do not intend buying or reading this author ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I'm a big fan of Catherine Coulter, but when I attempted to read this book, I was very disappointed. I didn't like the way the wording of the story was written; sometimes it seemed to jump to different points in the story without a smooth transition. I made it to chapter 7 before I finally gave up and went to the last chapter to figure out who was stalking her. In my opinion, not one of Catherine Coulter's better stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspiring Editors and Writers, there is new found hope!","review":"This was my first Catherine Coulter novel, and though I tried and tried, the prose was simply too repetitive, mistake riddled, and quite frankly awful. Her character development comes off as if it were written by a 4th grader. Though Coulter has a creative mind in putting together a story, there were some pieces of the puzzle come together like trying to reconstruct a shattered whindow. With better editing, fewer \\"Damnations\\" and \\"down to his/her toes\\" the book would have been less frustrating to read. Many a suspenseful moment exist, with good ideas, ruined by the teller's plodding prose.At least at the end, the story answered it's few unanswered questions. I just wish it were put together more effectively and edited by a professional.I will give Coulter another chance, there has to be something to a person who can write several best sellers. Just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was my least favorite of the series, mainly because the main female character \\"Becca\\" wasn't all that likable. Besides the annoying name, she was a loose cannon always going off and doing what she wanted instead of what she was asked/told to do by the professionals who were also becoming her friends. And that they let her get away with all her demands was also unrealistic. The other unrealistic thing was the \\"bad guy\\" just had wayyyy too much info and power for being an unknown person .... too many federal agents were killed and the case was spread out over so much geographical area and he was always right on top of things .... everywhere. Just didn't buy this one. Have really enjoyed the other books in this series though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"This book was a quick read, but I didn't really enjoy it. It seemed wordy to me and the protag was willful, headstrong, and down-right dangerous to those around her. I do like strong female characters, but there were really only two characters in the entire story that I liked and they had bit parts. The descriptions were very good of the locations, but the dialogue was choppy and repetitious. I was disappointed in the overall juvenile feel of the story. I have not read the series in order so this could well be a factor, but I'm not sure that I will try the first at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic relief.","review":"This book started out okay but the farther I got into it, the more ridiculous it became. I am so glad I didn't buy this book but checked it out from my library. Don't waste your time unless you want absurd dialog and unrealistic plots. Catherine Coulter makes everyone look and sound like brainless idiots with all the silly explanations. The book got so silly that I just started laughing. It's really good comic relief if you don't want a serious mystery to read. Don't buy this book. It's not worth it but for a laugh, check it out at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Can't finish this book.","review":"Started kind of perky, then the trite treatment of small townsfolk went on a little long.Two or three paragraphs at night and I am sound asleep.Try reading Looming Tower, a history of Al Qaida.

I have not enjoyed a book so much in a long time that had me turning the pages and glad not to be near the end of the book so I could just keep on reading! Always a delight with her characters, having them reappear in other books is another little extra that this author seems to have a flair for. For everyone who hasnt read her books, its a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagerly devoured","review":"I have really grown to enjoy Savich and Sherlock but was disappointed (slightly) to have them only appear after 100 pages. This book is entertaining and well written. However, towards the end there is a spell where Coulter seems to feel romance should take over. Then it drags. Perhaps if Coulter had cut about 25 pages out of the last 100 this could be remedied. The story of a woman who has lost her mother and is targeted by an unknown stalker does hold one's interest. Tyler is an interesting character but not necessary as a subplot. The workings of the FBI and CIA are entertaining enough. These opinions do not mean I took much time to read the book - two nights actually. However, I can't wait for the next book and hope it is dedicated strictly to that dynamic duo of Savich and Sherlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I have never read dialogue so contrived in my entire life. The tension between Adam and Becca had not point of origin. The tension between Adam and Tyler was stereotypical, to say the least. The way the author ridded the characters and reader of any residual guilt/frustration/regret in regards to Tyler was totally unrealistic and disgustingly half-hearted. Such a cop out! The entire \\"love\\" story was based on notions of \\"Gee, you're hot! I wanna have sex with you! We must be in love!\\" When, at a rather crucial moment Adam said \\"Even my molecules are horny\\" I stood up, threw the book across the room, and laughed for ten mintues straight. I didn't keep it or sell it; I threw it in the bin where it belongs. It was utter trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"I don't think I could say enough bad things about this book. The dialog was stiff and unnatural. The plot was supremely unbelievable. Not only that, you were annoyed with the underdeveloped, useless characters for the fact that they even believed that such rubbish could be going on around them. There was subplot inside subplot inside subplot, none of which made any sense or tied together in any logical way. Unbelievaly bad. The good news is, it serves to give aspiring authors hope: if this got published, anything can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is far too high, if that seems possible","review":"I got through about 240 pages of this book. After the first 60 or 80 pages, it was strictly a case of trying too see if Coulter was as bad a writer as she seemed. She was worse! The characters are pure cardboard and the dialogue is inane, and I mean inane. Can you imagine a Maine vacation town called Riptide--why not Shark Beach. Every street is named after a poison flower--how charming! Five minutes after meeting our heroine, her former nerdy, now super stud, college classmate announces that the whole town thinks he murdered his vanished wife. The plot and dialogue remind me of Stuart Woods, who now looks like a great writer by comparison. What a piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last Coulter book.","review":"This is the first book that I have read by bestselling author Catherine Coulter and the worst thing I have read in a long while. Prose so bad I found myself rereading whole paragraphs just to make sure I had read it correctly the first time. It so many ways it reads like a first draft not a finished work. The dialog so stilted it seems to have come the mind of a 14 year old. The reader ends up not caring one whit about the characters or their fate, how does a book like this ever become a best seller? Might I suggest the latest Nevada Barr or Susan Whittig Albert, everything by either of them is great. For Ms. Coulter sake, and her many fans. I hope this book was just a glitch in a long string of bestsellers. I will never know however, because this is my first and last Catherine Coulter book that I am going to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than Minus tide","review":"Take a look at the reviews for any of Coulter's FBI series and the comments are all pretty much the same. She is the author people love to hate.If you are looking for an excellent writer that can keep you in suspense while using very descriptive language that adds to the enjoyment try Michael Connelly for one. No slang expressions here that sound like some teenager's writing and the FBI agents sound like FBI agents. They don't drag their 6 month old baby on the job for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb characters","review":"I thought the author said these were some of the CIA and FBI's best operatives. These are the most inept characters I have ever seen. They couldn't guard a dog. The plot didn't come off as realistic or plausible. A high school student could have done better. I gave this book a two star rating because I enjoyed the update on Sherlock and Savich, however, they appeared to have also been struck by the incompent virus. Looking over some of the reviews, I think many readers bought the book based on satisfaction with past books. Authors need to protect their reputations. It is easy to throw a half done effort out to the public and make sales based on past results once or twice, but that won't last forever. These characters and this plot got dumber by the chapter. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. The plot made no sense, from the absurd names in the town, to the heroine hanging out with a guy who might have killed his wife while being stalked anonymously.

Also, there are some long quiet scenes with no dialogues, but I was really fascinated by that and not bored at all! The scenery is really beautiful and the actors are great.

I liked it. It was a little confusing. There was three time differences. The vacation with his family, the time he tried to commit suicide and then when he came back. But the thing that shocked me was when i was watching the extras and the press was asking Jeremie if it was difficult (or something) playing in a gay role. I thought that he was gay. In the two movies-this one included-of his i have seen he is a gay character. But the movie is GREAT. strongly reccomended to anyone with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloriously understated","review":"I found Come Undone a pleasure to watch.

That's exactly why I liked this movie! The director doesn't take you for a [person] and let you fill in the blanks. God, do we ALWAYS need to see movies that are explained from A to Z? Also, there are some long quiet scenes with no dialogues, but I was really fascinated by that and not bored at all! The scenery is really beautiful and the actors are great. If you want some freshness, a little unshamefully exposed nudity (a la French) and a passionate love story, buy this Dvd! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complexity that leaves you thinking afterwards","review":"My boyfriend and I decided to catch a gay-themed foreign film one day while I was in a two-week long civil court trial and got something that neither of us expected. \\"Come Undone\\" seems to be your typical European \\"boy meets boy\\" movie at first, but the varied changes of time and place combined with the subtle inlays of the inherent difficulties found in a gay relationship keeps you thinking after the movie ends. Comparable to the British film \\"Get Real\\" in storyline but more somber and closer to a tragic drama than the tragic comedy found in the British counterpart.Even though \\"Come Undone\\" is not rated by the MPAA, due to sexual content and other adult themes this movie is definitely not for those under 18."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of Summer","review":"First love, loss and healing surround a boy's discovery of his unique identity outside familial quandaries and limitations. Elkam's performance as Mathieu is astoundingly heartfelt and articulate in portraying this young man's emergence from sheltered apathy into life's passion and unpredictable temperament.Unlike other movies of this genre, the controversy surrounding the boys' orientation and relationship serve to add a compelling depth to the plot, rather than a clich�� anecdote.With the mood shifting throughout as the viewer becomes more aquainted with the boys' feelings toward one another, one also can sense the resistance among the other characters to this level of intimacy between young men. The actors deliver such genuine connection between these characters, the innocence of such a love is self-evident.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicite Sex a plus - Everything Else was huge flop","review":"In short - this movie was pleasing to the eye with the acting and explicite nudity - but overall the screenplay was terrible, the direction was shotting, the editing was all over the place - and there was too much scenery when there didn't need to be....to much silence killed this film.

This procedure of turning 200 and something minutes into 80 minutes a fun and wacky ride.

Reb Beach is a blistering guitar player and Wild Mick and Jeff Pilson are as strong a rhythm section as ever, but I can't get past the vocal issue. My advice: go see them live, enjoy the still-excellent live show, and treasure the memories.

If you really want to hear what Dokken sounds like live, go pick up Beast From the East or even One Live Night. I'd say go see them in concert, but without George there's no point. Reb Beach is a great guitar player, but he's no George Lynch. And Reb is the first one to admit it! I've already heard him butcher classic Dokken tunes in concert. Why would I now want to buy the CD?

Obviously, AI is a compelling subject - what makes humans human? But unfortunately, the human characters in the book are shallow, unlikable, and not particularly human.

Because I felt that Powers spent waaay too much time on his past relationship with C. While it had relevance to the story, he could have gotten the gist across in fewer, shorter flashbacks. It seemed like so much filler. I did love, however, the take on Pygmalion. The parralells and other allusions made it a wonderful story. But brush up on your cognitive and physiological psychology before you attempt to tackle this book! A lot of big concepts and words get thrown around in the process of creating Helen.

Accordingly, I was excited by the premise and promise of Galatea 2.2. It seemed likely that Richard Powers could explore this field in a thought-provoking, valuable, or interesting new way.Unfortunately not. This isn't really a book about Helen, or about AI. The whole concept of Helen exists only as a foil for the musings and life discoveries of the autobiographical protagonist; she could be replaced by a socially stunted colleague or disabled child and nearly none of the text would have to change.It may be worthwhile fiction, but if your interest is in the supposed topic rather than the author, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasurable struggle","review":"A sometimes difficult book, especially with all of the computer references that are included (which are not exactly my forte'). Still, it remains a very good book, for we get a good sense of the protagonist's being adrift in a new life. It is interesting how he tries to find some handhold on his world while mixed in with people who very nearly speak a whole other language than himself. I am always attracted to characters who are spiritually wounded, yet manage to summon the courage to continue on with their lives, as well as to tackle daunting tasks. However, this isn't one of those books that will leave you happy and fuzzy after the last page. Those of you who swear by a certain talk show host's club's selections may want to avoid this one. But, if you like giving your brain cells a bit of a workout, this work is definitely a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always intellectually engaging, frequently moving","review":"Aside from the first 20 pages or so, which struck me as sort of pretentious (I started and stopped a couple of times), and the romantic interest in the graduate student, which seemed forced and poorly developed, this novel is pretty close to perfect.The amount of emotional weight Powers can make one feel for a machine - and almost all of the novel's characters - is astonishing. Plus this whole book has a sincerity that a lot of other erudite modern fiction seems to lack. One can feel that Powers put of lot more of himself into this book than just his knowledge of artificial intelligence and literature, which is more than I can say for most of the brainy/flashy stuff that people are writing nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive novel yet somehow disappointing","review":"With this current novel, Powers has undertaken a theme which addresses the position of humanity in the information age. It is a modern-day \\"Frankenstein,\\" but with love, instead of hate, as the binding force between creator and created. Although Powers has a command of the English language that is really astounding, his depiction of characters seems lacking at times. The figures in this novel often seem to have the exact same voice - they are all hip and ironic, possessing a flair for allusions to culture's produce. If only there would be a little variety! The computer mind that is created in the novel also becomes unbelievable - not that realism always needs to be adhered to, but the way that the computer almost immediately begins to express emotional states is simply not convincing. Yet \\"Galatea 2.2\\" is overall a provocative and entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"good day","review":"Well I was quite dissapointed with this.

The record is avaialble if you search online, but is going for a higher price. However if you are a AWB fan you must have this version. It is the best jam I've ever heard. This version can also be heard, but cut by 15 minutes, on their re-release of AWB. Why it was cut I'll never understand. It was from the same record label and it had plenty of space to fit it all.

I mean, I really wanted this to work.To make sure it was not just me I gave some to my mother who is going through menopause and goes through slight bouts of anxiety as well. She told me it actually made her feel \\"jittery\\" and left a bad taste in her mouth. My therapist taught me some special breathing exercises that instantly calm me down.

Tonight, I am up past midnight studying for nursing finals and my 9 month male cat, Rudy, was totally, out-of-control...trying to get my attention. When he wasn't climbing all over me and my desk, he was trying to get into cabinets, terrorizing my dog, etc. I tried feeding him...he wasn't hungry. HE WAS BORED-so was getting into everything, this lasted for about an hour--and I couldn't study at all with his distractions. I remembered that I had Rescue Remedy so I put 2-3 drops into his mouth. He hated the taste (so I gave him a few crunchies). Within 5 minutes, Rudy settled down and is now sleeping on the couch.

So, it didn't hardly relax or \\"rescue\\" anybody. I noticed before we purchased it that the main ingredient is alcohol, so I suggested to the missus that we skip buying this product and spend a few dollars more to just get a bottle of Jack Daniels. At least that way, I could have been relaxed if my cat wasn't. The missus was afraid I wouldn't give the cat the right \\"dose\\" of Tennessee medicine, and she really wanted to give Bach's a try.

But no real open-minded attempt was made to examine the cause of Scorpion's sinking, and the prose is plodding and repetitive.Points here for effort, but overwhelmingly poor marks for the author's numbingly dull style and failure to discuss and objectively analyze all possible information about the submarine.Silent Steel is a book that never moves from where it begins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Steel","review":"Too much detail, almost an analysis. i'm an avid fan of Submarine reads but this just didnt satisfy my inner desires.

There are some images you can actually use in the package, but not nearly as many as they claim! I found some 350 variations of ONE picture (1 easter egg).

Just as Vol. I has, the book of color thumbnails is excellent, but I never use it because I can see all of the thumbnails on the computer. I have XP, and it took a phone call to Hemera to figure out the totally non-intuitive way to get it to work with XP, but it's definitely worth it. The images are varied and clear, and beats any other clip art package I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definate Downgrade","review":"If you don't own volume one, you will probably like this suite. If you do own volume one, you will definately hate it. Absolute waste of money at half the price. Most of the pics are washed out tapestry scenes that have virtually no practical use anywhere.

I remember long ago I was highly anticipating this album thinking about how much I love Green Day and it's been awhile since an album...but I wish I wasn't so excited.With a few highs and lows (Main high: Ha Ha Your Dead...Main Low: Scumbag)this album is a failure. So bad I was almost skeptical about buying American Idiot the day it came out....(good thing I wasn't) Just there isn't much more to say except spend money on American Idiot, Dookie, Kerplunk, Insomniac, Nimord, 1037/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours or even Waiting, but please stay away from this pile of Green Day \\"Dookie\\" if I may...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had wanted Teen Pop I would have bought N*Sync","review":"I love all the other Green Day stuff I have but this CD is not up to par.

Not me thoough, one of my favorite Greenday songs ever is from their Warning album (Castway). But now i go out and buy this CD, for the first time i am disapointed. The songs on this CD, stink! Yeah maybe one or two remained catch for a couple of days but if your a fan who heard a track from this CD on the radio and are thinking of buying it don't. I'm sorry i would goto the end of the world for Greenday, but i gotta be honest this cd is no good. I don't even suggest old fans to buy this.

As it turns out, I know that this is a compilation album but it flows like it could've been an actual one. If I had to compare it to any of their albums, I would say that it most closely resembles \\"Nimrod\\". Not only does it sound similar to \\"Nimrod\\" but at some points this collection takes you back to the \\"Dookie/Insomniac\\" feel in addition to the diversity yet punk inspired \\"Nimrod\\". I didn't feel the urge to skip a single track on this, it's nearly flawless. Even the covers of the Kinks and Ramones songs sound terrific with Green Day's own spin on them.So in short, if you love Green Day from the mid-90's or the album \\"Nimrod\\", you'll love this collection of songs.Even the people who are into their newer stuff can appreciate some of what's on here I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente disco","review":"Como todo fan de Green Day que se respete disfrute mucho escuchando las canciones directamente desde el disco original, mis favoritas: Ha ha you're dead, Desensitized, Tired of waiting for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its pretty good.....","review":"This album is pretty good a few bad songs but thats it, by my standards thats a good CD.

Highlight songs are you lied which is one of the only oringanal songs of theres on the album might i add. the first song on the cd which is suffocate is a very cathcy tune it will have you singing for ever and it wont get out of your head. they also did over a classic the kink song tired of waitong for you. They did this perfectly. and they have a classic ramones song outsider as well which doesent sound so much as the ramones but still greatly done. another great and young song is i wanna be on t.v. all in all this is a good cd but not the best but if ur looking for some great catchy tunes to listen too buy this if not buy warning or dookie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, but Too Short","review":"Listen, Green Day is my favorite band, and I was really looking forward to this album.

True, it has it's ups with Suffocate, Don't Wanna Fall In Love, and Desensitized, and true it does have some catchy beats, but overall, this album is a complete flop. This album which came 2 years before AI is the downfall of Green Day. Most of the album is either really really fast, or depressing and slow. For those of you who are AI fans, this is NOT the album for you. I listened to this album after finding out about AI in the beginning of '05. I was so disgusted that I deleted the album from my computer until the summer when I put three songs on it.

There are 14 tacks on it, but its only about 30 min. This is a great collection of B-sides, and i'm suprised that suffocate, as well as some others, didn't make an album and are B-sides. There is only one track on there that i didn't like too much, and that's only because it didn't have any lyrics in it (Espionage).

Being a major fan of the band for a few years this is new stuff for me on \\"shenanigans but not enough. The only new song on the record is \\"Ha Ha Your Dead\\", which to me is okay, it was nothing like \\"Suffocate\\" or \\" Outsider\\".

This however is most certainly not. The songs here are all strong and fit suprisingly well together. I'd compare it to a really unified mix-tape. Remember the rules of High Fidelity, start of great (Suffocate) and then step it up a notch (Desesitized), then take it down a notch (You Lied) so as not to peak to early, and I assume the rule is work towards a low point, but great nonetheless (I wanna be on TV) and then gradually climb towards the mind blowing finale (Ha Ha You're Dead). Yeah excellent work, not ephemera at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Not the best of green-day comes out in this album.

Warmly written, funny and touching, she also fills out the book with very well-researched scientific info on feral cats, and cat populations.

So, if I want to make a smoothie, I just press the button and off she goes. I will say one thing, if you are going to make a smoothie follow their reccommendations about how to load your ingredients. For some it might be a \\"no-brainer\\", but for me being a novice to making green smoothies, well, just making smoothies period; it came in handy. My only regret is that I bought the three inch blade and not the four inch, but that can be easily rectified, I'm just going to buy an additional container. Other than that, I LOVE this blender and I would definitely reccommend it to anyone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not purchase this again","review":"I've had my blendtec for 1 year. It stopped working almost exactly 1 yr. after purchase. I had to ship it to the repairs center in Utah (cost me about $40!!) over a month ago and it's still not shipped back to me. I have to say, the blender could handle alot more than a regular blender, but I've used a Ninja and a Vitamix and they are comparable if not better! I made mostly green smoothies and soups. You def. need a liquid in there to blend with or else the blade will spin and spin and make horrible sounds like it's about to blow up. Another reviewer pointed out that the light weight of the machine is a negative. I agree 100%.

No new ending appeared.The book was a little dull at first, but then became interesting in the middle as I got to know other characters and wonder how Florence will do with her new enterprise. I was hoping for a good ending to have made the read worthwhile. I won't \\"spoil\\" the ending--just go to your local library or bookstore and look at the last line; you'll see why it's not worth reading.It's fine for a 'slice of life', not so great if you want a plot and a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every word resonates","review":"This tiny book is also one of the saddest I have read.

I wanted to get emotionally involved with Mrs. Green - there was such potential for development in this character - the place she was at in life, starting over, not quite fitting in, the bookshop not being wanted - but without the development of the plot and characters, there was no life to this book.

A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"After reading many reviews of this book (not just Amazon's), I expected to find a \\"jewel,\\" but I was sadly disappointed. More of a vignette than a novel, this book's characters are not at all well-developed. We are taken through a day-to-day journey of a woman's attempt to open and run a bookshop in a village that doesn't want one. For all of us who care about reading and books, it is a marvelous premise.

There was a point, about midway, that I thought there might be a substantive plot. I was wrong. I never felt Florence had passion about her bookshop - and that bothered me: The story of a woman in mid-life, putting her savings and her name on the line to open this bookshop in a small isolated town should have elicited great sympathy from me.

Boldness and TRUTH was found in Lie of the Tithe where masking and yoking with the same burdens were found here. I have learned that when Nobody 777 says its good you should look out. He seems to be a religious something or other. The book falls short by a MILE from delivering the solid truth and will trap people into bondage again in the long run.

Out of those stories came this enchanting book, a semi-novel for children and wise adults, a series of stories both hilarious and profound told and experienced during a family's journey to visit relatives by the ocean. De Angulo's luminous vision gives us as intimate a picture of a Native American vision of life as any book I can think of. That this classic is not better known is a mystery...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Delight!","review":"This book rates as one of my favorite five of all time...If you are a northern Californian (a REAL Californian) this book can attach you to your landscape in the most delightful ways. It is actually a re-telling, a new story which incorporates many many California native tales into a simple story of a family from California DreamTime that take a walking journey from their inland home to the coast. It was both of my kids' favorite read-aloud bedtime book, and the droll illustrations by the author (a physician who helped start UCSF med center, and a buddy of the Kroebers etc.) are equally sublime."},{"rating":"1","title":"suitable for children","review":"I thought this was only a mediocre collection of tales, not especially well told, and that it properly belongs in the Children's books category"},{"rating":"2","title":"KILO ROCK BRAVO","review":"As so many forms, and sub genre's of music develop and change thier very nature, so did that somewhat mundane version of jazz known as \\"Big Band Jazz\\". In short the essence of what was once an element which had so much talent going for it, but seemed at times to mire in the rigidity of its orchestrations emerged in the late 60's and 70's into a vibrant musical form with dazzeling power, drive, and a new crop of jaw dropping solo preformers. Altough the later, more nationaly recognized Fergeson, and Rich bands would achieve an unbelievable level of quality, in the begining there was Terry Gibbs big Band. The power acheivable by correct orchestration of big groups is wonderful, but the magic is to still have that gutty feeling driving down the middle of the musical highway.

Centipede is such a gosh awful mess that it is difficult where to start. The bottom line is that too many people were involved in this project-over 50-each of them trying to improvise something to show off their jazz prowess (thought Julie Tippett was a terrible singer before? you just wait until you hear her improvised wailing); what they ended up with was a sonic hurricane of musicians playing barely in tune and trying to play louder than their neighbor.

Anyone who owns a dog or cat will need this book.

I was severely disappointed to learn that the very chapter I wanted to thoroughly dissect was rewritten from being operating system independent to being operating system dependent, the dependent operating systems being DOS and Windows 95/98. A good deal of the information in this book depends upon these operating systems and will not work with Windows 2000, ME, or XP.The book provides meticulously thorough backgrounds, mundane explanations, and vague and ambiguous examples. Personally, I wish the depth of information was structured completely opposite.If you just want to \\"learn the ropes\\" of Assembly and have access to a DOS or Windows 95/98 machine to learn them on, this book will do.

I have read a great number of programming books, and with that said, this book has little value beyond reference.

In fact I have read two other books in my quest to understand assembly. But this book is definitely the best I have came across. The author has broken down the assembly instructions into many chapters that can be useful in locating the subject of interest, and skipping those that do not pertain to the reader's interest. His explanation of the interrupts and their associated services are uncanny. He has organised them into modular format so that the programmer can write programs as though he/she is connecting a large jigsaw puzzle. To my experience this made reading and writing assembly much easier task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok text, but horrible examples","review":"This book is ok reading.

Then 3 strippers break off from the Chippendales, and the creator wants them killed. Why? He can't take the competition. Well. Who cares about this dreadful story anyway. There are holes in it bigger than J.P. Pitoc's hair. So with a movie like this, with no plot, shouldn't we at least see what we expect to see, some manhood? Well, no, the guys are dancing in the 1980's, and their hair is awful, and costumes are tacky. Their bodies are okay, but come on, that hair, and those mustaches? Good grief.

That is exactly the location and time period of this series, which starts with new settlers arriving in virtual wilderness and ends with the land being cleared and cities founded. Leaving aside the soap-opera elements, this movie is the story of the pioneer experience in the near Midwest.There are some really nice performances in this, even though at times the script is wooden and the story trite.

Still, Panasonic wants the consumer to purchase a new battery at their expense for a product that should be under warranty and is obviuosly sub par from comparative reviews. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"outgoing message on answering machine always faint, static and a little garbled; can't erase messages remotely so while away the machine fills up-even if you check it; after a couple of years the speaker stopped working, could only here messages when I checked remotely through the handset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses the signal a lot","review":"Disappointing. This phone loses the signal from the base frequently, with up to 5 second periods where you cannot hear the person you are speaking with, and they cannot hear you. It gets worse the further you get from the base, but even from across the room (15 ft.) it regularly loses the signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This phone rocks","review":"This is the best phone we've ever owned. In the last year i've thrown away 3 cordless phones who's batteries didn't last or got horrible reception. I'm buying a second one for our bedroom and i'd buy a 3rd or 4th when i need them. The speakerphone is cool because you can switch back and forth just using the handset (most speakphones can only be used from the base)so my toddlers can talk to grandma on speakerphone from just the handset, since they never seem to get the phone positioned right on their ear! The caller id holds more than enough numbers, the battery seems to last forever and i've dropped it on our ceramic tile kitchen floor dozens of times without the slightest damage (i wouldn't recommend replicating my study though) You won't be sorry. I can't praise this phone enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does The Job","review":"The two most important features I was looking for was a speakerphone on the handset and a phone that used the 900MHZ frequency (so as not to intefere with my Linksys wireless network). This phone met both criteria at an affordable price. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has broken twice in less than a year","review":"The handset sound quality is excellent and the caller ID works fine.

Very poor reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features","review":"This is a great phone. It has handset speakerphone, the most useful feature. Other important feature I rate high is keypad on base. It is annoying at times when handset is not accessible, one cannot call from the base, for example, when the battery goes dead. This phone has full functionality on the base including keypad, speakerphone (except CID).My only complaint is that I have to hold the handset close to my face so that the person on the other side can hear me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwww","review":"what a horrid phone!

Poor Handset Sound quality.","review":"As a Panasonic product fan, this phone is not one of their better products. It has great phone features at a reasonable price but poor sound quality for people on the other end of this phone. People you speak to from the handset say you sound like you are calling from inside a box or \\"phone booth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems with this phone","review":"I bought this phone about 6 months ago swayed by the positive reviews and the features on this phone. Just a month after purchase, this phone has developed many problems. The main one being that when I make phone calls, the people I am talking to always complain that they cannot hear me. I have to speak very very loudly for the other party to hear me. Additionally, if the TV or music is on, it creates a lot of echo on the headset so that it becomes impossible to hear the other party. I do not know if I just got a bad unit, but I am not too happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handset failed after 9 months","review":"As others have noted, this product has a nice feature set and reasonable to good voice clarity, esp. on the speakerphone. In fact, I liked it so much that I bought the version without the answering device to use as a wall mount phone in our kitchen.The problem we had was when the handset became unable to link to the base. Since operating the phone relies so heavily on using the handset (to pickup caller ID records, set the time, etc.) it's not really functional in this state.I'm now shopping for an separate answering machine. I've come to the conclusion that it may not be the best idea to combine the answering machine with the phone itself - a failure means replacing everything. I'm really disappointed that the Panasonic failed in so short a period - while it worked it was actually pretty good. While I could return it for repairs, I don't really want to be without an answering machine for the month or two that would take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I would not recommend at all.

NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery power sucks!","review":"I thought this phone was great when I first got it, but just a few months later I am now learning that the battery is terrible. Even if I do not use the phone all day, If I leave it off the base over night it is dead in the morning. I can not believe how bad this battery is. All the other features of the phone seem nice. It is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Cordless......","review":"I always had clicks and drop outs with this phone since day one. Now that i have my phone over the cable this cordless has only gotten worse. If your not standing 2 feet from it your caller will not hear you. If I had a choice I would go back and buy a AT&T phone. Never had a problem in the 8 years that I used it....I recommend that you do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Interface, Suspect Battery, Bad Customer Service","review":"The problems started when the battery wouldn't fully charge. I charged it overnight to it's full capacity, but the battery ready never grew past \\"one bar\\". Obviously, the phone was brand new, so there was no problem with the charge connection, and the \\"charge\\" light was on, indicating it was receiving power. However, after three days, the phone never charged to capacity. So I called Panasonic, and they told me to clean the receptors. Keep in mind, the phone is brand new, so there would be no need to clean the receptors. Then customer service told me that there was probably a defect in the battery. They then instructed me to go out and buy an extra battery. I couldn't believe it. The phone was brand new! It's their responsibility to replace defective parts. I'm done with Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"diconnects calls and battery dies","review":"This phone is not worth the bother. My sister and I both have one and have the same problems.

There are few examples and there are no guided practice problems/solutions. That is good for the professor I guess since they don't have to worry about homework as much, but my chemistry books always have at least odd numbered problems with solutions and a solutions manual so you know whether or not you're doing the problems right.

The arrangements are attractive and varied enough to keep up the listener's interest, and the performances are masterful without being slick. And, as always, the wire-strung harp has a clarity and openness that transforms whatever is played on it. All of Ball's albums are good, but this one approaches perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine effort from Patrick Ball","review":"For Celtic Harp music lovers, this is a must.

These are also very efficient, I'm powering them with anOnkyo TX-8255 Stereo Receiver(50w/ch) - and I rarely have it past half volume!Deep bass is also present, but more so at higher volumes. They don't need a subwoofer, but having one doesn't hurt either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing speakers","review":"I just received these 2 days ago and I was blown away by the sound. I was expecting good sound, but got great sound for the price. It sounded great with any kind of material, I threw Jazz, Rock, Classical, even some metal and rap at it and it performed beautifully.

The tweeters blew out the first time we played them (at half volume on a new receiver that puts out half the power these speakers are rated for). Polk sent us new tweeters. They lasted about 2 weeks, maybe 10 hours of use. Again, the tweeters blew at about half volume (about 50 watts per channel). They were wired correctly. We'll ask Polk to replace them again, but this is ridiculous! What happens when the warranty expires? They sound great until the tweeters blow, but what good does that do? These are junk. We'd give zero stars if we could. My husband's 31-year-old DCM IVs at least handle anything we dish out.

I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Lovely!","review":"I purchased these as part of my Home Theater Christmas-present-to-myself, and I couldn't be happier.

Where to start first...within the first 5 hours of listening at med volume the tweeter in the right speaker went out and then within 10 hours of listening at med volume mind you the tweeter in the left speaker went out, so now i have 2 speakers that have no tweeters and upon contacting polk audio i was denied repair because J&R Music and Computer World is not an authorized seller of polk products. I have already replaced these with some Infinity tower speakers and will be sure not to ever purchase A polk audio product ever again. Be warned I have done some research after purchase and found that the tweeters going out on these speakers is A common problem.

The ability to bi-amp is a nice feature, especially at this price point.I purchased these as my first set of floor-standing speakers, and they sound so rich that the lossy part of my music collection is highly discernible from the rest. Luckily for me, it is because my high end audio sources sound exponentially better.When your playing Dolby TrueHD & DTS-HD Master Audio sources, the fidelity difference over the digital standard reminds me of the first time I listened to a CD. Live music performances are especially enjoyable.You will need an equally capable sub woofer, but that is a given and doesn't detract from these speakers.I would recommend these to everyone, but if your concerned at all by sound quality, these really need a decent receiver with the latest formats and a good sub.

The battery life problems started after the return period. I didn't look into warranty repairs as I hobbled along on the week battery of both phones & made sure to charge at all times except when in use.When straight out of the cradle I can have as long as one single 1-hour phone call - but with any additional calls, the battery drops the call.

Answering Machine is good, but do not forget you are purchasing one of the most expensive phones in the market on its class (Siemens is way better). Caller ID never fails (yeahhhh). Reception is usually good, but I had complains from people who could not hearing me very well. Buttons do not work all the time. Oh I almost forgot.Operating the phone is not convinient at all, for a simple redial you need to touch three buttons. For most of the people that owned this phone for more than 6 months I descriebed their phone. For you who want to spend that money on this cool looking phone, better think twice.

Take these hooks for instance. Why on earth would you need a 'loose' hinged hook that pivots and lifts up, when you try to lift the thing off that's hanging from it? Try to lift your your oven mitt off one of these hooks with one hand (while the other is busy - as is typical in a kitchen) and the hook unhelpfuly lifts also, clutching the loop that your mitt hangs from even tighter; not letting the thing loose.Frustrating & nonsensical.

The same thing for the basic poses. Barbara will occasionally mention the name of the pose that she is leading us into, but without a clear reference of what that pose is or what it looks like, it's hard to know if I am doing the pose right or even have the correct pose to the name she is using.The DVD could be great if there were more instruction on the basics of breathing and poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems decent","review":"So I ordered this looking for something to help me with stress, I haven't gotten through a lot of the DVD but I can't really complain being completely new to yoga. The beginning stuff seems like meditation with stretching, concentrating on the breath and such. It was definitely relaxing although she seems to use props a lot which kind of annoyed me. I didn't want to run around looking for blankets or pillows to use for stretch moves. I'm not sure how common it is to use stuff like that though for Yoga, might be the norm.

After about 3 weeks of using this DVD twice a week for about a half hour I started finding that that my body is able to do a little more each time and it's starting to really come together for me.Remember to not skip the interview.

I'm coming back to yoga after many years of thinking it couldn't do me any good. This is a wonderful DVD to use to get back into it. It offers am/pm workouts of various lengths -- pick one, or combine a couple. Benagh looks and sounds like a genuinely nice person. In my opinion, she is a gifted instructor and worth checking out if ashtanga and hot yoga are really not your thing. I like the beach settings and the music is not intrusive or repetitive -- just pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying waves, lacks pace","review":"The background on Yoga for Beginners is just too much of a distraction and the pleasant voice is also a bit too soothing - I felt like dozing off and I just didn't have the patience to endure to the end of any of the lessons.

For more focus on yoga while remaining awake and aware, I prefer any and all of the Yoga Journal videos with Jason Crandell and the Yoga Step by Step series of CD's with Natasha Rizopoulos.

Her DVD contains an introduction to Yoga, a wealth of introductory knowledge and more advanced routines for you to follow when comfortable. Whether your goal is to start your day off right, relax from a hard day's work or build strength, she has a routine for you to enjoy.I highly recommend this DVD if you are new and interested in yoga.

You will need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning yoga dvd","review":"This video is perfect for both me and my husband.

It gives you a lot of different options. For instance, if you're in a certain mood, you can do a routine that's good for that mood or if you would like to only do a routine for a certain length of time, there's an option for that too.

BUT, she provides easy to follow instruction with gentle modifications to get the most out of the pose. This DVD is packed with yoga routines: the first 8 range from sun salutations, hip openers, core strength, standing poses, gentle unwind. She then also includes 8 more routines ranging from 20-70 minutes that incorporate the aforementioned moves. This is a must for any yoga collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga video","review":"This purchase was a good value. There are lots of exercise routines on the DVD.

Well this is not for beginners, as I have seen stated in several posts now it is a little speedy. I also have to first of all try to still see the screen and be laying on the fall turned around while attempting the movements. By the time I am in the actual movement and able to get set she is off to another move. If I were limber already I would not need begginners yoga.

Her directions lagged behind the video which was confusing in the begginning. Transitions from one portion of the workout to another were abrupt and the editting was poor. She is not graceful in her movements which did not inspire me much. It advertises a wide variety of workouts but in fact, most are targetted to specific body areas and are very brief. The two longer workouts are almost the same except for the addition of a few more challenging poses in one. I am very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little more difficult than expected","review":"I am trying yoga for the first time, and will find another video until I learn more of the yoga basics. Speaking as a true beginner, this video seems to be better suited for someone who is on the higher end of beginner or low end of intermediate levels. There is no basic explanation of the poses, so I was looking at the television to figure out what she was doing as opposed to concentrating on my breathing and pose.I do enjoy the scenery and sounds of the ocean waves. Her voice is very soothing, and it's obvious she lives yoga. I will come back to this video when gain more strength and knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner Class At Home","review":"I had started to take a yoga class, but did not have time to continue with things I have to do, but I enjoyed it after a couple of classes.This has worked as a great way to conitnue to learn as a beginner, it is just like beeing in class wwith the way she presents the material and cues you on the moves and positioning with the appropropriate breaks/pauses as needed.Definately a worthwhile video for those starting to learn yoga and the main things, such as breathing and the poses that are used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo boring.","review":"This video is sooo slow.

It was a gift for my wife, who says that she actually does yoga, though I've never actually seen her do it.My flexibility begins and ends at being able to reach behind my head to toss a handful of change into the basket at the toll booth. The thought of yoga brings to mind bored, soy latte-sipping, tofu-eating women sitting around a loft studio in the trendy part of town, unrolling mats onto a hardwood floor before practicing their Downward Dog.Whatever that is.Yoga is supposed to promote health, flexibility, circulation, longevity, sex life, memory and cooking skills. Heck, it probably even makes you smell better, I don't know. But my wife does.

However; many appallingly casual, highly offensive racial slurs spoiled this one for me. I found it hard to appreciate the finely-crafted white characters and apt depiction of moral struggle, whilst being so frequently derailed by the vulgar depictions of black servants. Yes, it was 1890, so a few racist references might be expected - perhaps cringed at and overlooked - but we're talking dozens of n-words, scores of disrespectful depictions, and too many ugly incidents to be ignored. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Self-assumed Burden","review":"To live by one's conditioning, moral and religious, or to follow one's heart-- which? Not everything Good is good for us, and in this short novel Chopin shows us the price paid for doing the Right Thing: deprivation and unhappiness, but never a scandal.There are points in this book where I had to stop and admire the prose. Chopin's writing is easy and articulate, just how I like it. Her characters are exceptionally real, their personalities well-defined.

This \\"full length\\" movie is based on the original short that was shot in a garage. The precise attention to time laps is beyond compare. Cameras dance with tripods that are being attacked by a clapper board. The best part of the film is the sound track and the sync with the action. The heads of spot-lights spin in time with the music and the wizard walks on a wall with sound efx. This a work that looks like something Disney would do. But no, one (or mabey several) Jittlov, a green robe with stars, and a full load of original talent. To quote the transfer tech in the movie \\"far out man\\". And it is.

I don't think so....Anyway, my own feelings towards this film is that it is decent, but no where near what could be accomplished if Jittlov would stop playing martyr and move on.I'm waiting for a DVD of this--containing the movie, and his short subjects--as many that can be fitted onto a disc. I don't think that will happen, but I can dream, you know.Please do like the fact Jittlov got a movie made. Just be honest about it and say \\"it's nice, but not that good a film.\\"With a shoe string budget, it accomplishes many things. But the budget keeps it from accomplishing anything where Jittlov's imagination would work wonders.Too bad Jittlov got into a snit over the film.

Don't expect a realistic view of high school girls' search for popularity and the mistreatment of those who don't fit in. This is a hokey play on witchcraft (trying to catch the Harry Potter crowd?) and popularity. It's too cheesey to be scary or disturbing & it's just plain silly without being humorous.This is definitely NOT \\"Mean Girls\\" or like it, & I'm not sure why the group of girls are called \\"The Bitches\\" when they are not really mean or cruel to everyone at school. They even rotate having lunch with all the different groups just so they can continue to be adored!The plot is just so unbelievable and unrealistic it's almost insulting. Don't waste your money on this one! (Check it out from a library if you're still curious)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin Bizzare","review":"This book was soooo weird.

It started out good and I was excited that Jane, the main character, finally was becoming part of the popular group, the Bitches. Then when she tries to be a good person she gets stabbed in the back by the person she was trying to help. This angered me. Jane was a rebel and was doing good and all she got out of it was being smacked in the face. Oh yeah and she got Phil as a friend or whatever. It was a bad ending. There was no happy ending after the good deed. After reading all I could think was THIS SUCKS! If you want to see the good girl that everyone can relate to get hurt and have an awful life in the end then you should read this book.

Not.Because a tiny part of Jane's brain is telling her this is wrong.But the bigger part of her brain is making up excuses for her and the other Bitches' behavior.But when Bitsy (the junior Bitch) tries to harm another girl named Camilla Jane stops making excuses and tries to help Camilla who's not as innocent as she seems.This is a good book that will make you look at the popular girls at your school and think \\"Are they really that ruthless?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhymes with scrap","review":"This book is extremely predictable...At first, you are introduced to a teen queen wannabe-Jane.

As Jane starts to become one of them, she learns their secrets and rituals.At some point in the book, they talk about \\"Sandy\\" who happens to be a school teacher. A little confusing? Yes. Myracle, doesn't even bother to go in depth about her role in the story, and only briefly touches on the subject.My advice to you? Don't read this book. Although the story may seem intriguing at the beginning, it is anything but. It's extremely predictable and much like the mean girls story, except harsher, and a little creepier. Afterall, it does deal with witchcraft.Hope this helped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Attempt","review":"Rhymes with Witches is about a social outcast, Jane, who gets invited into the school royalty group called The Bitches. I found this book to be exactly like the rest of Lauren's books. Even though her books have a very shallow plot, you can't seem to put them down. And then once you get done with it you feel very dissatisfied and wondor why on earth you gave that book the time of day. One of the reasons I hate this book so much is because of the characters. The only character you're really supposed to like is Jane, and I found her very annoying and tiresome. I hated the ending as well. When Jane finally tries to do the right thing, she winds up having nothing but Phil, the only semi-enjoyable character in the whole book. I personally think this book sends the wrong message to readers, and I discourage anyone from buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disapointed by Myracle","review":"I am absolutely appalled by this book. As a huge fan fan of the ttyl series and other Myracle novels I could not believe how dreadful \\"Rhymes with Witches\\" was. The beginning was intriguing, a real page turner in fact, but there were a lot of loose ends that weren't fixed. The last chapter seemed fit for the middle of the novel, not the end leaving a very confusing and quite frankly \\"freaky\\" mystery on the future of the character. I suppose that type of fill-in-the-blank ending works for some books, but in this case it only made the mediocre plot and elementary prose writing a bust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the Blue Light in da Basement!!!","review":"Hey there!!

This production certainly went too far. La Rondine is a charming, though not profound, work. This production misses all the charm and goes for the ghastly. The costumes and settings are a poor man's version of the Capitol in Hunger Games, and it is just as bleak. The singing is not bad, but you are constantly distracted by the dancing r-rated commentary and the hideous production and you can't enjoy it.

If you buy this book, dont say I did not warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now we know computer books also ship with bugs","review":"The first part of the book is a nice little tutorial on creating the different parts of a computer game. However, through the programming section of the book the author continually leaves out important lines of code that you need to make the samples work. Then when you dive into the source code that was provided on the CD he has changed the names of his variables and functions so that trying to find the error between your code and his extra difficult.

Although this is one of the few books out there that deals with DirectX using Visual BASIC, it didn't really explain anything about DirectX itself. It tells instead of teaches. Apart from that, right as Crooks drops you into Direct3D, he pulls you right back out and wraps it all in a library of his own called TrueVision, which looks _very_ familiar to the DirectX Common Files standard application skeleton. This book came in a package with Advanced 3D Game Programming with DirectX 8.0 by Peter Walsh (an incredible read 5 stars).

Considering that every song except for the title track is rerecorded on \\"House By The Cemetery\\"; \\"Hacked Up For Barbecue\\"; and \\"Final Bloodbath Session\\", there's not really much point to buying this release, unless you're curious as to what the band sounded like with live drums. Furthermore, the sound quality on this CD is absolutely atrocious.

The trigger lock takes a lot of getting used to. Can be very hard to lock. The knob on the front for locking the depth gauge is coming off. It's a plastic knob pressed onto a brass insert, and when you tighten the knob it pulls away from the insert. The electronic brake stopped working, and the height lock came loose.

Even when it worked I thought the convoluted off/on switch was a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News","review":"I purchased this router about two months ago and the 1/2\\" collet worked fine. However, when I tried to use the 1/4\\" collet, no bits would fit it (I noticed others had the same problem). I finally got the collet to work, but when I tried to remove the bit, it would not come loose. For whatever reason, the collet stuck in the router and when I tried to remove it, the locking mechanism on the router broke with very little pressure. The collet is still in the router and now I have no way of getting it out short of getting out the vice grips. I am sending it in as a warranty issue and I will probably get another in return, but I am definitely going to buy another router that has better quality. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Router Ever - 0 Stars Here","review":"I bought this router shortly after it was introduced thinking it was the next best thing since sliced bread. Man was I wrong! For handheld use, it is stiff, cumbersome, and unbalanced. It's worse in a router table, which was the main reason I bought it. I thought the second power switch would be handy for table use, except you have to lock the handle switch in the on position. And in order to do that, I had to tape mine just so the switch would lock into place. The height adjustment is a pain to work with. Overall, this is one of the worse routers I have used. If you want a router for a router table, spend the extra money and step up to a 3 HP router"},{"rating":"1","title":"PC-7529 is a loser","review":"This is the second review on this router. This one is just the 7529 with carrying case and edge guide.This router will not stay in a fixed position. It works Ok as a plunger router where you hold it against the stop. It is NOT satisfactory for using on a router table or with a Leigh Dovetail Jig. Where depth of cut is most important."},{"rating":"1","title":"My other PC tools are good but this one","review":"is another story. The big problem is the switch located on the handle. It just doesn't work in a router table. I've tried a replacement model as Porter Cable thought I must have had something break on the first. The second router's swtich broke in about 15 minutes. I should have checked out the reviews here first. Gonna go look for a new router now. Shame on Porter Cable, especially for their ignorance of this problem when I called into their tech support staff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I expected.","review":"The 7529 worked ok in plunge mode although it was rather stiff and smooth plunging was a problem. However in shaper mode it was a big let down. As noted by another reviewer the handle power switch would not lock on, I also had to tape it, but worse was the micro adjuster. The adjusting knob is too close to the body and not shaped for other than working with the finger tips. I could not move the bit up as the weight of the inverted router was too great for my fingers to overcome. My old ELU router (now DeWalt and the worse for it) had a rod with a Tee handle which extended clear of the body. This arrangement was far easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON YOU PORTER CABLE","review":"PORTER CABLE REALLY BLEW IT ON THIS ONE. THE SWITCH WENT OUT IN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.

I wish I had bought it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Router","review":"I just recently purchased this router after extensive research. I'm very pleased with it's many new features, including the electronic brake. But most importantly it works well in both free-hand, and table use. This eliminated the need to purchase more than one router. I especially liked the package because it included the template guides in the price. My buying criteria was reputation, features, price, and service. That's why I went with this model. Hopefully time will validate my decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plunger but where's the brake.","review":"The first few thing I noticed about this router is the smoothness of the plunging mechanism. The release and lock lever are ergonomically correct and it always seems to lock and release on a dime. The softstart is a nice feature, when you turn it on it doesn't try to pry itself from your hands. The fence that came with the kit is also accurate specially when plunging mortises. The only dissapointment is the brake. On my router it worked for about the first ten minutes and then it quit. I guess I will be taking it to the service center to give it a brake job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use this for a router table","review":"Porter Cable has a design flaw with the trigger locking switch. To use this in a router table, your must lock the trigger on and use a switch located on top of the router to turn it on. The problem is the switch lock breaks easily and the router will not function properly. I found this out the first time I used it in my table and sent it away to be fixed. After the fix, the repair lasted 20 minutes. I am now looking for another router to use in my table. I will only use the 7529 for hand held applications where I constantly hold down the trigger myself. Porter Cable should have a recall on this. I am not the only person with this problem. I posted my problem on a tool chat room and other woodworkers shared the same story. If you want to use this router for a router table, get another router.

The good points are some funny Jewish jokes and the author's commendable honesty. Her description of dating married men is also witty and she has a sharp eye for ludicrous self-deception (in others). However, on the subject of feminism I found her to be surprisingly self-pitying, and there was something uncannily shallow in her descriptions of her various husbands and other partners.

All-in-all, I would never buy this system again - and unfortunately, I'm stuck with it now that I have about $1,000 invested all-in-all - it's hard to toss it.

Such an obvious feature overlooked (if it is possible, we can't find it explained anywhere in the manual). Also, when listening to messages, you can not save the message on the base unit, you have to transfer it to a handset/mailbox or lose it. Best feature is that you only need one phone jack for 8 handsets, you can put the handsets anywhere you want (near an electrical outlet). Handsets not very comfortable for long conversations.

(2) It is educational: This video shows steam and diesel locomotives, a trolley, a pullman sleeper car, a railroad turntable, and of course, a caboose. There is also a demonstration of a tiny model steam engine. All this is presented in an engaging fashion for little kids who love trains -- it never gets too slow and it isn't too much. (3) It is safe (and wholesome). There is a nice segment on railroad safety, and safety is emphasized throughout.While Whistlestop Willie's character is too silly and over-the-top for most adults and older children, it is just the right stuff for preschoolers, and depending on their temperment, even some pre-adolesants.

Scenarios addressed range from the Russo-Japanese front to attacks on California and the Japanese conquest of India. Each chapter ends with a section entitled The Reality for contrast. The editor deserves congratulations for maintaining a high level of consistency among papers by different authors, generally avoiding overlap or duplication. The only exception is the last chapter (on the invasion of Japan's home islands), which is awkwardly and unconvincingly cast as as a lecture with questions and answers. The book includes maps of varying quality and a section of photographs from the Pacific war.

I have read the book from cover to cover three times, and all I have learned is how wonderful a developer the author believes he is.This book does not go into enough detail on any of the API's, but it is especially lacking with regards to JAI. He has some sample code in the book, but all of the sample code is wrappers he has written around the Sun API's. Instead of explaining the API's one would like to learn, we are given a full detailed explanation of the wrapper code he has written, and leaves the API explanation details to the reader to figure out for themselves.This book is a complete waste of time, and has to be the worst book I have ever read relating to Java.

Listening to him read his own work was wonderful: I found myself smiling, guffawing out loud, and impressed with the simplicity of his language and the honest irony it almost effortlessly produces. I can't compare him with other poets in terms of composition, but I can say that he is one of the more accessible and effective poets that I have ever heard recite their own works. He has none of the deliberate musicality of Robert Pinsky, no need for the electronic accompaniment that Anne Waldmann has integrated into her work, and is not guilty of the unnatural poetic voice that so many writers assume when reading in public. He is clear, direct, and almost apologetic in tone: he is a draught of spring water, from the source.

If you plan to use again, which you probably will, then just save your template somewhere for the next time.Then obviously due to the eyeball shape of the tabs, you have to be careful when removing them since their curved nature makes them want to tear.

The battery was still going strong. With a sharp blade, this tool will melt through 2\\" lumber. It's seems to cut more quiclky than my old Milwaukee Sawsall, but it is not as smooth and vibration free as the new Makita reciprocating saw (which is AC).

No cordless tool is a match for its 120Vac corded counter part for power or price provided there is a handy place to plug it in. For those other places, the Dewalt cordless tools come in very handy. I love to use mine where a cord is a nuisance or just plain dangerous. Soffits,attics, and crawl spaces come to mind. The recip saw has plenty of power and has good balance. It works best when the blade is matched to the type of material being sawed. I got the blade assortment pack too. It sucks the power out of a battey pack pretty fast, but no faster than any other saw. All saws use a lot of power when compared to a drill or a flashlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattle Trap","review":"DeWalt makes a great line of cordless tools.

In more skilled hands,this could have been a very good film, but then the plot and scriptwould need be less inane than it is.

The movie lacks character development, plot development, direction, conflict, suspense, and basically any other feature that is usually included in the worst of cinema.

The idea that a man would be able to track down his wife's lover by pretending to be HER in e-mail messages is pretty clever.

Add an excellent cast to those ingredients. Not bad so far. But why did it have to be edited with a lawnmower? Why did we need countless locations, most of which contributed nothing but confusion to the proceedings? And why, once the cat was out of the bag, did it have to drag on through a preposterous, maudlin celebration of the wife?

The actors very successfully portray the depth of each of their characters, and the plot was paramount to their ability to do so. It was a beautiful story, and brings out how complex people are.

The book is about 3 women and their encounters with pregnancy and babies. It is intriguing to read about the different ways women handle circumstances. Each character in the book is connected in some way or another, which is another aspect of the story that I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?!!??!","review":"Having read JEMIMA J AND BOOKENDS and loving them, I have to say I was very disappointed in BABYVILLE. It appears to me that Ms. Green has a multi-book deal with Broadway Books and she's just writing to meet deadlines, she's not writing with a good eye for content. I can't honestly say that I liked, or could relate to any of the characters in this book. They all seemed so immature and self-absorbed and the stereotypes practically drove me crazy. I usually love British Chick-lit books for their snappy turn-of-phrase, this book didn't have any of that. It took me two long weeks to finish only because I kept thinking it would get better and I have to say: I'm barely a fan after reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"I think most of the people writing reviews take themselves too seriously. This book was entertaining, it kept me interested in the characters and the storyline. These are the expectations I had for the book so I was not disappointed. It hit on some different aspects of pregnancy, the frustration before it happens, the panic knowing you will be in charge of someone elses life, and finally the aftermath, knowing you can love someone completely, but still need time and energy for yourself. Overall, I enjoyed it, there are good moments in the book that will change your perspective, just don't expect it to change your life. As a mother of 3, I was able to identify with several of the characters. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babyville","review":"The book started off slow, but turned out to be great. The chaptered point of views was a really interesting aspect of this book. I loved how all the characters intertwined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"Green really hits home with this one. While I can't compare myself to any one character completely, I found myself, instead, relating to all three at different times in my life.

A great weekend read or beach book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearfelt and Hilarious Novel","review":"I have never really been interested in so-called \\"chick-lit\\". But my cousin gave me this book and i didnt have anything else to read at the time so i thought i would give it a try. I absolutely LOVED this book!! And i really wasn't expecting to either. I loved how well-developed all of her characters were and how at the end all of their stories intertwined. I was actually sad when i finished this book!! I really felt like i lost some of my best friends. This was the first Jane Green book i read and now i have read every book she has written and have liked all of them (except for one.) Before i just read suspense novels but i really wanted to laugh and with Jane's book i always laugh out loud and love escaping to the world that Jane ceates for her reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm offended!","review":"If you have ever struggled to conceive, please don't buy this book! I thoroughly enjoyed the story until the last page, which read, \\"The stress of wanting to conceive can stop conception happening\\". One of the main characters, Julia, who has difficulty conceiving, suddenly becomes pregnant at the end of the story, ostensibly because she has stopped trying. For those of us who have suffered through the agony of infertility, it is nearly unendurable to have idiots like Jane Green chalk it all up to stress. Women in war-torn Bosnia conceived, for Pete's sake. Stress does not cause infertility!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen In My Entire Life","review":"My friends and I were stumbling around watching the TV, and we happened to hit Cinemax. Travis Jesperson was like, \\"Leave it on!\\" So we did. Jesus Christ. We almost killed ourselves half way through. My 3-year-old cousin could have made a better movie with his toy camcorder. I swear one girl was a man. She had a mustache, a masculine body, and huge ..... Can you say plastic surgery? The female on female scenes needed a lot of work. If you like ... licking, this ones for you. The music was blatantly stolen from Mortal Kombat, and the sound effects from Doom 2. If you had to kill yourself or watch this movie and live...i suggest you grab the gun.Wow, I mean, there arent enough words in the english language to describe the absolute agony we went through watching this movie. Do not buy it.Please!Therefore we agree with the earlier poster--0 stars, or negative 5 stars, if possible.Thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, why don't they have \\"0 stars\\" as an option.","review":"This movie is completely awful. Out of the whole film, maybe two of the girls were hot. Some had scars on their breasts where the implants were inserted. One in particular had so much work done to her lips, it looks like she was punched in the mouth, and the lip swelled.I like softcore, but I had never seen a Seduction Cinema title before this one. Quite frankly, I would be happy to never see one again. Not only were the women skanky, but I could have financed this title with the money that is currently in my wallet.Did I mention the music drove me crazy? They took five seconds of tribal drums beating, and they played it over and over and over throughout the entire film.My advice is to avoid this title at all costs...Bottom Line: This title stinks worse than the family bathroom after dad uses it on Chili Night. I can't believe I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out freakin standing","review":"I absolutely love it. I paired this with with Polk audio: CS2 center, 60 towers, RC85i wall souround, and RC80i in ceiling for back surround.

From mid treble to the lowest notes, the speakers generate sounds that are smooth and rich, much like much more expensive ones. Since I have a very old receiver that is low powered (about 20 watts per channel), I am very pleased with the high efficiency design that lets me fill the house music. Speakers are large, but attractive, and are solidly built.

I had a pair of Cerwin Vegas with 10 inch woofers for years and loved them.When I got my polks I gave them plenty of brake in time and then put them to the test and let me tell you they passed with flying colors.I don't know what people are talking about when they say these speaker are short on bass,they have plenty.When listening to some Heavy Metal they will rattle pictures on the wall at 1/4 volume.Very pleased with these speakers and for the money I found none that will come close after 6 months of looking and the cherry looks great,I did it a little different and got cherry and put it with my xvt3d Vizio tv and it looks good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"These speakers are some of the best out there for the price. However, they are very bright, almost harsh, out of the box. In order to help with the somewhat shrill sound, they MUST be equalized in the 2.5-6 kHz range. Doing this will bring out the hidden warmth in these speakers. They image very nicely and are great paired with a subwoofer. Don't expect the 5.25\\" woofers to give you much bass below the 50 Hz range, but this should be expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knizhnik","review":"Polk Audio Monitor 60 AM6022-A 2-Way Floorstanding Speaker (Single, Cherry)I bought these speakers with hope after my SONY-7000 tweeter broke. The sound is flat, mid range is not transparent and low base is almost absent. Working power is about 10 watt - anything higher - distortions and clipping. Aesthetically OK, but smaller bookshelf boxes sound juicier. Returned to seller.Get something with 8\\" drivers and bigger. I will get back to SONY F-7000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speaker for the price","review":"I bought two speakers for Onkyo-TX 805 A/V system.First, it's kinda wide and big. The sound is very crisp and clear.But without a subwoofer, Bass sound is a little bit weak.I don't know when can I find a true speaker that doesn't need a subwoofer.If I turn off the subwoofer, I can feel the lackness of Bass sound.But above all, I like the design and the quality of the speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a cord!","review":"This tool has NO POWER! It's good for about 10 cuts then needs a new charge. The only reason I bought it was so that I would have a 3rd battery for my drill/saw. I typically like Dewalt cordless tools, but I would not recommend this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get DW682K Corded Joiner","review":"Should have listened to John Bryer review...Corded Plate Joiner is gutless. I set up a comparision between my 18v and my brother's corded. The first biscuit (on full charge) only cut about 90% and then the blade stalled. Same thing on the second. Slowing down the feed solved the stalling problem but left me disappointed with the performance of the tool. Otherwise, the cuts were of the same high quality as the corded joiner. The portability is somewhat offset by the extra weight and the need to have a vacuum attached to ensure through dust extraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this game shortly after buying my MacBook and was very disappointed to find out that the game does not work on Mac OSX.

Tomb Raider Chronicles is not for new iMacs. It is for older classic Macs only."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SAW!!","review":"This Milwaukee circular saw is among the best tools made. The motor is strong and cuts through the hardest woods with relative ease. It is well balanced and of moderate weight thanks to the alloy construction. Fit and finish is suberb, as is the case with most Milwaukee products. The case is sturdy and a plus if you move your saw frequently between jobs. The Milwaukee gets 5 stars and is a credit to their line of quality power tools. I'd buy another one without a second thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CIRCULAR SAW ON THE MARKET!","review":"I had this saw over a year. Never failed, cut through pressure-treated wood, ash, oak, walnut, bloodwood, maple, mahogany...always give me a nice, clean cut. The angle cuts were more precised than any other circular saw I tried in the past. No reason to buy any other circular saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome saw","review":"I purchased this saw based on other reviews here at amazon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. It's base is a perfect 5\\" offset, which makes measuring cuts fast and easy. The saw has a handle that tilts to make cutting at any angle a breeze. Fitting with a Freud Diablo blade, this saw seems to breeze through just about anything I throw at it, the cuts are clean and fast. It has a nice front handle, and the angle guide is labelled clearly and easy to use. The hex wrench for the blade arbor is stored on the saw itself which means you don't loose it. Just for a bonus this comes with it's own box which stores the saw nicely. I really can't stand tools that don't come with a carrying box of some kind. The base plate is very smooth and glides of materials very nicely making this saw a pleasure to use. would definitely recommend and buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Said made in USA but in the box it was MADE IN CHINA","review":"Just a heads up. I went to a local Home Depot to check out this saw. I was dead set on getting this saw for $130 because the display saw said \\"Made in USA\\" right on the saw (not the box or case). I was also looking at the Makita 5007NK for $99. It was made in China. I told the lady at the register that as soon as I go through the line I'm opening the box and if it is made in China I will return it immediately. I ended up doing just that. Opened the box and looked at the saw and the saw said \\"Made in CHINA\\" in the same place that the display model said \\"Made in USA\\". I returned it, and walked over and bought the Makita instead.I'm not sure if this is a ploy by Home Depot, or by Milwaukee or what, but it sucks.Go buy the Makita instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon or bad design?","review":"The very first time I used this saw the depth of cut adjustment locking handle made a \\"pop\\" noise when I pressed it down and would not hold the adjustment. It is a black nylon handle on a metal shaft. I unscrewed it and rotated it backward then reassembled. Seemed to work ok.Today when I adjusted the depth and pressed the handle down I heard another \\"pop\\". This time the fix did not work. I wound up removing the handle and shaft and putting an aircraft nut on the machine screw that locks the depth of cut into place.I would not buy this saw again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing piece of China...","review":"I'm returning this unit without opening it. It's made in China, and I've got nothing against the Chinese people, I'm doing all I can to buy American. I know it's \\"too little, too late\\", but to do nothing is worse. And I can get the exact same thing at Home Depot for the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've tried","review":"My old skilsaw was a true dog--it was heavy, poorly balanced, underpowered, and difficult to adjust. I dreaded using it. So I decided to stick to the old advice about buying the best tools you can possibly afford, and then some, and I splurged on this saw. Wow. Like a few other reviewers, I wish it were made in the USA, but it's by far the best power tool I own. It breezes through everything I've tried to cut with it, including pressure-treated 3/4\\" plywood, and the saw never hesitates. I really love it. You don't always get what you pay for, but in this case I think I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw works great. Everything I expected.","review":"I'm very pleased with this saw. Before buying, I compared itwith a number of similarly-priced models by other brands --DeWalt, Porter Cable, Makita, etc. Quite honestly, I was happywith them all. The reason I chose the Milwaukee was for thefeel (not necessarily the adjustable handle). I've had noproblems with the base, I can easily see the cut line, and Ihaven't been disappointed by the absence of a brake.Then again, I haven't cut the cord (and don't expect to). Itboth rips and cross cuts just fine. In short, it's what Iexpected for the price -- a good solid saw for framing,siding, projects around the house, etc. The only remainingquestion is how long it will last, but of course that[hopefully] won't be answered for quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Shoe","review":"This saw is awesome....except. Don't expect square cuts, because the shoe on every single one I have seen/used is warped right where you need to hold your square to set the blade-to-shoe bevel to be square when adjusting it. If this saw had the same MAG shoe as the Porter Cable, I would have kept it. But, I exchanged it for a Porter Cable, and even though I don't have Tilt-lok, I have a keyless blade change, and good square cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING CD :@(","review":"It grows tiring within the first few listens.

They always taste like nasty medicine, but I've still needed them. Thank goodness that Halls came out with these Breezers because now I finally have something that helps me when my throat is sore and has a great taste (these strawberry one's taste a bit like a Creamsaver candy to me).

Support abysmal.","review":"This product is not serviceable after one year warranty! Am informed by Buffalo tech support that the root operating system is not accessible by Buffalo or anyone except the Japanese firm they appear to only be resellers for and who do not offer support. I bought two of these Terastations and one of them failed to boot after only three months. If this happens to you after the warranty, you are out the considerable purchase price (as much as $1000!) as no one can service it. I found Buffalo tech support extremely difficult to reach and not adequately knowledgeable of their own product. Buffalo's system for RMAs is also a hassle. I strongly advise to avoid buying this product that Buffalo is maintaining an obviously deceptive support position on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this if you're a business user","review":"My client had been using a TeraStation 1Tb as the main file server. It works as advertised, but after 18 months it died, the unit shut itself down and when we restarted it, it can no longer connect. Since it is out of warranty, Buffalo will do nothing for us, NOT EVEN SELL US A REPLACEMENT CORE. They offer no extended warranty, although the support supervisor was kind enough to call Austin HQ with the problem, they still won't budge. So if you are considering using this as the main file server, or any Buffalo product in a crirtical business application, BE WARNED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad when it works, but...","review":"I have two of these units. Both have failed within the warranty period due to disk failures. Both were using raid5 and, despite what you'd expect, the data was not recoverable. The newest unit just failed again with a broken network connection, one day outside of the 1yr warranty. I now have a very expensive set of spare parts for the 2nd unit. These devices are not bad when the work but they don't work very long. Pay a bit more money and get a better quality NAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't defragment, does not support windows file attributes","review":"Fails to recognize archive, read-only and hidden file attributes. This messes up things like tape backup. It can only support one file system and it's not NTFS. You can't defragment the drives so they are very fast out of the box, but keep on getting slower as time goes on.Probably good for a home user archiving data, but don't think about it for small business with several users that update files on a regular basis. Also can not be used in conjunction with a tape drive for performing incremental or differential backups due to the missing file flags.If you do decide to buy it suggest updating the firmware as soon as you open the box. Seems to have been a few speed improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - avoid this product","review":"Basic functionality doesn't work properly. I had the following problems with it:1. Shuts down on its own randomly.2. Hangs every few days.3. Firmware upgrade didn't work.4. Tried again and it came back with the unit set to Japanese.5. Client utility works sometimes - not always.6. You have to initialize the unit often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac User plugged it in and it works. Uh, pleasantly surprised...","review":"So I read the reviews and checked out the competition in NAS and considered other RAID enclosures and configurations.

Actually looks better than the picture.- I literally plugged it into my router and found it immediately on my network- copied and retrieved files immediately!- easily configured and monitored via a browser interfaceCon- No remote access supported!Conclusion- Works great in RAID 5 for an archival drive- offers great redundance and price per GigOther considerations:- I haven't tried the print sharing or the USB ports yet- Contrary to other comments, Tech support RESPONDED to two email in one business day- Documentation is light, but buy this product for what it says it is, not for what you think that it might be and you will be very happy!

It gave you ah hah monments where you see why certain story lines played out they way they did. You get to see background information and you also see where the american version connects to the swedish version.

At first I was a bit worried that the dubbing would be what I call \\"hokey,\\" but let me tell you...it's fantastic. Don't get me wrong...I enjoy subtitles when it comes to foreign films. However, this time, I wanted to concentrate on the action and nuances first. I will view all three movies again using the original soundtrack with subtitles.

The additional material is true to the novels and makes the story line much more clear for those who have not read the books.

The next two, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" continue the drama, intrigue and pathos.

In total the movie is actually like a mini series.Bluray review: Part 1 and 2 (girl with dragon tattoo) video and audio quality is superb. Part 3 on the other hand, video is very grainy. In some scenes it is not so obvious but in most of them, it is. I am not sure whether they purposely did it in the name of some kind of \\"art\\". Not sure about the rest of the movies (part 4, 5 and 6) but since one of them is quite grainy, does it matter anymore how the rest looks like?Nonetheless, I do not regret buying this. Totally worth it...unless part 4, 5 and 6 are worse and grainier than part 3.Dear God, please send a miracle and make my Sony Bluray Player, Sony Amp and Sony Bravia filter out the grain and make it crisp clear.

First movie just has English subs, but the other two have the option for English dubbing (which isn't bad, but the voices just don't fit the profile).I would recommend reading the books before watching the movie so you have a good idea of the dialog and what's going on.Can't wait for the English version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo with Daniel Craig (Dec 2011?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to play","review":"Can not be played on my DVD player.

Mercifully, the movie isn't nearly as wordy as the book. The 'what' of the story is told perfectly well, the 'why' you can only get from the books.There wasn't a lot of 'emotion' in the movie, just the facts with a little bit o' sex on the side. Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander) was so perfectly cast, it was amazing.Anyone who watches this movie, please let me know how the character of Mikael Bloomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) gets the ladies.Overall, I'd watch this movie at least 3 times to soak it all in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done in capturing the essence of the books","review":"Much - if not most - of the extraneous subplots found in the books were removed from the movie adaptation. Despite that, each of the movies captured the essence of and was true to the main storyline. Consequently, this was an extremely well done book-to-movie adaptation. It also seemed that each of the characters were well acted; however, given that I don't speak Swedish, it's difficult to make such an assessment because the language barrier doesn't allow for a true assessment of the authenticism each actor gives to the respective character through the delivery of the diaologue. Though each of the movies has omitted much of the story found in the books, they are all over two hours long. Nevertheless, the time travels quickly because the movies do draw-in viewer. Overall, the Swedes have done a fine job in the silver screen adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Ride - Excellent.","review":"This is an excellent group of films. Have watched the individual titles andthe extended version. The extended version is much better and worth the price. Did not purchase the Blue Ray because have found that some of the foreign films do not transfer well. Probably some techy difference precludes a perfectly smooth transfer.Although the characters carry the difficult script perfectly through the three films we are treated to more and more elements of the mystery of Lisbeth Salander and The Section.Have not tried to offer a detailed review since others have already given such great explanation and analysis.Amazon provided this set of DVDs and will get the books for the Kindle shortly also.Recommend these flicks to anyone who like film noir for these are excellent examples.

I bought the books, the dvd set and headed for the theater to see the new movie with Daniel Craig. While the new movie was good, there just is no way anything will ever do justice to these amazing books like this 9 hour mini series did. Steig would be proud. American media may be a little too tight ass to make such an amazing mini series but the Swede knew what they were doing. I was electrified! Couldnt stop watching it. Love that this dvd set is so complete. It has horus of additional footage which I would never have known was missing if they hadnt told me but I like watching it all within the movie. I dont like the deleted scene section. This also has the option to either watch it with subtitles or with an English voiceover....awesome both ways!!!! So in love with this trilogy!! I even bought the books. Should keep me busy all winter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy DVD - Girl with the Dragon Tattoo","review":"The films follow the books as closely as time allows. Anyone who likes the books would like the films. The acting is very good and while the story is dark, it is one you will want to see to bring the books to life.

I was so pleased with the smooth way these pencils laid down the bright shiny colors.

I have enjoyed them so much I am ready to order more. More for me, more for my (adult) daughters, and more for all my friends who color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft Core but Dull Metallic Effects","review":"I love Crayola color pencils and these metallic color pencils have a nice soft (but not too soft) core, and they lay down on the paper smoothly. However, the colors are very dark and muted. I expected them to burst with brightness and sparkly shimmer, but that is not the case. They lay down dark, with a brownish/grayish tinge that's not very sparkly or shimmery, which is strange because when you look at a freshly sharpened tip, you can see the glittery specks, but the result on the paper is only slightly pearly. The set comes with 8 colors, but some of the colors like copper and bronze, or purple and pink are very similar. The quality of the actual pencils is good, but the metallic effect leves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after reading A Field of Poppies","review":"After reading A Field of Poppies, downloaded Dark Water on my Kindle and quickly discovered the characters were so \\"high school\\" in actions and dialog there was no choice but to just delete it and find something else to read.

That being said, I really liked the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting Suspenseful Thriller","review":"From the first page I was hooked! I felt so sorry for Sarah - ten years old and witnessing your father being convicted of a crime he didn't committ and finding your mother after she committed suicide - I really hoped that she wouldn't let such traumatic situations bring her down. Sarah - as a grown woman -was a very compelling character. At first I thought she was too coldhearted, but then once she met Tony I realized that she had a softer side. I really like the suspense regarding who killed her father. The only thing that seemed a little far fetched was her Aunt Loretta and her strange \\"paranormal insights.\\" I am almost done with the book and can't wait to see who killed Sarah's father. With approximately 50 pages left, I still can't figure it out. I will definitely read another one of Sharon Sala's books when I'm done with Dark Water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"This is an awesome Delerium album.

I felt that the group has lost its 'New Age' way with this project. To be more polite, they have gone in a totally different direction. The music, in my opinion, lacks melody & harmony, and lacks the ambient sounds so typical in their earlier efforts. My favorite Delerium are Karma, Poem, Chimera. Sorry to offend the raters who are obviously more inspired. I'll keep playing it; maybe something on the CD will eventually catch my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One who knows","review":"I am someone who is extremely busy and this book has helped me become aware of what to eat and how quick and simple it can be to prepare.

She shamelessly cites her lineage in a \\"Scots-Irish tradition\\" - that apparently utilizes the rituals from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn complete with the Hebraic names of God - as the basis for her expertise. What little content there is interrupted with pointless segues of her dancing, performing rituals, and making significant glances at the camera to further convince you that she is a truly mystical being.Watch only if you feeling in the mood for a bit of schadenfreude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying hard to avoid seeing the allegory","review":"J.K.

Dr. Geo Trevarthan, the researcher and narrator behind the documentary, has certainly done her homework in this in-depth exploration of the history and symbolism lurking behind-the-scenes throughout the novels. The Harry Potter series is embraced by an audience of all generations and the adult fans of the series in particular will find this film insightful and thought-provoking. Dr. Trevarthan's passion for the world of Harry Potter is evident in her enthusiastic presentation and her thorough research. Harry Potter fans, literature enthusiasts and anyone interested in the layers that make great fiction will enjoy this entertaining and educational documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Waste of Time","review":"This documentary was shabby at best.

However I did pay attention to the fact that there were reports of reception problems and carefully read the unit's instruction manual. My phone is mounted on a wall, about five feet from the floor and is positioned about three feet from my iMac computer.

I have friends who square they can tell the food taste \\"low fat\\", well they well fooled especially the homemade tomato sauce receipe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetarian That Even Meat Eaters Can Appreciate","review":"I have several Moosewood cookbooks, but have sometimes found that the recipes can be complicated and time-consuming, and can involve ingredients that are not always easy to find. This book, however, contains good recipes that are not only healthy, but also relatively easy and quick to make. From soups to salads to entrees, I haven't tried anything that I haven't liked, and I really appreciate the effort that was made to make the dishes low fat. Low fat or not, the recipes included here are for food that is both flavorful and hearty. A must-try for the vegetarian or even the meat eater who wants to try to include some vegetarian meals in his/her diet. I find myself turning to this book when I want to make a meal for friends who are not necessarily vegetarian, and they are always pleasantly surprised and ask for the recipe! These meals would encourage even the hard core carnivores to take a break and eat some veggies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy for People Interested in Yummy & Healthful Food","review":"OK, I admit it. I'm one of those people who buy cookbooks, but rarely get to the making the recipes stage. This is one of the few cookbooks I own, that I actually *use*. Why? Everything that I've made has been easy (no funky ingredients, no bizarre food appliances required), quick, and tasty. Although everything is vegetarian and low-fat--the food just tastes good. You don't feel like you're eating healthfully, you just acknowledge the goodness of the food (if that makes sense). Two of my favorite recipes are the pasta w/tomatoes and chickpeas (sounds bizarre, but very good) and the low-fat chocolate pudding. As somebody who has always bought Jell-O instant pudding, it was a revelation to realize I could make homemade low-fat chocolate pudding that was just as easy as opening up a box of Jell-O and 10x better in taste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Cookbook of all time","review":"This is an incredible vegetarian cookbook as well as an incredible low-fat cookbook. I have several Moosewood cookbooks that I love but this is now my ultimate favorite. I love the white bean and roasted pepper dip, I make a new batch every week to bring for my lunch with carrots. The pasta and green bean dish with sun dried tomatoes is so easy and delicious. I am going to try all the recipes recommended in the other reviews! The low-fat cooking tips at the beginning of the book are so helpful and having the full nutrient break down for each dish is wonderful too. What a great book. You really don't feel like you are missing anything. I recommend it to all my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cookbook ever!","review":"I absolutely love this book! It is full of great vegetarian recipes. It has a lot of variation in number of ingredients and prep in different recipes which is helpful. My favorite part is the sections about nutrition, definitions of foods, and menu pairings- this definitely sets it apart from other books. Being a nutrition student, I love that they provide consumers with nutrition background info so people better understand the importance and benefits of good nutrition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed many of the recipes in The New Moosewood Cookbook, so I thought that I might have luck with this one too. Not so. Every recipe I tried turned out mediocre at best. I have given up attempting recipes from this book for fear of having a ruined dinner. I have held on to it though because it does have some interesting nutritional information and inventive tips like using ground rice to thicken a soup.

The book is easy to follow, with generally common ingredients that blend together to make wonderful, tastes. As a not-so-serious cook, who is NOT vegetarian, but looking for healthy spa-type food, this book was a find that I will treasure. Recipe analysis and cross-referencing for ingredients round out an excellent diverse selection of recipes, 300 in all. Middle Eastern Tofu-stuffed peppers, Banana muffins made with rolled oats, New England Squash Soup...

In short, while the book might be an adequate, albeit SLOW, introduction to Oracle, it covers very little actual PL/SQL.If you are a programer/engineer/dba looking to \\"learn Oracle PL/SQL\\", interested in practical applications of such fundamental topics as constraints, foreign keys, indexes, joins, cursors, views, triggers, corelated subqueries and the like, look elsewhere.

He giggles when George \\"talks\\" and Im so glad that he is interested in something so entertaining and still teaching such great lessons even after Ive grown up.

Trust me, I hate those types of bands too, but Incubus are so much more than that. They have truly great songwriting skills, a unique sound and style, interesting and emotional lyrics, and their albums are very eclectic and diverse. Obviously you people are just metalheads who don't like anything that doesn't have a lot of screaming and guitar distortion. I mean I like some heavy bands too but I like other stuff too.

Why the Discovery Channel cut this content and relegated it from the box set is beyond me. The 2 minutes of \\"Behind the Scenes\\" that they include with each episode are pathetic in comparison.

This is hands down, the absolute worst phone I've ever gotten. The sound quality was very good at first, then steadily went downhill and within 6 months became pure static. The answering machine (and I've owned 3 answering machines and 4 office mailbox-type answering services) is the absolute worst answering machine I've ever used. You can't even change the time without consulting a manual. It is absolutely inconceivable to me that anyone, letalone Panasonic, could make an answering machine this bad.

It was around that time that the battery life virtually disappeared. After a full charge, we couldn't get more than a half an hour before the battery indicator would start blinking. To make matters worse, Panasonic was not in the least bit helpful about diagnosing the problem or attempting to look at the phone. I ended up having to buy a new battery on my own.After installing the new battery, I saw the problem disappear . . . for about two months. It's back to the same problem and I'm not willing to torture myself by going back to Panasonic for Round 2 of fighting this problem.So, I'm going to buy a Motorola instead. Their new MD681 expandable system looks appealing.IN SHORT: Panasonic is not what they used to be and you are buying their products at your own risk. Don't expect any help from them when you run into problems (like the common battery life problems)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about a year...","review":"The phone worked wonderfully for about a year, now the phone is having trouble making contact with the base unit, I called Panasonic and what they have me do every few weeks to get the phone to work again is a big hassel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish you had a ZERO STAR RATING!","review":"THIS PHONE IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF I HAVE HAD OF ANY ELECTRONIC PURCHASE.

It's easier to just dial the #!! Even if you save the # to the directory in an \\"edited\\" fashion, the next time that person calls the caller id list doesn't recognize it as an edited #.

At about the one year mark, the headset jack just >stopped working< - I found out that the phone is pretty uncomfortable to hold on the shoulder. Then, the reception went from >100 ft to ~8 ft.

Otherwise, the answering machine and speakerphone work well and would have raised the overall rating to 4 stars if not for the inconsistant sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone","review":"This phone is all digital but everyone advertises it as analog 900Mhz. Also, there is too much static noise on and off. dont ever think about buying this phone. this is also clear from the fact that the price dropped between the time i bought it and returned it after dissatisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine for a while, then forget it...","review":"I purchased this same version (last model) of the Panasonic phone just over a year ago. The number pad now works randomly, causing us great frustration as well as many wrong numbers. I have contacted their customer support many times (via email), and have yet to receive any response.If you are looking for a phone that will last you a couple of years, then I would recommend that you do not purchase this phone. I don't recall EVER having any problems with the old rotary phones...do you?P.S. If you answer the phone, and the caller has dialed the wrong number...perhaps now, you'll know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this phone.","review":"I have not been pleased with this phone. Most of the time it is almost impossible to hear the caller. We have tried all of the adjustments but without success.

The suction is not strong enough to hold the toy in place on the high chair. As a toy, it's fine, but we were looking for something we didn't have to keep picking up. This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh - not impressed","review":"My baby enjoys the toy enough, but I bought it specifically bc I was looking for a product I could stick to the tray on her high chair so she would have something to entertain her that she couldn't throw to the floor in two seconds. The suction cup is basically useless. I do NOT recommend this item if the suction cup is one of the features that attracts you to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't suction and baby's hands get stuck!!!","review":"I bought this specifically for the suction cup base...well it only suctions to my daughters high chair tray or any other hard surface for around 20 seconds then, its tossed right on the floor with the rest of her toys. As well she seems to get her fingers stuck in the toy and then screams, I had to take it away from her because she kept getting them stuck, I was worried she would bruise her hands or worse. If the suction base worked at all I could place it just within her reach so her hands wouldn't get stuck in it, and she could still spin it. I am very disappointed with this toy and as well have forwarded my concerns to the manufacturer. I hope this and all the other reviews help any other parents looking to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wouldn't suction!","review":"I got this product for my daugther because she is in the \\" I'm going to throw everything on the floor.\\" So I thought OH great this will suction to her high chair. OH NO I was wrong. This didn't suction to anything!!!! I had to stuff it in the cup holder for it to stay in place. She loves the toy part but there is no suction at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept but...","review":"The suction toy is a great concept. I purchased 2 suction toys for my son's walker because he kept dropping toys and then running them over to try and get them. At first I was really excited to have found them but quickly learned that they do not stay in place. My son sometimes removes the suction portion and chews it and can be entertained momentarily by me spinning the fish but it does not work properly. While the concept is great it is a waste of money if you desire the toy to actually suction to anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad as a suction cup toy","review":"Like one of the other reviewer pointed out....toy easily detaches from the suction cup. That totally defeats the purpose of having a suction cup toy. I suction the toy to her high chair and she grabs the toy out of the base, leaving the suction cup still attached to the tray. I did give it two stars because my 5 month old enjoys the toy (the fun music was a surprise to me)...it just doesn't work for the purpose I bought it for - to stay put."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but painful!","review":"My daughter is 5-months old and finds the spinning features of this toy captivating. If she is fussy, it helps settle her down.Like most readers, I found the suction cup worthless and don't even use it anymore. I just have this as a rattle.The problem is that at her age, her movements are not controlled. Thus, whenever she tries to shake it around like a rattle, she inevitably hits herself (or me!) on the head. Being that it is a heavy plastic toy, it's quite painful when you are hit with it. She also likes to use it as a teether, which makes me nervous about all the plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also GREAT for under 6+ months!!!","review":"My daughter is 2 months old. This is the first toy she ever showed any interest in playing with. Her little hands can't hold onto a rattle yet (and I'm afraid she would hit herself in the head with a heavy rattle and hurt herself). She likes to bat at this with her fist and make it spin around. It's very captivating! I love watching her play with this! It must be helping her get control of her movements too, she concentrates really hard on landing her blows on the toy to make it spin around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Mark Alan","review":"I agree with the former reviewer's opinion of the Mark Alan who regularly performs in Eugene, Oregon. However, I'm fairly certain that this is not the same Mark Alan. The clips don't sound at all like him and the picture doesn't look like him.I gave this cd one star for each of its songs because a rating is required in order to post a review, but I've never listened to the actual cd, so I don't know what it deserves. I merely wanted to post here to try to straighten out the identity.

The story is so flat, and her use of the couple from the last book was a mistake. I never could care about either in Slightly Shady and was disapointed to see them return when I opened the first page of this book.I hope she kicks her writting up a notch. I know she has betterstories!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick to Avoid","review":"Don't Look Back was my first Amanda Quick novel. I am going to avoid this author from now on, due to the flat plot line and lackluster mystery. I can say, however, that I was intrigued with every character that was introduced in the book and because of this, I was pushed to finish reading it. I would like to see these characters in a more compelling storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sequel to Shady Lady","review":"Amanda Quick fans should love this sequel to Shady Lady. It combines mystery, romance, and historical fiction genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her usual development","review":"I've enjoyed many (if not all) of Amanda Quick's books - her female characters are always educated, intelligent and very capable for the time period her stories follow. Her male characters, who seem to admire women with these unusual feminine qualities - are themselves strong and supportive. This usually makes for a novel with not only romance, but intrigue, suspense and passion (excellent beach reading). The characters are too priggish and polite to eachother - even upon familiarity. Lavinia's character seems flat and peevish - her \\"heat\\" is not believable and for an intelligent woman - as written - seems stupidly unaware of the obvious - I'm not referring to her purposeful naivete. Tobias' character is more believable - he seems human, although he could use more depth. Hopefully the next one will be up to her usual par...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No emotional depth; uninspiring","review":"My book club accidentally shipped me \\"Don't Look Back.\\" As it looked mildly interesting and I hadn't read Amanda Quick before, I kept it. Then I realized I needed to read \\"Slightly Shady\\" first. So I bought it and was truly disappointed. The characters, what I could make of them (with little written about their physical characteristics), were uninspiring. There was little emotional depth to the story. You hardly ever saw what the characters are thinking or feeling. I just could not get to know or even like Lavinia or Tobias. I did read both books, and by the end of \\"Don't Look Back\\" I was mildly amused by the dialogue. So I give 2 stars for good dialogue and great plotting. That's all these two books have going for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful role heroine","review":"I hated the woman - and the man was soooo patronizing. I liked the other book but MY WORD what happened to her?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to look at all.","review":"This sequel to \\"Slightly Shady\\" is just as boring, if not worse, than the earlier title. The characters are cardboard cut-outs and the plot is laughable. After reading everything that AQ (aka JAK, etc) has written, I can safely say that if the next one is like this I, for one, am not going to bother again. I think this author needs to forget the contract pot-boilers and get back to basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"This book was interesting while reading it. I had read Slightly Shady before this one. I found Lavina not to be so much like herself in this one, yet to me she wasn't as annyoning as in the pass. I thought the background plot between Anthony and Emiline was great. However a day within reading this book I totally forget how it ended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When you start pondering that secondary characters would make better leads, you know that the story is in trouble. Lavinia Lake and Tobias March spend too much time arguing with each other and the mystery is rather weak. The two detectives team together to find an ancient Roman-British artifact that might have supernatural powers. Between arguments the two main characters attempt to find the artifact and solve a murder. As huge fan of Jayne Ann Krentz/Amanda Quick, I was very disappointed in this novel, to the point that I could put it down and not really want to get back to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't look back","review":"Not one of Quick's best. I wouldn't buy the book. The characters are not well developed and the plot isn't interesting at all (too similar to other plots). I feel that she is cut and pasting her plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The further adventures of Lavinia and Tobias","review":"The further adventures of Lavinia and Tobias (as started in Slightly Shady) ... Lavinia and Tobias, now lovers and business partners, are in search of a killer. Celeste, the wife of an old family friend of Lavnia's is murdered. To complicate matters, a priceless bracelet is also missing. Lavinia and Tobias figure that if they can find the bracelet, they will find the killer. Of course, they aren't the only ones searching for it. This was a charming, light read that made me chuckle. I especially like the lively interaction between Lavinia and Tobias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Table Use","review":"This knob is good for table use, but unfortunately, you have to remove the height indicator, and you still need to release the lock.

He writes with a flair that the reader can picture in his mind what it is he is reading. He takes real situations and compares it to what Jesus went through.

Stream of consciousness ramblings has never been a successful way to communicate and get things done.The book presents a simplistic, misleading, or fictional version of the reality. The silly blacked out lines will offend the reader. The author's personal agenda seems to be anger at his relative poverty.

Granted, the author is a former CIA agent but I'm sure that basic research could have backed up many of his salient points.

Mr. Baer substitutes innuendo, unsupported assertion, and conjecture for facts, evidence, and a cogent argument. He comes across as disgruntled and sophomoric.

It tells how oil and money from Saudi Arabia have corrupted the U.S. government -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- while Saudi Arabia provides the ideology, the money, and many of the leaders of al-Queda and other terrorist organizations. This dysfunctional kingdom, says the author, is likely to collapse, leaving behind chaos and even worse terrorism.

However, as an American that has spent 8 years living in Saudi Arabia, I question the authors credibility. He has never set foot in Saudi Arabia and exaggerated certain details of Saudi life. It leads me to wonder what other statements in his book might be exaggerated.While the foundation of what he has to say may be solid, it's tough to take the facts and circumstances that he builds on top of that foundation at face value.

Unfortunately, his research and field experience demonstrates that we, as a nation, are truly unaware and unprepared for the upcoming clash of cultures, indeed of civilizations. It demonstrates are basic failure to gain intelligence, and to actually apply said intelligence \\"intelligently\\".

He vomits its leaders and its people at every page. After working in the CIA for so many years, he fully endorses the official 9/11 story and the \\"war on terror\\" mythology. My conclusion is that he not a former CIA agent, but rather an undercover agent with a hidden agenda. Printing blacked-out passages supposedly censored by the CIA is a laughable trick. For whoever believes 9/11 was an inside job orchestrated by the crypto-zionist neocons, it is evident, from the choice of the patsies (Bin Laden and the 19 pseudo-hijackers) that one of the goals of 9/11, besides dragging the US into the phony war on terror on the side of Israel, was to harm US-Saudi relationship and black-mail the Saudi and Bin Laden families.

Still, the story is not just about growing up but getting along with one another. It's a daring trek through the wilds of Sonoma County (in California) of generations past and yet it is a story that is as timely as today, defying the apathy and cynicism that is so common in today's world.

The fan beeps to turn on, beeps to change speeds, beeps to oscillate, and most annoyingly - it beeps when you turn it off! Why?

However, one day towards the end of summer it totally died on me. I didn't have a receipt to return it to the store, so I contacted Lasko. All they could do is tell me to blow into the fan with canned air to clean it out. It didn't work and I was out of luck because I didn't have a receipt. They would not honor the one-year warranty without a receipt, even though I'm sure they could determine the date it was made via the serial number.

The screws does not match the holes, not just the diameter, but the holes for connecting parts are also in wrong position. Only 4 out of the 10 given screws can be fastened, really?!2. Cheap plastic base and column support. Both of them are in two pieces, and no matter how well you try to snap them together, there is big gap and the whole thing will become shaky.3.

The remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well. However within 4 months of owning it, when we tried to have it rotate, it turns slightly, gets stuck, and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating. Needless to say it no longer rotates, so it is now just a stationary fan. I even tried taking it apart to unjam it, but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem, so without new parts it could not be fixed.

The fan takes up so little space that we can place it midway from the AC to the loveseat where she sits to knit and watch TV, and the cooling effect is pronounced, all without giving up much space (or sacrificing another window to an AC).It's perfect for what it's made for, quiet, efficient, and small in footprint.

I found it wobbly unless very carefully set up and well torqued. It will allow the router to twist and \\"jump\\" unless you really torque the screws and force the guide well against the router base. For long reach jobs, it would be smarter to clamp a straight edge on the work piece. For close in work, clamp a short strip of wood to the router base. This you can trust and do cheap. The edge guide itself is short, narrow in height, and will not permit larger bit diameters (I wanted to use it for a slot cutter for bread board joints on a table top.)

The problem is that it mounts with the handles in the wrong orientation to the way you work. It is the routers problem.With the guide mounted on the router the handle orientation is wrong (at least to my way of working).

There are two small stainless spring clips that sandwich between the set screws and the straight edge arm. They fall out. Mounting to the 690 router base is a pain. It slides in the two holes but good luck tightening it and having it mounted tight with stability. Adding this straight edge makes the router awkward, out of balance, and heavy.

Looks like it was filmed by some college students. After the first 25-30 minutes the movie starts getting really dull! The friends sit around a campfire telling about the scariest things that have ever happened to them. One of the girls starts rambling on about how some guy had broke into her apartment and tried to rape her. She says how she started to tell the guy to do it to her good, she said this freaked the guy out and he tried to run off. So then she runs after him naked and screaming at him don't you want me, you sick bleep! The bad language really flies while she is rambling on with this absurd story. Although there are some OK creepy scenes, the death scenes are totally confusing and wierd! Not a good movie in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pull through sharpner","review":"Pull through sharpeners do not work their a gimmick you see the angle of the bevel that makes the edge varies from steel to steel the only way to sharpen a knife or anything else for that matter properly is to do it by hand or buy a machine that will run you close to 1000$s the \\"edge\\" that these sharpeners leave while it may feel sharp to the touch it's whats called a false edge do yourself a real favor skip this and get a DMT sharpener I make knives and handle all sorts of sharps on a daily basis this item is a edge destruction machine"},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpfull","review":"This book brings all you need to know, be you a beginner or a competant.

Then comes a 60 page chapter on Agriculture which offers a catalogue of early sites and only alludes to Abu Hureya and the younger Dryas. The chapters on Mesoamerica and Peru are awfully sketchy. How do you manage a chapter on Peru without mentioning mit'a labor, split inheritance, or royal mummies? Don't be in any hurry to adopt this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"The movie itself? Not so good. Its a pretty predictable thriller that tends to drag itself on an on. While I will admit there are some interesting scenes, the movie really doesn't pick up until the very end when the music kicks in for the credits. Its just so haunting. Unfortunatly, I cannot say the same for the rest of the movie. To make a long story short, my opinion is if you do happen to decide to pick this movie up, don't expect greatness. Although Michael Keaton and Cane aren't bad in and of themselves, the rest of the movie is pure...well I leave the rest of the sentance up to you to decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Flick!!","review":"It seems that not alot of people have watched this little gem of a film, by the number of reviews that it has...but I have to say, that with the likes of Michael Keaton and Michael Caine, this film delivered a great action movie!!!

The movie however, STUNK.There are sooo many plot holes and oddities in this movie (the girl lying \\"dead\\" in bed is blinking, no blood on the white sheets even though she's massacred), Keaton's character is somehow easily able to go from area to area without any transportation. He's able to send email without logging into any email service. It takes him 5 minutes to padlock a woman in a caged room and then is able to get her out of there in 2 seconds (and HOW did he get the key?). The whole movie is like that -- where you watch it and go, \\"WAIT a minute. You can't DO that!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd hoped..","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this crime thriller because it starred two of my favorite actors, Michael Keaton and Michael Kaine, but as much as I tried to be objective, this one didn't shine for me. The story never came together well because the directing and editing was simply awful. Even the star power of Keaton and Kaine couldn't overcome the lousy directing. The scenes were chopped and stapled together with impunity.This film had the potential to be a success. It had a reasonably well written script and the right actors to play the parts. It's a shame it didn't turn out that way. I own the DVD, but it's one I won't be watching again any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master but..","review":"This is a recording of masterful, soulful Shakuhachi Music brought low by cheesy over blown reverb.

We all know the Flintstones are a cartoon loose adaptation of the Honeymooners...BUT------Jackie Gleason is NOT Fred Flintsone, we wanted to see Fred Flintstone not Jackie Gleason. I think the actor was capable of being Fred by being more of himself and I hope he drops the Gleason act for the next movie.If you overlook wannabe-Gleason Fred, the movie was awesome; the Great Gazoo was incredible as a special effect and for his wit. Overall, this movie was magic on the verge of greatness, they need to fix Fred and recast Wilma and they could have a very interesting movie series.

I was surprised when I checked the invoice and noticed that the movie cost about 5 USD. However, it is fair to say that even at five dollars this DVD is grossly overpriced.Why? Because this looks like the worst kind of 4th generation bootleg VHS transfer. The video is crap and the audio is worse. This is, without a doubt, the worst DVD in my library (and it won't be there long). I actually checked the packaging to see if in fact this was a studio release.If you are an afficianado of Mexican bootleg DVD's then this is for you. Otherwise, ZERO STARS .(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Caine and Frankenheimer fans ONLY","review":"The Holcraft Covenant is nothing more than your average 80's thriller that has the benefit of having a top-notch leading man and director attached. The picture looks excellent and there is just enough intrigue added to the film's premise to keep the viewer on board the whole way. Frankenheimer displays his trademark visual flair without going over the top(as many were guilty of at the time). The one thing that really detracts from the film is it's obviously low budget and irritating synth score. It is an overall average adaptation of a fairly decent Ludlum thriller that is worth picking up only for the excellent picture quality and commentary by the director. It is a delight to hear Frankenheimer discuss one of the film's most exciting scenes being filmed and constructed around of the absence of a leading man! For Fans of the star and director only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying or viewing","review":"As others have mentioned. a poor transfer to DVD with fuzzy sound and blurry pictures. But even with a good transfer, still not worth seeing. The actors and director do their best with a silly script with convoluted action that has more turns than a NASCAR race track and with unrealistic characters spouting nonsense.

There was no viewer menu, no ability to navigate the scenes.As for the show, it was pretty good. For some reason, however, the bad guys had to prove they were evil by engaging in incest. I guess Hollywood couldn't expect an audience to understand killing for money as a bad thing. The plot is somewhat corny and ripe for satire, but the movie has good production values. Michael Caine plays his role perfectly, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a stinker!","review":"Absolutely awful musical score (vintage Japanese sci fi screeches - by composer Stanislas, never to be heard from again) sets the mood for a poorly written, terribly acted movie that no doubt cost a bundle, had a good cast and great locations, but man they couldn't have ruined this one any more than they did!Just goes to show that even the bigger stars need any work some years, but I bet this stinker set Caine's and Tenant's career reps back at least a decade.

Forced to defend a movie he has obviously directed to pay his taxes. Allright, at that time (1985), few directors have resisted the Cannon Group pressure. This company hired well-known directors, screenwriters and actors and produced a lot of bad (when I say bad, I'm still nice) movies.Now, we have a Robert Ludlum novel about a nazi conspiracy, a good actor, Michael Caine, two or three old public favorites, Lilly Palmer and Mario Adorf and an action movies director : John Frankenheimer. Result : great cinematography but a marmalade thriller which will not be the highlight of Frankenheimer's filmography.Too bad MGM chooses to present this movie because sound and image are first rate. Berlin and Lake of Geneva's country are well photographed and the first five minutes of the movie, shot in black and white, are the only reason why I don't give a 1 to THE HOLCROFT COVENANT.An unnecessary DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"MGM's is widescreen","review":"It looks as though Amazon has lumped together reviews of all DVD releases of Frankenheimer's semi-infamous Ludlum potboiler (which I think is quaint but enjoyable, granting it 3-plus stars), most of which are terrible fullscreen prints offered in the public domain. If you care for the film, do yourself a favor and purchase MGM's 1999 release (currently out of print), which contains a booklet, director commentary and, contrary to the specs listed by Amazon, a clean widescreen presentation. To emphasize the point I padded my rating of 'Holcroft' to four stars instead of three.

This album is full of romance and passion especially in Latin mood with guitars, horns and percussion. With this CD, I think Ricky did prove himself he's a great singer as well as an outstanding performer. I felt a bit gloomy last weekend and after listening to this I became so happy soon.

He sings his heart out with so much passion and you can't help but love this cd. Highlights include his version of Go the Distance and of course the song that made him a star The Cup Of Life.

It has upbeat rhythmic songs like \\"Por Arriba Por Abajo\\" and the evermost popular \\"La Copa de La Vida.\\" (The Cup of Life.) It also has soft powerful romantic ballads like \\"Vuelve\\" (Come Back) which is the best song on the CD because not only his voice and words express the hurt in the song, but the powerful music expresses the grief and sadness that the song has. The piano music in that song is incredible. Also, if you enjoy Ricky Martin, I suggest you listen to Enrique Iglesias (his best CD is \\"Vivir\\") or Alejandro Sanz or Luis Miguel. They are also all extremely talented artists that also deserve rcognition. Even if you don't speak Spanish, get \\"Vuelve.\\" You'll still enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente!","review":"Vuelve is a great CD. Ricky Martin is a very talented singer. Even if you don't understand Spanish, the music will catch your attention as it did mine. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most exciting performer on the music scene today","review":"Ricky Martin's \\"Vuelve\\" is full of energy and soul. For me, it is the most refreshing, exciting CD to hit a music scene that seems dominated by stylized posers and mediocre products. Numerous tracks, including \\"Lola, Lola,\\" \\"Vuelve,\\" \\"La Copa de La Vida,\\" and \\"Por Arriba, Por Abajo\\" surpass even the work of the highly respected Gipsy Kings. Hats off to Ricky Martin: his Grammy for \\"Vuelve\\" is well-deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ORGANIC!!!!!!!!!!","review":"IF you read the ingredients you'll notice there are pthalates and paraben and dangerous artificial colors!!!

TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Page Turner","review":"I read this book a few years ago and remember thinking that it would make a great movie, just based on the action alone. But beyond that, it also has a great emotional element and a good dollop of scientific speculation - in short, I believe it has broad appeal.Anyone with even a passing interest in paleoanthropology would probably love this book. Beyond speculating about Neandertal life and habits, it attempts to answer the big question: Why our \\"cousins\\" became extinct.

But this is the bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST of the series.","review":"Felt compelled to write, reading the other reviews here. The last Zatoichi Katsu made before his death, and this one, are the WORST of the series. Do yourself a favor and get any of the ones 1-19. The first few are good films, but the ones in the mid-60s are great Zatoichi films where the character comes into his own and the fan of the series is rewarded with subtle variations on the formula and beautiful cinematography. Any Katsu Zatoichi is worth a look, but that last one and One-Armed are really mediocre and should not be considered representative of the series. To the reviewer \\"afraid\\" of getting other ones, get over it and get the better ones in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic","review":"This is also my second Zatoichi movie, my first was the last movie he made before his death. I have to say that I didn't know what to expect even though I really liked his last movie as Zatoichi. Fortunatly this movie is great and something I enjoyed from begining to end. In a way I'm a bit concerned that this may be his best movie so I'm a bit reluctant to buy more of his films. If you're a first timer to Zatoichi then buy this movie because it's a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this short review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Zatoichi movie is a must see because:1- This film also appears in the Bruce Lee's documental called \\"Bruce Lee the Legend\\".2- The final fight was awesome.3- Zatoichi ALMOST battle an army but they got scared.4- Awesome movements of Shintaro Katsu.5- Action packed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hong Kong Chinese Version","review":"I am now 61 years old, when I was a young man, my parents took me to a Chinese Theatre in L.A., Ca Chinatown to see the Chinese Version of One Armed Swordsman meets Zatoichi.

After all, I figured I deserved them after 30+ years of marriage.I used the turner to remove hash browns from my non-stick Calphalon pan and noticed an obnoxious smell. The edge of the turner was slightly melted and stunk! I trimmed off the edge thinking it was just a little extra plastic at the end.I just baked cookies and smelled the burning plastic again as I removed cookies from the cookie sheet.

The texture of these is really disgusting. I tried making several boxes both in a pot and microwave and both ways made me literally gag.

The reason is because both book are fairly similar I've noticed the only major difference is between the examples they use. In certain chapters the author might have a added a newer example or changed the wording. But most of the context is basically the same.Second the book is very well though out. It isn't your average psychology book. The author put an ideal amount of effort, into breaking down the terms. In terms of vocabulary isn't hard either like I said its a simple book written for an audience who might never had taken a psychology course before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Textbook Should Rarely Be A Work of Fiction","review":"Though I am a former English major with a love of whimsy, I found the framing of this book (the narrator is told theories of learning by an alien) obnoxious and of only questionable use. The narrator's pithy comments in text sometimes served as memorable examples, but the \\"story line\\" itself added unnecessary and often frustrating reading. I had hoped that the Old Woman was part of a learning strategy I had yet to understand - perhaps she would emphasize theories, or help to memorize material. Instead, I believe she allows the author pretend he writes for a world beyond academia.

That, plus I did see a (similar) version of it in the Sex & the City movie.The love letters in the collection are all great. That and they were written by famous people. I love the sentimentality of the letters and the timelessness of the verses. It's such a great read if you're into old-fashioned romance and grammatically correct phrasing. I managed to read and re-read the book many times before I parted with it to be enjoyed by someone else.I'm not too crazy about spending over $30 for a book though unless it's a collectible.

I've wanted to see where the old lines used to run, and this book has been the best I've found, if you want to find the old routes of the long-lost Virginian or Pere Marquette railroads.The capsule histories that adjoin the maps are helpful as well; it's a quick way to learn how the Penn Central went bankrupt or the way that the big modern railroads absorbed the rest. The maps are listed by railroad, seem to cover most of the old companies, sometimes going back to the beginning of rail operations in the early 19th C., rather than state by state as in some atlases.

This is especially true since Porter Cable has joined the ranks of other companies, manufactoring their blades and bits in China. I have a number of Porter Cable tools, and they've always been first rate. I was really surprised when I received my new 7518, and it only had one collet.

I have both the original \\"Musical Massage\\" CDs and this one contains tracks that are more like re-recordings of the tracks on the originals. The melodies are recognizable, but the overall balance of instruments has been changed, and in some cases the addition of cheesy new synth strings has occured. The tracks are still beautiful compositions, but they just don't sound like David Darling to me - more like some new-age compilation DJ's reinterpretation of what DD should sound like.

I once read that if you put a group of monkeys in a room banging on typewriters, eventually they would come up with a novel. This must be that novel. I found it contrived, too pat, illogical and unbelieveable. Not to mention boring and uninteresting. It read like a grown-up Bobsey Twins novel. Amateurish.

This one song alone is so great...I am really hoping the rest of the album follows suit (have not purchased the album yet). \\"Hush\\" is so psychedelic and ahead of its time....no wonder it's a classic!

John Lord caught the Fudge in fall '67 when they played London and were one of the hottest bands around. Ritchie Blackmore was more into Hendrix after making a living as a session player and in bands like Jerry Lee Lewis' back-up band. When Lord and Blackmore came together in early '68 they agreed they wanted to become a British Vanilla Fudge with Hendrix overtones. This is what they came up with......\\"Hush\\" and \\"Hey Joe\\" are the best tracks here. They were still finding their direction, and only became \\"heavier\\" when Zeppelin's first album came out in '69.

There is only one song on here that is even remotely listenable, and that's Hush. The rest of the album is dull, dull, dull. So boring it would make the bowling tournaments on TSN look like brilliant entertainment. I'm a big Deep Purple fan, but not of the Mark I albums. In fact, I'd even say I HATE that lineup. Deep Purple might have done great things later on, but that psychadelic pop they did in the 60s was truely awful!

I consider myself an audio fanatic and music definately sounds a hell of alot better playing through a great sound system. After the ipod became more and more portable I knew i had to have a sound dock that i could bring with me wherever i go. Such as work, parties, and trips. The inmotion 9 gives me all that plus superb sound. I initially compared this to the bose system and honestly I couldnt hear the difference. But a hundred dollars cheaper sure sounded great. There was also a dock that apple made. Sounded great, but was extremely heavy and by no way a convenience to anyone. Imagine the carrying case that might come with it, you could workout with it. The im9 comes with a great backpack that u can take on hikes and deep sea diving. haha not really. Backpacks aside, this is a great ipod dock speaker system and i definately reccomend it to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate higher if it sounded like it did in the store","review":"I heard one of the IM9 systems at a Best Buy store and thought it sounded great. The store didn't have one so I ordered online (for less $). When I received it, their was an odd pop in the bass at reasonably low volumes. I actually took it to the store to compare it to the one there, and it sounded bad! The store still didn't have one so I exchanged it online. The second one does the same as the first. I will return this one and probably buy something else. It's a great idea, but the quality of sound wasn't consistent. It also has no treble/bass adjustment.

First, I tried to go to the website given on the box as the way to order the adapter. That website does not exist.After registering with the company so that I could email a request for an adapter for the new Nano, both of my emails were ignored and then deleted (even though they did give me a Reference Number for each of my questions).

This misleading information left me wishing I could have given the product a zero rating because the omission made the product unfit for it's intended and advertised purpose for me. It might be a great product but I was unable to judge it's performance because I don't own an iPod the IM9 would accommodate. If like me, you have a 2nd gen. Nano, you're out of luck.

In the product description, it claims that it comes with international plug adapters. One of the reasons I purchased the iM9 is that I travel extensively abroad and planned to use those plugs.

As I said it's not answered so apparently no one else could get the source to compile either. As I said in the forum if authors would simply include a jar file with the source this problem would not exist. Since the author used eclipse to generate the examples and since it's a simple mouse click in eclipse to do this, it must be laziness on the authors part. I'll change my rating once (if) the source code compiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I have used Spring for over a year including Spring MVC.

It also has some of the best photos of any of the bios out there, in small b/w spread throughout the book. The photos could be bigger though and the only big color photos were animation art rather than the other great photos that are in the book of Walt at home, play, & work.

At first, I was using the parallel port connection (don't even think about doing this). The connection isn't fast enough for the printer and every page you try to print will be illegible. Using the USB connection has helped, but I still throw out about 1 out of every 3 pages that I print because they don't come out correctly.In short, the S400 isn't reliable.

Most of the selections were recorded 20 years prior to this production. She's the sort of artist for whom each performance is unique, finding something new each time.

In a nutshell: Two brothers are released from prison on the same day, then decide to return to a life of crime. That's it!! That's everything this movie has to offer. Bowie had a great opportunity to take his character of an aging English Ganster to some interesting places.

I asked if they had a repair facility in Canada and was told yes, but they will not repair scanners for customers from the United States. My advice is to steer clear of Microtek products until they work out their problem with servicing their products. It will be interesting to see if they actually work to solve this problem, I sense they may not, as their customer service rep had the discounts for a replacement scanner memorized with the discounts diminishing as the scanner ages.

Already, the system was a pain.We never WERE able to use it without it leaking all over the place, but I guess that's the price you pay for clean drinking water. The straw that broke the camel's back was when the dial on the side became too difficult to turn. I have mobility problems, and I could no longer switch between tap and filtered water. I tried to take the unit apart to clean the buildup and couldn't even get the pieces unscrewed. I threw the whole thing in the garbage and ordered a Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter.

In addition the light that is suppose to indicate whether to change the filter shows green when there is no filter in the system, but when you put the filter in the light turns kind of a dark gray so you can't tell if it is red or green...I suppose I will use it until the new filter I have is used, but I doubt I will buy another Brita product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita water filter","review":"The waterflow was more of a spray instead of a smooth solid stream.The filtering result was very satisfactory tho. changing the filter was easy,which I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly made","review":"I've gone through 4 of these in about 5 years.

The light on the from that tells you when to change the filter is a nice idea and works fine.

I was a bit skeptical about the indicator, because I really loved the flashing LED on the last Brita we had. I should've listened to my intuition. Most days, it was difficult to see what it was showing. The worst part about this filter, though, is the switch. I shouldn't have to twist the switch with the force it takes to remove machine-tightened lug nuts off a car tire. The entire filter is just designed so poorly that it's not worth it.

It was kind of tolerable in the beginning but after 3 months became VERY difficult. My girlfriend can't turn it at all, and I can if I try as hard as I can. I've had two units and they both had this problem.

However the switch is so hard to turn I've been using a wrench to turn it. That's a little ridiculous in my book.

I don't mind letting it drip slowly after sediment clog up, except it won't even drip normally in a straight line. The filtered water runs in all different directions along the base and water ends up dripping left, right, center - all over the place. You can't even catch the water evenly. Poor design, lousy product. You'll get better performance in the brita filter pitcher and filter will surely last much longer, and probably drip quicker too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, with this one (Sorry, Brita)...","review":"I rather like their filtering pitcher, but the on-faucet filter is a piece of junk. Why?? It blows off the faucet, right out of the box.I called Brita, & they sent a bunch of adapters. Still blew itself off the faucet, twice in a night. The problem, was, the filter would not tighten on the adapters. If the screw-on part was metal, NO PROBLEM, I am certain, because the [PUR] filter it was supposed to replace --two years + old, & finally leaking around the seams-- has a metal attaching apparatus. Will have to continue using it, until I can find a replacement.Thank goodness, for Amazon's excellent returns policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One month out of warranty","review":"This system was great for a while.

A few months into using my second piece, i started having the same problem again! Essentially the entire unit will pop off the faucet. As highlighted by several others, the threads are poorly made and wears out easily. I have resorted to using parafilm strips to lace the threads so as to make the grip better.

If you want true merengue, go out and listen to Rikarena, Bananas, Sergio Vargas, etc... there are so many out there, but this guy's media overexposition and terrible sound are enough to make anyone with a decent ear for music sick.

The melodies are catchy and vary with every song as opposed to other artists whose songs sometimes all seem to carry the same melody.

Specifically, moves are broken down into small steps, you see the moves repeated, and written out tips come onto the screen.

On a few songs I half expected Tafkap or Chaka Khan to show up--\\"Chicago\\" and \\"Your Song\\" in particular--but that's just how I think. My favorite jams on this are \\"At the River\\", \\"Pre 63\\", and \\"Dusk You and Me\\" which are ingenious loops of mellow funky sequencing over riffs of brass, woodwinds, synthesizer and voice.

I really liked I See You Baby when I saw the video and I figured that this was a good Fatboy Slim clone band that would tide me over until Fatboy himself released his own new album. I then saw the CD and realized that the song sounded like Fatboy Slim because he's the one that mixed the video version! That led me to fear that the rest of the album would be completely different, and alas, I was right. The rest of the album is chock full of Air-ish, Moby-ish, subdued, funky, jazzy, ambient pastiche. I mean, if you like that stuff, fine, BUT DON'T LURE ME IN WITH A VIDEO THAT IS TOTALLY MISLEADING AS TO WHAT YOU ARE ALL ABOUT! Fatboy fans, stay away and patiently wait for his new stuff to come out.

Tracks like 'If Everybody Looked The Same' and 'I See You Baby' will fill the dance floor while 'Dusk You and Me' and 'Serve Chilled' will keep the chill out zone happily occupied. Best of all is the single 'At The River' which samples the unique vocal talent of Petti Page - best known for singing 'How Much Is That Doggie In The Window' (bizzare!) - from her late fifties single 'Old Cape Cod'.

She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the \\"who, where and why\\" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling mystery that keeps you guessing till the end.","review":"This book was one of the finest book i've ever read.

Two unappealing characters meander through a shoddy landscape, trying to avoid monsters.

A little better and at least you could be mildly entertained a bit. The \\"monster\\" scenes (if you call watching CGI octopus aliens fornicate watching monsters)are all shot in the dark. All. A few dead body parts in daylight. No whole monsters were ever to be seen in the light. It was just entertaining enough, just enough, so you can keep watching hoping that any minute this will get a little bit like \\"signs\\" scairy (which it never does).

Not to be funny, but no way would I give a stranger (she has only known the guy for about 24 hours at this point) my passport to hold on to. I would also not get offended if the guy who she has only known for about 24 hours slept with some strange woman he picked up in the bar.I found both characters pretty annoying over all.

The second statement could only be true if no other monster movies were released in the same year as this movie. Though the premise seems pretty OK, and the production of the movie seems to be pretty high quality, the story-telling is dull and the movie ends with little direction or closure. This isn't a movie you'll watch again and again. Once is plenty! The movie actually moves very slowly and the romantic attempts in the movie fall completely flat.

Sadly, this film had more of the former and less of the latter. You probably watched the trailer so you don't need a synopsis. Basically, the writing and acting sucked. SOOOOO cheesey. These scenes we're meant to buy are just too contrived and character development is rushed. (Granted the movie's only 94 minutes.) These characters go from being total strangers, cold and distant, to being friends like they had been for years and then romantic in a matter of days. Felt the main character de-evolved from and able and savvy journalist to a college frat boy on spring break. The one ok thing about the movie, interspersed between scenes of lame dialogue, there are a handful of mediocre to pretty cool monster sequences. The creatures themselves were kinda cool.

While I like action in my sci-fi, placing too much emphasis on it shallows out the real root of what makes for great sci-fi---the examination of humanity and culture. If you enjoy the more thought provoking aspects of the genre, give this a try.

Most of them were good. So I bought it along with the other dvds I really wanted to buy.I just finished watching the movie. IT IS Sooooooo boring. The movie IS NOT one of the monsters movies that year. Well, if they did not do another one the very same year, then the quote might be correct.There are hardly monsters to see and the story is only about a photographer who has to bring his boss's daughter back from Mexico to the USA. It is about their relationship and trip back to the US. Nothing really happens.I am really mad at me that I bought this movie. It is only worth to scrap it!

But it wasn't. There's a lot of low budget monster movies I've enjoyed. The main characters might as well as been wooden puppets for the chemistry between them.It wasn't really a monster movie. It wasn't really a social commentary movie. No romance. The whole movie seemed to be just a half step out of kilter.

I've heard of slow, but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle. It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago, there is now an \\"infected\\" zone where you cannot leave, and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out. Yeah, I get the symbolism there, but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story.

So go ahead and watch...BORE yourself to death..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The cast and script were more than adequate--where the movie fell down was billing it as a \\"thriller\\" and \\"horror\\". It was neither of these things. As a think piece, it was quite good; what a shame that it must disappoint those audiences who are actually expecting the Monster movie that it was billed as for it certainly is not that. My poor review reflects, in part, that disappointment. If you watch this movie expecting a morality play, a think piece, with quite tame moments of suspense, then you will not be disappointed. Quite the opposite. The other issue may be nit picky--i felt the dark lighting went a little too far. In the interests of evoking a mood, most of the film is shot at night. It came across as almost too dark to see on my pc, hence a large portion of the film's ambience was lost in a dark splotch that would last minutes at a time. This problem is probably rectified on the large screen--one would hope so in any case."},{"rating":"2","title":"As great as CLOVERFIELD should have been!","review":"First off, there are plenty of \\"Monsters\\" in this film.

Production values were first rate, but the movie did not meet expectations for the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie...but not what everybody expects","review":"If you want a movie full of brainless E.T. killing action, do not rent or buy this one. I read a couple of reviews before doing it and avoided the dissapointment. I think that when you know what to expect, \\"Monsters\\" is actually a pretty good movie about people in an extreme and very unlikely situation. The creatures are just an excuse to witness the human characters deal with their issues. It can also be an alegory to immigration and, of course, it has an ecological message. Very elegantly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Potential","review":"Realistic characters, understated dialog, good cinematography and special effects all come up short in what appears to be an off-hand statement on current American Immigration Policies and the demographic shift in the southwest. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts. Disappointed not only with the money spent to rent it but the lost opportunity to make a genuine monster movie. Watch Cloverfield or Alien Raiders instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was dull","review":"Mainly this is a movie about two people going on a journey, it just so happens that they are going through an area where alien monsters live. Nothing really exciting happens and it just seems to go on forever. I kept waiting for the good part, it just wasn't there.They could have just made a movie about a couple traveling together without the alien backdrop, because the aliens had very little to do with it.The movie did prove a point though, that you can have F-22's in a movie and it can still be boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and disappointing","review":"This is yet another science fiction film that begins with a good story idea, but drops the ball. It took at least 40 minutes for anything to happen and when it appeared there might be some action the movie ended. If you want to see a good science fiction movie watch Splice, because Monsters doesn't make the cut. Why do so many film makers think aliens look like squids or reptiles?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful movie","review":"A thoughtful movie. Environmentalism on a universal scale. Human concepts of fear, evil and good all put into question.

I hope more come out like it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving, Bad Script","review":"The pacing is terrible. Everything moves entirely too slowly and, when there is movement, it's jumbled and nonsensical. There's overall poor transitioning and a suspect cast; though, possibly the problem is the source--the script. The imagery in the scenes is also not well thought out and the directing is bad. The premise is interesting, but the execution is far-fetched, to the point of being boring because there's no realism, so no concern, for the characters, and, to \\"add salt to injury,\\" there's nothing really interesting happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised, but pleasantly so.","review":"I started this movie wondering if I was going to get bored and shut it off half way through. Word of warning, if you are looking for an action movie this is NOT for you. If you can truly appreciate a STORY and not just explosions, you may enjoy this film. Not much dialog, but wonderful visuals and they serve to inform the viewer better than dialog would in its place. All in all, worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd watch the Sequel","review":"I enjoy this genre. I'd read $400k budget and Gareth Edwards doing his own CGI work, and plenty of folks dissing the effort. I watched it twice before the rent was up and will own a copy. So much of the story 'had one foot in reality'; foreigners in foreign lands, the career and unexpected demands, unlikely bond 'in the moment' grown by shared experience. As our two mains move through the story their situations and interplay are not wholly absurd as much sci-fi/fantasy often is. The monsters 6 years in, 'that season' now and a tipping point reached? And the end begs continuation. McNairy some unlikely hero for money, imagined love, or his word? And just how rocked will Able's and everybody elses world be? I'd watch another installment of their perils and these monsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A waste of time. I wondered why it lasted in theaters for such a short time. Now I know. Outside of about ten minutes worth of action, I was bored to the point of falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick flick gone wrong","review":"If I had wanted to watch a movie about two people thrown together in tense circumstances, there are alot of cheaper chick flicks I could have wasted my time and money on. The monsters in The Mist were much better and more believable, not to mention more of them. How this movie is going to cover the 15K it took to make it, is beyond me. I would consider my money lost if this mess was 1.99 to rent. Save your cash for something worth the time to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Si-Fi with some typical love entanglement","review":"Not even worth while renting. All the reviews seem to be written by those who have some vested interest in the film. A lot of cheap movie shots of Mexico somewhere and homes still not repaired from Hurricane Katrina event. Standard boy meets girl who is already engaged but ends up not wanting to getting married to her husband to be, but falls in love with the guy she has the adventure with. Like the last Titanic movie disaster. I waste a lot of time watching movies, and this was very much of a waste of time. The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land. The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land. And these monsters were not all that distinct. The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds. Very stupid. At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is tedious, slow, boring - make you want to gnaw your foot off to escape boring","review":"This movie is horrible. It is tied with Battlefield Earth for the worst movie ever created. The characters are un-interesting, it is tediously slow, the plot is non existant. It is about as exciting as watching people ride the city bus, which by the way is probably 1/2 this movie. Watching them ride in a bus, taxi, boat. It's like they made a total of 60 seconds of special effects then later just said 'hey, film these painfully boring people riding around Mexico for 90 minutes to pad the film\\" Half way into the movie I was so bored that I started to fast forward to the \\"good parts\\". Guess what? There are not really any good parts. It literally gets interesting for 10seconds then 20more minutes of pad the filmKeep in mind. I'm not a movie snob.

The build up took so long I had lost interest in the fate of the main two characters, the f/x were B-movie laughable (and not in a good, kitschy way) and the usual series of ludicrously stupid decisions to push the plot along one sees in this type of movie were beyond farcical.

Unfortunately I fell for it. I won't fall for it again.To be fair. The film maker had a nice eye for cinematography, but the storyline and acting was weak. I would not have minded that there wasn't really a MONSTER MOMENT, but then the storyline should have been MUCH stronger with MUCH more tension. It's a good premise, perhaps a touch recycled. It could have been a much better film.Lastly, you know what would be really ground-breaking? Huh? Skip the Hollywood Ending Kiss!

Oh, there's some scenes with monsters but not enough to warrant the title. Oh and while I'm at it, the monsters' design is just soooo original.This movie goes nowhere.

As for the female lead, she should have won an award for most irritating laugh/giggle/chortle. Other than that she just pouted, frowned and really just did not contribute anything to the film. Ten minutes into the film my partner and I were eagerly anticipating the two of them being disemboweled and eaten by the 'monsters' (for 'monster' read Kang from The Simpsons); just so that it would be all over and done with and we wouldn't have to suffer their whining voices any longer.

Don't buy or even rent this movie it sucked big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny bad","review":"I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Story with Monsters","review":"Too few monsters...too much love. This misleading title and cover art is a well crafted film but there's little action...lots of love between two strangers...and the plot is extremely thin. Kudos to Scott McNairy and Whitney Able for their acting performances...only 2 stars for the movie because it is in no way a \\"monster\\" flick. It's a drawn out love story that just so happens to have monsters (they look like inflated carnival parade balloons) in the background. This could have been a great film. It isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not picky in terms of movies.","review":"I enjoyed a mediocre movie once in a while but this is terrible. Special effects are ridiculously unrealistic. 1/5.

I didn't realize it was a dull, listless walk through someone's attempt at making a point through cinema. Acting was there, scenery was there, the extraterrestrials were not. There was no suspense and I could not bring myself to care about either of the characters.

LAME","review":"The movie had potential as it was a different outlook on alien movies, but fell flat on its face as it turned into a drama/romance between the two main characters. The beginning was slow, but I figured it'd pick up...It didn't. The middle had a few things in it though mainly provided us with insight that the two characters were beginning to like each other...Really? After watching the ending, I was sorely disappointed and rather happy it was over. If this is your idea of a good movie, you are certainly impressed by anything. The CGI octopi monsters were pretty lame, just sounding like a whale whenever a noise from them was made.

I'm done reviewing now, hope I've been helpful..-Cam"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprised","review":"As an avowed fan of Marvel movies and fast paced blockbusters, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Intrigued might be a better word. Some plot issues were obvious, such as the theft of their passports and money following his night of drunken debauchery. But others, like the night attack on their convoy, and the encounter in the river (who could have imagined that was a 2 seat F16 in the water, and given what we saw of these creatures, how did it get there?) were pure genius, and not something I expected from this movie. Overall, it was very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filmmaking 203","review":"This movie started with the feel of a friday night chiller movie and instead of developing into something more, it developed into something less. The concept of a quarantine area in the middle of the North American continent was unique and something that could have been developed more fully. The major monsters turn out to be flying squids which lay glowing eggs next to the moss and lichens on the side of tree trunks. When the action gets going, it's hard to tell who's deadlier, the monsters or the combined airforces fighting them. Gas is the preferred weapon.I'm guessing the budget for the film was limited and that in turn impacted the quality of the photography(lighting and color), acting and sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic surprise of a film","review":"I found this movie here on Amazon while looking for more traditional action packed type killer aliens taking over the world kind of movies.This movie has a quiet feel, that focuses much more on the interaction of the main characters with each other, and the people that they encounter on their journey. This movie is NOT an action packed gore fest. I got the impression that it was a much slower pace like \\"The Thing\\" or the first \\"Alien\\", though much less frightening. If you love monster movies, but are getting tired of non stop silly action of these new generation PG 13 Horror movies that seem to only satisfy the 14 and under crowd, then try \\"Monsters\\" for a little more robust \\"adult\\" suitable monster adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"For a movie called Monsters with little to no scenes with the \\"Monsters\\", it was one of the most visually entertaining films I've seen.

I could understand someone not liking this if they were watching for a monster/horror film, but the main character is a photographer and if you look at things like he would it kind of changes things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching Isn't Story-telling","review":"As a low-budget science fiction, it could have worked well. Unfortunately, the heavy-handed, politically-correct allegory overwhelms the modest plot. I would like to have given it three stars, because it was quite well made, but I had to demote it to two. If one is to use a tale in service of allegory, it shouldnt feel as though that is only purpose of the story. Just write an editorial instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Everything Cloverfield should have been but wasn't because of the obvious desire to make things blockbusterish and over the top. 'Monsters' is how you make a meditative science fiction horror...endless tension and it explores a real human experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small budget love story over a sci-fi background","review":"Very well done on a small budget...if you are looking for Transformers or something with a lot of running and explosions you won't like this. But the storyline is plausible even if sparse. The movie was satisfying if you can appreciate that less is more and don't have to have every single thing explained to you. There are some not always subtle political undertones to the movie but it's not heavy handed. It's really a movie persons movie and a nice study of two people in a unusual situation which is kinda the point with science fiction storytelling. One last thought, the scenery portrayed in the movie is fantastic and the special effects fit the overall look of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"way to go little movie","review":"wow. just wow. how often do you get a small drama done well without being trite? rarely. How often do you get a monster movie where the the monsters are done well without detracting from the main characters?

I almost wish they would have come up with a better title though. The \\"monsters\\" while essential to the story are not what the story is really about.

Since I have baking soda, oatmeal, European clay, citric acid and salt in my cupboards already (and the kit comes with about $5 worth of these ingredients) and keep essential oils (the oils in the kit are synthetic- maybe $3 worth) the only benefits are the jars and directions.

I feel like I spent $30 for a few ingredients, most of which I had in my pantry, some small empty jars, and a handful of recipes that I could have easily found on the internet.

However, I found that these steel guides do not work nearly as smoothly as brass guides such as those available from Oak Park. The reason may be the cadmium plating doesn't seem to be very smooth. The brass guides are quite a bit more expensive but are very well machined. When I bought my Leigh D4 Dovetail fixture, I was advised by the Leigh rep at the woodworking show to not use the PC guides. Leigh can supply guide sets that are very high quality machined steel.

I had to return this on the same day I had to return a VCR that didn't work. Don't things work anymore?

Customer service stinks. with the help of a screwdriver and some masking tape, (to hold the wire in it's correct position), I was able to get this thing working right. As for scanning film negatives with the optional adapter, save you money, it does a losey job.

It worked ok until the short warranty ran out. One day I turned it on, scanned one page and poof smoke started pouring out. After inspecting the inside for the cause, I found a transistor had 2 bad solder joints made by the factory that finally oxidized to point of failure and burned out several components. Contacted Microtek by email for parts. They would not sell me any parts but wanted me to spend much money to send them the scanner for repair. They were even too cheap to furnish me with a schematic.

My only recommendation is to buy the plunge base and router together as a kit since then you get the case for it and it's much cheaper. PC charges a premium if you buy things separately. I can't find a case that is sold separately for the combo kit either so if you buy them at different times like I did you are stuck with pieces of a kit rambling around in your shop.

There is a strong, what I like to call, \\"ICK\\" factor in this book. Rachel believes that the man known as Emmett is her brother. There is lots of sexual tension between them right from the beginning, and they even share a passionate kiss even though they are \\"siblings\\". This almost made me sick. I hate incest plot lines.

Though there are fine moments, overall, I couldn't wait for the trip to end -- I mean, how many times can he talk about the photo he took 40 years ago at a Mexican border crossing?

The stories were cut short just when they could have illustrated a point (I wish the author had continued sharing the story so that I could see if I connect with that person's situation, decision, and outcome). Instead, I found her writing a bit choppy, cutting off before I could benefit from the stories included.The main message seemed to be self stimulation, which I did not anticipate when I was buying the book, so I was a bit disappointed that this seemed to be the only lesson.I also think the material is a little outdated (written in the 70's).

I think that after his long speech when Caitlin came home from the hospital, there should have been more time before Caitlin took him back. Jordan pushed too hard, in my opinion. I could not STAND a man who hovered the way he did.

How does one know if product defective without opening?!! Note that on current website product has been considerably reduced after my complaint. I'm disputing the charge. This is a product with arms that wobble so much it is unsafe for us. In our opinion a shoddy, dangerous, item that should never be sold to seniors.

It tells the lenegadry story of the warrior king who turned pacifist and spread the code of Buddhism. Produced by Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla, it stars Khan as the troubled emeperor. The true triumph, however, is Kareena Kapoor. She electrifies the screen with her awesome presence as Kaurwaki, an exiled warrior princess with the ferocity and heart of a lioness. Great music, choreography, and cinematography, and direction make Asoka one of the year's best films."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want this movie.","review":"Asoka is like gladiator, but with morals, awesome indian dance sequences, and the hottest girl in the world. you will be crying like you did for titanic (yes, that means you toughguy).

Asoka, the main character, goes from being a warrior prince to an angry despot to finally discovering the magical transformance that can occur when one discover's their love for all of humanity. This is a movie that would be most appropriate for the present time in which our country wants to wage war on a nation (Iraq) that has done nothing to us. Asoka is a subject that should be discussed in all of our public schools and universities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring love story, that's all!","review":"I got this film with high expectations. The first 10 minutes were great, then there was 1-1/2 hours of boring love story, followed by 40 minutes of thumb twiddling while Asoka recovers from a wound, then a few minutes of plot followed by one of the dullest battle scenes I've ever seen. Lovely cinematography, appealing musical numbers, but a boring story. Rent, don't buy. I am so disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asoka, such a great film...minus Bollywood","review":"I have been so very impressed and touched by this film. I only wish for a version that would enable me to turn off the \\"Bollywood\\" music scenes. The \\"music video\\" quality of these inserts is very silly and trite to western eyes.

Asoka's whip and the fight moves were a bit lame, but that's the action. The film was about love, the effects of imperialism, and union.

The only real cool thing about the movie was that there really was THAT many elephants and warriors and horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang on to your seat...","review":"Asoka was visually mind-blowing, and the storyline was inescapably crafted around some of India's history.

The first half of the movie was extended too long and made me want to fast-forward to an interesting scene. The second half was better, though. The film wasn't necessarily bad, just much too overhyped. Unfortunately, the film did not include the greatest period of Asoka's life. There are some good songs, however. Don't have high expectations when (if) you watch \\"Asoka,\\" or you will feel disappointment as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the king really shine?","review":"Asoka really was reviewed as a magnificent portrayal, but I have to disagree. Shahrukh's acting was good, but his producting and directing skills alongside Juhi Chawla is hardly eyecatching. I'd have to say Kareena Kapoor delivered the best performance, especially with the female fight scene, even though she did end up being like the Indian Britney Spears, by taking off her clothes. It isn't shown, but the film shows a lot of violent and sexual themes, amidst the chaotic action. The music is excellent though, except for the annoying \\"Aa Tayar Hoja\\". I wouldn't waste my money on this, it really isn't too great at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"The only good part of this movie is the heroine fight scene, the music, the cinematography, art direction, and Malayalam fighting style.

Probably in the 3-4 star rating for a \\"B-rated\\" cheese flick. Watch it with a group of friends and the aid of some mind altering substances, and you'll have a good time. Just remember to keep the DVD remote at hand to skip over the \\"song and dance\\" routines.

This is the second one I've bought. The display is nice and easily readable. The unit runs forever on one battery and provides all of the basic information ( speed, distance, time) for monitoring your trip or amateur bicyclist training ride. The only problem with this unit is that it sits in a simple bayonet lock on its mounting pad. The bayonet lock makes the computer easy to remove when you have to leave your bike unattended but it also makes it easy to fall out of the mount in response to severe vibration or shocks. Lost my last one while transporting the bike on the back of my car(with computer mounted)during a 30 mile normal highway trip.Good value for the price but be sure to secure the computer in its mount else in may fall out at an inopportune time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ON THE MARKET!","review":"I have tried a variety of bicycle speedometers and Sigma is the best by far. Instaltion is not a problem if you follow the directions or have prior experience installing other bike speedometers. The display is large, clear, and flawless. The power cord from the speedometer to the wheel area is larger than the Bell's and less prone to breakage. What I like most about the Sigma is its accuracy. I would recommend that you use the wheel size instructions in the directions booklet as a starting point and then check your settings over a known distance. You can then tweak your numbers for the extreme accuracy you desire. The best thing I can say about this unit is that it is quality at a reasonable price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price","review":"This is a good beginning bike computer, and for the price it has a good set of features such as average speed indicator.

Two lasted a year and the most recent I gave up on after 3 weeks. I then decided to buy a quality wired cyclocomputer - and the BC906 fitted the bill. I chose wired because I found wireless was affected by my flashing LED headlamp - the flashes were interpreted as speed when the two were adjacent.I'm very pleased with the BC906 - it's accurate, easy to fit (no tools required), and highly legible. It's easy to set-up although the pictogram-based instruction book is not particularly easy to follow and could be better.It doesn't have a backlight or ambient temperature - nice-to-have but not essential features. I chose it over a similarly featured and priced Cateye because the BC906 had a larger, clearer display.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great German Quality","review":"This is my 3rd Sigma and Ive only had great experience with their cyclocomputers. Easy to install within 30 minutes and option to have on stem or bar. Chose the stem like many of the pros. No tools are needed just elastic bands and a plastic tie for the wire down the fork. Easy to read and the buttons are very easy to access. Readouts seem accurate and the arrow up or down to show you where you are on the average speed is great.Only gripe is when to reset for another ride you need to reset each reading (trip time, average speed, fastest speed...) in my past sigmas, I reset the trip time and it reset all the other readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunatley dissatisfied","review":"I recently purchased a concord reference Bible and was excited to receive it in the mail until I found several problems with it.

They are very solidly built, durable, and I believe they are very safe when used properly. The problem is installation. Our cars don't have LATCH systems and it is next to impossible to install these securely with the shoulder belt. I typically have to wrestle with each one for 20-40 minutes, often injuring my back and fingers to get them securely into our '92 Accord. Using the tether helps but it's very difficult to get the the shoulder/lap belt tight enough to minimize play, even using the locking clips.They simply will not fit safely in our '93 Corolla. Even the LATCH installations can be quite difficult in the rental cars we've used. The straps can also be quite difficult to adjust--they seem to get stuck underneath. I would love to give these a much higher rating but installation is so difficult that it can seriously compromise safety, not to mention usability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Compact","review":"Love these seats.

The middle uses the belt strap that comes with the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat!","review":"We purchased 3 Radian 65's for use by for our 4 year old son. We have one in each of our vehicles and in grandmas car. Our son loves it. Very comfortable and it puts him in a position where he can see better and do more while he is strapped in for long trips. Plus easy to recline for naps. Critical to us is the 5 point safety harness. Having that is much more safe and secure than using a traditional seat belt on booster seats. And this thing is built solid!. Not flimsy like so many of those other booster seats. I found it easy to assemble. It is very heavy, so toting it around is not easy, but using the carry bag makes that easier. I like how it just folds up, so easy to store away. Cover is not easy to get off to wash, but I have yet to find any car seat other than Britax that is easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Able to fit 2 in Prius plus Peg Perego SIP","review":"Problem: 2 toddlers and 1 infant all need to fit into a 2004 Prius.Solution: 2 Radian car seats forward-facing on each side in the back seat and a Peg Perego SIP infant seat rearward-facing in the middle. All seats are using the LATCH anchors and the Radian seats additionally are employing the headrest/seatback tethers.Note: This setup also works in the Scion Xb.You could probably find something other than the Peg Perego to use as an infant seat since it is really the narrow base dimensions of the Radian car seats that make this setup possible.The only minor drawbacks I can see to the Radian car seats are the price (on the high side but still at $180 each not the most expensive seats out there) and the weight (HEAVY in comparison to others but that is the trade-off for the sturdy quality due to the steel support frame construction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Seat, Super Safe, Super Heavy","review":"I love this seat for a variety of reasons. The latches are like seat belt clips- easy to undo as well as do. The frame is solid- certain of its ability to hold up in the worst of crashes. There is a safestop belt to connect to the harness for smaller children in the seat. It folds with a velcro closure. It can recline a bit. It is well padded, even though it doesn't look like it. My son can't unbuckle himself across the chest like other seats I have. It fits in the back of my Subaru Forester with two other seats.The downside is there is no way I would carry this seat through a big airport. It weighs close to 30 lbs and I've worn it just to transport around from car to car and it is quite a feat- very uncomfortable. I also have a Combi Coccoro and I would gladly tow it around in an airport with my three kids and pregnant belly. So, unless you have a carry bag to put it in or only have one kid I wouldn't buy this for its portability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buckle defective - it breaks!","review":"Just like an earlier reviewer, the one prong of the chest buckle on my son's Radian 65 carseat snapped off when I was putting him in the car today. The seat is only about 1.5 years old, and we are the original owners. Clearly, the plastic is not high quality, and cannot withstand routine use. I shudder to think what might have happened had it been tested in an accident. Sunshine Kids should recall the product instead of hiding behind a one-year warranty.

What kind of child's product isn't machine washable?!? Our one year old vomited old milk all over the car seat, and no amount of hand washing was going to get the smell of sour milk out, so we threw it in the wash... and it practically disintegrated.

Thicker straps in the back, and stitch those straps so they'd survive a hurricane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for high impact activities","review":"This bra is comfortable, but definitely NOT for high impact activities like running. I got the 36-38 C/D and wore it for a run this morning - painful, to say the least!

The animation however is not as catchy (or dark) as it was in All Dogs Go To Heaven 1 and therefore the characters look a bit different. The first film had songs integrated in it and so does this one. Although in the original film had doggies singing the songs too I find the singing dogs in All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 to be a little corny. The songs are nice however.

Come on, Mr. Frost-give me the next installment this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the game's afoot!","review":"This is a classic fantasy thriller that features Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes as the hero! Doyle with the aid of a Holmeslike sleuth names Jack Sparks must match wits with a band of criminals trying to take over England by supernatural means. This novel combines thrills, chills, humor and a little romance it also has one dandy of a final line."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"Take the book,The 7 Percent Solution, and mix it in with the film, Young Sherlock Holmes, add a pinch of The Mummy, and you have this book. It's not a bad book, I mean, Frost clearly can write, and you won't feel that you have wasted your money. It delivers what it sets out to do: historical mystery/thriller/horror story, etc., etc. It's just so dang derivative that there is no incentive to seek out anything else by this writer. If you want the adventure/horror thrills, get the 2 movies mentioned above. If you want a Sherlock Holmes pastiche, read Nicholas Meyer's book. Or better yet, if you want the REAL Sherlock Holmes, read the real thing. They are still very fun books, especially the Hound of the Baskervilles."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would A.C.Doyle think?","review":"I started this story because I was amused by the concept of turning A.C.Doyle into a fictional character. Sort of completes the circle started by fan's insistant belief that his creation Holmes was a real person. (Also I'll read anything about Holmes, no matter how outragous) Unfortunately the plot in this story lagged, Jack Sparks is a wonderfully drawn charcter, but as soon as he was offstage I was bored, and skimming ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and dark mystery that has an interesting spin!","review":"This tale of Arthur Conan Doyle and his years prior to his fame is exciting, inviting and really worth your time. As you are propelled through a dark and sinister Victorian England, excitement, action, and intrigue draw you into the story. Many actual historical figures creep into the plot and as you will see, Holmes and Watson had an interesting birth.This is a must read for any Sherlock Holmes fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Frost: A.C.

Well worth the read"},{"rating":"1","title":"INTERESTING MOMENTS BUT NOT ENOUGH","review":"This book has an interesting premise and well developed characters, but fails to deliver on its full potential. I really liked the idea of a story from A. C. Doyle's perspective with overtones on his writing of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, but the overall characters in the book seemed stilted and incomplete. Nevertheless, the action and pace were good, but the final ending weak and unfulfilling. I will think twice before trying another book from the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is verbose. It was a struggle.","review":"Seems to me that Mark Frost wrote this book for himself, not for the average readers. Too many words to write a single thought, I am not impressed by the string of words he puts together. Mark did pretty well with the Grand Slam and Greatest Game Ever Played but reading this book had been a struggle to say the least.

The bottle says nothing about the duration of time you need to take it to achieve effects but I did the 10 day \\"program\\" and I feel just as bloated as I did before I started. It may work differently on everyone but for me, it came down to paying over $2 a day for pills that didn't do what they claimed.Also, many other reviewers claim that the product works BECAUSE it makes them go #1 a lot but the directions instruct you to take the pills with a large glass of water and to drink AT LEAST 8 glasses of water throughout the day so if this is more water than you normally consume; yes, you will be running to the bathroom more often than normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aquadrene rocks!","review":"This most definately helps relieve the water bloat during my PMS.

It seemed to have a lot of power but would often freeze up while panel raising - even in MDF and making multiple passes. I hate the locking screw and it did eventually strip out just like every other PC router I've owned. I found that a vice-grip C clamp worked better and faster. I also had the dust problem on the threads. I learned to remove it often from the base (table mounted) and dust it off and spray it with silicone. That seemed to help. I fried it last month while panel raising and had to go back to the small 691 model to finish up. I've had the 691 for 10 years and can't seem to burn it up although the base (is not as high qualified). PC offers a lump sum rebuild for ($$$) but I'm not going to do it mainly for the principle of the matter. I think PC needs to do some updating.

On the other hand, if you want the toughest, most powerful router you can get, than this ones for you. This router was designed to be used in a router table with big bits. I have owned this router for 9 years. I make raised panel doors for a living. This tool has never failed me. I've been through three router tables, but only one router. Porter Cable could easily jack the price up on this router and it would have no problem selling. I own 7 routers. If I could only have one, it would be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter-Cable 7518 Speedmatic 15 Amp 3-1/4 HP Fixed Base 5-Speed Router","review":"A workhorse and maybe more than you need - IMHO - really meant for a production type environment and not the home user"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you read what's included","review":"I think it's criminal that Porter Cable has chosen not to include both the 1/4 inch and the 1/2 inch collet with this $300 plus router. This collet can't cost more than fifty cents; yet it's retailing for around $12. This is especially true since Porter Cable has joined the ranks of other companies, manufactoring their blades and bits in China. I have a number of Porter Cable tools, and they've always been first rate. I was really surprised when I received my new 7518, and it only had one collet. If they're going to rip you off on a collet, who knows what corners they're going to cut inside the case.Aside from the collet problem, this appears to be a first rate router. I bought it without comparing it to other routers in it's class because I have several Porter Cable tools, and I trusted their quality. I can't say I have the same level of trust anymore. In the future, I'll definately make some serious comparisons before I buy another Porter Cable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"7518 is a very good router","review":"I use my Porter Cable 7518 mounted under a table. The speed control is essential, especially when using large bits. The soft start and relatively quiet operation are big bonuses. The only problem that I have is adjusting the height: This requires the motor to be rotated which can cause dust that is accumulated on top of the motor to become lodged in the threads that adjust the height, causing the mechanism to jam. Once in a while I have to unmount the router, remove the base and thoroughly clean. Otherwise it easily beats other routers I've used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use this router for Raised Panel Cutters","review":"I bought this router thinking that it would have no problem cutting raised panels based on PC description of the product. When I received the router I tried cutting raised panels in red oak with a 3 1/2\\" panel cutter, the router stalled and had to be reset. I thought something was wrong with it so I called PC and they sent me a new one. It did the same thing. You'll have to take at least 4 passes and even then chance burning the wood if you use this router. It worked great on all other bits except the large panel raiser, which is why I bought it. I could've spent a whole lot less for a router to use with my smaller bits. When I contacted PC about the problem they informed me that that was the design of the router circuitry to stall if too much load was applied. Having to take 4 passes in red oak is a bit excessive. I've had the router for 2 years and ready to throw it in the drawer and not use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"with minor fix - a good value","review":"Instead of just adding a lock washer next to the knob, add a star washer inside the joint created by the stand and the music holder (remove the bolt, put the washer between the bridle joint of the stand and the bottom of the music holder and thread the bolt back through to engage the knob) This makes for a much stronger angle adjustment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"This is a nice lightweight portable music stand that works well for sheet music but probably not for a heavy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Music Stand","review":"Bought this music stand for my kids.

The story is stilted, and not at all complicated. The acting is over the top and the costumes are dreadful. It is however lovely to look at, and might as well be a travel guide to Barcelona, Spain. Made in the early nineties, you can tell, but it didn't hurt to watch. True it can't even see the good movies from where it's standing but you can glimpse a young Kate who is light years from her Underworld character."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"I thought that this was a very good movie. I enjoyed the ending and was quite impressed overall. Definitely a good movie for being an older movie. Props to Kate!!! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute shocker","review":"Not even Kate Beckinsale with her kit off can provide interest in this stilted, ludicrously plotted film. The acting is as scenery chewing as the dialogue is Ed Wood-esque. Kate must have hoped that this one never saw the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Kate Beckinsale","review":"I won't go into the plot of the movie in any detail, since many previous reviews have already done that. This is not a well-known movie. However, please do not let that stop you from buying or renting it. This is a wonderful movie to watch. It just goes to show that a movie doesn't have to be a blockbuster at the box office to be good.This is one of Kate Beckinsale's earlier films. It was a treat to watch her youthful charm and charisma at this stage in her career. She was simply adorable as Julia, a young lady who makes her living restoring works of art. And that short haircut simply looked sexy on her. Anyway, I have always considered her to be a good actress. And this is certainly a film to own for those who are fans of Kate Beckinsale. If you would like to see Kate's earlier films, I highly recommend both Haunted and Much Ado About Nothing.The supporting casts include talented veterans such as Michael Gough, John Wood, Art Malik, and Sinead Cusack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, though Beckinsale fans might find it worthwhile","review":"This movie was made in the mid 1990s in Spain, it was directed by Jim McBride, based on a novel by Perez Reverte, and it stars a young Kate Beckinsale. Sounds promising? The movie's not. Basically, the plot has Beckinsale (with a boyish short hair cut) playing an art student in Barcelona, who finds that a flemish painting holds clues to some murder, or something. The whole thing is very dull, full with ridiculous situations and characters. The only thing to recommend for it is a couple of nude scenes by the young Kete (one in particular, with Kate topless for many seconds looking at a painting and sporting a grannie's panties is particularly memorable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This movie has a good plot, good actors, plenty of mystery and the beauty of one of my favorite actresses: Kate Beckinsale. Maybe it's not one of those movies with plenty of violence, chases and a lot sex (...), but it's an interesting movie. And made in the best city of Spain: Barcelona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately","review":"UNCOVERED- Kate BeckinsaleMy my it's been a long time since I saw a movie this poorly put together. The music alone rates zero & the directing, writing & acting is scant above that. It does have Sinead Cusack & I have enjoyed her in a number of things so it was nice to stumble upon her again.I can't remember ever losing interest in a set of characters involved in a mystery as quickly as I did this one. By the time Kate puts her pert breasts on screen with their perfectly upturned nipples I had already been bludgeoned by the directing to the point I didn't care what happened next. Apparently no one else cared either. You're a pretty woman Kate but it wasn't worth this to see you nude. I give only .5 stars. I do believe this is my first 1 star rating, what a waste of beauty & talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all good","review":"The motivations of the characters were all over the place. Perhaps it's a \\"Spanish thing\\", but the male characters in particular are boorish and whiney in an instant - it's all....\\"I'll get you, you b***ch\\" one minute and then all lovey dovey with the same female character in the next scene - as if nothing dramatic had happened - you know, like attempted rape for instance.It's a sad day to see a great actress like Sinead Cussack having to utter the, \\"You need to get laid\\" line and use the f-word a lot. Very sad indeed.Also, the \\"plot\\"? Oh dear. Obvious is too obvious a word to use.And as for the \\"selling point\\" of the DVD, the lovely Ms Beckinsale is a way more attractive and interesting in the recently released \\"Underworld\\" - here she just looks too young for the part. I'm reminded of the song \\"Jailbait\\" by Motorhead.All in all, I'd say.....avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncovered","review":"While restoring an old painting showing a woman and two men playing chess, Julia discovers the text \\"Who killed the knight\\" underneath the paint. The owner of the painting tells her that one of his forefathers was killed, the painting might identify the murderer. When Julia's friend is killed she understands that there is more to it. She consults Domenec, a chess genius who reconstructs the game from the painting. With any piece he takes, somebody dies. This movie is a very poor translation from the novel. If you enjoy laughing over a miserable attempt to make a mystery, then by all means, rent this one. B-movie at best, not Kates best, predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"Even though I assumed the book--Arturo Perez-Reverte's marvelous The Flanders Panel--would be superior to the film, I was stunned at how truly awful this film is. Kate Beckinsale is quite good, but most of the casting choices are wretched, and this film looks like it was directed by a college student on a modest budget. The sleazy ending has little to do with the subtle, surprise ending in the novel. Perez-Reverte must have cringed when he saw what was done to his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Features not included","review":"This picture is based in the famous spanish novel \\"La Tabla de Flandes\\" from Arturo Perez Reverte (Alatriste), but the picture is boring, with slow and bad acted characters.

His description of conditions preceding the campaign were fantastic. I also found that McDonough treated Bragg fairly--unlike many other historians. Although I wish the accounts of the battles had been longer, the ones there were terrific.On the other hand, I found the few maps too be not enough, and the ones provided were not too good. A nice compliment to the book were the several photos of the battlefields (Richmond, Munfordville, and Perryville).Overall, I believe this book is worth the $12.57, plus shipping. I actually bought my copy elsewhere, at the full price of $17.98. Just the fact that this is one of the few books on the Kentucky campaign makes it worth the money. If you are a serious Civil War buff, or are interested in the Kentucky Campaign specifically, I highly recommend that you buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compilation of Billy Currie's solo recordings","review":"This 61-minute 2007 compilation is my first purchase of a Billy Currie recording.Currie plays various keyboards, violin, and viola, though there are no instrument or musician credits in the liner notes. I figured this would be a good place to sample Currie's solo output-It contains 13 tracks total, and although it doesn't list what tracks come from which albums, the all-to-brief liner notes do list that the tracks are taken from Curries following albums:\\"Transportation\\", \\"Push\\", \\"Stand Up And Walk\\", \\"Unearthed Pieces Of The Puzzle\\", and \\"Still Movement\\".Liner notes do mention though that Yes and Asia guitarist Steve Howe plays on some of the tracks from the \\"Transportation\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pictures","review":"This pictorial biography on Evita is one of the best, by far. Perhaps other books give more detailed factual information about the life of Evita, but this book gives you the best \\"feel\\" for exactly how much Evita was loved (or hated) by the people of Argentina. The pictures from her funeral say it all...the many thousands of Argentine citizens lining up for days, just for the chance to get a glimpse of her body lying in state.

In between the flashy electronic sounds they seem to up the volume on forcing you to hear this sound they created you actually get a taste of the guitar style Chuck Shuldinar spent years creating along with other death metal pioneers (mainly Chuck).

I'm sure they worked very hard on this but it just seems forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I bought this album thinking it would sound something like death's human. I was wrong. Although the musicians are very talented not one song made me want to blast it through my speakers. The computerized sounding singing that goes on through the songs gets really annoying and drawn out. i was expecting a heavy melodic masterpeice, instead it was technical, boring, and has no power-in your face at all.

The album considered by some to be the peak of Death metal (although it really does defy categorization as JUST a death metal album). This inspiredmix of death metal, progressive metal, and fusion/jazz, creates one of the most incomparable metal albums ever. Fantastic basslines from Sean Malone, accented by the nuanced drumwork of the king Sean Reinert. Paul Masvidal gives off some snaky guitar lines along with a strong vocal delivery. It's sad that this was their only official release, but its a memorable one! Check out Gordian Knot (with Malone and Reinert), Aghora (with Malone and Reinert), and Death's Human album (with Masvidal and Reinert).
