Sad to say the Elegants did not scale the charts again after \\"Litte Star\\",apparently for all the standard reasons.That's too bad, because there are several songs on the compilation, notably \\"Little Boy Blue\\" that I think should have been hits, but of course were not.

It is very easy to apply with the Hook & Loop feature and has performed well. It does not leave circular scratches and is best used climbing through the grits. I have used between 80-grit to 220 grit and each disk delivers as advertised. I would not recommend using this for sanding wood that has any hardened glue or other finish since it will reduce the life of the paper however this is common for most sand papers.

They keep sounding good year-after-year.She and producer/writer Wayne Kirkpatrick wrote fantastic songs with \\"heavy\\" lyrics and great melodies. Each song is distinct, too - none of this sounding-the-same as some artists do.Of the 10 songs in here, all ten are good, and I'm not exaggerating. Like Joni Mitchell, Susan's first few \\"albums\\" were the best and timeless - just great stuff. She seems to have disappeared on the music scene, and that is a big loss for all of us. I hope she returns some day and gives us more of this type of material."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Christian Cds of All Time","review":"Susan Ashton and producer Wayne Kirkpatrick team up again and hit it out of the park. Kirkpatrick wrote most of the songs on the cd and Ashton sings them with everything she has.Standout tracks include the rocking 'Here in my Heart', the teary 'Grand Canyon', the humbling 'Better Angels of our Nature' and the toe-tapping 'Walk on By'.The cd is filled with songs concerning our closeness to God, the temptation to sin and to judge, and the fragileness of our humanity. Great songs sung by one of the greatest singers in Christian music.Excellent from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Surprising, just sad!","review":"One wonders if Ms. Reynolds was enjoying an afternoon on the grass herself when she came upon her theory. Or was it simply an effort to get some publicity for a book that in no way measures up to the competition.

While the mood on this album is probably the darkest of all Anathema albums..... it is still a horrible release. There are fine reasons why albums like \\"the silent enigma\\" were not released in the United States until years after its' european release and why it received absolutely no press coverage. I'm happy that they buried the hatchet on the \\"doom/death\\" sound and opted for a more refined goth/prog rock sound with \\"eternity\\", \\"alternative 4\\", and \\"judgement\\".

These seem to wear uniformly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't cut very long","review":"I made a mistake and bought boxes of fifty of most grits because the vendor at a show had limited selection. They do not cut very long. As another review said, they cut great for a short while, then quit, then swirl mark. The vendor said, they are designed for that, use it and change it. Great for Mirka, if you keep buying their product.I find it is a lot of time wasted stopping several times per piece to change the paper. And you can have alternating areas of well sanded and poorly sanded wood. This can show up when its too late (finishing). Will buy a better brand next time. There are several other brands that are much better for little to no extra cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"You get what you pay for. I used these pads primarily on red oak. I know from experience the cutting diminishes quickly with hard woods, but I never expected this. The 80 grit pads wore down literally within 30 seconds of sanding. The 220 grit lasted somewhat longer. I'll go back to my old brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about it","review":"I just got this CD and I have to say it is the worst thing I have ever heard. It starts with a horrible version of Dougie MacLean's Caledonia and then goes downhill from there. Every song is over-done, over-produced, and over not soon enough. It's like they're all trying to be a 1980's supergroup or heavy metal wannabe. I can't say for sure, but it sounds to me like many of the bagpipes are synthesized, not the real thing. The sound levels are uneven with very poor quality. I'd rate this a zero if it went that low. I would consider giving this away, but I wouldn't inflict this on anyone. There's a reason audio samples are not available for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful album, indeed!","review":"As I listen to this album over and over again, each track grows on me and adds to my pride in being of Scottish heritage. \\"Caledonia,\\" \\"Hector the Hero,\\" \\"Slangeva\\" (\\"Cheers\\" in Gaelic), \\"Always Argyll\\" (even though I am a MacDonald of Glencoe descendant), \\"Highland Cathedral,\\" \\"The Flower of Scotland,\\" \\"Will Ye No Come Back Again\\" and \\"When the Pipers Play\\" are particular favorites but there is not a weak track in the album\\"s 17 selections.

Maybe baseball really should be kept away from academics, who have a tendency to suck the life out of the game. The Notre Dame history professor who wrote the \\"most scholarly\\" life of Babe Ruth at least knew how to turn a phrase, if not \\"two.\\" If Dr. Seymour is a fan he keeps it carefully under wraps.The best thing about this book is Seymour's careful \\"deconstruction\\" of some of baseball's cherished myths, chiefly Abner Doubleday's \\"invention\\" of it. The worst is that Seymour is altogether too enamored of the institutional side of the game. In the dialectic of style and structure he is so enmeshed in the structural aspects, the business aspects, even the legal aspects of the game, that the knothole gang is supplanted by the paneled boardroom. I wanted baseball lore but instead I got corporate logic. Not a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned - Not new, and a man's work","review":"My wife bought this book many years ago for me, and I enjoyed it.

Dull, boring and hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better book from a fine writer.","review":"David Drake has made the \\"smash them flat\\" style of futureistic military fiction his own. However, in his newest book, \\"Patriots\\", he has drawn the plot development and characters with a much finer pen. The closest, and in my mind, most complimentary comparison I can make is that this book reads like a Bob Heinlein book.The book contains all of the successful elements of Heinlein's, a younger lead, an older mentor and a romantic interest. This mixture is lead into a revolution, almost a cliche, but well handled, in a humerous way.The book is not the Great American Novel, but it is an entertaining way of spending an evening or two. Try it! You might like it and then you might want to go back and re-read some of the Alois Hammer books and see where David Drake has come from."},{"rating":"2","title":"patriots: a good sci-fi book for starters","review":"The book Patriots is about a group of people that settled on the planet Greenwood. These people must defend their homeland against people from Earth and other planets that are intending to take over the planet. These invaders see big profits in Greenwood and are motivated by greed. The people from Greenwood show their would be invaders that they will not back down easily. I thought that the author's portrayal of the characters was very realistic, and the way they reacted to the situation that they were in, was portrayed very well. However, the story suddenly ended abruptly at the end of the book, as if something was missing. I think that the author should write a continuation of this story. Overall, this is a good book for someone that wants to read a Sci-fi novel that is not very long, and is very intersting for anyone who wants to get started with Sci-fi novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical Fun","review":"Forget Sex and the City and dive into Queer Chronicles, or as I see it: \\"Sex and the Southern Guy\\". Frank Blocker's alter ego, Kenneth, does it all and journalizes in prose that is both hyper-witty, incredibly detailed, eccentric, ironic, but most of all, just plain FUN. Atlanta's wild and gay 90s comes to vivid life; I especially enjoyed references to cruising at the \\"Homo Depot\\", the many and varied sideways glances towards \\"the EX\\", and a vivid recounting of turbulent events at the Atlanta Olympics. Plenty of political slant here -- Blocker/Kenneth has an opinion about EVERYTHING and is not shy about sharing!

This collection reaches back to their first album, 1975's Circle Of Love, and features at least two lead songs by each sister. Some of the classics are present, We Are Family, Reach Your Peak and He's The Greatest Dancer, but it also contains such gems as Happy Feeling, Can't Mess Around With Love, You Fooled Around, I'm A Good Girl, Everybody's Friend, Smile and their version of Stevie Wonder's \\"As\\".

I was unable to put it down once I started reading it. \\"Hunger\\" completely captured my attention from the start. Anna Rossi, the title character was so interesting, so human. She came alive through the pages of this book. I felt that she was a friend that I wanted to talk to and offer support. I could relate to her conflict and her struggles. I envied the fact that she could pour herself into her cooking and that it was theraputic for her and such a gift to others.I became emotionally involved in the story. I became Anna's cheerleader and wanted to see her succeed. I was angry with Michael and I could not grasp his way of dealing with everything.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone that enjoys a great story that wraps itself around you from the start to the finish. Bottom-line this novel feeds your body and your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumptuous, sensual, sexual","review":"Author Jane Ward tracks a path we are all too familiar with - the end of an ill-advised marriage, the hardship of personal renewal, growth in spite of obstacles, fears faced head on or avoided. So many of us hide from one hunger (for love, for purpose) by feeding another. Too often the result is gaining weight, feeling guilty, feeding ourselves even more. But food doesn't have to be our enemy. It can feed our souls and heal our bodies and minds. This relationship to food, to people and to life is intimately explored in Hunger. As a Weight Watchers leader, I encourage those who fight with food to see how the flavors, aromas and textures of sustenance can be positive friends as we progress from stage to stage of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food and Life","review":"A superb novel that mixes the quest for 'the perfect meal' with the quest for 'the perfect life.'

After trying some lame Bluetooth headsets, and researching a little about the CS50 USB Wireless Headset, I made what is probably the most intelligent decision I've made since I started teaching online five years ago. The CS50 is totally comfortable, I can walk all around my apartment without losing signal strength, my students hear me perfectly clear, and I can actually REPLACE the battery after its life cycle is done. What else can I ask for?I've only used the CS50 for a couple of months now, and my only problem is that I regret not having bought it before.

The CD Rom they send as \\"instructions\\" for set up are extremely vague and need to be more explicit. I still don't know what the \\"smart button\\" does and/or what features it activates! I had never used a wireless headset before, so perhaps I needed a bit more handholding, but I shouldn't have had to struggle as much as I did with the set up. While I'm certainly not an IT whiz, I am fairly salient in electornics set up and was very put off by the set up process and the lack of explanation of features and how the headset actually operates. Otherwise, now that I'm over that hump (although I'd still like to know about the \\"Smart Button\\" although maybe it's only for \\"smart\\" people!), the headset is good, with good sound quality and is comfortable to weat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"A quick comment. I've had the cs50 for some years now and consider it still the best headset I've had, and I've several different and high quality brands. The CS50 is the best by far for Dragon Naturally Speaking. I also use it to communicate with Homeseer (smart home setup). The range is phenomenal. The accuracy is as good as it gets. I'm not using it much for phone, except when travelling, because my cordless phone is already set up for VOIP.Very comfortable to wear - I use the headset not the ear loop things.Just plugged it into my new laptop and it worked, so Vista already has the necessary drivers - no need for software downloads. My laptop has a sleep and charge function so no need to worry about the headset not charging when the laptop is in sleep mode.The CS50 was well worth the money spent and has paid for itself several times over.

I am sensitive to those who have to listen to me, and the feedback I get is that when I place the mouthpiece in just the right spot (about an inch from the corner of my lips, and at the exact same elevation), the sound is tolerable. The earpiece is plastic, and snaps off of the unit rather easily. It is just a matter of time before I lose it.

He certainly didn't get it from the Bible. Because of his skewed ideas concerning the Old Testament and in particular the Law, Mr. Joyner proceded to make numerous exegetical errors.Apart from the awful theology, the book was even more poorly written. It jumps from one issue to the next without transition. There doesn't seem to have been any editing of the manuscript before publishing.I had heard so many good things about Mr. Joyner's teaching that I looked forward to reading this, but now hope this was just a bad book and not representative of his other works.

This book equates biblical conceptions that are not equal. Mr. Joyner's presentation of Christianity (in his books, teaching tapes, and on his own website) seem to contain decidedly mystical elements. It's as if he doesn't believe the Bible is really the Word of God, but instead it is merely an allegory.

These concepts make it so much easier to understand the nature of the ongoing internal conflict of \\"walking in the spirit\\", and \\"walking in the flesh\\". With these ideas made plain \\"walking in the spirit\\" becomes that much easier; or at least that much more obvious which walk we are taking.Joyner's heart for God over and above God's blessings is as present as ever. \\"We must worship the Lord of the Book, not the Book of the Lord\\".If you want insight into the daily battle for holiness and fulfillment of God's destiny, DO NOT PASS THIS BOOK UP."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PERFECT EXPLANATION OF WHY THINGS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE.","review":"AFTER 20 YEARS IN THE CHURCH AND WONDERING HOW CHRISTIANS COULD ACT THE WAY THEY DO AND WHY CHURCHES SPLIT, I NOW UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHY THAT HAPPENS.

One of 2000's catchiest pop tunes, and inevitabely best pop female efforts (compared to the overall poor competition), the single is taken from Kylie's latest album, entitled Light Years.

Basically there are about 30 pages specific to American Bulldogs and the rest(140 pages) could be about poodles, pugs or rotweilers. Also, considering all the name brand product illustrations and plugs throughout the book, it could have been offered for free as paid advertising. However, since I own an American Bulldog,or he owns me, the pictures in the book make it a keeper. I would have given it more stars for more dogs pictures and less product endorsements.

That's a bunch of BS.

The blue lion kept falling off and would not stay connected, the black lions legs wont even go in to the conpartmenet, and the heads of the lions are very loose and are bound to break off very easily. I dont see for this price tag they could not have made it just like the orginal.

You should really pass on this and buy a real used one on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Collectors Only!","review":"I suggest you only get this Voltron if your a collector or just want a collectable. This is honestly the worst recreation of the original Voltron toy I have ever seen.

To be perfectly blunt if your looking for a Voltron toy don't buy this! However if you want a Voltron collectable you should most definately think of purchasing this Voltron. -Note: I gave this item one star only because I myself was immensely disappionted in it, I was expecting something entirely different.

It was his very first toy craze and all we heard about for months was how he wanted Voltron toys. The description says the plastic is durable but it is not. We kept the shield, sword and wings in the box since they were so sharp. We showed our son how to form Voltron and break it down into the lions and he was able to do it after two demonstrations; much faster than the adults in our household. We showed him where the weak points were, \\"oh, Lance's legs, got it\\" he said. Two hours of playing with Voltron on Christmas morning were all he got. The Voltron fell from a height of 19 inches (a cat knocked it off a short chair while I was watching) and both the legs broke off. This is completely ridiculous for the amount of money spent.

She is one of the few feminists who admit that women, not men, commit most abuse on children as well as half of all assaults on siblings or spouses. An interesting gripe in her book is that only 23 per cent of men will consent to cook when they have a female in the house. Maybe this is because hardly any women will service a car when they have a male in the house. I like Greer1s writing style. It is crisp, frothy and frivolous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greer needs to do her research first","review":"A friend of mine sent me this book from the UK. It appears that Greer spent more time developing her opinions and making them persuasive than she did researching her material. Her section entitled \\"Pantomime Dames,\\" for example, is full of medically inaccurate statements and quotes taken out of context. To say that she is speaking from the \\"lecturn of humanity\\" is shocking. Instead, she is preaching for a supreme \\"whole\\" woman based on her limited and extreme definition and twisting facts in a mean-spirited way in order to lead her readers to her conclusions. In my humble opinion, she is giving the rest of us who consider ourselves feminists a bad name. Reader beware: when you read this book, please make sure you do the research she didn't before agreeing with her conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty rhetoric based on sloppy research","review":"I write as a member of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) Support Group. Professor Greer has not understood or researched the biological or social facts about AIS; and instead of checking the medical literature has merely quoted, out of context, from newspaper and magazine articles then added her own interpretation. The socio-cultural premises that she puts forward concerning AIS women, and which she pretends to derive from biological principles, therefore have no foundation whatsoever. I bought the book, read what she had written on AIS, and took it back and got a refund. I have no inclination to see whether the rest of her book is any better argued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Greer, you obviously have no idea","review":"Her point of view on invitro fertilization shows a woman who has no been through or talked to women who have gone through ivf.

Please stop being so confrontational and try to keep an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not feminism","review":"In fact, this book is as anti-feminist as they come. Motherhood as a career? Puhhhhleese.

She defends Female Genital Mutilation , praises female illiteracy, and feels women were better off before the invention of the washing machine when they did clothes on river banks. I can't figure out if some of these stances of hers are just deliberately perverse or if she's so full of fury at men, at Western culture and about growing old that she's lost her mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief for Misogyny-Wearied Souls","review":"Besides the fact that this book demonstrates the political genius of Germaine Greer, it is well-worth the admission price because of the relief it will provide to women.

The feminist Juvenal returns!","review":"Greer returns to tell the 'muddle crass' what a load of tripe and codswallop feminism has become in the nineties.

What Ms Greer spouted on all those pages could've been summed up on as few as 3 pages! Reading it was like being in a college lecture hall, listening to a professor talk on the over commercialism and consumerism that is plaguing this world. Granted equal rights and fair treatment for women in this mad world of ours is not even close to the ideal. It needs a heck of a lot of work. Work that can be completed as we celebrate that which is womanhood.

This book details the horrors of surgical alteration and acts as a warning that women must combat the unnatural and unfair expectations of men. Through concise and often humorous commentary, Greer gives many aspects of a man-driven culture a good tongue-lashing and inspires women to turn on their aggressors to tell them that no woman deserves the persecution of a male-imposed perfectionism. I would highly recommend this book to any woman who found that upon entering the adult world, life was not quite the shining castle and the prince on the white horse she thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"You can't beat the price and they are great for tea, water and bar glasses are a good size for drinks.

I believe I have 2 left from my original set of 8. One time I was drinking from the glass and put it down (normally - I didn't slam it down or use too much force) and when I next picked it up it had a large crack down the side. The glass is very thin and it just seems that anything can cause them to fracture. I really like the look of the glasses and would certainly buy more if they didn't break so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but cracks/breaks easily","review":"I completely agree with the rest of the reviewers here; these glasses are gorgeous-looking -- simple yet chic -- BUT they break extremely easily. Rapid temperature changes seem to be the key, at least from my experience: I've had them crack and break at the base just by hand-washing them w/ hot water. Also, if you take them out of a hot dishwasher into a much cooler kitchen too soon after the cycle, they can break (again, at the base). All of this within the first couple of months after purchasing them.I liked the way these look and feel so much that I bought two sets of the short tumblers, but I now have only 4 or 3 completely intact glasses from the original 8. Although they're quite aesthetically pleasing and the price seems right at first glance, I suggest buying a sturdier glass set that won't have to be replaced w/in a few months despite careful handling."},{"rating":"1","title":"And then there were three...","review":"These glasses are very pretty but not very hardy.

Unfortunately, like other reviewers, I have only had them for a month or two and many of them have broken. The shorter 8oz glasses seem to hold up better than the 16 ounce ones. The glass is very thin and this was one reason I really liked them at first (my previous glasses were very cheap and chunky feeling, but they have held up much better). I had one of my 16oz glasses break by a lightweight bamboo spoon falling on it in the sink...the glass had no other weight or pressure on it, yet it broke easily as if I had dropped a heavy skillet on it or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Glasses","review":"Nothing too special here. These glasses look pretty cool, but are run of the mill in terms of quality. Not to say they're of cheap quality, though. They're not super thick or thin glass; pretty average overall. They're good for everyday use, but if you drop one, it's going to break... that's just what most glasses do.

After examining them, they only had a \\"12\\" on the shoe and the box with no width designation, so I assume they are considered \\"medium\\", but let me tell you, they are far from any medium I have worn. This is an obvious reason why one should try shoes on in a store before buying them on the internet - especially if it is something they haven't worn previously, or in a long time.The quality of the shoe is also sub-par in my opinion. On one shoe, the toe upper is sewn crooked and makes a strange folded crease in the leather when I wear it.

This modernistic production which seems to be set in a madhouse bears only the faintest relationship to Les Contes D'Hoffman. (Hence the title Des Contes.) If I didn't hear the music I would think I was watching a staging of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Marat/Sade. It remined me of a production of Rienzi I saw where everyone was clad in camoflauge? Where were the visuals to go with the grand music? And where in this version of Offenbach is the charm, the beauty, and the humor that goes with this music? Is it really doing composers a service to mask their intentions and create incongruous crap in the name of invention and eschew convention? I felt as one who sits down to dine on Beef Wellington on fine china and is served hamburger on paper plates."},{"rating":"1","title":"The production is awful.","review":"Not only did I not like the production, I was offended by it.

The whole opera is set in a grim, grey insane asylum of some sort with drab costumes and no furnishings beyond a few chairs and a ubiquitous rolling cart. The vocal perfromances are quite good, and the use of black artists very appropriate and interesting, but you may find yourself distracted by questions such as: why are so many of the characters bald, or why do they keep exchanging coats?

Myself, I'm going to look for a more traditional staging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre Production","review":"I enjoy conventional productions of opera which feature lavish sets and huge ensembles to complement the vocal, dramatic, and instrumental aspects of the subject. This production by the Opera National de Lyon is an off-the-wall avant garde exercise that is so bizarre that it would have been funded by the National Endowment for the Arts if Europe were the 51st state. It features stark sets, bald women, and a hand full of supernumeraries selected from a nursing home and a mental hospital. If they spent over 50 cents on the set they were robbed. At one point there was a dual between a stage curtain and one of the performers that reminded me of Woody Allen battling the Giant Tit in the movie \\"Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask\\".

The set (there was only one set), the costumes (virtually non-existent), and even the singing were distortions of the worst kind. I am hard put to give this DVD the dignity of a single star. It is a total waste of money in purchasing it and of time in watching/listening to it. I'm very much surprised it was even produced by the Lyon, France opera company.

My husband bought them for me for Christmas. Not only will I never take a book recommendation from this friend again, I will never read another book by James Morrow. This book was thought provoking? Only if your thought was \\"What the heck is he thinking?!\\" Morrow's writing style is sadistic, boring, and painful to read. My first thought reading the first book - \\"it's got to get better... it has to\\". During the second book, \\"\\"this one can't be as bad as the first one...\\" I was wrong on both accounts. I am a collector of books, and for the first time ever, I have toyed with the idea of burning or just throwing away two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting.....","review":"A writer for the lost, troubled, souls that walk the earth.

Too many people have blind faith, really giving no thought to their beliefs. This book pokes fun at that that while addressing other issues such as feminism and sexuallity. A very good read. Caution to the even semi-religious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Milk of Human Blindness","review":"Not a book for anyone whose religious beliefs won't allow questions or alternatives. In fact, it's not for anyone who can't suspend belief for 300+ pages. Not really science fiction or fantasy, Only Begotten Daughter is more of a \\"what if\\".It's impossible to describe much without using spoilers. Amazon's description and other reviews give away more than they should. Since I presume you have read them, I will add that Morrow's effort will both amuse you and scare you.This is one of his early books and not as accomplished as his later ones. However, it is a good place to start reading Morrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to bring out the Agnostic in you!","review":"The book that broke my views on religion. Morrow infuses this book with such witty views and inspired observations that you can forgive him the sometimes rough quality of his narrative. Christians, beware! Morrow has written much on the subject of religion since OBD, but this is his classic opus."},{"rating":"2","title":"As with all good literature...","review":"This one will likely upset you, particularly if you are of a particularly fundamentalist persuasion...The story line as stated is quite accurate but nothing can likely prepare you for the actual unfolding of events the way Morrow sees them. He isn't shy with with his razor-sharp wit deftly dicing and slicing away at many of the Western world's (and, in some cases, global) sacred cows. A much less misanthropic Swift for the 21st century.Morrow is probably lucky that his books have been slotted into Science Fiction since otherwise he'd probably be on a \\"most wanted\\" list like Rushdie. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Satire","review":"This was a refreshing change to the usual SF that deals with the messiah. I couldn't stop laughing about the absurdity of the story. Nor could I find a way to express the delight I took in reading a book that takes modern Western religion (all religion) and shows the foolishness of blind obseesion that people give religion.This book is an essential for anyone who has been overly indoctrinated with fundemental propaganda and is seeking some humor in the subject. Strangely, I think only someone secure in their own beliefs will appreciate the humor in Morrow's story.I couldn't put the book down and the ending did not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"I really enjoyed this story, though I didn't think it was as blatantly humorous as I thought it would be. However it brings up some really good issues about faith.It's also not really so much of an attack on god as it is on the people who use religion for their own agenda.Jesus is actually portrayed as a caring person, yet he doesnt exactly appreciate xianity that much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative BUT much of the comparative chapter removed!","review":"Although more updated information has been added to the previous edition, much of the COMPARATIVE PART have been removed.

I didn't see where this was a scientifically controlled experiment at all. In a cellar? At seances? Moving objects? Ectoplasm? You have got to be kidding. This was just a farce presented in pseudo scientific jargon. As with all these contacts with the dead, nothing of any substance is ever revealed. It is all the same- the loved ones are happy in the afterlife, peaceful, love us, are watching over us, etc. etc. How about some real knowledge- like a cure for cancer?

Plus we get comma splices (that often create unintentional ambiguities), mixed metaphors (one howler is the old men of the Chorus who are compared to a withered leaf that has 3 legs), and language that sacrifices both clarity and poetic texture. What Fagles translates as \\"we must suffer into truth,\\" Shapiro translates \\"suffering is our teacher.\\" Blah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judging God's way","review":"As a Christian I have, in the past, grown very frustrated with the populary held idea that Christians cannot declare something to be wrong even though the Bible condemns it. I always heard, \\"Judge not that ye be not judged.\\" This attitude never felt right with me.Thankfully I am not the only one. The author does a masterful job of distinguishing between unlawful judgement and lawful discernment. He makes good use of scripture, in context, to support his points.In the current post-modern world that we live in, where tolerance is held above justice, this book and others like it can help Christians deal with the world we live in. You'll learn how to judge situations based on God's standards not your own. This book does not promote self-righteousness. Rather, it promotes sensitivity to the righteousness of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"mirka sand paper","review":"I would never buy any mirka products again!

Although I bought the original for a dollar at the Dollar Store, I'll have to cough up the shipping charge here because it is so worth it.No, it doesn't have a cute little rhyme to it, but the illustrations are colorful, beautiful, and detailed. They even put an outlet in the background of one picture. I cannot find the others here so I'll be going to the publisher's website for them soon.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that this board book was easily torn my child with just a lot of use.

The story, based in truth, is one adults can identify with and kids find amusing. The rhyme scheme reminds me of Dr. Suess and the illustrations are first rate. The little girl in the story learns how to help others, in this case the Great Wayne Gretzky, at the expense of her own good fortune. It shows an intact loving family (a rarity in today's culture), shows that little girls can be the star of a story, and can play hockey.

I live on the coast in the southeast. The humidity here is unbearable. Even when I did have a relaxer, I would step out of the house in the morning and all the effort that I put into styling my hair would just melt away. I had to start wearing sew-ins and I wouldn't dare be caught at a club or someplace that had the potential to make me sweat. Until I found this. My hair lasts ALL DAY LONG. A little goes a long way and it's a true pomade because it emulsifies once you rub it in your hand. The only thing that I don't like about it is that if you use too much it could make your hair look greasy and flat. I recently went to an amusement park and my hair lasted from 9am until 10pm.

I actually went as far as adding Rose Oil to it to help take the stink away, but I can still smell it in my hair Sunday morning when I wake up. I have not gotten around to flat ironing my hair while using this to see how it would do with holding my hair straight but it does a good job keeping the frizz out of my hair.

Her book suggests that your chances for having a girl increase the closer intercourse is to ovulation. I had another beautiful baby boy who is now 2 1/2 (who I wouldn't trade for the cutest of girls!). In that regard I am thankful for her book.

The plot is very plausible, the dialogueis intelligent and the photography very good. If one were to critizise anything, that would be the props(screens & paintings) which were painted yesterday and are bad imitations. - Just don't pay attentionto them and rather look at the clothes which are excellent.

So how does a CD featuring a song that I find thoroughly obnoxious earn four stars? That's because if \\"Beep Beep\\" is everything bad about an era, the Playmates song \\"Wait For Me\\" is everything that's good about their era. \\"Wait For Me\\" features lovely vocal harmony and skilled arrangement unheard in today's popular music. Unlike the rediculous \\"Beep Beep\\" and it's little mash Rambler challenging a Cadillac, \\"Wait For Me\\" tells an intricate and touching tale.

The earliest history of mankind is not an easy subject; there are many bits of evidence that don't always fit neatly together. Competing theories of how those bits might fit are examined, sometimes the results are conclusive, sometimes not, but the overall picture of prehistory is filled out. As a side note, for those with some doubts about evolution, this book will quell them. Many different aspects of Homo sapiens evolution are examined thoroughly, and the process is much clearer than when Darwin first developed the theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Ask Ed: Your Marijuana Questions Answered","review":"EVERY question you have will be answered.

However, lovers of opera may actually enjoy this flick for the singing (other than Rodney when he's not using the magic wine) and the respectful treatment of the world's greatest art form.I looks like Rodney or his producers actually knew something about the art of singing and liked it. Rosa, her mother and father and the other 'real singers' all are portrayed to sing beautifully, naturally, and sincerely. There's not a hint of the sarcasm and caricature that the typical Hollywood cultural ignorance could have applied. The movie accepts the thesis that bel canto singing is worthwhile on its own terms, and not just as a celebrity vehicle for the Three Tenors, or an art form to be marginalized by the mainstream of pop culture.Although I'm sure he didn't set out to make a music education film, Bravo Rodney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear him...Or live and regret it!!","review":"Rodney travels to italy to learn how to sing. and meets a charming lady.

Rodney brawling like Bud Spencer in the kitchen, and to top that, Davi ends up getting suffocated between Annabella Gurwitch legs.This movie will bring you more than a couple of laughs, its a charming and well done flick, with alote of well known faces, its just a real treat. with a little magic. it has all the ingredients for the perfect movie. it has comedy, romance, wine, women and song, a little action and actually some horror. (you who has seen the movie knows what i'm talking about)Bravissimo!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodney Dangerfield","review":"Rodney Dangerfield is always a laugh. 4th Tenor is a movie about a singer.

It is another great book in the redwall series. The story focuses on Lord Brocktree, a badger lord, who is on his journey to rule the mountain stronghold of Salamandastron. Along his way he mets Dotti the young haremaid and Ruff the otter. He also mets several other creatures whom he has adventures with. Meanwhile, at Salamandastron, Lord Stonepaw,Lord Brocktree's father, has to defend the mountain from the evil wildcat named Ungatt Trunn and his evil Blue Hordes. He is a ruthless killer who wants to conquer Salamandastron for himself and his hordes. The last battle in this book is absolutely spectacular. This is easily one of my favorite redwall books. All of the books that are in the redwall series are great. Brian Jacques is one of the best storytellers and this book shows his skill. I recommend this book to anyone ,if your a redwall fan or not, and this is a must have book that everyone should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Brocktree is a good book, but not up to standards","review":"Lord Brocktree is a great book, but it is not has good as other Redwall books. It seems like Brian Jacques rushed through the book. There was little character development before the fighting started. I was hyped up about this book coming out, but it was a slight dissappointment. It starts out with Lord Stonepaw and his aged hares all living on Salamandastron. As always, they smell a war brewing. Then Salamandastron is attacked by a horde led by a wildcat named Ungatt Trunn. Lord Stonepaw is left dead. Then Lord Brocktree comes into play. He has a vision, like all badgers do, telling him to go to Salamadastron. He finds out about the Blue Hordes, and realizes the Bloodwrath won't help him. While he is traveling, he gathers up and army to go fight Ungatt Trunn..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last!","review":"Over a week ago I was shocked to find Lord Brocktree sitting on my doorstep. For some strange reason it had been shipped to me a week early! I was estatic! And when I picked it up I wasn't dissapointed. It tells the story of the greatest Badger Lord. He ventures from him home to get to Salamandastron, to portect his father and the moutain from the evil wildcat Ungatt Trunn and his huge army. But they are vastly out numbured. What will the Badger Lord do?As I said before I think this book was even better than the last one. The descriptions where almost real, the hares (especially Dotti and Fleetscutt) where soo funny, and the action was incredible.

And now I have to order again to complete the group of books Alex likes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Pure Brilliance","review":"Well, Brians done it again. He's pruduced another book in the Redwall series. This one is as good as the others, the has been no drop in quality whatsoever. He's put in plot twists, and more gripping moments than you can wave a stick at. He's been back and looked at the original books, seen whats missing and then written a book to bridge the gap in Salamanderstrongs history. A great book, with hopefully more like it in the mix. Well done Brian, good luck for you're next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe 2 1/2...","review":"Lord Brocktree, to say the least, was a boring book. It was almost as boring as Legend of Luke. It could be because of the pages and pages of pointless dialogue, or maybe the same repeated plot that Jacques keeps using. Either way, this book was anything but put-down-able. I give this 2 stars only because I have a soft spot for Brian Jacques and there were a FEW interesting parts. But, if you want Classic Jacques, the true quality of his best books, read Redwall and some of the other earlier ones before you read Brocktree.In other words, Brian Jacques, what's with you lately?? Come up with a new plot!! And maybe the bad guys could win for once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord Brocktree by: jake penrod","review":"This book was a okay book but not a great book. I think this because the plot of the story is very good and the setting really paints a good picture for you. But the characters are kind of strange and Brian Jacques doesn't really give good descriptions. Also i feel that the story skips around a lot and making you feel that something is missing. Because of all of these reasons i have to give Lord Brocktree by Brain Jacques a 3 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Brocktree rules!","review":"A very exicting book for people with big imagination.

In my opinion, this book is an outstanding piece to be added to anyone's collection of books. Although i enjoyed this novel, I couldn't help but feel like Jacques' rushed through some parts of the novel that he could've elaborated on. In his past novels, he focused on battles, and wonderful descriptions of swordplay, that would thrill even the blandest of readers, yet in this one, i feel that he went through them with too much speed, like he was almost behind on his deadline when writing it. That's my only complaint though, other than that minor flaw, it is a great novel, and everyone should read it. Also read \\"The Long Patrol\\", because it is the best novel in the Redwall Series to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring plot mixed with lame characters = Lord Brocktree","review":"This book was utterly horrible and what made it worse was that I bought it with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and that was utterly horrible too so don't get this book unless you feel like wasting money.

Now, Lord Stonepaw, Lord Brocktree's father grows old as he is guarding the ancient mountain Slamandastron. All is well until out in the ocean, the evil villain, Ungatt Trunn invades the eastern shores where Salamandastron lies. With his numerous blue hordes of rats, Lord Stonepaw is soon overthrown because of his old age and being drastically outnumbered. Lord Brocktree's mission is to take back that mountain that is rightfully his. There is only one problem. He doesn't know where it is.

At times I was too sickened to continue reading but I desired to know how they survived the sights, the smells, the screams, the smoke. When I finished the book, I found inspiration-- if anyone could survive Auschwitz, then the small trivial problems that we sometimes let control our lives can be overcome. The book, unfortunately, ends abruptly as if the authors in recounting these horrible memories could stand them no more. I would have liked to have read about their liberation and their lives after the war, but I thank them for having the courage and the strength to give us their account of this inhuman history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an uplifting read","review":"This book voices a strong opinion that I disagree with completely. It seems to exclaim that good cannot survive where evil is so overwhelming. There were, according to these survivors, no heroes at Auschwitz; those who did not die became \\"totally familiar with the inexplicable and the abnormal\\" and \\"learned to live on intimate terms with the crematoria.\\" This book is not for those who choose to see survival in Auschwitz as a triumph of the human spirit.

The book focuses more on how you, as a mom, can cope with all of the changes, rather than focusing on what is going on with the developing baby during pregnancy.

It is now the cornerstone of a burgeoning library. A must-have for anyone interested in the period - gives excellent details on fabrics, construction techniques, patterns. Superb photographs. Details on stitching, seams, etc. Since it deals with only a 40-year period, it can zero-in on various garments, for both men and women, and describe these garments in detail.Patterns would need to be altered for 20th/21st century figures (our posture is all wrong!), but in general they give the general size/shape/shaping required to achieve the desired result. Couple this book with Avril Hart's \\"Fashion in Detail\\" (now being published in paperback) and you have an excellent start on how to look authentic for the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"My grandson has a similar one that works great.

The rest of the comp, while consisting of some great material, is a short affair of tracks seemingly tacked on without care after 'Whip It', but that's pretty obvious since the song's title is used in the title of the compilation, which is a pretty tacky ploy in itself.Basically, if you like the song Whip It and might consider getting into this truly awesome band, try going for their 'Greatist Hits' instead as a warm-up, which'll give you a much clearer view of the band's overall psyche and style, because if you do find you enjoy these 10 tracks you'll kick yourself for getting such a whimpy compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good audio book, seller sent me a used copy though.","review":"I really like the concepts in this book.

I initially watched this movie because I am a huge Joseph Fiennes fan, but I loved everything about it. It is a charming love story, the kind that you wish would happen in your own life. Monica Potter is so much like Julia Roberts it's a little weird at first, but she is quite wonderful. Anyway, I have watched this movie quite a few times, and I will more than likely watch it a few more. After all, one can never get enough of Mr. Fiennes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It&#65533;s a must for my collection","review":"I first saw this movie when travelling from Australia to London on a Qantas flight. I was giggling for the full length of the movie, the only problem I had was trying to remember the title - \\"Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence\\" - a shocker - good to see that's the USA renamed it. All the actors are great and well casted, although I have always been a fan of Ray Winstone who plays the shrink Pedersen. The music is well suited and has made me look closer at Ed Shearmur. I then went on to buy the sound track. A good movie to watch with your companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Thought of True Love","review":"Irresistibly charming! As he did in Shakespeare In Love, Joseph Fiennes brings his remarkable charm and devilish good looks to this wonderful tale of true love in the new millennium. The always beautiful Monica Potter, with her electrifying smile and wonderful persona lights up the screen, and tops her performance in the box office hit Patch Adams. The film, which deals with the misadventures of 3 British guys who fall for the same girl, brings an irrepressible smile to the face of anyone who watches. Whether you are a man or woman, if you are a fan of true love, then this movie should be at the top of your must see list for the new millennium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there such a thing as fate.","review":"If you want a plausible, realistic, it could happen movie, you won't find it with \\"The Very Thought of You.\\" As a dedicated fan of Rufus Sewell I did not like his character; however, I never noticed just how utterly romantic Joseph Finnes could be. Just one look at those puppy dog eyes and I would fogive, forget and fall in love all over again. I also enjoyed Monica Potter's performance as a woman who wants to believe in love but has a hard time forgetting her track record. A chick flick that is great for a first date. What a dream to just pack it up and start all over again....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading other's reviews, I thought this was a good selection for me. However, it is one of the worst movies I have watched in some time. It is pointless, and there is nothing funny or charming about it. Just totally boring.

Super Movie!","review":"This is my FAVORITE movie! I watch it all the time. It is only rated PG-13, not R. It is a clean, feel good romance. Monica Potter and Joseph Finnes light up the screen. And if you like saving money like me...then pick the movie up at the local video store's pre-viewed section. I bought it for only $5! I do think the movie's worth the $103! It's great! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time","review":"It could be classified as a chick flick but in truth it is put together very cleverly, told from beginning to end. Not to mention how the British accents are so cute and the main character, played by joseph Fiennes is gorgeous. the movie is quite funny, with quirky lines and characters thrown in everywhere to make it unusual and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron 10 shirts in 88 minutes","review":"This movie was recommended to me by my very intelligent sister-in-law. She said it was fun and uplifting but I would have rather been asleep for the 88 minutes than waste my time watching a made for T.V. movie that was shallow, simplistic, weak, and only had Joseph Fiennes and Monica Potter going for it. Both are very attractive to look at but Fiennes must have been bored stiff to give this script his time. I agree with other reviewers that Potter looks like a blonde version of Julia Roberts. I'm incredulous that so many reviewers rated this movie so highly. I might have enjoyed it if I was home sick with the flu and half asleep but I expect character development, thought provoking ideas and real poignancy if the movie is romantic. I'm amazed people are so easy to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! An Antidote to Paint-by-Numbers Romantic Comedies","review":"A very sweet (without cloying) film--the most satisfying romantic comedy I've seen since When Harry Met Sally.... and yes, Joe vs. the Volcano. Sure, it didn't have the big-name stars of Nora Ephron's later formula romantic comedies Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail (yes, Nora Ephron knows what sells even if it is manipulative),but the film's utter charm lies in its simplicity, especially Monica Potter's understated and delicious performance as Martha. Demonstrating that less is definitely more, she has no need to draw from the bag of romantic comedy tricks including the manufactured, artifical ear-to-ear grins and calculatingly cute turn of the heads that other actresses of the genre have cheaply relied on. The result is a performance of depth, and the entire cast and production crew obviously worked very hard to have produced this mouth-watering confection of a film. Monica, YOU'RE WONDERFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a quietly surprising film!","review":"the very thought of you is amazing film because it is funny without all of the big gymics movies use today. the characters are more deep than most movies let writers take them. what is most great about this film is that the actors charm without seeming to try and light of the screen with picture perfect chemistry. Joseph Fiennes and Monica Potter act so tenderly and real together that you believe, without a doubt, they are ment for each other. The film is small but don't those always leave you with the best and longest lasting impressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a big romantic antic, but.....","review":"the way this movie was cleverly directed,,,,you'd give it an ovation just for that. it keeps you lingering on and peicing things in your head as you watch the movie. the movie's characters were awesome and monica , well she looked twice as delicious.

They only had one release in 1987 on Maybe Crazy records. They played neo-rockabilly with a touch of psychobilly featuring an excellent lead guitar and a powerful slap bass with a sound very close to Restless (Vanish Without A trace/Girl Invisible era) though their singer is clearly not Mark Harman. The songs are well done, with a will to make melodic and original tunes but the real plus of the band comes from Klaudia. She sings b-vox on a couple of tracks and lead on two, including a superb cover of The Ricochets' Night Ship and the ska/new wave/psychobilly Change Myself.

The whole line of wrought iron stuff from eagle is nice. Its simple, looks great and is durable. The only thing i don't like is that when you first get it the metal smells pretty bad.

Italian and Jewish gangsters supplanted German and Irish hoods during Prohibition. The Italians outlasted the Jews and are now being supplanted by other ethnic groups. Working largely from FBI files and contemporary news accounts, Fried examines the why and how of it all, tracing Jewish organized crime from the early New York street gangs through such powerhouse mobsters as Waxey Gordon, Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, the \\"Cleveland Four,\\" headed by Moe Dalitz who later migrated to Las Vegas, and the legendary \\"Chairman of the Board,\\" Meyer Lansky. One wishes there had been more emphasis on other Jewish mobsters such as Dutch Schultz, Jake Guzik, Charlie Birger, Kid Cann, and the Purple Gang but the rise and fall of the Jewish gangster seems to have been much the same story anyway throughout America and I don't think it's been told better anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying.","review":"John Bunting is a mild mannered, straitlaced, somewhat shy engineer.

But then he decides to seek revenge. He vows to identify the hoodlum who fired the fatal shot and then kill him. To do this, John sheds his Milquetoast-like personality and insinuates himself into the very gang responsible for Ann's death.There's a lot wrong with this novel. The plotting is contrived and ham fisted. The motivation behind the actions of the various characters is obscure to the point of inscrutability. And the dialogue, though obviously painstakingly crafted, often lacks authenticity.Journey into Terror is a very unsatisfying novel.

But even so, I was disappointed. The Mummy game has some interesting puzzles, but you have to put up with a lot of smarmy commentary from Malcom McDowell's character all the while. It really got old. Then I felt like the ending was so cheesy and abrupt that it wasn't worth the trouble of figuring anything out to get there. It was a true let-down. The Frankenstein game is equally frustrating. Lots of wandering around, having no clue what you're doing. Then once you figure out the puzzle, you want to kick yourself for wasting so much time on it. Because it really leads nowhere. Overall, both these games are decent pastimes, as long as you're not expecting high adventure or fast-paced entertainment.

All you do is control this little hand that's a pointer and click on random objects. It's really stupid. I couldn't even get out of the airplane on the mummy game.

But after it did that, my CD-ROM wouldn't work right because it couldnt find all it's files. For some reason my computer thought c:\\\\mummy files was c:\\\\program files so alot of my programs wouldn't work. Some are still messed up because when I try to run something, it can't find mummy.exe. So it's not only a really bad game, but the installation software is really messed up. This game wouldn't even be entertaining for 3 year olds. If you want a good family game, try something from Hoyle. Or if you want a good game filled with action, try Tomb Raider.

I found that song to be very novel and quite marvelous at the time for its marriage of breakbeat electronica with classical string instrumentation. The production on it is not the best, though. You can't up the bass to listen to the break-beats with any force without having the orchestral bass strings overpoweringly-thumbing out too buzzy-like. Well, this song lost its gloss pretty quickly for me. I think it's an interesting electronic novelty song now. I have since sold this EP to the resale shop. The rest of this CD sounded like an attempt to be a sort of electro version of They Might Be Giants. Mildly amusing at times, for the most part Mr. James didn't seem to hit the mark. I agree, these short tunes with his whimsically innocent vocals DO sound like scraps of sillyness he dug out from bits of crumpled paper perhaps lying around his floor.

I am always impressed by the quality of the Softwalk shoe and these are no exception. These shoes look so cute with jeans and also dress up nicely for work.

They just fell apart. Some people think they know everything and will blame my technique but its real simple. The glue didnt hold.. The remaining Gorilla Glue residue was easy to clean off anyway - it flaked right out of the joint. I redid the joint with epoxy and its fine now.Gorilla is going back to the store for a refund.

The directions tell you to moisten the surface first, which I did, but still, the bond was not strong enough for my taste.Also, the glue is IMPOSSIBLE -- and I repeat -- IMPOSSIBLE to clean off your hands. You MUST wear rubber gloves if you use this stuff. I got some of this glue on my hands when I used it, and it literally took a week of scrubbing every day before it was all off.

This ranks somewhere near the bottom for me, under Furniture Music For Evening Shuttles (their crowning achievement, in my opinion), the Planet TR disc (mystical & incredible) and The Fraternity Of Moonwalkers. I find it more boring than those, maybe because there's not as much diversity in sound or in song (a lot of jamming on a single riff), and there's no weird overdubs. Plus Matt sounds like he's doing his best Neil Young impression. I love Neil, don't get me wrong, but there's something off-putting about it. The tracks kinda meander, and every once in a while, you'll hear some cool keyboard strangeness or bizarre editing, which excites me, but as much as it pains me to say it, the best albums by them are the ones that are currently out of print. This is a little too conventional for my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is both really sexy AND has a good plot!","review":"First of all, I should admit that I'm a big fan of reading erotica. Usually, however, I prefer short stories that get right to the \\"good parts\\" over full length books. But in Sign on the Line Jaime Clevenger successfully weaves together six or seven sex scenes ranging from pretty darn good to incredibly hot with a fun and compelling plot (it's way more interesting than the back of the book makes it sound). Clevenger's dialogue is particularly witty and had me laughing out loud more than once. The main character of the book is charming and likeable despite (or maybe because of) her playgirl ways, and the ending delightfully resists the predictable. If you like reading erotica and/or lesbian fiction, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Topics in Corporate Finance","review":"As a student utilizing this text for class, I found it extremely insightful, as well as challenging in content. The book is subdivided in to various topib headings related to corporate finance, everything from debt and equity offerings to derivative risk management.

It's not a bad phone otherwise; I haven't had as many problems with static as the others have. I have noticed that it starts ringing (if it rings at all!) a few seconds after the other phone I have in my house, which is a Brother phone/fax with digital answering machine.

However, the love affair is over.In the past couple of months the phone has steadly gotten worse. Lots of static and 'out-of-range' messages. I've bought a new battery for the phone figuring it was a bad battery. But the problems persist. Since DAY-ONE I've had the phone on a computer grade surge suppressor (and phone line supressor) to protect it from power spikes etc.I've read the other reviews. It seems that I'm not alone in the problems that I've had with the unit. I can't recommend that anyone else purchase one.

As a matter of fact, I had to switch to another phone during my phone call to customer service because this Panasonic kept making a zapping sound in my ear and they were unable to hear me on the other end! They extended my warranty so that I could contact a local service center. I am in a Chicago suburb, yet the closest service center is 1 1/2 hrs away!

This is a strange quirk, and frustrating if you need to make quick back-to-back phone calls from your directory.

The story is well-written, intriguing, and at times even a page-turner. The few occasions when the story drags are most often in the telling of Orr's trials, when Wambaugh seeks thoroughness in telling the story of the trial, but occasionally at the expense of the reader's interest. But all told, this is a good, even haunting story of a true case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a few items","review":"Rather than go into an in-depth review, I'll just make note of a couple of things that I found to detract from this book. Wambaugh notes that John Orr set a number of fires over a period of several years. A chart listing the fires and their dates (and, even better, a map of their locations) would have made the narrative much easier to follow, but alas there's nothing of the sort. I repeatedly found myself paging back through the book when Wambaugh mentioned a fire that had occurred months or years earlier. Photographs also would have helped. Wambaugh notes that Orr's completely ordinary, undistinguished appearance made it easier for him to escape notice when he set fires in occupied businesses. It would have been nice if we could have seen for ourselves. Finally, whenever Wambaugh refers to a vehicle making a U-turn - which he does incessantly - he uses the very annoying phrase \\"pulling a U-ee.\\" Please, a little less slang would be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"He just hates him......","review":"I have enjoyed Wambaugh's other true crime books, and watched for this one to go on the Best Seller lists. When it didn't, I decided to buy it anyway.....And I wish I hadn't. Wambaugh obviously despises the man he refers to as \\"the fire lover\\". He holds him in such contempt that this is in no way an unbiased account, but on the contrary it is a diatribe against this man. Admittedly, the \\"fire lover\\" has done some despicible things, but, please, let the reader come to that conclusion. Why write 338 pages about a man you hate? Spare me......I'll read a more objective account of this in the newspapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story, Two Flaws","review":"As someone who read and enjoyed \\"The Onion Field,\\" \\"The Blue Knight,\\" \\"The New Centurions,\\" \\"The Blooding,\\" and \\"The Secrets of Harry Bright,\\" I was happy to see that Wambaugh served us up another fascinating true crime story, one about someone who was probably the most prolific arsonist in American history. The story of how John Orr was brought to justice is intriguing and gripping, without wallowing in grisly details.I do have to deduct a star from my review for two reasons:1. Just as he berates the lawyers trying the case for subjecting the juries to too much detail, the author overdoes it himself on occasion.2. As a related point, some of the evidence Wambaugh cites would have been much easier to understand with some pictures, diagrams, and timelines. Yet these, as in his other true crime stories, are absent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very American!","review":"These chants not only demonstrate the intonation and rhythm of American English, they are American culture at its best.

Stylistically, it's all over the place: psychedelic prog, acid guitar leads, tight baroque-pop harmonies, sound collage, etc. but it all works.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"No excuse for Axis.","review":"The low number of stars in my review has nothing to do with the music on this album. It has everything to do with the inexcusable sonic blunder committed by Axis in chopping apart and defacing the seamless musical transitions on the original Aorta album. Even for those who have never heard the original, these audio injuries are glaring and jarring, and almost make this CD unlistenable. This was a big mistake by Axis, and is extremely hard to understand since it is technically possible to identify and number the different tracks on a CD without separating or chopping apart any portion of a continuous audio transition between the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I KNOW BOBBY JONES FROM THE GROUP","review":"I KNOW BOBY JONES FROM THE GROUP AND HEARD AORTA PLAY IN THE STUDIO ON RUSH STREET MAKEING THE ALBUM THEY WERE GREAT AND HE IS STILL A FRIEND OF MINE THE GROUP WILL NEVER GET PLAYING AGAIN BUT THERE MUSIC WILL STILL BE ON OUR MINDS AND IN THEM TO ...THE BAND WAS A GREAT SOUNDING BAND FROM IL.

These oak desks were very good quality, but they unfortunately had an ugly black top on them. I am unsure of what the black surface is, but it seems to be some sort of plastic/synthetic. After stripping the desks and removing the edge trim from the tops, I used Gorilla glue to attach furniture grade oak plywood to the black surface. After making a new edge banding and using traditional finishing techniques, the desks look like a million bucks. I experimented with other adhesives, but found Gorilla glue to be the absolute best for strength, working time, and cost. There is a bit of ooze-out when clamping pressure is applied, but I just wait for the glue to dry and scrape the hardened seepage with a chisel befor sanding.

I used it to glue a ceramic/porcelain foo dog. An hour later I saw the hard, foam-like ooze coming from each seam! I ended up having to scrape it off with a sharp edged knife. For the remainder I had to use fine steel wool soaked in mineral spirits. It took a long time but eventually it came off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong but very difficult to work with.","review":"Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking. It has some major drawbacks. It is not water soluble so you cannot wipe the excess with a wet rag (I had to use lacquer thinner). It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially, you are still going to have it coming out of the joint. Don't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps, as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move. The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap (which of course glued itself to the nozzle).I've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones (tite-bond) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work like original..","review":"Tried gluing two pieces of like-kind plastics together and it lasted a day.

In looking at comments on other items in this category, apparently Amazon has a HUGE problem with inaccurate description on Birkenstock shoes. They have just one generic description for each style of shoe which specifies composition -- but then they have all sorts of different ones actually for sale in that style. No way at all to tell what you are ordering unless the one you pull up specifically says in its \\"size/color title\\", \\"Birko-Flor\\" or whatever for that item -- but most of them don't, as they just say the size and color.

I had some two-strap Birkenstock sandals before and they would sometimes come off my feet while out in the yard.This style is so comfortable and these in particular have arch support. As soon as I put them on, they feel comfortable--unlike many other shoes that need to be broken in. They will last many years.

Read this and understand what united the colonists and led to the achievement of the first nation to result from the great thinkers of the Enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You say you want a revolution","review":"I have always had a bit of a preoccupation with the founding spirit of this sometimes great nation. There was such a fervor and passion for freedom from the iron fist of the British Empire that a foundation for freedom was established that many nations worldwide would come to imitate. I have to admit that when I read a brief manifesto like Common Sense by Thomas Paine, I imagine what it would have been like to have been a colonist in those days. Would I have had the courage to join the Revolution? Thomas Paine was a bit of a rogue but surely he inspired quite a few people to take up arms in the Revolution. And he did grant us the time honoured notion that at its best, government is merely a necessary evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book behind the US as we know it.","review":"This book simply has to be read. And carefully: then it becomes apparent that the work started around 1776 has not in fact been finished, and it perhaps can never be finished. The tyranny and arrogance of the British Government then is now replaced by tyranny and arrogance of the communistically oriented governments in the US itself. This work may now be more actual than ever since the 18th century. By the way, perhaps no author had ever so much slander levelled against him as had Thomas Paine. There is no need to add to that, as a poster here had done. That eg. \\"the great\\" Ted Roosevelt found it fit to lie regarding Paine does not absolve us of responsibility of tracing the actual facts. Paine had been reported as \\"one of the most pleasant companions I have met with for an old man\\" by a roommate, at the time when he had all the reasons to be bitter towards humanity, which had for the most part betrayed him. Please read Thomas Paine, and read carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"the reasons we became","review":"Some of the things in society are discouraging.

The book changed everything by crystallizing the issues of the time in a way that the people could understand and placed us onto the path for independence. As much as we need it today, it is unlikely a book with this great of an impact will ever be released again. Every American should read this, because to read this is to understand why, two and a half centuries ago, people fought and died to found a country based on the ideals of freedom.

Of course, any 70 year old Korean war vet should be able to take out a 30 year old FBI agent in top shape....sure. Believable. Hey, Crumley. This is supposed to be crime fiction, not fantasy.The author also seems to have a voyeuristic fascination with young women and drugs, in no particular order.Sex and drugs were used to good effect in \\"Kiss.\\" Here, they're just cheap devices to spice up a basically very boring plot.So much more could have been done with the illegal immigrant/white slavery/child abuse story, but that was never explored.

But this book goes way overboard because it relentlessly heads in far too many directions and ends up with a few - not just one - ludicrous situations and developments. lt's a book which becomes uglier as the plot moves forward and ends with at least 2 quite unsatisfying resolutions, including - SPOILER - the showing up of several characters from out of nowhere, especially a teenager seeking vengeance on one of the antagonists who had disappeared and hidden in a very remote location. How in heaven's name he was found is never, never explained...along with other important matters not revealed.

It is the lost fifth gospel. The wild girl is Mary Magdalene, and she describes her tantric love relationship with Jesus. It is all about the union of the inner man and the inner woman in the inner marriage chamber of the heart. Resurrection and eternal life are not following cruzifixion and physical death, but they are following love and spiritual union, that may also be reflected in physical union. This is the female point of view of Mary Magdalene, in opposite to the male point of view of Simon Petrus. Really great stuff! The story is very touching. It gives no easy solutions.

Applied three coats of Top Cote, used the saw on Sunday to build some Christmas gifts for friends, and then on Monday evening noticed the entire cast iron top had a faint golden haze - rust film already setting in, 48 hours after Top Cote application.

Although every young girl should aspire to achieve their hopes and dreams, Becky Taylor, especially so early on in her life, and possibly her career, should NOT aspire to be the next Charlotte Church. She should continue to perfect her craft and wait a few years. At this stage in her life she should not be putting out CDs. I do not own the CD myself, but heard it at a friend's house, and I am glad that I didn't buy it.

There is an innocent quality to her voice and it fits the selections.It is a shame that she is being compared to any other artist.

The best was the analog tape only \\"Live at the Black Cat\\".OutdeBox is the closest of the two Epic releases to what the fans were jammin to, partly because it was originally a Currant release.Here - is a revealing personal ballad from Kevin, great songBill Cassis is one of Texas' undiscovered talents. He is every bit as talented as Ian Moore or Eric Johnson.Kevin's song writing has always been great, but it needs Bill's guitar wizardry edge to make exceptional tunes. I'm glad they are collaborating again. Hopefully one of the music industry clowns walks away from SXSW long enough to catch Soulhat at Heart of Texas, and signs them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great one","review":"Any fans of SOULHAT, or even music that grooves on a high, funky plain will love this album.

I took a glance through it, and that was enough.I'm sorry, but it doesn't grasp the male viewpoint. Harragan's take on men is naive and stereotypical enough to cause chuckles. As to her notion that the corporate sector is based on military organization...well, Romanian and English are both based on the Latin alphabet, but they aren't even close linguistically. The whole chapter about this assumes that of course no woman has EVER been in the military, and of course all male executives were, and of course young men who've avoided the draft or service (This was written in 1977) are in the same boat as women in that regard. I'm also a veteran and have worked in the private sector.I'm sorry, but no. There is an inequality against women in the corporate world, and I don't know what the fix is, but it's not in here.Highly misleading, badly dated and not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells you the rules of business very clearly...","review":"... and if you weren't either a football player in high school or in the military you don't know them.It's written for women, but any men that weren't jocks or military need to read this too.I used to wonder why I got in trouble at work -- now I know and don't do it anymore. I'm getting well paid for my work, get along with my co-workers and management, and my career is on track.I recommend this book to everyone I know, the few who actually read it get the same results I got.It's a little dated, but don't let that stop you. The corporate culture (at least in the United States) hasn't changed much this century and it's not likely to change anytime soon.

After running into their first CD, \\"Step One\\", at London's Gatwick Airport during the summer of '99, I just knew I had to have the CD. That is when I first got into the Steps sound. Now, over a year later, I still have a great respect for Steps....kind of an ABBA for the new millenium. However, with STOMP, the first single off of their latest album, I am a little bummed. The vocals on this one are excellent, and most of the credit I give the song is due to the singers themselves. However, the actual song itself is a bit boring and barely memorable. It is a re-hashed disco song with very little of anything too interesting. The first couple of times I heard it, I thought it was pretty decent, but now I am sick and tired of it. Not a strong offering from this U.K. bubblegum group."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extremely talented artist who deserves much better...","review":"This CD is the only Jones CD that covers her entire career, but is dubbed from disc and sounds appalling.

She was way ahead of her time with her ear-piercing, soul-scorching vocals, but once I bought the CD I was in for the shock of my life. The master tapes must have been buried with Linda, because they're not here on disc! This disc is full of snap-crackles-and-pops and reminiscent of LPs found at a flea market! Shame on the producers and engineers attempting to pass worn vinyl off on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Linda Jones music on horrible CD.","review":"Any fan of 1960s soul knows that Linda Jones was one of the greatest divas of her time and that (sadly) she never attained the success and recognition due her. While she never scored a major pop hit other than \\"Hypnotized\\" many serious soul fans feel (with some justification) that she was more worthy of the \\"Queen Of Soul\\" title than Aretha Franklin ever was. Unfortunately this CD (her first-ever U.S. CD compilation) does not do Linda any justice whatsoever because all of these songs were transferred from horrible-sounding, worn-out LPs. This is great music from a great diva that cries out for and is in dire need of better remastering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for those intrigued by large freshwater fish","review":"This book is great for those interested in the unusual and rare.

What a surprise! A beautiful book that exceeded my expectations. Much better than the Complete Guide to Flower Arranging, this has some very modern and all easy-to-create arrangements. As a floral designer, I sometimes pick up books here and there for inspiration to use in my business. However, lately I haven't found much to inspire me. This little book is superb.

That was almost 10 years ago. My best friend is now about to have a baby, and I am going to make sure it is the first book my little \\"niece\\" or \\"nephew\\" gets.

It's childlike sweetness makes it the perfect book for a friend or mate, without being overly dramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Little Book","review":"This book definitely gives some unique and nice reasons for liking someone. I liked most of them. However, for some of them the author is so \\"real\\" about why people like other people that he lists not necessarily healthy reasons. For example, one page says that they like the other person because if they get mad at them, they also get mad back...when someone is nice to you when you're mad at them it makes you want to punch them in the nose. True? Sometimes. But not how I want to teach my child to be. Another example is they like the other person because when they say something funny the other person laughs. Does that mean when someone doesn't laugh you shouldn't like them?The last page has a bizarre illustration of a little girl feeding a little boy who is all tied up.In my opinion the age range should be 8 and up rather than 4 to 8.The illustrations are all black and white sketch drawings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Some of the stories are very high quality and fitting the girls that they are about (Addy, Kirsten, Josefina, Felicity). The heroine upholds a good ideal of what a good person should be. Others, it seems, indicate that the author was completely out of ideas (Samantha, Molly).

The price of the adapter seems a little high which is why I rate the product 4 rather than 5 stars.The keyboard is easy to use and the process is fast enough that I see no need to have one of the more expensive versions that interfaces to a PC.All in all it has been everything I expected it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"bcieclipse bounces back with this one","review":"after \\"curse of the dead\\" i thought long and hard before i bought this set,but as it turned out this is a much better set than the last one. as always no widescreen and just ok transfers but a great way to build you a collection of b-z grade horror movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I bought this and used it a few times using a cordless drill.

All ages and groups will enjoy watching it but I would not recommend it for the \\"under 15's\\" as there are sexy remarks and a few innocently naughty scenes(Kamasutra illustrations style).But anyone above that will have a great chuckle.It portraits well and with huge amounts of humour how the big majority of us sees the British aristocracy.All of the characters are likeable in their own ways (eventhough some of them are not \\"out of the closet\\" yet)...I feel this is one of those movies you just gotta watch more than once as there is a lot of clever and surprising plays on words...5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"three problems","review":"There are three problems.

It does not even provide the Strongs number for each word so that you can cross reference them with a Strongs Concordance. This book only gives the references for every time each word appears in the Bible.

The acting was on the level of soap-opera quality, and the scenery was not very good either. The movie also withheld the surprise element from the viewer concerning Crawford's attachment to another woman, which is the climax of the book.

Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to Austen fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous in every way","review":"If you are thinking of watching this film, go drop something very heavy on your foot. The experience with distract you more and pain you less.All about this mini-series is awful. Acting, costumes, wigs, casting, cinematography, portrayal of the characters - all were worse than I have ever seen or could have imagined.The 20-plus brainless snobs who have given this series a 4-5 star review are not the enlightened literate ones, as they would like you to think. They are soulless philistines who will review anything awful as good, hoping that the rest of us, who accurately judge a horror as such, will then ascribe to them some greater depth of feeling and artistic sense.Don't be fooled. The is a plodding, mindless production whose characters manage to take a plot that withstood the last 200 years, and put it in peril of surviving the tedious 3 hours of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible casts, bad screenplay, bad directing.....","review":"this is the first jane austen's novel that was poorly done into a movie. i could never imagine that bbc would did such a bad job. all the casts are so bad, the screenplay, my god, is so bad that it would take a great deal of patience to watch along and stay in a sitting position. all the casts are so bad, none of them are likable unless you are just like one of them. what a terrible directing and acting. the screenplay, my god, is so bad, i just don't want to get into the details... stay away from this deadbeat and don't waste your lifetime in this pathetic movie, see other versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Poor acting. Dismal cinematography. This could have been so much more. The story of Mansfield Park is my favorite of all Austen's works. This movie was my least favorite of all movie attempts at her novels. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"This video was completely disappointing. The only thing that kept me watching to the end was the fact that I am a huge Jane Austin fan. It is completely boring looks like it was shot on a camcorder. Avoid this version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your mother's (or grand mother's) BBC","review":"Yes, it's strictly old-school period movie. Dry as saltines. Fans of Austen will be better served watching the new Andrew Davies screenplay version, which is much less staid."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst","review":"I have collected every Jane Austen film available and out of all of them, this is the one I will not watch again. Once was more than enough. It is very poorly produced, staged and acted. I cringed every time Sylvestra Le Touzel spoke. I recommend either of the other two versions of Mansfield Park (the Billie Piper and Frances O'Conner versions) over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST I have EVER seen","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There was absolutely nothing remotely atractive about this, the acting was bad, the costumes were bad. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was true to the book and it is one of my favorite Austen novels. At first I thought I was watching Night of the Living Dead that is how bad the acting was, but then I realized that the zombies on the screen were wearing the wrong costumes!!! If I never have to sit through Fanny moping about the house looking like a deer caught in headlights,it will be too soon. I'm real sorry I bought this movie before seeing it, but who knew you could go wrong with a Jane Austin movie! My copy of the movie is now where it deserves to be, hidden behind my row of favorite movies; Pride & Prejudice (A&E version), Sense and Sensebility, and Emma (A&E version)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the way I imagined it!","review":"Contrary to the other reviewers, I find this version of Mansfield Park is exactly how I imagined it when I read it. I wonder what the others were expecting in a poor girl at the mercy of difficult relatives? And, did they expect it to be more romantic? I found the acting to be exactly what I'd expect for people of the type Jane Austen described in her book. Especially in England at that time. This is not a happy book, by and large. Perhaps the readers imposed their own world onto Ms. Austen's prose when they read it. Perhaps they are not aware of the difficulties of daily life, even for the leisure class, at that time. I've watched it many times, and showed it to my friends and sisters, and we all love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best -- and most accurate to the spirit of the original -- of the Austen adaptations","review":"A wonderful, understated, intelligent and sensitive performance by the lead actress anchors this adaptation of probably the most difficult of Jane Austen's books. While the later movie version throws out Austen's Fanny Price and replaces her with a more palatable Lizzie Bennett clone, this version sticks to the inflexibly good, faithful and genuinely grateful Fanny -- a girl who may appear to modern eyes to be a bit of a prig. It's tough going to make this difficult heroine likable, but Sylvestra Le Touzel more than pulls it off. Bravo. Well worth watching. Again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austin must be spinning in her grave.","review":"This movie is a grotesque display of horrendous acting in its purest form. The actress portraying Fanny repulsed me. Someone should have informed her that she was playing the heroine in one of the greatest novels of all time, not some harpie on daytime television. Save your money, as I wish I had, and rent Sense and Sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Disc didn't work","review":"The first DVD worked fine... but the second we couldn't get to work. We tried it on several different DVD machines in the house. But never could get it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, just ok...","review":"I loved the book, just liked this movie. True to the book, but the movie was long and poorly made. For fans of the book only. If you have not read the book you will not like this movie. The film making is not the best in the world but is does the job of telling the story. I think that Sylvestra did a good job of portraying Fanny. A little different, when she cries she goes a little overboard, but I think that was how Fanny was intended to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Closely Follows the Story-line of the Book","review":"This BBC presentation is very faithful to Austen's story. However, in so doing it is very long! Also, I did not really appreciate the casting of the two main characters. La Touzel's acting was not up to my expectations and the actor who portrayed Edmund did not seem equal in appearance to the regard paid him by Miss Crawford. In other respects we liked the product very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Available Adaption","review":"Most reviews have covered the bases - this to me is the most faithful to the book, altho slow (like the book). Other adaptions either cut too much out or took too many liberties.If the viewer has read the book, she or he will appreciate the faithfulness of the characters, story and acting. If not, the story may seem boring and dragging, but the book itself read that way, at least the first time around.I highly commend this version above all others. It taught me to appreciate the book and read it anew."},{"rating":"1","title":"True to text but hard to watch","review":"I would have to agree with the former posts that this movie is boring, also that a new adaptation that is true to the text AND has heart is in order. The scene where Fanny is crying in the schoolroom while Sir Thomas interogates her is tortuous. Fannys sobs are forced and go ON and ON and ON.... arrrg!Sir Thomas and Aunt Norris are played well. Miss Crawford is played with spirit but doesn't look the part, whith a different hairstyle I think she could have pulled Fanny off with more success. The others are pretty wooden performances.While the newer Mansfield Park is more entertaining, it is soooo loosely based on the book it doesn't deserve the name!Rent this one from the library while you wait for the REAL one to be made. (We can only hope it is soon!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly still the best Mansfield Park Adaptation","review":"Like the other TV adaptations before the 1990s, this miniseries has rather stagey production values. However, if you're used to such a thing, you should highly enjoy it as I did. It is the only adaptation of Mansfield Park to actually stay true to the book and its characters, so if that's what you like and you were disappointed by either the 1999 or 2007 versions, you should check this one out.Most of the acting was perfectly adequate (with one big exception)- Sylvestra Le Touzel as Fanny Price. Yes, she was written true to the book character of Fanny Price- timid but highly moral inside and all that. There was just one big problem- she just couldn't act! The way she recited her lines sometimes made me cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable!","review":"This movie does stay true to the book in the events that happen, but I find this irrelevent when the lead actress is so bad that it completely ruins the character and story for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Mansfield Park","review":"I cannot say enough about the artistic excellence of this DVD! I love Jane Austen anyhow, but this BBC production was simply outstanding. I love Sylvestra Le Touzel! She is so exquisitely refreshing and played her part so well. I cannot understand why she has not appeared in other films. What a sweet actress with great ability! I cannot see how anyone could be Fanny Price any better!Nicholas Farrell was outstanding, as indeed were Anna Massey, Bernard Hepton, Angela Pleasence and others.I have seen this at least twice thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I am an avid Jane Austin fan and found this to be one of the worst portrayals of her work. I couldn't even watch the entire movie, because the acting was so horrible. Don't waste your time or money. Try Persuassion or Pride and Prejudice, they are worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and boring","review":"It's sad when you watch a movie and honestly feel like you've wasted two hours of your life in the worst possible way when you're done. Too bad we can't give zero star ratings, because that's what this deserves. The only reason I kept watching it was because I was convinced nothing could be this bad and it had to get better. Nope, it doesn't. Viewer from Fairbanks, you summed it up best when you called this film \\"a grotesque display of horrendous acting in its purest form\\". Unfortunately, I had already bought this video, or I would have thought twice about it. For every other Austen fanatic out there, avoid this film like the plague. Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility are the only ones that have been made into worthwhile adaptations so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in light of good material","review":"None of the characters, especially the main, seemed likable enough to care about what happens to them. Fanny was certainly in possession of a good character and strong moral compass, but seemed dim-witted (though sweet). You never get the feeling she's in love with Edmund, nor he with her. I was disappointed overall with the entire performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Enjoyed Watching This!","review":"I recently watched this Mansfield Park DVD and I loved it!I bought the Jane Austen Collection which is a collection of Jane Austen productions made by the BBC and this was one of my favorite of the movies and I really liked it. The girl who played Fanny Price may not be a great beauty but she wasn't susposed to be one anyway and I really thought that she had nice eyes and she played the part of Fanny very well and I would highly recommend this movie either bought seperatley or as part of the Jane Austen Collection boxset which is what I did.BTW: What was the deal with Lady Bertram? Was she mentally challanged? I haven't read the book yet so I was wondering if she was simple minded in the book like she appeared to be in this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An avid Jane Austen fan..","review":"This adaptation is true to the text but that is its only credit.The actors are not well cast for the roles they play, i.e Edmund Bertram is in his early twenties in the book! The woman who plays Fanny Price moves awkwardly(the hands) especially, which I found very odd. It was painful to watch it through.Aunt Norris and Sir Thomas's characters were cast and played well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pyle of ...","review":"Unfortunately for the price there's nothing else in a similar category, so my only real recommendation is to spend more on something that's not a Pyle.

This wasted power and made the \\"portable\\" nature of it moot since you couldn't pre-charge the batteries and transport it anywhere -- they'd start draining as soon as you unplugged it.The second arrived and looked ok, but when I took the handle to remove it from the box the lid came off with it, followed by the sides falling in like a cartoon house collapsing.

I plugged in a mic to test the wired section which worked okay, not super-loud but sufficient for my purposes. I thought maybe it needed a charge but found that, when plugged in, the LED charging light never came on. I called Pyle in Brooklyn and they said I could return it at my cost and they'd take a look. I then contacted Amazon and was pleased to see that they would pay for its return and send me a replacement. But when I got ready to re-pack it I found that the mic cord I'd plugged in could not be removed from the jack--somehow locked in! I call Pyle and they were of no help at all, so I'm now sending back this unit (with my mic cord still plugged into it) for a REFUND.

He plays as if he is obliged to deliberately show off. Ave Maria is too bad in particular. I have never heard it played with so much vibrato as it is here. Ave Maria here is not the Ave Maria from Schubert. It sounds like from third-grade soap opera that you happen to encounter when turning the channels on TV.

So far I haven't gotten it right. I'm afraid that if I tighten too much I will strip the screw. The other down side is that it has to be wound each day. A full wind last about 24 hours.

They do not pull the board into the fence as described by other people without tremendous down pressure being applied, resulting in having to stand directly behind the board to push it through, which we all know is dangerous. The anti reverse wheels actually do reverse (turning on the threads and not their own spindle) and I wouldn't trust them to stop kickback. Adjustment is a pain in the neck, I'm constantly catching my nuckles when adjusting the wingnuts: frustrating!However they do work very well for holding the board down vertically if used in conjunction with a traditional featherboard.These are gadgets that simply don't perform anywhere near as well as traditional featherboards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Have for the table saw","review":"Great little addition for any table saw (I purchased the green wheels for my shaper as well) - you'll probably need the track for it.

Since I bought Grizzly's table saw figure I should get the right unit in their recomended accessories list.When shippment arrived the box says Woodstock International W1104. The hardware needed to mount on the fence railing is 'optional', meaning extra cost, extra shipping charge, and more time waiting for more parts.The wheels and castings looks good, but I wished that I have ordered the Woodstock International's W1104 and save $10 from lower price and free shipping.

From there you fly through the land of the dirt covered hands where you learn about all the aspects of raising a pot baby of your very own. Then, as you stroll across that wonderful rainbow, DJ discusses the many aspects of curing, and enjoying the bushel of pot that you are about to harvest. If you so desire you can stay and soak up DJ?s knowledge about breeding or cloning your little ladies, and even learn something about choosing the color of your flowers.I Give this book five stars from my cannabis sky because I?m on my way to the bushel at the end of the rainbow!

There a few pictures that were also already in CC. Dj Short is respected in his trade as one of the best but he is not an author. If you want detailed information, this book is not the right one.

The orchestral work is similarly excellent. Aside from the uniform excellence of these performances, the best thing about this set is that it provides a really nice picture of the evolution of Beethoven's compositional style. The relatively uniform orchestral and soloist approaches allows a comparison of Beethoven's compositional styles. While recorded with a modern orchestra and a modern piano, the 1st and 2nd concertos display the more Classical style of Beethoven's earlier work. The 5th and final, Emperor, concerto, is an outstanding example of Beethoven's mature and fully Romantic style."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIARS CLUB","review":"Although the stories of other inmates were extremly interesting, I cannot help getting the impression that Mr. Taylor was lieing about his own accounts.

My oppinion of Taylor is, assuming all the stories are true in his book, that he is bitter and is putting down the system that probably saved his life.

The author did a good job, it's obvious he did his homework. The problem is, there just isn't enough there, and he's not a very engaging author. The book is terribly boring and the philosophical inferences he makes from anecdotal historical hearsay is just quite a stretch. He gets even more lost when he speaks of modern cynics vs. Diogenes' Cynics. It's obvious this guy knows people as well as he knows entertaining writing.I can't tell you how long it took me to get through 200 mind numbing pages. You're better off reading the encyclopedia or even dictionary entry for Diogenes. At least that way you don't get this guy's attempt at writing.

So many times, Peste Genovese can be too oily, covering up the taste of the basil and the pine nuts. Not so with this pesto. Every ingredient seems to be perfectly balanced so you get the freshest, most flavorful Pesto Genovese available.

You may find yourself laughing out loud while listening (and dancing uncontrollably) to this CD, for the music's joy is infectious.

You even have Maynard Ferguson doing his master-of-the-stratosphere thing. The arrangements of standards like El Manicero and Bahia (\\"Baia\\") are so Kentonian as to be far removed from the typical Latin idiom. None of this constitutes criticism.

If you're considering a career as a writer in the film industry, use this book as your launching pad, and consider the many excellent courses offered by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful screenwriting book.","review":"This book is comprehensive and easy to read. It is the ultimate step-by-step screenwriting guide. You can't go wrong. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical guide for beginner screenwriters","review":"This book is great for anyone who is learning the formatting of a screenplay. It's pretty inclusive and has lots of examples. The writing is plain and direct.Trotter also gives advice about how to break into the business and shop around your screenplay.I bought the software Movie Magic Screenwriter after reading the book, and have been happy with the way the software does the formatting work that Trotter explains in his \\"bible.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Ever wanted to know, and then some","review":"If you're an aspiring writer, I recommend this book. My journey as a screenwriter started online by looking at other scripts and going by various web sites. I couldn't find an exact standard. Then I surfed onto a web site that had a screenwriting contest and suggested to follow the guides set forth by David Trottier. I bought the book and found more information than I was looking for (in a good way). The book covers everything from the thought process to curing writers block to revising. I'm always finding new things about screenwriting and frequently revising my work-in-progress. It truely is a bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Bible that matters","review":"This book should be required reading in every English/Writing class in every High School/University in the country. The Bible is not only a great read in its own right, but a resource that you can take with you your entire career. Dave Trottier offers sound advice for new writers and reminders for the seasoned proffessional. The tag line \\"Six Books in One\\" is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this and love it.","review":"I actually didn't buy it here. I bought it at ScreenStyle.com because they have free shipping but it's an excellent book. If you're not careful you might think it's just for formatting but there is a lot more \\"how-to\\" write a screenplay. Great for beginners and those rare professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indespensible guide...","review":"I recommend this guide two levels. Firstly, it's an excellent guide for beginners. If you need to know formatting, etc, this is exactly what you're looking for. Secondly, it makes an excellent reference to have nearby while writing. It's only a matter of time before you get stuck on something, and this guide is sure to get you out.I bought 6 other how-to's on this subject before I found this one, and I sure wish I had found this first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is an excellent product for either experienced or beginning screenwriters. I initially leaned screenwriting under the \\"Old Style\\" (Tommy Thompson/Bill Wilder..etc. ) This product, The Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier, has certainly helped me bring my skills up to date and made it possible for me prepare myself for re-entering a market where most of players have changed. A valuable and practical tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must have for beginning writers","review":"I love this book. It gives step by step instructions on how to review your own work before you send it out to others. The only problem I found is that some of the information is spread out a little too much and you have to keep referring to the index to find the topics you need, which could break your creative flow. But that minor, overall I dont know what I would do without this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Super product. Quick shipping. As described. Good price!The content of this book is simply fan-tas-tic!David Trottier is the king of screenwriting.The book looks like a University textbook... but just on the outside.Inside : funny, practical, brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle","review":"Actually I was never able to download this product so I ordered the book which I love. I looked and looked for a receipt with the link and it never came and there was never a confirmation email that I could respond to or complain to, so I was not happy with this. I've had absolutely no problem with previous kindle orders but this one gave me nothing. I hate giving dings if I can work it out another way, but so sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples, no simplistic worksheets","review":"I own this book, and it's terrible. Many of the so-called examples are extraordinarily simplistic. The likes of which I'd not seen since grade school. No joke!And, perhaps most remarkably, there are no real worksheets given to help write. A far better choice for beginners is The Screenplay Workbook: The Writing Before the Writing, by Jeremy Robinson and Tom Mungovan. It will give you a much stronger set of story creation tools, including some excellent worksheets on plot structure, and has plenty of worksheets to start your writing. But whatever you do, avoid The Screenwriter's Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand new book","review":"I ordered this and I wasn't sure if it was brand new or used but it was new. I needed this for class and it got here pretty quick. It was definitely cheaper than it would have been at the school bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't care for it","review":"The writer likes to make this book all about funny quotes from his wife and nephew. It is a total turn off. I quit reading it. I want instruction not a campy book of quotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot Of Hype....But Not Worth It!","review":"Very disappointed in this purchase. High unorganized and hard to follow way to write a book. What the heck? I buy books to help me, not confuse and irritate me! Some good points but mostly my anger speaks more about this book than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to a creative mind","review":"Do this but don't do that. What a lot of nonsense.It would be more beneficial to read Aristotle's Poetics and to focus onwriting an excellent story, than to become narrow minded and learn how tospace your lines, format the pages and adhere to the clich�� \`more is less,'which tells you, that oxymoron's or contradictions are acceptable. In otherwords, this book is full of rules for the sake of rules. Precisely what a creativemind should avoid.This book reminds me of the rules formed by the conventions of Europeto preserve certain standards during the classicism period. For example,no handkerchiefs were permitted on stage, or a woman of nobility was not toallow a defamed man into her room. The rules were arbitrary and they wereloosely based on Aristotle's Poetics. Corneille rejected the rules to produceone of the greatest plays--El Cid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that will change your writing life","review":"Writing is my life. I have written many novels, screenplays, short stories, etc. I have read and continue to read books to improve my writing. I am not kidding when I say The Screenwriter's Bible completely changed how I write. This book not only skyrocketed my ability to complete screenplays, it became an invaluable tool in my novel writing.In The Screenwriter's Bible, Trottier breaks story theory down into easy to understand plot points. I believe that story writing is a beautiful combination of left and right brained thinking. Trottier understands this. He helps you outline a perfect story schematic before diving in and putting flesh on the skeleton.If you love to write, as I do, whether you are a novice or an old veteran, you must read The Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier. It is a must have among your writing reference arsenal.Good writing.-Craig Nybo, author of [ ... ]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable -just buy it already!! Not just a boring how to manual","review":"Like i said up top: just buy it already. This book helped me find a way to format a scene that allowed it to flow effortlessly.I cannot recommend this enough. Pick it up and turn to any page and learn something fun, creative and also about \\"The Biz\\" you want to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I've read a few books on screenwritng and I find this this book just as helpful as the others. It's fun, and puts the prospective writer at ease. Well worth reading and doing the homework. Now get that screenplay written and stop just reading about :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive screenwriters format book","review":"My only regret about this book is that I did not find it years ago, when I began writing screenplays. This is the definitive book on the subject. The format is simple, logical, easy to follow, and conducive to creativity. Many screenwriting contests specify this book as the format to follow.This book is an absolute must for the beginning screenwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"A superb book. If you want to get serious about screenwriting, buy this book. I've seen none better, and have used it in an advanced screenwriting class through UCLA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Resource","review":"The screenwriter's bible is a very good resource. I wish it had more examples of scripts, but overall...very good. I'm sure I will read it a lot more in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Find for the Price","review":"As a homeschooling parent, I am satisfied with The Complete Book of Math workbook. We tried other much more expensive math programs for my son, but he retained very little. I picked up this book for just a few dollars, supplement it with Life of Fred books, and math is now my son's favorite subject. He enjoys the hands-on activities and games that are scattered throughout the book. I feel the pacing and the number of exercises are perfect for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Review Work","review":"We use this to review over the summer. Both kids do a few pages each day. They love it. Helps to keep those brain cells from falling out of their ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for hot weather camping.","review":"I do a lot of off-the-beaten-trail camping in the desert Southwest for up to 10 days at a time. The summer temperatures will often get up to 105 to 110 deg. The Engel MT-45 fridge does an excellent job keeping perishables cold but in the desert heat, this transit bag is a must. The transit bag provides a significant extra layer of insulation so that the fridge doesn't have to run all the time to keep up in the heat. Besides providing protection to the MT-45, the transit bag will cut the fridge's net power consumption considerably. Without the transit bag, my MT-45 would draw close to 2 amps on average on hot summer days. With the transit bag, my MT-45 draws 1.1 amps on average. If you're running on a solar charged AGM battery bank as I do, the difference in power consumption is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific product, but oh so much better with steel fence and roller guides","review":"I will let others extoll the virtues of this product. My message is that you should consider buying the complete \\"Mesa Vista Design GT2000 42\\" Magnetic Featherboard System\\". This comprises two Grip-Tites, a 4\\" high, 42\\" steel cover for your aluminum table saw fence, and roller guides that attach to each each Grip-Tite. Yes, at $150 it costs a lot more than one or two Grip-Tites, but it much more useful, and really essential for narrow rip cuts on your table saw. I started with two Grip-Tites, then bought the fence and roller guides. They are well-worth the additional cost. Please see my review, and reviews by others, of the GT2000 system."},{"rating":"1","title":"JIM","review":"This would be great for steel saws. But most new small portable saws are constructed out of aluminum, so the magnetic attachment doesn't wpork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well but a bit hard to fine adjust","review":"The picture is missing small fins that could be mounted to both sides of the body of the unit and act as horizontal featherboards. The magnet is remarkably strong but the same trait also makes it hard to fine tune the position of the featherboard once it is stuck on the saw table. Otherwise, it is a fine accessory to have for your table saw or router tables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for use resawing on bandsaw","review":"I have had this tool for a long time and never really found a good use for it until it came time to resaw a number of boards on the bandsaw. It works incredibly well holding the stock against the oval (round) fence attachment piece vertically while still allowing minor corrections to the feed angle based on the specific nature of the blade. I was able to consistently resaw 5+ inch wide walnut pieces to a thickness of less than an 1/8th of an inch with negligible variation. Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Car Wax","review":"Great product. Easy to apply and was shipped quickly after placing the order.

I had a dog who was prone to hot spots. He would get them over and over.After I started him (and all other dogs I have owned) on this product, I have never, ever had a hot spot problem on him or any other dog.It solves skin issues, and brewers yeast is supposed to control fleas, so I don't use all the other flea products.I don't know why every dog owner doesn't use this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"War Without End\\"","review":"If you are looking for a rare objective analysis of currentworld events, this book is not worth reading. The author's political bias became evident when he wrote that America'sinvolvement in World War II was not justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Details","review":"If you are new to MFC and Visual C++, this book will help you. When you want to start learning why some things are done a certain way, you are out of luck.This book will walk you through the basics of using the MFC in Visual C++. You will learn the steps you take in VC to do basic component manipulation in MFC but only on the surface. The examples are not really that good. Sure they convey the principle but that's about it. I found myself with more questions to ask and no answers to be found.If you have never done any MFC programming before, this is a good place to start. Otherwise, my advise is to keep looking.-=} Randall {=-"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This is a very poorly written book. If you follow the instructions, none of your programs will work. If I could give it a ZERO stars I would.

I added black olives and sun dried tomatoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first refugee of scoundrels","review":"Nixon apologist and ex-con Jonathan Aitken serves up this loving tribute to his fellow ex-con Chuck Colson. Aitken serves on the board of Colson's prison ministry, so any expectation of objectivity flies out of the cell door. In Aitken's long-ago, forgotten biography of his hero Richard Nixon, he similarly soft-peddled Nixon's crimes. At least this time out the former Tory MP, who just got out of a British prison himself a couple of years ago, forgoes the ludicrous conspiracy theories that made his Tricky Dick biography such a joke. Unlike the unfortunate convicts unmercifully hounded and courted by Colson's ministry, Colson was preaching to the choir with Aitken, who returns the favors to Colson, with this way-too-thick inspirational sop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Read","review":"The subject, Princess Grace has been well researched and told with intimate detail without the \\"tabloid\\" style.

It was very easy to install if you have the mount right on the stud and cable management is very nice and covers all the cables as expected. I have never had an issue with the product in the 2 years I have owned. I am able to take the cover off the cable management area and make changes without issue. The shelf is very sturdy and is quality glass. I have a DVR, DVD player, Apple TV and DVR expander drive all sitting on it without any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product-overall very happy","review":"I like this item very much. It arrived very quickly in great condition. Beware though: if you are not a person who can follow picture instructions, good luck. There are no installation instructions in English with this product.

But this book does a few things extremely well to make configuration much easier, quicker, and better.There's good examples - you expect that with a name like \\"cookbook\\". But each example is backed-up with excellent explanations and references. The particular problems I've wanted to solve haven't matched the book's examples, but they've been close enough to adapt the solutions to what I've needed.I've also appreciated how much this book has helped me how to *think* in Apache. Its use of examples and explanations helps to paint a top-down view of Apache, and help me analyze problems methodically instead of hunt-and-peck through a flock of random configuration parameters.A nice combination of technical know-how, tuturial, and clear writing makes this a darned useful book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not beginner friendly","review":"The kind of solutions this book gives are not aimed at someone like me, new and uncertain when it comes to linux.

There are no vocals, just a bit of shouting and stuff, at the end it's pretty good, oh and in the middle they talk about burgers or something. This CD is like a non-vocal Portishead with a bad cold. It's old stuff, go for the new."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst excuse for art I've ever encountered.","review":"I own two albums by this artist (not three, this one's in a landfill somewhere). I respect Sonic Youth, don't get me wrong, but I've got to tell you... My three-year old sister could get together with her sandbox playmates and produce a more powerful musical statement than this album generates. This is very weak material in every sense of the word.

But it does go downill a bit after the first season. Some themes get repetitive and it gets progressively more ridiculous in its conjecture, assumptions and doomsday scenarios. Certain episodes like ones on alien life forms purely assume with no more authority than the guys working in the creature shop at ILM what alien life forms might look like. And entire episodes are given to things like \\"Sex in Space\\" that really don't warrant 45 minutes of coverage. But if you separate the information from the shock factor they're providing for entertainment's sake, it's really an enjoyable series. I felt like I learned a ton and was encouraged to learn more on my own. Fascinating and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it","review":"My 11 Year old was thrilled by this. He's very interested in Space and Astrophysics, so this is a good starting point for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This saw gives the cleanest cuts I have ever seen. Period. Try it and you will never want another blade. Get the dampener too- it reduces scream and improves the cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previously skeptical","review":"I was previously skeptical that the Woodworker II blade could be as good as people raved. My first use for the blade was cutting hard maple. I had a hard time distinguishing between jointed edges and edges cut on the blade. I'm skeptical no longer - silky smooth cuts.The carbide welds had some wierd wire-like protrusions - but that doesn't seem to be a problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth as Glass","review":"What can I say? This is the best saw blade I have used thus far. Rips and crosscuts are smooth as glass. I will say that a carbide tooth broke off the blade on the fourth cut I was making. I'm sure that this was an isolated incident, anybody can have a defective part every once in awhile. Amazon.com handled the warranty situation exactly as I would have expected. No hassles and no complaints. Had my new replacement in three days. No return shipping. Atta boy to Amazon for outstanding customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing cuts","review":"This is an amazing blade -- If you want the perfectly smooth cuts - use the 5\\" arbor stiffener (it will limit the depth). Even without - it gives one of the best cuts I've ever seen. Forget the Freud or Oldham, etc. Forrest makes the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY, VERY BADLY OVER RATED","review":"I purchased this blade about 12 months back and was thrilled with it for about one month. It cut through maple and cherry (up to 2\\" thick) \\"like butter.\\" And then it was dull and prone to all the trials and tribulations of dull blades (kick-back, etc.). When it was brand new it cut better than any blade I have owned but at the price it should! At the price, it should also have retained its edge for a lot longer (I've had really cheap (Skil 10\\") and mid-priced (Hitachi, et al) blades last MUCH longer and some even started off almost as sharp).Again, for one month of 6 day a week use it was GREAT but it dulled much too quickly - regardless of the price (and yes, I did clean and treat the blade at the end of each day). So, whyh pay the price unless it comes with free sharpening and a loner blade for the time it spends \\"away\\" every four or five weeks.If the blade cost $50.00 I would rate it 3 to 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price..","review":"I used this blade for cutting pine but It did not impressed me at all. I found my Freud industrial blade ( combination ) giving more clean cuts on pine.I guess most of the reviews were for cutting pine, but most woodworkers don't use pine as it is weak / soft wood.After using this blade for one project with pine and Redwood, I did not felt the price was worth it. Nothing impressive at all..Save your money and get Freud combination at less than half the price or go for Oldham combination blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a great blade","review":"The only complaint I have is about Amazon's service as I actually received the thin kerf blade instead of the 1/8\\". After looking up the thin kerf on Amazon I realized that it was more money, and so I was getting a good deal. I decided to keep the thin kerf since I have a 2hp contractor saw; I knew the thin kerf would give me more cutting power.The blade is frikkin awesome!! Even without a blade stabilizer I am making extremely clean cuts in hard maple. The difference between this and what I was cutting with is amazing. Though the price is high, the fact that you are getting a lifetime purchase is worth it. Save up and get this blade; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll never buy another saw blade","review":"I guarantee that once you use this blade,you'll never use another one.I know the price is steep,I kept debating about getting it myself.I'm glad I did!I have a stabilizer mounted with the blade(3/32\\" thin kerf) to my contractors saw.It leaves no saw marks whatsoever!!!

For me, though, the name change from Liz to Andi, and Sadie's name change to Friday, ruins it. I will stick to reading the 1971 edition; I just finished reading it to my sons and they loved it, especially the illustrations by Leonard Shortall.

Well, I'm taking a break, but not too much lightening up in Susan Hill's books!! These are certainly dark here and there, and filled with characters you will care about and want to know more about.I highly recommend this book, and the next...and perhaps the next in the series...!!! You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Narrative Gift","review":"Its hard to put Susan Hill's Serrailler series down.This is a crime series set in England. Hill explores many aspects of modern life while Serrailler hunts for the killer. It is this mult-faceted feature of her works that makes them so absorbing. The crimes are balanced with insight into the daily lives and tragedies of the inhabitants of an imaginary English town. The main character Simon Serrailler is complex, flawed, and likable. He and his sister Cat, a local doctor, are the pivot around which the action moves.I regard this author as a great find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I keep buying Susan Hill's mysteries after reading this book?","review":"I could tell by the pages left in my Kindle thatthere wouldn't be much of a resolution for this mystery.Little did I know there would be NONE! The greatestmystery about this is why Simon became a detective.He never thinks outside the box. His \\"guv\\" is alwaystrying to promote him, but why?Still I continue to buy and read Susan Hill's Simon Serrailer novels becauseof her other characters like Simon's sister Kat, her children, andothers in the community of this cathedral town. The quality of Hill's writing andher psychological insights keep me intrigued, but Susan if you writeanother stinker like this one, you might turn off this reader for good. Don'tdo that because I'm one of your biggest fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH INFERIOR SEQUEL..........","review":"Susan Hill's VARIOUS HAUNTS OF MEN was a revelation. It was well written with exceptional 3 dimensional characters, a great suspense building plot and had a very unique atmosphere about it as it made its surroundings more than real. It was honestly one of the best books I have ever read.i was thrilled that this was a series and had much anticipation with reading this second in the series. It did follow up where the other left off. It is well written in its own way but is nothing in comparison to the first. The suspense does not exist here. The atmosphere does not exist here. And most importantly it is not written in a way where you care about the characters.SPOILER - The main character from the first novel is not present here and it seems her heart was what carried the novel. There is no character as interesting in this book.Somewhat well written but very subpar pschological novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second in a great series","review":"I am thrilled that there is a new detective series on par with the great books from PD James, Ruth Rendell, Deborah Crombie and Elizabeth George. Susan Hill has created a memorable set of characters and sustains a moving story from book to book. If you love literary procedurals, this is a can't miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A study of uncommunicative relationships and life chances, more than a crime novel","review":"I started off enjoying this book and thought I was going to like DCI Simon Serrailler as he seemed a caring, likeable chap with a deep love for his severely handicapped sister and a fondness of art. However I didn't feel we really got to know him any better, other than to find out he obviously has problems with relationships, possibly a mixture of his strange uncommunicative family and his job, and was actually a pretty disappointing character.I found Susan Hill's descriptive writing conjured up scenes and images in my mind very easily, not flowery descriptions, just everyday believable ones. However the story line all felt a bit flat and I kept thinking things would tie together somehow or there would be a satisfying end but it was just the opposite. I can cope without having everyone living happily ever after but this left me feeling cheated of purposeful story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"What just happened here?","review":"When I saw I had fewer than 50 pages left to read, I wondered how everything was going to get tied up with so little of the book left. I see now that I was right to wonder. Quite a few storylines are opened up in this book and few of them, including the main one, are resolved. The characters are well done but it's as if the plot is an afterthought. I found \\"The Various Haunts of Men\\" also a bit unsatisfying; I may give the author one more chance, but if after a third try I have the same experience I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pure In Heart","review":"This is an interesting mystery regarding the kidnaping of a small boy. The mystery has several twists and turns as well as a number of side stories that don't seem to connect to the mystery at all. It actually seems to involve more the private life of the primary detective and his family than it does the mystery at hand. The story begins with Simon Serrailler, the primary detective, on holiday in Venice and he receives a call from his father that his sister is ill and probably dying. He hurries home and his sister recovers - only to die sometime later. But the story of his sister has nothing to do with the disappearance of the boy and could be considered a distraction - or should the kidnaped child be considered the distraction? At one point, I seriously thought the child had been kidnaped to deflect the attention of the police from another matter. The book is well-written but I don't think it should be classified as a mystery but as general fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, unsolved mystery","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the outcome of this book. At the beginning, the characters were fresh and the scene was set for a good mystery. About halfway through, the book seemed to take a bad turn. Characters and actions rambled on and on while the plot went nowhere. I finished the book out of curiosity, but was sadly disappointed when no true conclusions were reached, and the mystery was left unsolved. Sad, just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth reading","review":"I read the first book The Various Haunts of Men, which I was not thrilled with, however, I thought the second one would finish the first books story, not so. This book is a completely new crime, which, of course is never resolved. The main character is flat, unpersonable, too handsome, too talented, too boring.The excitement of discovering a new author was soon deflated, this 2nd novel is the last I will read of this author. One sees the crime from different eyes, nothing is ever resolved, we see this in our own daily lives or in crimes that are in the news, I read mystery books for resolution, for closure, for believing in good wins in the end. Sadly this is not the author for me, if you like being left hanging you may enjoy the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending?","review":"Calling this a Simon Serrailler mystery is certainly a stretch. So far, he is 0 for 2 in the mystery solving department. Perhaps he should turn in his badge and concentrate on drawing. In this novel, even the author doesn't solve the mystery, and there are so many loose ends that the novel doesn't really have an ending. It simply stops. Worst of all, the characters grow ever more unpleasant, especially Simon himself--who comes across as a egotistical and condescending cad. I would not recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the conventional mystery genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, scary, ghost story!","review":"The Old Willis Place is a great beginning mystery/ghost story. There are parts in the book that make you shiver and parts that make you feel like you know the charactors personaly. Mary Hahn does a fantastic job of creating the plot so that you can feel, smell, hear and see the setting as though you were in the woods right there with the kids. It is a great book to use as a read aloud. Not too scary, but just enough to keep kids (ages 9-12) interested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Willis Place","review":"The Old Willis Place is a book about two children who take care of them selves when trying not to get caught from the new caretaker of the old Willis place. When a new family decides to live in the decaying mansion, Diana and her brother Georgie Start to study the peoples reactions and the way they live. They do this so they know what not to do when trying to scare them, which is done for their own enjoyment.Although Diana wishes to be friends with the family's daughter, she and her brother are faced with a tragedy that allows them not to be seen or go past the boundary that was made for them. Lisa the caretaker's daughter is new to the environment and is longing for a friend, but when she hears a little about the dark secret her home stores within the walls and rooms, she can't help but wonder what happened to the kids who used to be there.The Old Willis Place is a spectacular read which is why I recommend this book so very strongly to those who love mystery books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky! by EU from North Boulevard","review":"I reviewed the book Old Willd Place. I rated it four stars because it was very spooky and was about real ghosts! The only thing I would change is the ending with the old mean lady. The story is about two kids that have \\"something bad\\" happen to them and they have rules to follow. You don't really figure out the bad thing until the middle of the book. It was a very different way to tell a ghost story. Don't read it at night! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves ghost stories, probably ages 10 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"This is the best book ever!This book is about two kids who live in the woods. When a new caretaker comes to take care of the Old Willis place Diana and Georgie want to make friends with the caretaker's daughter. When Diana takes a risky move to break the rules and shows herself to Lissa, Diana creates a problem. This problem will create many lies and might even ruin their lives!If I were to recommend this book to any one I would recommend it to kids 9-12 years old, also to people who like happy endings or scary ghost stories. If you like books that might relate to real life this is the book for you. When you read this book you'll never get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old wills place review","review":"I rate this book at a 4stars because It was different then the other books by her . I would have ever guessed it would end like that . Some parts that I like about it when Diana showed herself to lissa for the first time, and when Lissa wrote in her diary about Diana and Georgie and how she knew they were ghosts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Willis Place","review":"I give this book 5 stars. i read it in one day, couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story and especially a great ghost story. Skip the sample because you'll continue reading this one for sure :). It kept me guessing throughout and did not disappoint. A great read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away!","review":"As a huge fan Hahn, I can honestly tell you that this is one of her best books. Her characters are complex and I see real character development. This is one of her more suspenseful books and my blood runs cold everytime I read it. If you have any intrest in non-gory ghost stories, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"Mary Downing Hahn is a wonderful author, and the best ghost story writer in this whole world. However, in some parts of the book their was a bunch of miss-spellings. I do not know if it was intentinol or what, but I know Mary forgot some spaces, and at some times, hard to read.

Teeth were all dipped in protective wax similar to other cutting tools I've bought. The carbide is very thick, thicker than any other blade I've owned. So far I've only tried the blade once on some 1/4\\" birch ply. Birch ply is in my experience one of the hardest woods to get clean cuts with. So I cross cut a couple pieces and the results were very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this blade because of someone's recommendation. I am disappointed with the performance of this blade as it causes a lot of burnt marks on my wood, both solid and plywood. It also does not cut as smoothly as my lower cost blades. May be it needs to be sharpened but it is brand new and I can't find anyone locally to sharpen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"This is the first Forrest blade I've ever owned, but I can assure you, it won't be the last. I always thought them a bit on the pricey side and that's probably why I haven't bought one before. This is by far the best blade I've ever had on my table saw. Ripping is so smooth I really wouldn't have to run it through the joiner before biscuit jointing. I do run one pass.....but probably wouldn't have to. Used it for the first time cross cutting and it was very smooth. All in all, well worth the money and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to replace their old blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forrest Woodworker II and Sharpening Service","review":"This blade is everything claimed for it: quiet, leaves a burnished edge. It's worth every penny. I have also used the Forrest resharpening service both for Forrest and non-Forrest blades. They were promptly returned and cut the best they ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super smooth cuts, even crosscuts.","review":"After trying various other blades, I have found this to be the best all around table saw blade. At first I was skeptical of the high price, but after using it I am convinced that this is the only way to go. Tool tip - Make sure that your blade is sharp. It can be deceiving that although it still feels sharp to the touch, it is not cutting as well as it can. I have used the resharpening service that Forrest provides, and I am extremely impressed with the quality of the service."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK no BS, the best blade you can buy.....period!","review":"I have had this blade now for a couple of months. This simply is the best blade that I have ever used! I cut lots of white oak and have glued up rip cuts without even going to the jointer. I recently riped a edge veneer in white oak to less then 1/16\\" and this stuff looks like it came from a veneer factory! I can take a 8/4 piece of oak and cut strips almost as thin as paper with NO saw marks! Did I mention melamine, cuts without chipping! I will be buying another one so I can have one runing while I send the old one back for sharpening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forrest woodworker 11 Saw balde","review":"I have using this blade for about 10 Years. I am on my third one. i have had this sharpened buy Forrest Manufacturing. When i get broken teeth they can repair and comes back as good as new. the blade makes glue joint cuts and no need to use a jointer. It is well worth the money for this blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice but unforgiving.","review":"When cutting hard maple this blade will give you cuts as smooth as glass as long as the wood does not wander even a few thousandths away from the rip fence otherwise it will burn the wood. So as long as you are perfect..it is perfect. It is a very good blade but it is not as \\"forgiving\\" as other blades I have used over the years. If you use a dial indicator (or other methods) to assure your fence is parallel to the blade, and you feed it perfectly or use featherboards, you will be impressed with the quality of the edge it leaves. On crosscuts it leaves a really nice edge with only the very slightest fuzzy which will fall off with a touch of your finger leaving a perfect edge. I bought the blade because of all the \\"hype\\" I have heard about it over the years and although I like the blade very much, it may be a bit more expensive than other blades that will do a similar job."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!!!!!!","review":"Now I understand what all the fuss is about...this blade stands completely alone. It produces such a smooth, beautiful edge when mounted in my table saw, that it looks like I sanded the edge. It's so much better than even the Freud blades that I have been buying forever, that I can't imagine using anything else from now on.I should also mention that I am able to feed hardwoods through my 3HP table saw with much less pressure. It feels like I doubled the HP on the saw...a nice bonus.All I can say is don't wait, don't think another second about the few extra coins this will set you back....just buy it and I know you will never be sorry. I wish I had done it sooner. My results were so exceptional, that I immediately ordered a 12\\" 80 tooth Chopmaster version for my Dewalt compound miter saw....can't wait to test that too.P.S.

Instantly the group of people at the demo table bought blades.The price is not cheap but (as the demo guy said) \\"the quality outperforms the cost.\\" He is right!I haven't done it yet, but adding the stabilizer by Forrest guarantees a babies butt smooth cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"i recently bought a used PM66, and got this blade to replace the completely worn and warped on that the previous owner had on the saw.aligned the tables and fence, put the new blade on, set the fence to 3\\" and ran a 2x4 through, and my digital micrometer says 3.000.what else needs to be said?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent do-everything table saw blade","review":"The Woodworker II blade replaced a Freud general purpose thin-kerf blade that was just OK. It caused occassional burns when ripped a burn-susceptible wood like cherry. The Forrest WWII (standard .125 kerf) does it all -- clean, burn-free rips in cherry, smooth cross cuts on hardwood, and smooth surfaces on both sides of cuts in solid core plywood. It's unusual to find a product that handles multiple tasks as well they would be handled by several single-purpose tools. This one really does it all. I have a 1-HP Delta contractor's saw and the WWII blade seems expensive, but it's worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Available","review":"My woodworker husband loves these blades; we buy at least one a year so he has them on hand for projects.

I kept reading great reviews about this blade and couldn't imagine what the big deal was -- I mean, I already had a carbide tip blade. But, it was on sale, and I am trying to upgrade my equipment. So, I bought one.I was surprised by how heavy the Forrest blade is. But, the real surprise came in its use. I was cutting a piece of mahogany. As I fed the wood into the blade, I didn't notice any of the usual resistance -- had I not been staring right at blade, I would have sworn that the wood was not being cut!The blade sailed through the mahogany, and left a perfect, splinter free cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't hit any knots","review":"I bought one of these Forrest blades about 15 years ago after seeing a demonstration at a woodworkers show in Portland, OR. I was very impressed with the demo, but about the fifth time I used it the tips flew into dozens of pieces when it hit a knot in some cherry wood. I threw it away and have not bought any Forrest blades since.On the other hand, I am very impressed with the 12 inch Rigid blade that came with my Rigid miter saw. The cross cuts are truly as smooth as if sanded with fine sandpaper, even after extended use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control ?????????????????????","review":"I ordered this blade for my new table saw after reading all the reviews so I ordered the blade from Amazon and I installed in table saw and went to test cut and all it did is smoke and burn the wood!

Also the louds are usually far too load sounding nothing as they do in in a live performance. The parts of the other performances I could stand hearing to the end had much poorer performances, perhaps Mozart's fault since many of the themes are trivial and repeat endlessly. Over half the quartet recordings in my large collection have the violins on the wrong side. This does not bother me now since,having biwireable speakers, I have the B speakers reversed. Absent such speakers banana plugs can be quickly changed but that is a big bother. Otherwise, listen with headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallace's Lists","review":"This is a great story about Wallace who can't do anything without a list.

There is no way you can lock the featherboard to the table slot and have it be a reliable, working accessory. I'm amazed this set is still offered for sale.

The knob has a mickey mouse set up consisting of a phillips head screw in a plastic chase. As you try to tighten the knob, the theory is that the screw will remain in place as the knob threads down the shaft and snugs the plastic adjustment arm. It works, sort of, with one knob.

This thing is nothing by a cheap, flimsy piece of plastic. The fingers are way too lightweight to provide any kind of significant pressure against a workpiece, and they don't even line up in a straight line.

Their sound (distinguished by Art Wood's gruff vocals and Jon Lord's nimble Booker T.-like organ lines) was sure-footed and tough through relentless club gigs in the UK. Like other organ-based UK combos like the Graham Bond Organization, their main strength was their awesome instrumental prowess but not top-notch songwriting ability ('Art Gallery' is comprised mostly of soul and r'n'b covers). This fated them to relative pop obscurity and footnote status to late-60s supergroups like Deep Purple and Cream. But the recorded documents they left behind define an era. 30+ years later, they still sound exciting; their rhythmic drive on tracks like \\"Keep Lookin'\\" and \\"Be My Lady\\" is undeniable.

It was after hours I didn't expect an answer, but Mr. Forrest himself answered the phone. I was blown away that he answers his own phone; try to get the president of Freud on the phone. He and I spoke for a good 15-20 minutes. Mr. Forrest personally told me if for any reason I didn't like HIS blade he would buy it back from me no questions asked.

The \\"3D\\" elevated the material from mere historical footage to a virtual time travel experience, one could almost sense what it was like to be there. Seeing Hitler in 3D made me shudder, extreme evil comes disguised as the benign. Seeing the people in crowds cheering and responding to him in 3D was bone chilling. Could it happen again? My only complaint is that it was too short. I understand the limited amount of 3D material available, however they might have included more pictures, recently released, of the Allied efforts in stereoscopic photo reconnaissance.

It should've been 'Patterson's African Adventure'. Hunting the man-eaters is just part of it. You would've finished reading about it even before you reach the halfway mark.If you're looking for a bone-chilling, nail-biting man-eater hunting adventure, this is definitely not the book. Get this book only if you want to read about some bloke's adventure (misadventures in most cases) in africa. Even then I wouldn't recommend it unless you are absolutely desparate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"This book barely touches on the story of the lions of Tsavo. When the author does talk about the events, he leaves out all of the good details that the reader wants.

If you want to read about how he killed African animals, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man-Eaters of Tsavo","review":"Peter Capstick is an excellent writer. I can't imagine the gripping fear of looking over you shoulder and seeingthe man next to you get taken by a man eating lion! The workers were under constant attack.

ALL TRUE! For the close readers, and those with any practical experience hunting any kind of dangerous animal, you'll find that only blind luck or perhaps the Hand of God was watching over the sometimes bumbling J.H. Patterson in his efforts to complete the bridge over the Tsavo River. The man-eaters even got a brief mention (priceless for lovers of dry British wit) in the House of Lords at the time. I have seen the man-eaters in Hall 22 of The Chicago Museum, and even as mounts, they elicited a cold chill up my spine and raised the hair on the back of my neck! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Adventure and Slice of History","review":"You don't have to be a hunter to enjoy this book--I'm not, and I loved it. Contrary to the title's suggestion, this book is not merely about the Lions of Tsavo. In fact, both lions are dispatched fairly early in the book. Nevertheless, Patterson's account of their carnage, and efforts to kill them, are detailed and exciting, and probably unlike anything that will ever be written again.This book is also gives a micro-social look at British imperialism in Africa around the turn of the century...an interesting slice of Africana, especially through our arguably hypersensitive, politically-correct modern eyes.Generally, an easy read, filled with local color, hunting, and excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend of the Lions","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. After spending a year in Kenya myself this brought back some memories (no I didn't encounter any maneaters).

Every child should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the sun goes down...","review":"A fascinating snapshot in a small hiccup in the giant that was the British Empire. \\"Progress\\" is stopped by two lions who have developed an appetite for tender meat. Patterson is an engineer and really not a hunter. Nevertheless, he struggles manfully and heroically to protect his workmen and advance the empire.He's ultimately successful but not without failures. Despite his impressive efforts, the lions devour Indian workers, native tribesmen and even Europeans. Clearly these cats aren't racist. Everything is turned into lion scat.Perhaps \\"Maneaters\\" isn't the best-written book in the world but it is documentation of a world long past and to the courage and endurance of a very brave man.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexico"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating biography","review":"The attack by a wild animal on a human being carries with it a certain morbid fascination and \\"The Maneaters of Tsavo\\" is one of the best documented and most famous of such man-beast encounters. Upon reading Peter Capstick's \\"Death in the Long Grass\\", one realises the sheer number of individuals who have lost their lives to the lion.

Colonel Patterson really knows how to tell a story--a very descriptive writer.

There is a dragon on the front- an animal that is mentioned no where in the book. It is as if the publisher has never read this book. I also didn't realize that this was a large print book- so be warned that this book is basically a print out, in large font, of the book with a random cover on it.

'OK', I thought, 'read this and confirm what you already know.' Boy was I wrong! Patterson's words came to life with a harsh, punch-in-the-nose reality that fiction writers seldom match. He truly makes you feel what it must have been like to take up your rifle and walk out into the darkness night after night knowing that there was unspeakable horror out there. Patterson's self-deprecating, matter of fact style almost makes you forget the awesome courage he displayed week in, week out until the man-eaters were destroyed. He was a clumsy hunter and it is miraculous he survived, but a magnificently brave man and I'm glad he lived to tell the tale.

This causes two things to happen. One, if you are jointing wide boards, the jig can rock, which can cause either a bad cut, or worse, binding and kickback.The second problem is that the second clamp will catch on the edge of your table saw as you feed it through unless you are really careful - again, a bad cut or binding and kickback.I'm chucking mine before I get hurt and am going to build a simple jig with surface mounted toggle clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the $15.00","review":"Holy cow, what a piece of garbage. One of the previous reviewers explained it perfectly. The board you're straight lining can not be held flat on the saw. Not only that, but if you're doing a board, say, six feet long, then as you slide this along, the bottom of the clamp comes off your saw and then the piece sits flat. This causes the cut NOT to be true. You would need to put a clamp every 15\\" inches or so down the length of your board to keep it consistant. And even if you do that, it's still not lying flat.What a piece of garbage. I tried it once and threw it in the trash (after smashing it with a hammer since it screwed up my cherry).

I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words, this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes: The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second, the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way, if you experience a lot of noise, the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Zero-Clearance Insert, Best Dado Insert Too!","review":"I bought two of these for my Unisaw. I've seen guys fiddle around and make their own inserts, but I don't want to waste my shop time (limited) making saw parts, so I plopped down the cash for these boys, and I'm really glad I did. I made one into a zero-clearance insert, which has greatly decreased the already unlikely probability that my Forrest Woodworker II blade is going to produce tearout on the back side of whatever I'm cutting. I made the other one into a dado insert, which is also zero-clearance for 3/4\\" dadoes... It makes your dadoes clean and crisp on the edges.

Unlike cheaper inserts made from UHMW plastic, the phenolic material used by Leecraft is extremely stiff...no warping or flexing. Fine adjustments can be made with the four leveling feet, and the fit can be snugged with a side mounted set screw. It's prenotched underneath so the initial blade cutout goes very smoothly.It does need a slot cut out for the splitter as well as the blade, but it's simple enough to do.

I use it every ten days or so and it's perfect. One bottle lasts me about a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dado blade I've ever used","review":"The only thing to say is that it does everything that Forrest said it will do.

Throughout it reveals the poet, as a kind, loving, and honest human being. Not only does the poetry reveal her inner self both good and bad, but it also, in the reading, gives a retrospect of our own lives. To do that it must hit home. The book is illustrated with photos taken by the author who is an accomplished photographer.Again, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It will make the perfect gift for a loved one, and especially for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all","review":"Belkin is known for great products, not this one.I received static with the music, no matter what empty FM frequency I found.Really disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No!","review":"I read the reviews but I had to try it for myself and No it really does not work. I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee and use a wired cassette. That works fine. The sound level from the TuneBase is alot lower and noisier. I tried tuning in dead stations and it does not matter. If you compare it to a wired connection you will be disappointed. If you have no comparison or just lowered expectations then you might like it. The base is very stable, that's a plus. But there's a cheaper model that does that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive!","review":"About a month ago I tried the Griffin iTrip, and I was immensely disappointed with the result- it was very scratchy, poor sound quality, and I had trouble finding a radio station that didn't have overlapping noise.So I gave this product a go- and I LOVE it. It works beautifully, there's no static, and you get radio-quality sound. The steel neck makes the iPod easily accessable when you're driving too.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this.

That is about all it is good for. The FM transmitter is terrible. As others have said it rarely works without some form of interference. Even when there is no interference at all I have never been able to get a stereo signal. I wrote an email to Belkin's technical support email address suggesting maybe my unit was defective or I there was something I could do to improve the FM transmitters performance and got absolutely no reply.

My tunebase works great. The sound isn't CD quality, but I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference b/w my tunebase and a normal FM radio station. My cigarette lighter does seem to be in a good position, b/c the tunebase is right next to my radio, so this may help. But I get very good sound coming from this product, and it's very stable. I also like the tuning feature, where I can tune any frequency on the tunebase, and then program it into one of the 4 presets for easier tuning later on.Good product that works well for me, in and around a big city w/ lots of radio stations.(For the NYC people, I use 91.7, 107.7, and 106.5 as the stations for my tunebase)"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIP: How to increase FM performance","review":"Pros:- Tight fit, sturdy gooseneck.- Line-out jack in case you have an aux/mp3 input for crystal clear sound.- Turns off ipod automatically when the ignition is off.- Charges the ipod while playing.Cons:- So-so FM transmission performance.However, I did accidentally found a trick to increase FM performance. Just connect a mini-stereo cable to the line-out jack, and the radio reception became noticeably better. This worked in both of my cars. I guess the cable acted as an external antenna for the FM transmitter. I suppose a headset will also work if you can't find a mini-stereo cable, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with BMW factory radio","review":"I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci with a factory BMW radio (not Harmon Kardon). The Belkin will charge through the cigarette lighter but does not fit quite right, it wiggles around. When I use the attachment ring provided in the box it won't fit at all. The iPod will charge and play when in the cradle but no signal transmits to the radio. I literally spent 1.5 hours, first by myself, then with a gadget-knowledgable friend, going through every single FM frequency. Nothing but silence, even with the iPod volume turned all the way up. The iPod works fine with head phones, by the way.Granted, I may have gotten a defective Belkin, but I won't be trying another one for the simple fact that it won't even fit my cigarette lighter snugly.BMW Owners- be sure to read the return policy carefully before you buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product that's advertised","review":"This product states that it is compatible, via trays, for an iPod nano as well. When I received it, this is also printed on the box several places. However, upon trying to fit my nano in the tray I found that there is no way it will fit...anyone who has a nano knows that the plug on the bottom is offset slightly. So, a mini ipod would fit perfectly as it's plug is centered. The 2 pieces were about 1/16 of an inch off and there is absolutely no way it would fit...4 of us tried!!! This was a big disappointment.

I bought it. I returned it. The problem is, radio stations and electrical appliances can all introduce noise to FM transmitter/receivers. In a city as dense as Los Angeles, it's **impossible** to find a frequency that's not occupied or noisy. I ended up using a tape-adapter that connects one end to a tape cassette player and the other end to the phone jack on the ipod (or any audio-source with a phone jack).My friend worked for Belkin. I trusted Belkin to make quality products. But in this case, I was really let down. It probably works well in other cities but not in Los Angeles at least.

I stopped using my Itrip mini and was disappointed. If your considering buying this, I woudlnt. What you SHOULD do is but the Regular Belkin Charger and use the Itrip FM transmitter.

It does a great job of eliminating splintering when working with fine plywoods. Also, I rip a lot of thin hardwood strips (for edging plywood shelves).

So the ones that don't jam do not travel far at all (less than 5 feet out of the shooter)I will contact Amazon to see if I can return these. I paid $20 for these 40 disks that are basically useless.

The movie felt like being in a car after the driver had a seizure and you could see the brick wall straight ahead. Some people would complain about bad acting but I don't expect Shakespeare in low budget; what I do expect in a coherent, cohesive and copprehensive presentation. Okay, so you're thinking why'd I give it one star or even bother to write this critique? Randal Malone's hammy Italian mobster, while it didn't save the movie, gave me great amusement.

It sounds like it would be so bad it's funny, but they manage to screw that up as well.Here is a tip from me, get some friends in a room and play this movie. Warn them ahead of time to avoid lawsuits later. Watch them react to the movie. It's hysterical!!! Sheild your own eyes and ears from the movie for the sake of your own sanity.

This CD has a unique overall feel to it that I find fascinating.

For example, I probably listend to this CD 15 times before I started to even like \\"Smile\\" at all, but now I really like it. My favorite track is probably \\"No Easy Way Out\\".

I suggest making sure \\"People Move On\\" is in your collection and Suede's \\"Dog Man Star.\\" The latter was co-written by Butler before he left Suede.

Sharp and keeps an edge pretty well. I prefer this way over a small hatchet. The blade is bigger,and the longer handle makes it a better chopper.

If you don't want this, there are other options for binary time.

Nonetheless, is is infinitely easier to make bread from this handy little box rather than tracking down and assembling all of the ingredients on their own. This mix makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf, which lasts about one meal at our house. The procedure is pretty simple, add water, then the flour mix, yeast, and some butter and turn on the machine and wait (you only supply the butter and water, everything else is in the box). The six boxes actually don't take up that much room, so it is not too burdensome to buy this quantity and it is handy to have the fixings for fresh bread readily available.

He was afraid that if no one wrote down who the kings of the Franks were, people would forget. He was right.In a rather junior-high-like style he tells what happened after Clovis invaded Gaul, and founded France. Gregory had a front row seat - his dad was a Roman Senator and he was a Bishop. It's a really interesting book about three generations of leaders after Clovis (generations didn't last very long among the barbarians). This is a really interesting book that's easy to read, and presents an interesting Medieval view of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Don't buy this book.

I am reading this book for school and will have to buy the penguin version to get the full text. To call this \\"History Of The Franks\\" by Gregory of Tours is an outright lie. Do not buy this edition of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important work, good translation","review":"First, this work tells us a lot of what we know about the Merovingian kings of France. It also provides a few rather odd looks at pagan survivals among the Franks, such as the role of female soothsayers (which Gregory oddly discounts in part because angels told him the same thing that the soothsayers were telling), some possible hints into old Frankish mythology, and the naming traditions which seem extremely consistent with those of later Viking Age Scandinavia.On top of this, the work is one of our most important early historiographies of France. It is interesting regarding the struggles against the Arians, and at times Gregory seems to obsess somewhat on proving his loyalty to the Catholic Church. Indeed a large portion of book one seems to have been included solely for this reason.This book is thus one of the more important primary sources for the study of the dark ages, and of early Germanic peoples. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with lots of full leg shots. Christine Nguyen at her best!","review":"This is best of the series of films by this collection of actors and actresses.

But I'm also against murder. The Israeli separation barrier is dramatically reducing murders of Jewish civilians by Arab terrorists, and I approve of that. And I think the authors of this book are refusing to oppose these murders. If they do not like the separation barrier, I think they should try to help stop the murders.There are some truly awful articles in this book. We see Stephanie Koury defend an International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling against the separation barrier in spite of the fact that this ruling may well be the greatest judicial travesty of the 21st century. And Lindsay Bremner has an article on bantustans in which she fails to note the similarities between Israel (a small area into which Jews in the Middle East have been stuffed, while Jews are not particularly welcome elsewhere in the region) and a bantustan!This book is a barrier to peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for a good cause","review":"I enjoyed most of the short stories in this book, particularly Melanie Rae Thon's and Jill McCorkle's.

The authorknew Erdos personally and speaks out quite openly, nearlytoo openly, about private details of Erdos' life. SinceErdos was only and always concerned with mathematics it is aspecial achievement of the author to create such afascinating book. The excentricities of Erdos, on the otherhand, lead to many funny situations, which the author seemsto have collected from many of Erdos remaining friends andwhich stories made easier to bring the mathematicians bioto life.Some simple math pops up here and there to give the reader anidea about the topics, Erdos was concerned with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya don't need ta be a math guru","review":"This is a book everyone can enjoy. I know very little about math and was able to keep up with the contents. There is a good deal of interesting math trivia as well as information on the lives of other famous mathematicians. The life of Mr. Erdos is very fascinating in and of itself.This book is very inspiring for someone like myself who plans to learn much more about the amazing field of Mathematics.If you love to read, do not think that because your math background is slim you will not be able to enjoy let alone sink your teeth into a math story. This is that very math story that is down to earth enough to capture the interests of a wide variety of readership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portrait of Mathematical Prodigy and Anomaly","review":"The Man Who Loved Only Numbers was an absolutely enjoyable read. The information about Paul Edros's life was very telling and interesting. Besides being able to discover the negative numbers by himself, Erdos disproved the notion that mathematicians only do their best work as young men. Erdos was the prominent counterexample to this belief, almost working 20-hrs. a day on math. Though it seems he did nothing else, Erdos's love for mathematics is, simply put, unbelievable. It seems as though he always lived in a world of numbers and sought to find the truth behind them. The book portrays all of this very well while also providing intriguing anectodes about Erdos's life adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pick on special people?","review":"Calling a great mathematician crazy and a speed/ drug addict isn't good.

There are absolutely non-sensical and useless diversions into Hardy and his interest in cricket, Ramanujan and his food habits etc. Cheap tricks to get attention and hide poor research.It is clear that the author has no interest in mathematics and it almost seems like the book was published to cash in on Erdos's death and the media attention the event was getting.Save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"This is a book filled with garbages which the author took from somewhere else and forcefully pasted them together in a rather distorted way. Most of the time, the attentions are focused on fun and interesting issues of other mathematicians other than Paul Erdos himself.

Instead, it's a disorganized collection of anecdotes about Erdos, most of which portray him as absent-minded, sloppy, and demanding as a house guest. There's almost no discussion of his achievements in mathematics. Erdos lived only for his work, yet this book considers everything except his work. The reader doesn't learn why Erdos was famous -- only that he was an eccentric genius. To expand the book to over 200 pages, the author included largely irrelevant material on the history of mathematics. This book was a waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible.","review":"I bought this book to learn more about the life and work of Paul Erdos. I expected a biography. Instead, I found an appalling amount of filler. Anecdotes not about Erdos, as I expected from the reviews but cliched anecdotes about famous figures in the history of mathematics. Why does the author bore us with this? Who amongst his readers hasn't already heard these well-worn stories before? Though the author claims to have interviewed him extensively, I almost doubt it. This book places uneven weight on certain periods of his life, seemingly for no other reason than that he didn't bother to do thorough research. Definitely the worst scientist-biography I've read (And I've read many.) I still want to know more about Erdos. I am left with a very incomplete image. I am hoping that the competing biography, \\"My Brain is Open\\" will be a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"C-","review":"The author obviously did not have enough material for a book. He constantly digresses from one topic to another, and goes into distinct subjects with detail, obviously just to fill up space. It is the same trick high school students try to pull off to meet the minimum number of pages requirement in their writing assignments. If I did not think this practice were disrespectful towards the reader, I might even commend Hoffman for his effort at trying to link so many unrelated topics back to Erd?s. That requires quite a deal of artistry. But it does not really work towards making the reader think the digressions are relevant to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than I expected","review":"I understand how some readers thought of this as a long magazine article. But, in my humble opinion, that is a neat thing. The author talks about alot of things besides a simple list of Erdos' achievements. It is a very readable book. The author talks about such as: Hungarian history, Fermat's last theorem, the history of math, etc. This is a fun read... Let me put it this way, after reading this, I am looking for other things by the same author, Paul Hoffman, and I hope he writes many other books as pleasurable to read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math is a group thing.","review":"This book did a good job expressing the idea that people work better together when trying to come up with mathematical ideas.

What a treat! I liked learning about Erdos and the passion with which he did mathematics. I also like the exhuberance with which Hoffman writes. He is clearly turned on by math, and his clear, exciting prose turned me on. This is not a straight-ahead biography but more of an idiosyncratic, impressionistic take on a uniquely strange individual. Hoffman pulls it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erdos is god","review":"An intimate portrait of the legendary Paul Erdos.

At the end of it, you feel acquainted with his quirky turns of phrase (bosses, slaves, epsilons, Sam & Joe, the great SF) but why did he engage himself with certain types of mathematics (prime numbers) and not others, what did he struggle with as he grew up, what shaped him into the memorable yet odd-ball mathematician that he became. All of these topics are brushed over lightly as Hoffman takes another digression into the life of Ron Graham, or the life of Fermat and the nature of his Last Theorem. I can't help but feel that this book was cut and pasted together from multiple, barely related writings of Hoffman until the requisite number of pages was reached to satisfy the needs of the publisher. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I liked the early part of the book, but Hoffman's style of stringing together a bunch of different anecdotes only loosely connected became grating.

Though Hoffman's non-linear account of Erdos'life is certainly fascinating, this book is really a celebration and meditation on the elegance of number theory, with cameos by all the great mathematicians from the Greeks to Andrew Wiles, the modern day conquerer of Fermat's Last Theorem.

The question is, why carry two?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is okay, but flawed in many ways.","review":"Hoffman is certainly right that Erdos was fascinating, but so much of this book is filled up with stuff that has nothing to do with Erdos. I think the New Scientist was right to say that this book shows signs of being a magazine article bulked up at great speed into a book. The New Scientist was also right that the Erdos biography by Bruce Schechter, \\"My Brain Is Open,\\" is far better written and gives a much better sense of Erdos the human being as well as Erdos the mathematician. A big disappointment. Schechter's book shows that Hoffman did a lazy job and relied on the strong personality of his subject --rather than good and careful writing-- to supply any interest this book has."},{"rating":"2","title":"An odd book that flows evenly","review":"I've got this book to survive a long air travel. The reward couldn't be more surprising. First, the book introduces the weird mathematical world to neophytes in a very light and pleasant way. I was charmed to discover, say, the \\"human\\" side of all those peculiar creatures. They are everything but tedious. Believe me, this book is about people searching for elegance, perfection and beauty in a funny and sometimes tragic way. Second, it is also some sort of a math book - a captivating one. I mean, you're actually going to taste the brilliance of masterpieces like Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes - even a stupid like me could put the pieces together.

I told them that they definitely do not and at this point, I just need to return the bags. I don't have time to keep emailing back and forth (as a mother of twins, I have little time to do anything). I asked for the supplier to pay for the shipping so that I could return the item. I was told that they would not pay for it because they are insisting that the bags fit the car seats. I am extremely dissapointed with this company and I would advise anyone to not waste your time and don't buy from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product doesnt match the photo...","review":"The actual bag is blue in color and made out of canvas, not gray/black as indicated. The material feels cheap and the brackets are plastic - not metal as indicated in the photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit-N-Stroll Travel Bag","review":"Purchased this specifically with aeroplane travel in mind. I found it easy to use and it protected my Daughters MaxiCosi CarryTot very well. We used it on a recent trip to Austria and I found it ideal for storing her car seat. Would recommend it for carrytot use, not sure about bigger car seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Jessica Alba calender.","review":"12 crappy public domain images. Forget it!

I was not sure about the quality or honesty of such a large corporation and to my surprise I am hooked. I have found shoes on Amazon that I cannot find anywhere else. Not only are the shoes available but the prices are insanely cheap for the same shoes on the other sites. Please don't change because of your size, once a company reaches your size it tends to get out of touch with the consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit or Expired","review":"Be cautious. I bought this cologne - which is sold and shipped by Amazon - and if it is not a counterfeit (I trust Amazon), it is expired. Its scent is weak and fades quickly. I am used to Lagerfeld's Photo and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least. I bought four of them, and I wanted to return the three unopened ones. This is what Amazon tells me:\\"For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\"Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around. This is odd, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bank for kids!!","review":"My 3 year old son received this book as a gift and we both LOVE it! He understands the 3 separate categories and is proud to put money in each. It is simple and a great tool to teach children how to save. I also love the tips on the inserts as well as the ledgers available online. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a bank to teach children healthy spending/saving habits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but is not practical and badly made.","review":"After much research we decided on this bank to help teach our children about money management. I love the overall look and concept of the bank. Once we received it we broke the lids in a matter of minutes. They were too hard to put on and take off. The only way we could open the lid was to break it. Now the lids are basically useless and just sit on top of their compartments. It is also VERY hard to get the money out. After we broke the lids and took them completely off (they are on some sort of plastic hinge) we still have a hard time getting the money out. the openings are too small for even my small adult hands. You can't tip it over because then all the money will fall out of the other compartments. Overall I am disappointed and am looking for a new bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing Disaster","review":"I love the overall concept of this bank and will continue to use the idea of Save/Spend/Give for my daughter's allowance. The quality of the bank is terrible though. The flaps that are supposed to allow you to access your money are made of a stiff plastic (not rubber) and they therefore are nearly impossible to open. They are more impossible to close. When I was pushing the bottom flap closed (just with my fingers) on the Save compartment, the clear plastic completely cracked, broke off and fell in. We now have the flap duct taped shut. The top flaps were finally pried open with great difficulty (no child could open it) and now they won't close again at all.Great concept...poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i thought....","review":"...it was.

Therefore, and also considering the low-price, I will not rate this record as severely as I am tempted to do.There are two major problems with this CD. First, why, if Naxos is desperate about producing, over time, the \\"complete works\\" of all major composers, not selecting Maria Kliegel instead of Hugh for this particular one; the comparison with Rostropovich (re-edited, at low price, a few years ago... this is the original and still best interpretation... of the first two suites, at least... I don't have the third) would prove less detrimental to Naxos. Second, intrinsically, the cello sounds so rasp that is it difficult - if you have not heard others play these works - to even apprehend that Britten's cello suites are masterpieces. I strongly advise to run away from this record..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this pump","review":"All the other 1 & 2 star reviews are right. Don't buy this pump. My old pump finally stopped and I needed to remove the water at the top of my dry well. Went to sears and bought this pump. Plugged it in and for the last 2 hours it runs for 5 seconds, stops for 15-30 seconds and then runs for 5 seconds again. Really? I read the instructions, didn't use an extension cord and still the thing cycles for 5 seconds. Thanks Simer for a craptastic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Pump worked two times and than crapped out. I dont have time to not return and contact vendor, that is why I buy from amazon and not direct. You got problems you send it back, no questions asked. Couple of days later I bought another pump because I know I dont get jerked around by Amazon. I wish I could buy gas from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has worked as advertised","review":"After I purchased this product I discovered it did not meet my specific needs. My father-in-law bought the pump form me and he is very happy. It has been running for a full month with no issues and it operates as expected. I also happen to own a Simer 3986 1/2 HP sump pump which has been running 24/7 since May 25 without issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk","review":"I've had two of these pumps (only because I couldn't find anything else locally) and both have driven me absolutely nuts. As other reviewers have noted, the pump won't stay running, and keeps cutting out after running a few seconds even when standing in 6 inches of water. Yes, I've checked everything in the manual multiple times: the screen is clean, the line voltage is fine (extra heavy duty extension cord, etc.) and it still won't work. Like somebody else said, a simple switch to put the pump in manual mode would have worked wonders. But as it is, you'll be better off bailing with a bucket than using this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reliable","review":"Agree with others who had trouble getting the pump to keep running. In most applications, you would need to use an extension cord. How often would the water be right near an outlet?? Our pump runs for just a few minutes & then stops, a while later, on then off again. All this while sitting in 5-6 inches of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Doesn't Work","review":"I bought this pump to help drain a flooded basement, but could not get it to work no matter what I did. I called Simer tech support and tried a few of their suggestions. Still no luck.I tried shorter discharge hoses (even no hose!), shorter extension cords (even plugged it right into the wall), and different depths of water. Every time the pump would switch on for 4 seconds, pump a little water out of the hose, then stop. Back on for a few seconds, then off. A few minutes later it would start the cycle again. To be fair, for the few seconds it worked, it pumped very well.According to the technician I spoke to, the pump senses when water is present or not based upon the electrical flow to the unit (which is why he suggested trying a shorter extension cord). It seems checking amperage isn't a very reliable method.I'm taking it back to the store.It's a real shame. My dad has a couple of Simers from the 80's that run like champs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great natural feeling lube BUT...","review":"I have tried MANY lubes and I have to hand it to Basic Solutions for makeing the only vasodilator AND warming lube out there that I have found. The only PROBLEM is that it is not nearly as warming as other brands such as KY and Wet. The positive side is that I believe it is warming enough so that it is not cold when it hits your skin. I believe this was the idea behind that lack of heat. I do have to say nothing beats a WARMING lube that gets nice and HOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the best","review":"Great works of art give us a glimpse of the meaning to life. Here's a quote from a friend: \\"Finally I watched The Hurricane and now I feel really bad about not having watched it earlier. I resisted watching it for a long time and now I feel like one of the ignorant people who never bought his book and read his story.\\"I must for the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous and contrived","review":"\\"Hurricane\\" the movie and Denzel Washington have a lot in common: they're both laughably overrated. Don't believe the hype, this movie and its twisted-out-of-context storyline aren't nearly as poignant and thought-provoking as director Norman Jewison would like you to believe. Go ahead and buy it if you want, but don't say I didn't try and warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic issue of what standard to apply to a film","review":"Like Oliver Stone's \\"JFK,\\" this film raises the issue of whether to judge a movie by historical accuracy or simply by the standard of if it is an entertaining and well-crafted effort. Anyone taking time to look at the evidence produced at the trials, will have to reach the conclusion that Carter, if not the gunman, was closely connected to the commission of the crime. But should this matter to a movie-goer, who is looking for an enjoyable movie experience? That being said, this is an okay effort, with plenty of drama for someone not familar with the story. It has generated more interest, however, in the ensuing debate about the accuracy of the story as told in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pack of Lies","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out and was duped into believing the lies and fabrications it peddled. It's great fiction, but not a single bit of it is based in fact or reality. I wish I could sue the creators of this propaganda so I can get the money back I spent on it. Please don't waste your money on this anti-American trash. It's sole purpose is to further degrade our trust in our government and perpetuate the blacks-as-victims and whites-as-persecutors storyline of the leftist lunatic fringe. I suggest you do a simple internet search and learn the truth about this piece of human garbage called Rubin Carter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I have yet to see a movie starring Denzel that was bad. His acting ability is phenomenal and I'm sure it takes him days after the film is done to come out of character. Whether true or false his acting is what's being judged in this movie. Not black against white. The story line, plot, dialogue etc. is the focus of MY review. This movie was moving and told a story of a boy who by a fluke (destiny) stumbled upon a book that stirred within him the passion that he lacked thus uncovering evidence that was withheld that set a bound man free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ingrediants of an Epic","review":"What happens when you mix: A great script, a heartbreaking and epic true story, and the best acting of Denzel Washington's career... Well here it is.This movie is the true story of a boxer who was wrongly imprisioned based on race descrimination. In prision, he spends a big chunk of his life. With the help of a young man, and three Canadian activists, Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter is once again brought to trial. The young man and his friends are on a mission to set the Hurricane free.This movie is a pure example of fine storytelling, which is all a movie needs to be down-right great. There are no special effects here, or fast paced editing, just a serious heartwarming story that is hard not to enjoy. Plus with the DVD you get an EXTENSIVE list of features.The Hurricane said it best: \\"Hate got me in here, love is gonna bust me out.\\" Most Highly Reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 strikes for Denzel","review":"This movie was boring, disheartening, spineless and basically just all around insipid. In fact, it is the first DVD that I will be returning. It was that unbelievably godawful. Bone Collector was pretentious, Remember the Titans was very clich��, marginally interesting. But The Hurricane was way below average in terms of the story line, the message it attempted to impart, the cross-section of humanity it tried to portray, and basic overall movie-going satisfaction. The movie was poorly written and the characters seemed like they were something out of a children's book, because they had about the same level of complexity and interest. The acting was OK, but certainly nothing Oscar-worthy. Denzel's movie roles of late have been much ado about nothing, and his performance in The Hurricane is highly overrated. He gets one more try."},{"rating":"1","title":"More tripe from Norman \\"Rollerball\\" Jewison","review":"If you are a fan of movies of substance, then pass on this one because \\"The Hurricane\\" is likely not for you. It's a sappy, cheesy, artificially sentimental movie that opts for a couple of preposterous turns in the story line in order to squeeze a sniffle or even a tear or two.If, however, you are the type who like a good cry or you want a grossly out-of-proportion rendition of the truth, then this movie may do the trick - just so long as you really don't pay much attention to the story line and how ludicrous and absurdly bad Denzel Washington's (over)acting is. It was no surprise to me that the director of the 1975 original version of \\"Rollerball\\" patched this thing together."},{"rating":"1","title":"White man is bad, black man is good.","review":"This is your typical story that shows blacks as the mistreated people that just cannot get a break from the evil white man. A black man, accused of a crime he did not commit, is pursued by relentless white people that will stop at nothing ... blah blah blah. It is the same story that has been told in Hollywood thousands of times before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Ending Hope","review":"I feel this shows that police are not always right that they can make mistakes and that there are a few police that are not good people (corrupted) and that just because of them the good police have to work twice as hard. Just like with the police all black people are not good nor are they all bad. This movie showed me the story of a man who had to fight all his life and because of it and the color of his skin was seeked out by the bad cops because even if he made mistakes he turned his life around and made something of himself but some people just wanted to keep him down. I bought this movie to show my child so she will see everyone is not your enemy nor your friend and that she needs to watch her back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous","review":"Fantastic, outrageously good. Didn't know what I was in for and boy was I pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hurricane {HD DVD}","review":"I saw this movie when first released and since I'm a Boxing fan & book main events like the Boxing on my satellite TV had to get The Hurricane for my collection with a great performance by Denzel Washington Recommended ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining to the max","review":"Based on the story of the boxer, Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, who was framed for murder by a policemen. Outstanding Entertainment. You'll come away convinced he's innocent. The power of cinema...see it.But remember, in real life, he was exonerated by the courts."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film","review":"the hurricane starts off as a violent and full of flash backs to fights and times in prison and is interesting then it goes on like that for a while and it gets to the point when you have to be very patient until the end when it is good. and by the way i don't know why this is R in america because in australia you only have to be 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel can make any movie good, even this one","review":"The Hurricane is by no means a great movie. Denzel Washington is a great actor. His portrayl of the wrongly imprisoned Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter is simply spellbinding. He deserved the Oscar nomination for this performance because without him this could have been a tv movie of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOAX","review":"I am astounded that so few people understand that this movie was a shameful distortion of the facts. Carter was never exonerated, was not the #1 contender for the crown, was not robbed in the Giardello fight, was not hounded by an evil, racist cop, was not in another part of town when the murders took place and finally, was probably not innocent of triple murder. Read some balanced accounts of his case and you will dismiss this movie as the piece of garbage that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel Delivers","review":"*a marvelous performance by denzel washington (possibly the greatest of his career) highlights an inspirational story of an unjust imprisonment*this movie delivers brilliantly on the bringing together of human races and souls*take this story of courage to heart, as it is based on the true story of rubin \\"hurricane\\" carter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Morose and weak-kneed Raging Bull knock-off","review":"It would so easy to lavish accolades on this movie because it was \\"based on a true story\\". But I didn't as much as raise an eyebrow, so that's not a problem for me:) The problem for me is to see anything redeeming in a film that portrays blame shifting and gutlessness as if they were virtue. Seemed like hours and hours of Denzel Washington & Co. hemming and hawing and trying to prove his innocence and doing what is right, for nothing more than putting on a weak, cockamamie and sappily over-acted version of \\"Raging Bull\\".But don't get me wrong...Denzel Washington & Co. did a wonderful job convincing me of their cluelessness. But is this really something I need to see portrayed for the price I spent on this rental? A film should inspire, entertain, educate. This did none of the above. It just spun its wheels and lapsed into cliche and pulled easy strings to get a tear or two.Overall I give it one star - don't waste your time. Sure wish I hadn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Saw !","review":"it's One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Saw ! great .. not words ... to good to be true ... no words can discribe this kind of movie ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this claptrap","review":"\\"The Hurricane\\" is not a good movie. With it's myriad of inaccuracies, it's biased approach to a real life situation, and it's utterly bland technique at story-telling, there isn't much here that you can't find in a tv movie of the week. Basically, they santize all of the ugly aspects of Reuben Carter's life, portray all the real life people involved as one-dimensional heroes and villains, and throw in some appallingly corny lines in hope to maniuplate the viewer. It infuriates me see that people think Denzel Washington was more deserving of the Oscar than Kevin Spacey, whose performance was a thousand times better. Not to disparage Mr. Washington's acting skills, but it cannot compare to the kind of power and depth Spacey's conveyed so memorably. If you want to watch a movie that doesn't provoke or excite anything in you, watch this one, and consider yourself lucky if it fades from your memory soon after it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and over-hyped","review":"I can't believe all these reviews I see gushing all over Denzel's performance in this film...so he was a boxer who got caught red-handed, boo-hoo. Anyone could play that role. Denzel Washington is an overacting clod who grandstands about the racial injustices in this country at any opportunity he's given. Denzel needs to wake up and realize that if it weren't for the opportunities this \\"racist\\" country has provided for him, he wouldn't be a hotshot Hollywood star making millions off his movies.If you want to talk about gross injustices in this country, you need go no further than the fact that Denzel's movies have brought in so much money. Will Smith as \\"Ali\\" knocks this third-rate, preachy piece of fluff flat out on the mat 10 rounds out of 10 any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance, Crappy movie","review":"Denzel Washington is flawless in a terrible stinker of a corny, hackneyed, lopsided biopic of the life of Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, a great boxer of the 60s who is imprisoned for 30 years on charges he participated in a triple murder and then ultimately released. The material is fantastic: a terrible childhood, a mysterious murder, a successful man. But Denzel is the only person who overcomes the triteness of the script and ham-handedness of the direction. Despite Norman Jewison's efforts to canonize Rubin from the get-go, Denzel keeps it powerfully real. Any scene he isn't in is just crap, however. This is not a movie to own. Ever. But it is worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of hot air","review":"I went to see this movie because I thought it would be interesting. As I learned earlier this movie is based on a true story about the true Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter and how he was framed for shooting some guy. I also think that he was wrongfully accused and shouldn't have been arrested. I think that this movie is even more boring than the pokemon movie. I went to see \\"The Cider House Rules\\" it is WAY better than \\"The Hurricane\\". I think that the elderly would enjoy this movie the most because they actually remember this event in time. Another Group of people that would enjoy this movie would be the young because of its message to tell little kids not to do what the actual Hurricane did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong format for my dvd players","review":"This dvd would not play in any of my players. It is an HD DVD which is not compatabile with modern blue ray or dvd players bought at walmart or players on any of my computers. The dvd is not even recognized. I guess I should have read the offering closer. It was so cheap that it's not worth trying to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie was great. I showed it to a group of inmates in a local jail. They enjoyed it. However, let me warn you, this movie is good and \\"Hurricane\\" was wrongly convicted but in many cases a person charged with a crime is guilty and they want to negotiate the less time as they can for them to spend incarcerated. There were some parts of the movie that were unbelievable especially the parts about the prison life, but the story does make a good movie. The part that really intrigued me was the fact that the court system does not seem to be about getting to the truth. I believe this is exactly the way the system works today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hurricane with Denzel Washington","review":"I received the movie in a timely manner and am in the process of viewing the movie. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie...","review":"Before this movie I didn't have a clue who \\"The Hurricane\\" was. I watched this movie to find out who he was and because I read great reviews on Denzel Washington's performance. The reviews were definitely on point along with the Oscar nomination he recieved (which he should've won). Denzel Washington's acting was superb. The movie is about a boxer who went to prison wrongfully accused of murder, who then was helped to freedom by a young man and his Canadian tutors after reading his autobiography which \\"Hurricane\\" wrote while he was in prison. Hurricane was another black man who had no luck in the US Justice system and didn't recieve a fair trial until the case went to federal court where all the lies were uncovered and the truth set free. This was a wonderful movie. It made me cry and also angry at the injustice and also the racism. I was elated when \\"Hurricane\\" was released from a trying time in prison. This movie will be around for a while and maybe become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a beauty....","review":"This is definately the cadillac of saw motors.

Had to Order the a/c adapter today from the main company (Nocord or WWTG)for 9.99 and free shpping (states free shipping on website). I placed the order then received an email that they wanted me to pay Paypal for shipping. Called today and stated it should have been free shipping per their website and the individual stated they needed to check with their marketing company but I still had to pay for shipping and maybe get reimbursed later, like that is going happen.

ARGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal, emotional, and very very Autechre.","review":"With _Envane_ Ae have released likely their most direct and gripping tunes ever. It's a perfect mesh of the wierdness they've been exploring lately with their latest full lengths and the emotional bonds they created with their previous albums. The opener, Goz Quarter is a serene, plesantly stoned hip-hop eipc that seems to take place inside an ant hill, with warm wikka-wikka scratching throughout that envelops you like a favorite blanket. On the tail end of the disc, Draun Quarter manages to invoke images of giddy kids playing with jacks and grotesque battlefields littered with bodies at the same time. Ten minutes of the most comforting pensiveness you're likely to experience. Autechre prove yet again that they can rattle the listener's mind like no one else...but we already knew that, didn't we?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great EP","review":"This CD is proof Autechre isnt one of those bands that puts out its throwaway tracks on EPs before releasing the full-length. Probably Autechre's most consistent release ever - all 4 tracks could have been standouts on a full-length - Envane has an even balance between complex beat experiments and beautiful ambient pieces. The cover art is similar to that on \\"Chiastic Slide\\" but the music is closer to \\"Tri Repetae\\"-era AE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"This is a wonderful CD of familiar hymns played by two skilled guitarists.The artist's name is Brian Pinner, though, not Brian Finner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skating greats perform to Gershwin music","review":"Dorothy Hamill and other ice skating champions perform Gershwin classics from musicals and movies.

So if you are seeking a positive vision of self esteem and inner worth, this may be the book for you. Make Nog's Vision your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Expressive Decay","review":"The legendary bassist Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) from the Sex Pistols meets Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb), a heroin addict, who draws Sid into the addiction of heroin and emotional turmoil. Their relationship is a difficult one that seems to be next to parasitical where Nancy feeds off of Sid's acquired addition causing an emotional tug-of-war. Eventually, Sid attempts to go on tour with the Sex Pistols in the US, but the band cannot keep together due to Sid's gradually declining performances on stage due to the drugs. Sid gives a feeble attempt to launch his solo career with Nancy as his manager, but this too is ill fated. This turns out to be a dance that Sid cannot keep up with, and the future gives the impression of being dark. Sid and Nancy is a film that provides an outstanding performance by the actors and at the end awards the audience with a worthwhile experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, but unique for its time","review":"When this film came out in '86, I was deeply disappointed, but grateful that Hollywood was at least paying SOME kind of tribute to punk rock.Despite the ugliness and stupidity of this witless drivel, it was unique seeing actors play people I had idolized for almost a decade. And the costumes and a few of the period details were well reconstructed. But in all honesty, I can't recommend this to anyone who could just buy the albums and have their own wannabe fantasies."},{"rating":"2","title":"love and garbage","review":"This is a terrific movie that speaks compellingly to power of love: even when the lovers are two of the most repellent, disgusting parasites the world has ever known, we can't help but feel with them, grieve for them, wish them well. I've seen this movie many times, and it never fails to wrench me out of my complacency. The scene where Sid and Nancy kiss, oblivious to the garbage being dumped around them, says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the romanticizing for fiction... this movie sucks","review":"Hey, screw \\"artistic license\\" when it comes to biographies. OK, creating composite characters and blurring fine details in order to make a greater illustration of someone's life is fine, but this movie turns the life of Sid Vicious and his idiot girlfriend, Nancy, into some arthouse cinematographic pool of afterbirth. Besides the portrayals of Johnny Rotten and Malcolm McLaren (Sex Pistol's singer and manager, respectively), the persons invlolved become mere charactures... the scenes of Sid's \\"life\\" become mere anecdotes, and the metaphores come close to \\"stoner logic\\" (meaning, if you're stoned enough, you wont care if the meaning is overly obscure.... kind of like Pink Floyd's \\"the Wall\\"). In the end of the movie, one is left with more questions than answers... the one that might stand out: \\" what was I thinking when I bought this DVD?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie blows","review":"Writing as a Sex Pistols fan, I really can't stand this film. The actress playing Nancy is more annoying and ugly than the woman herself. If this was how Nancy really was someone would have killed her long before Sid. None of the Sex Pistols have endorsed this movie, citing that the majority of it is complete fiction. The plot, if you can call it that, really meanders. Gary Oldman is likable as always, one good thing the film has going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring","review":"Its a little boring and it's hard to understand what their saying half the time with their accents. It's a mindless movie so it gets boring fast, does'nt make much sense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sid & Nancy","review":"This movie was disgusting, dirty, disturbing, and depressing. At the same time very, very good. I really enjoyed it.

A very much disapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"There really isn't much to say about this movie except that it was an awful, inaccurate depiction of the relationship between this British punk rock \\"star\\" and his troubled American girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Want the real story? Try reading the touching \\"And I Don't Want To Live This Live\\" by Deborah Spungen for a true to life account."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, though inaccurate.","review":"It was a cute movie and Gary Oldman's performance was splendid, though the character felt somewhat empty--more out of bad writing than bad acting. And Johnny Rotten.. he was portrayed as absolutely dull, unenthusiastic, and lacked any and all of what made him awesome. There was none of the attitude or charisma, and his overall demeanor was terribly unappealing. Even the stage performances felt forced and lazy. This aspect disappointed me the most. It was as though he didn't even try. But if you can ignore the inaccuracies and emptiness of spirit it's a pretty decent movie, as an idealistic fantasy surrounding the tragic relationship between Sid and Nancy. I guess that's just to be expected when the movie is created without actually consulting anyone that really knew the people being portrayed. ;]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but...","review":"This movie was great, it followed the relationship between Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. Following their life between sex, punk, and drugs. It also shown how she tore him away from the sex pistols, and how he went solo. It has great music in it, and the actors sing most of their songs during the \\"gigs\\" and has some renactments from The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. I would give this movie a 5 star rating but the end was really bad. The ending was 2 sided (the real event, when nancy really died in real life) and it was the major downside, because i definatly dissagree with it. Overall i definatly reccomend this to any Sex Pistols, or Sid Vicious fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans!","review":"If you're not a Sex Pistols or Sid Vicious fan you could really like this movie, but don't trust anything it shows, it's all lies. The movie was made without the concent of any of the Sex Pistols members, they consolted Joe Strummer from The Clash instead of going to Johnny Rotten. It's all BS! If the movie had been about other people, let's say Sam & Natalie, it would have been a lot more enjoyable, but as Sid & Nancy it's worthless. If you want to see a good Sex Pistols movie watch \\"The Filth and the Fury\\". Gary Oldman is a great actor and, even if some other people have said his performance was off, I think he did a very nice job, most of all in singing \\"My Way\\". Still he was nothing like Sid. Chloe Webb was fine as Nancy, almost the same annoying voice, but not really like her.Don't watch it if you're a big Sex Pistols fan! It's enraging and depresing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie about a guy in a bad band","review":"When i first saw the ads for this movie i just wrote it of because i do not like the sex pistols.But i finally decided to watch it and i have to say wow this is an amazing movie.Gary Oldman(sid vicious in movie)does an amazing job playing a strung out rock star.the story is very depressing but true to life.the movie plays out very well with an great cast that is perfect for each role.if i could i would give this movie ten stars!!!!so if you like great movies try this one out.its great for fans and non fans of the sex pistols alike.and this is the 20th anniversary edition it came out in 1987"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I'm a Sex Pistols fan, but I really think you have to be utterly OBSESSED with them, and especially with Sid Vicious, to think this movie any good.

Waste of celluloid, time and talent.The performances by Oldman and Webb are over the top in the worst sense but the depiction of Nancy by Webb is extremely painful to watch. She turns Nancy from pathetic into strangely funny; a cartoon character.You have to wonder what was the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!!","review":"This movie, is deferent paste u would like it or u hate it.

If you dont have a widescreen tv do not buy this release. Buy the previous dvd release of this from the 90s.What they have done is places a 4x3 picture inside a 16x9 widescreen. The result is when you watch it on a full screen tv, the pciture has black bars on the top and bottom as well as the left and right sides..A TOTAL Ripoff.

This DVD set includes some of Elvis's most classic performances from 1956 all the way up to a few weeks before he passed away.

A nice bonus in this collection are the interviews with his close friends and musicians and the personal home movies of Elvis. Definitely worth the $15!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Man!","review":"I think this release is an excellent collection for the longtime fan as well as those new to Elvis. This new edition takes the first 2 of the \\"Great Performances\\" specials and remasters most of the video, and adds interviews with some of Elvis' fellow musicians as bonus features. This doesn't include the 3rd \\"Great Performances\\" special, but that one consisted mostly of Elvis' Ed Sullivan appearances, which are easily found on the Elvis on Ed Sullivan DVDs. Its good to have these specials back on the market since they were hard to find new for a while there, and the remastered video looks very nice. With these you get a some of every era of Elvis, so it provides a good overall picture of him as a performer. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to SAVE another fan this RE-Purchase!!","review":"Of course 2 hours of Elvis (why it is on 2 DVDs is just to give the impression of more and charge more)....is always 5 stars! My rating is because until I stuck it into my player I had no idea I was repurchasing DVDs I've owned for years with different artwork etc. If you have the 3 Elvis DVDs or the 3 DVD set...Elvis - The Great Performances Box Setyou have all this so SKIP!My one star rating is to try and make others take a second look.....and make sure before buying. I can't imagine any fan already not owning these.Its obvious by the low helpful rating that people aren't reading my review but are ELVIS fans who think I'm bashing the King. As I said in my review...its just to let others like me who jump on anything new ELVIS ...check before wasting money.

Spans just about his whole career from when he was taking off in 1956 to right before he died2. Includes home videos of Elvis with friends and family - really gives you another side to the man3. Really interesting interviews with legends and friends of Elvis like Jerry Lee Lewis & Sam Phillips4.

Like all great humorists, Jeff Yoder keeps his tongue implanted in his cheek by making you laugh at the awful truth. Through hilarious examples of what men and women go through in having children, the beauty of the book lies in Yoder's recognition and understanding that few things in life could possibly surpass the benefits of fatherhood. Everyone needs to read this book to better appreciate your children, your parents and the real meaning of life.

Because of her financial predicament, she decides to take on a class-action lawsuit, although she's never had any experience doing so. Bennie is one of my favorite Lisa Scottoline heroines and the feisty female lawyer does not disappoint in this book. Of course it doesn't hurt that she has an interesting set of supporting characters, including a new love interest. You can count on a good read and interesting courtroom action in Scottoline's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bestselling book???","review":"I read this book based on the \\"best-seller\\" status combined with good reviews on-line. What a joke. I was embarrassed for this author! Forget the lack of plot depth, etc. the writing is just plain terrible. She's trying so hard to write 'believable' characters and how they would talk, etc. but it comes out as just plain ridiculous.

I think that it is organized in an interesting way, so you can search more by topic. However, it is a limited resource in that the categorization is limited to only a certain number of topics. Further, many books or authors are repeated several times, and many books are already best-sellers or classics. The book is clearly just a composite of literary preferences of a particular person.

Take my advice - make your own inserts out of MDF or cabinet grade plywood. Use your stock insert as a guide for the shape. Once you make one, you can use a laminate trimming bit on your router to make perfect copies.

Writing based off misconceptions laid by his forerunner, Boettner, Swaggart continues to perpetuate lies and misconceptions about Catholic doctrine and manages to sufficently defend heresy in the Catholic Church which does not exist. Catholics do not worship Mary, sacrifice Christ in the mass, or so forth. Fundamentalists can do themselves a favor and avoid such authors as Swaggart, McCarthy, Boettner, Brewer, Chick, and Rivera, for more scholarly works. None of these common anti-Catholic authors understand the Catholic Church and thus it is useless and fruitless to use thier works as an authority on the Catholic Church. Their best bet is to stick with authors who explain thier faith such as Calvin, and then look to Catholic authors who explain the Catholic faith such as Keating, Ott, Hahn, Ray, Sugnesis, Waiss, Mork, or others and compare the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK COMES FROM A MAN WHO THINKS HE IS GOD HIMSELF!!","review":"Jimmy Swaggart has himself said if he misses preaching on Sunday that thousands of people will go to hell!!

The cheese and herb are light in this brand, so if you like a very strong herb flavor, this might not be for you.Price: With Amazon Prime, I'm paying $2 a loaf.

While I think their white and wheat are fine, they are nothing special. Now I am not sure about the cheese portion of this particular flavor, but you can certainly taste the herb half of the flavor, especially rosemary. It nicely complements Italian meals, or any other meal for that matter. Mix makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf but also includes instructions for adapting for a 1 pound loaf and cooks on the white bread cycle of your breadmaker. Mixes are easy to make, you only add hot water and butter.My only concern about these mixes is that the yeast does not have its own expiration date on it and I am suspect that it will be good until the expiration date on the bread mix.

It said it fit up to 20 lbs, so I thought it would be okay, especially since the medium is for up to 30lbs.Installation was super easy. I was suspicious once it was installed, thinking that it didn't look big enough to fit our girl. I got her in it, and she looked super uncomfortable, but I went ahead and took her on a short drive.Cavaliers are not petite. Our dog is only 11 lbs, but she is solidly built. It was near impossible for her to lay down. She tried, but ended up with her head at an awkward angle and finally stood back up. She couldn't move around at all.The device seems like a good idea, but absolutely it will not work for a dog up to 20lbs. *maybe* you could manage a 11-12 lb dog if they are a petite breed, but definitely not a stocky breed like a Cavalier.I am going to give it to my Mom for her 8 lb Yorkie, as I think he's small enough that it might work well for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, Safe Ride","review":"My miniature poodle, Mister Tibbs, rides comfortably and safely in the Kyjen Outward Hound Car Booster Seat.

I like the material, I like the idea that there is a safety strap, and I must admit the seats do hold our dogs in for the most part. One problem is that the dogs can get out of the seat and when they do the harness pulls their collars tightly against their necks.

The quality of the first one is gone. The frame can be bent with you own hands, the straps are thin and stretch under the weight.

Then it just lays back down in place. Very easy to use!The vented sides allow air circulation and the front blocks the direct air from hitting her in the face if she lays down. It has a little pocket on the front where I store her little water tray and chew toy.She really likes riding in it and doesn't fall off of the arm rest any more.

I was sort of skeptical about ordering the size small because of a few reviews but she is only 8 lbs & I didn't want it too large. The small sized one suits her perfectly! She can sit in it, turn her body left & right and also curl up to nap. It is not overly large where she looses her balance if I have to turn or stop suddenly.

He whined the first two car rides for a little bit but settled down quickly and now jumps into the car seat as soon as we put him in the car. We also put a few seat cushions under the seat to boost it up a little higher and put a blanket in the seat so he's got more height and warmth. This is a great car seat for a reasonable price. Car rides are now much safer for the doggie and the driver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great safe car seat for dog","review":"Great car seat for our chihuahua. This safe booster seat means that our dog is secure if we stop suddenly or go around a sharp corner, he will not fly into the dashboard or off the seat. The good height of the seat means that pup can have his back window down and get some fast air in his face!I nearly gave this product five stars except for two design aspects. Firstly, the back seat must have a proper headrest, not a moulded one on the seat. So this booster seat works in my husbands car but not mine. Secondly, the clasp for the collar is a plastic clip. I think a carabiner clip would be pretty brilliant, but I can easily pop one on mine for ease of clipping in.Dog is happy in seat and has only tried to get out once. This rendered him sitting comfortably next to the booster on the back seat, no strangulation or discomfort and still secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measure your dog first!","review":"The small is too short for my pet to lie down in, although he is only 9 pounds.

Unfortunately, this is one of the smaller groups that are out there. While there are certainly many similarities between what they do, and what groups like American Civil War and World War II do, there are also many differences. This problem shows up particularly in the web resources section, which unfortunately overlooks many of the biggest and most useful sites out there for other time periods.I applaud the effort though.

However, I keep coming back to this Nelly Miricioiu Tosca on Naxos. Miricioiu gives us a solid performance with her glorious vocal tone, and the rest of the cast is of a really good standard. It's such a pity that Miricioiu didn't record more in her career. Don't let the fact that it's a Naxos recording put you off buying this set. They have produced some of the most outstanding operas (Tancredi, Zauberflote, Sonnambula are all worth it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent anthology","review":"A good selection of modern horror/dark fantasy tales. The standouts are the surprisingly chilling \\"Praying That You Feel Better Soon\\"; the two Cthulhu Mythos tales of Inspector Legrasse, \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Where Shadow Falls\\" (which feel more like Robert E. Howard than Lovecraft; the second tale is better done than the first, IMHO); and the nightmarish \\"The Arizona Underground.\\" A few are less fantastic (\\"Black Velvet\\") or less horrific (\\"One Last Drag\\" and \\"Rest in Peace\\") or even tending towards other genres altogether (\\"Time of the Gr'nar\\"), but overall this is a nice collection, good casual reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filler.","review":"I enjoy using this sand for the bottom of my hermit crab cage. It's easy to tell when you need to add water to it because it kind of 'goes flat' when there's not any water in it. It's not the easiest to dig into either for the crabs, and as this is pretty important for them, I would recommend another substance for the other half to keep them happy. This is also a great way to give them their needs for calcium without having to worry about your calcium rock getting soggy or moldy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Transaction","review":"Brand new shiney copper tube cap for 2 1/8\\" O.D. or 2\\" nom. copper tubing.

Thomas Wolf's use of case studies allows the reader to understand his ideas through real world examples. This work kept my interest from beginning to end and has encouraged me to continue my research. As I continue to pursue my interests in the nonprofit industry I will return to this book again and again for insight. Its breakdown into workable chapters that outline key factors to nonprofit management (such as: board designation and effectiveness, financial management and fund raising, and accountability and sustainability) and use of discussion review questions at the end of each chapter make it easy to use as a reference. He also provides managers with guidlines to use in managing their nonprofit organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another resource...","review":"This book does provide some wonderful insights and helpful ideas for managing nonprofits. And since I'm always on the lookout for resources to help me do my job better, I'd like to recommend that readers also purchase The Complete Guide to Fundraising Management, Second Edition by Stanley Weinstein. It was just published (by Wiley, I think), and it offers step-by-step guidance in how to manage just about every aspect of fundraising ((major gifts, planned giving, capital campaigns, etc.). It even has a CD-ROM with customizable forms and worksheets that really will help me day-to-day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The (sorry) state of (most of) africa","review":"I have just started reading this book aloud onto tape (actually, into a computer) for blind 'readers', so I am obliged to read every word. Even only 2 chapters in, it is absolutely riveting. This is no dull historical treatise - it is lively, interesting, well-written and filled with fascinating information presented in a superbly easy-to-read manner. The little-known (to me, anyway!) historical snippets that it reveals are startling, and it dispassionately presents, without comment, the well-researched facts that show why the future of Africa is still forever in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed me Forever","review":"I picked up this book to read on my first flight to Africa and it changed me forever.

On the one hand, I was tempted to give the tapes 5 stars for their contents which include a live session, where Jon Kabat-Zinn instructs newcomers to the art of yoga and mindfullness. On the other hand, one should take into consideration, that these audio cassettes apparently are made under some very poor circumstances. The result is a continuing disturbing noise along with Kabat-Zinns instruction. But if that was all! You have to hear the instructions several times in order to understand what is said - simply because of the poor quality of the recording!Kabat-Zinns books and audio cassettes are reviewed on other places on this homepage, and I will not repeat these reviews words like \\"remarkably, inspiring and gentle\\".

Accused of a crime, all is not as it seems for Bronson's character Deacon, is he really a criminal or an undercover agent?

It begins to show evidence of the self-parody that soon overtook and destroyed the (nearly) original unit. Yet, if you like the band this is still a respectable effort and well worth having. None of the songs are bad and a couple are very solid examples of the groove that only AWB could carve so handsomely.

Plus it partakes of an oppressive scoffing at self help (particularly American and also Jewish so it's got a jingoistic and anti-semitic subtext as well). Under the guise of humor it's actually an oppressive paean to cultural rigidities - a tittering celebration of stupid attitudes. It's anti self-growth - a lengthy elaboration of the self-congratulatory stance of the brain-gone-rigid majority white male. I did finish it but only through a sort of horrified fascination. My advice is \\"Don't bother. There's lots of better things to read than this.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Left where it fell","review":"I can't tell you in words how much I've been disappointed by this album. After listening to \\"Tri repetae\\", I spent sleepless nights, and I still use \\"Tri repetae\\" as a reference point when I do reviews of techno records. \\"Chiastic slide\\", in many ways, just tries to duplicate the ideas and sounds of this masterpiece, and it even brings an ugly, dissonant and uninspired edge into the music. Many tracks are just built around a simple noise riff and crashy sounds, without much substance. The first two tracks are pretty good, though, and \\"Cichli\\" comes up with these psychedelic melodies so typical for Ae's earlier output. The rest is just plain boring for me. It also lacks the concept character of Ae's previous albums. And subsequent efforts like \\"EP7\\" with even more noise and less inspiration have really put me off. Not only Autechre, but also the Warp label started to fade. However, \\"Chiastic slide\\" is an o.k. purchase for new fans, but for me it was the beginning of the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubling","review":"Autechre really baffle me. They are talented, this much I know. What is the problem though? Music is a mass medium with a wide audience. When you are a musician, or team of musicians, you have some kind of responsibility to people to repay the time and attention they give to listening to something, or watching it, or reading it. I don't know if there is anything of that nature to speak of here. I don't know what this is, frankly. It is not music. The sounds are fascinating, but Autechre has always been about these amazing sounds they create. But what is this that has been collected. I am baffled, period. Possibly it is so ahead of its time, or I am just a fool. I don't know, but I cannot imagine the appeal of Autechre anymore. This is like music for your computer, for a robot without a thinking mind, only a calculating one."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion, the best album of all time.","review":"A bold statement but one I stand behind.

A joy from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"(de)constructed","review":"[chiastic slide] is the album that marks a radical break for AE, moving way past the linear programming that saw its logical conclusion with the industrial-banging of [tri repetae], and introducing discontinuous, (de)constructed rhythms and electronic fragments that threaten to implode at any given moment.certainly their most consistent and molecular record. criticims of [chiastic slide] fail to take into account the fact that [tri repetae], [LP5] and [EP7] (as brilliant as they are) were a little too self-indulgent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"I was worried by the bad experience others had with this media - for the smaller spindles available.

I've burnt three DVD+RW's from this spindle in a NEC 2500A drive. Verification was perfect. Nice to have 4x media after using 1x DVD-Rw Optodisc media (which redefines the meeting of unreliable!).

The first 8 tracks are the same work in 8 very different styles. See if you even notice it is the same piece. Different instruments, and arpeggios. I like it all. The first and the 8 Cellos version are perhaps my favorites, if you do not want them all. Also the 2nd track, a hard almost scratchy arpeggio version. I am getting into Arvo Part a little more now, though this is more or less his \\"Bolero\\"; a signature piece that builds on a rather simple, repeating theme, which is not like anything else by him- or anyone else. Well, you have to love a Soviet era composer who when the authorities began to annoy him, rather than cower or placate them with what they asked for, became more religious and started a series of variations (according to the liner notes, 2 taboos they warned him about).

I was immediately drawn to the teasing vocals by Roxanne and the crunchy, semi-drone, inverted bluesy guitar lines that would lull you into a fog before crashing over you in a wall of sound. I ran out and bought both Lido and Imaginary Friend, and spread them around my dorm like a rampant case of mono. The discs made their way gradually to the bottom of my stack, always eluding the \\"to sell\\" pile, when I'd flip them back into the CD rotation and realize how unique they still sounded 5 years, 10 years and now almost 15 years later.

Secondly, you have to hit the little bumps pretty hard to make any noise, and my one-year-old daughter can't really do that, especially with the hammer. I like that it was all soft, and that she could bang on it and make noise, but because she has to hit the thing so hard, she lost interest in it quickly. Maybe it would be better for older kids, but for one and under, at least from my experience, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was very disappointed with this toy.

Skorzeny expressed his derision and disbelief because he knew Speer and the impression he got, from Speer, was that of a commited man and of one who believed in the Third Reich and who was loyal to Hitler too.Apart from the the written above this book is an execelent account of the war from the Nazi point of view and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry.","review":"Inside the Third Reich makes for a dry reading. Speer constantly talks about architecture for pages and pages considering that most of them resulted in models. Then, he'll endlessly talk about routine daily affairs during his time as Minister of Armaments. I couldn't keep patience after halfway through the book because I realized that I wasn't learning anything new or interesting. Once in a while, Speer will have something good to say before disappearing to banalities. The best part of the book is the first paragraph in Chapter 17 entitled \\"Commander in Chief Hitler,\\" and Speer perfectly summed up Hitler. That was exactly what I was thinking. Elsewhere, the pictures provided in the book are quite awful. It's either murky or dark to see. I couldn't really appreciate most of them. All in all, Inside the Third Reich is an incredible journey of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little dry","review":"I'll be up front and say I never finished this book. I have about 70 reviews here and this is the only one on a book I never finished. It wasn't that it was terrible or lacking in information, it's just that it was so, so boring and superficial. All the encounters with Hitler had all the emotion of checking out a book from the library. The behind the scenes may have come later, but by a third of the way through I wasn't going to wait around to find out. Plus it was hard to overcome the feeling that there was no way this wasn't going to be a self-serving attempt by the author to restore his public image. Again, I didn't finish, so take my review for what it's worth, but it's rare that I read that far on a book and then find it so dull I lose all interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"Yes, this book is unique. Yes, because of the privileged position of the author it affords you a rare glimpse into important historical events. My rating, however, evaluates the book itself, how well it is written and how much thought went into it. I do not, by the way, object to the author's self-justification. Everyone indulges himself in this sort of thing continuously and it would be very naive to expect an autobiography not to. I DO object to the book's lack of insight into the psychological motivation of its principal subject (Albert Speer), to its superficiality, and to its banality.And despite my two-star rating I DO recommend that you read it. If nothing else, certain parallels between Hitler's Germany, as Speer describes it, and George W.

It is a bridge between the definitive and (not quite accessable) Gang of Four book and the (very accessable ) Head First Patterns. The previous titles are great on theory but not very good on practical applications. Design Patterns Explained covers the use of patterns as applied to real world problems like an e-commerce system. The examples are relevant and the books purpose is to teach. Each chapter has questions and exercises designed to make you think.It is a useful book that balances the other titles on the shelves. It has served me well when I needed a semi realistic and current exmaple of a pattern in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant introductory text","review":"I read this book before reading Gamma, Helm, Johnson, & Vlissides, Design Patterns. It was a pleasant, easy to read, and easy to understand introduction to patterns. Once you have read that other book, though, you will have less reason to keep this one around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much improved","review":"Although the first edition of this book was pretty good, after reading the second edition I'm inclined to think the first edition was more like a beta.The authors do an excellent job of describing approaches to design involving design patterns. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how they describe the \\"derivation\\" of patterns, rather than just present them as cookbook recipes.The book is very well written and easy to read.I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more concrete examples with real code, although I understand this is not the focus of the book. The code examples that are there are so simple that they don't add very much. I also agree with another reviewer - the margin comments are not useful and are slightly distracting. Lastly, I found the final section, Part VII - Factories, quite weak. There is a lot of repetition about why you should separate creation and management from the code that uses the objects, but I didn't find the examples very compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont go overboard in patterns","review":"I dont think you should go overboard crazy about design patterns. To me, knowing good Object Oriented design is what it is all about. With good OO design - patterns should follow naturally from the code.Obviously, I see the value of patterns, where they create the possibility of creating a framework or headlines for talking about code. But when some people take patterns to be the solution to everything I am bit sceptical.The book does a good job of explaining many of the patterns we know from the GOF text. And it is easier to read than the gang of four text. And there are also many nice chapters on good OO design.So, All in all I should give this book 4 stars. But I am provoked by (all) pattern books that elevates patterns to be the eight wonder of the world - therefore I deduct two stars.-Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"This IS NOT the book to buy to learn about Design Patterns","review":"If you're trying to learn about how Design Patterns work this is NOT the book to buy. When there were few books out on design patterns I could almost justify getting this book but now with so many books out there that explain what Knuth et al were getting at I couldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this and Heads First Design Patterns","review":"This is as much a design book as it is a patterns book. Most people don't understand object-orientation. This book will teach it to you by using patterns as guidelines. It then goes further - teaching great ways of doing analysis (Analysis Matrix and Commonality-Variability-Analysis) and translating that into design. The book unfortunately only covers about half of the gang of four patterns - but that is by design (no pun intended). The book is really about the lessons underneath that patterns and for that it doesn't need all of the patterns. Use the Head First Design Patterns book to learn all of the patterns and to see another explanation of object-orientation. Forget the GoF book which is a bit obsolete by now.These two are a great pair and are all you need to learn patterns and great OO."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than about patterns","review":"This book talks a lot more than about design patterns. It talks about what constitutes good design and how design patterns manifest this philosophy. Good design also must include how to elicit concepts from the problem domain and it does this well. This is the only pattern book that talks about all of the following:* design patterns in an agile environment* using encapsulation to hide unknowns* commonality-variability analysis* separating use from construction and why it is important* the relationship between patterns and test-driven developmentBy dealing with all of these issues in one place the book gives a more powerful look into proper design than is possible when dealing with these issues independently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for learning Object Oriented analyse and design with design patterns","review":"I read many books about software analyse and design in Object Oriented but this book show me the right way easily.

Sadly ironic, my same friend bought me the normal version last year. Will I need meds to revive myself from her dark world? Aimee must have a cult following, explaining why she's not seen much in the mainstream? Her voice IS beautiful, but that's where, IMO, it ends.

Yet after about a month or so of listening to it, its quietude set in - it's a cold, spare album offering up some of Mann's wryest, wisest songs on loneliness and isolation. \\"This is How It Goes\\" is devastating, \\"Invisible Ink\\" is gorgeously written (\\"I feel like a ghost trying to move your hands over some ouigi board in the hopes you might spell out my name\\" is not a lyric written by an artist in a slump), \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" and \\"Pavlov's Bell\\" are fast paced and clever.

But it just sits there, there is no opening cutscene, the game just starts. The weapons are so-so, the damage effects are lame and the sound is bad.Also, the game turns into the predictable \\"find the key\\" and \\"find the hidden switch\\" 1st person shooter game.

I mean, it is one boring game. The weapons are uninteresting, there are no puzzles at all, when you've played level 1 and level 2 you've basically seen all there is to see. And the villians are bland and, for the most part, are not challenging and graphics offer nothing new. In other words this game lacks pretty much everything, but most of all it lacks imagination. If you've got $40 bucks to spend then buy UNREAL and/or its sequel Or the new Half-Live Opposing Force game.

Oatmeal is supposed to be healthy, but after I put a tablespoon or two of butter in it, it could probably make an pretty passable cookie. Instead of a tablespoon of butter, I use a teaspoon of Butter Buds. Still tastes good, but much less fat than even margerine. However, I agree with a couple of other posters that the rehydrated mixture leaves something to be desired.The unopened packets last a very long time.

I am not saying this is terrible as it does provide some flavoring after using a lot of product but I wish it was better. However, I am quite pleased that there is no fat or cholesterol regardless of however much I use which is something that real butter or almost all butter imitations can never achieve.

Well...much to my dissapointment it is historical fiction. Any reader looking for factual, non fiction history stay away from this. It is written in a first person format and has absolutely nothing to do with Teutoburg Forest. It's set in Britania on Hadrian's wall.The author has clearly mastered the knowledge required to write an historical fiction NOVEL but presents nothing about actual events for the avid history student.

You have to wonder if Eddings has had an original idea for characters and storyline since The Belgariad. How many times do we have to have the same bantering dialogue with the same or similar characters? How many times do we have to have cute child god/goddesses who want to be hugged and kissed? How many times do we have to methodically plod from country to country on a mythical continent with the same group of characters spouting the same old tired dialogues?I have read every Eddings series (Belgariad, Malloreon, Elenium, and Tamuli) and this one is pretty much the same. In fact, it is not even as good as those. I could barely make it through this book and I would not recommend it or this series to anyone who hasn't read those other superior series I mentioned above and is just starving for more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"Here are a couple of authors (and their incompetent editors) that seem unable to read the writing on the wall. Flogging a dead horse would be the kindest interpetation that one could put on this piece of rubbish.As a former fan (I relished the Belgariad, the Malloreon and even the epic adventures of Sir Sparhawk) I find it incomprehensible that the Eddings could sink so far so quickly.Constantly trying to be coy, the writing would better suit protagonists that resemble Barbie and her entourage rather than the the characters in the text.At the risk of sounding like the obviously past-their-prime authors, this potboiler is so 'cute' it makes me want to throw up! I think I'm going to run out and see if I can find something written by Jennifer Lopez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"The Belgariad and The Mallorean are some of my favorite books. The next series was okay. The characters did not change but the story was good. This series sucks on many levels. The witty banter is present but the characters are one dimensional and almost all the same. There is no plot to speak of. They all gather, set up a fort and a natural disaster (1 of four can you guess??earth, air, water, and fire) saves the day. They spend most of the time discussing how the bug people evolve over and over and over again. Okay I get it already!!! There was no intrigue, no trying to figure things out, no quests, no fear that they might lose or that any of the characters were in danger. In short these books had nothing interesting. I had to force my way through the first three books and I have no intention of reading the fourth as I'm pretty sure of what is going to happen and I can probably fill in the dialogue too. I feel totally ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I want to preface this review with saying that David Eddings is one of my favorite authors. I will continue to buy anything he writes with an expectation of a good book.Having said this - the 2nd and 3rd book in this series did NOT meet with approval. The first book was decent bordering on good but it ended there. I bought all three after they had all been published and must say I was disappointed.If you are new to David Eddings - you may like these. If you don't like them... Do NOT give up on his works!!!

This is a VERY good fantasy writer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dreamers...A Nightmare, At Best","review":"Do yourself a favor, borrow a friends copy of this book. If unavailable, go to the local library(yes, they still exist).This is surely not Eddings at his/her finest.Endless flashbacks, that ultimately lead to a sudden ending. The Dreamers basically disappear, and a being, more powerful than the idiotic gods now exists. The story rambles on and on and on and on........ and then all has to be tied together at the end with the re-appearance of a Dreamer.What a total waste of time, energy and money. Unfortunately, I love Eddings' work and I can almost guarantee that I will read # 3, I just wont buy it.PLEASE D/L Eddings, Don't disappoint me again, I want to be able to fall into your work, not have to struggle my way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree it's a let-down...","review":"This series is just a re-hash of Edding's ideas from the Belgariad and Elenium sequences--without the originality that made those good. Read the negative reviews below for specifics. The same can be said of \\"Redemption of Althalus.\\" More of the same.I recommend avoiding them and looking to the duo's non-fantasy work, which show real promise. \\"Regina's Song\\" was an EXCELLENT thriller with an atypical plot and supernatural element. Original, with well-developed characters. The Eddings' should focus their effort to writing more books outside the traditional \\"epic fantasy\\" vein, as that well has evidently run dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Eddings should kill himself.","review":"I don't know when I first noticed it, but looking back at the Eddings books, the seed of rot was there from the beginning of the Tamuli. I noticed that there was less emphasis on plot, or character development. Everything seemed to have become formulated. Unfortunately the formula seemed to be: Cute Goddess that likes kisses + No plot + Lots of deus ex machina = MONEY. In fact the deus ex machina in this book and the preceding one was absolutely sickening. Even back to the Redemption of Althalus and the Tamuli. Everything is just really bad, and then the GOD waves his/her hand, and everything is okay. The actual people in the books don't do anything except make snide comments about the ones who don't have gods on their side. Sadly, I will probably buy the third book in this series, but only out of nostalgia, and I will read it with genuine remorse that a once-fine author has fallen to such an appalling low."},{"rating":"1","title":"He must have just needed money","review":"....because Eddings probably just should have't written this book. There isn't enough stuff in it to make one book, much less a series. The plot is haphazard, un-exciting, and the characters all blend into each other as essentially a rehash of his characters from other books. If you like Eddings, skip this series and at least retain a good image of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to chime in so similarly","review":"Long-time Eddings fan reporting in.The Belgariad & Mallorean? Fantastic! The Elenium & Tamuli? Enjoyable. Redemption? Passable. But 'The Dreamers' series literally put me to sleep. I hate to say that I've wasted my money this time.The pages simply do not turn. There is nothing keeping the reader interested. The characters are dry and lacking. There's no real action. Quite frankly, when it comes into the descriptiveness of the 'real battle', it seems as though it was dumbed down quite a bit.I'm sorry, Mr. & Mrs. Eddings, but I will NOT be spending my money on the rest of this series, and I wouldn't even recommend it to a die hard Eddings fan.Indescribably disappointed,Lady of the Trees"},{"rating":"1","title":"A clear no-no .","review":"Eddings was readable a very long time ago when there was precious little to be read in the fantasy genre.I don't say good but readable.Already the very first \\"Pawn of the prophecy\\" in the Belgariad was shallow and suffered from an exceptionnaly poor characterisation.Well, in the meantime the Donaldsons , G.R.R Martins , Eriksons , Williams and Bakkers came and showed how an original and complex fantasy with believable characters could be written.All the while Eddings kept pouring out his stereotypical books copying more or less what he did centuries ago.Nobody should waste time on Eddings in general and this ... book (?) in particular now when there is much, much better in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddings best series to date...","review":"I pretty much have read everything Eddings has written and it is very obvious that the older he gets the better he gets.

Boy was I wrong. It was even more dull than the first book. The characters were flat and irritating. Not only that, but a good chunk of the book was spent going over events that happened in the FIRST book, events that weren't exciting the first time we read them. When I finally reached the end of this lengthly (and pointless) flashback, I thought \\"Finally, now we might get some excitement.\\" Then to my horror I realized that the next huge chunk of book was written from the point of view of a character that had up to now had been exceedingly minor and that (surprise!) I didn't care about or even like. I gave up at this point and stopped reading. The bottom line is, don't bother with this book. If I could give it zero stars, I would. The truly sad thing is, I have liked David and Leigh Eddings' books in the past. What happened guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving","review":"I used to be a huge fan of Eddings. This books is so slow moving, I keep skip ahead to see where the book is going to pick up steam. Most of the books are using various characters to rehash their points of view of the same event, most of the character are not that interesting.There are few good lines here and there, but it is not worth the money to purchase a Hardback.I probably will read the next book(in PAPERBACK).

They are lightweight,smooth, easy to work on, dry quickly when washed, and can easily go through the dishwasher. They do come up with knife gouges, which is why I rated it with 4stars, but they don't effect the use in any way.

With the release of the 700w, I thought surely the manufacturer has perfected the phone, and with a Windows platform, I can't go wrong. I WAS WRONG! In a nutshell (even after several replacement phones, hours talking to tech support, and a move to an enterprise server): Constant lock-ups, faulty syncs, and just bad-overpriced technology. Palm preys on the \\"techy\\" that wants the newest thing. 10 of my colleagues are having the same experience. Verizon is not to blame - when I get a connection, the clarity is excellent.

When the smartphones came out a few years ago, I was excited to combine two items into one. At first I had the 650p, which was great. Unfortunately, I cracked the screen (my fault) and Verizon replaced it with the 700w, as the 650p was no longer being manufactured.Ugh, what a nightmare. I would give anything to have the 650p back! The biggest mistake Palm ever had was putting Windows in their devices. As others have said, the 700w regularly crashes, won't pick up calls, won't even RING when you're getting a call in some cases, and has lousy signal strength. My husband's cheapie phone gets a perfect signal when my Treo only has one bar (we both have Verizon). And as another reviewer said, there's that weird thing with not being able to properly use call waiting.I am now on my THIRD replacement, and this one just crapped out on me.

It runs the familiar PalmOS operating system which is much easier to use than Windows (specially on the small screen), and features a higher screen resolution (320x320 in the 700p vs. 240x240 in this 700w running windows).The 700p runs PalmOS Garnet (5.4.9) sports Bluetooth v1.2, dual CDMA (800/1900Mhz) and EvDO on CDMA2000. Compatibility with Office files like Word, Excel and Powerpoint files is achieved using Documents-to-GO bundled software.The 700p supports MultiMediaCard, SD & SDIO memory cards, up to two gigabytes. Plus, the 700p&#65533;s digital camera sports 1280x1024 res. and does video recording 352 x 288. It also has automatic ligth balance.In short: avoid this 700w that gives you lower resolution and a more cumbersome OS and go with the Treo 700p running Palm OS, just released in mid-May 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Conception, Poor Implementation","review":"This phone is just a bad product.

I have installed no third party software to cause this problem.It's nearly impossible to pull this phone out of a holster without hitting one of the side buttons.The keys stick out too far. I'll remove it from its holder just to realize that while I've been carrying it around I've managed to hit the letter \\"P\\" about a hundred times.The 240x240 resolution on the screen precludes this device from every being able to be upgraded to Windows Mobile 6.0.

My daughter is a lot like me. She learns more by reading than in any other way. I know there was some issues that made her apprehensive but she skipped over them and I was fine with that. I want her to do it when she's ready.She's only 9 but is going through hormonal changes and moood swings. She's also started developing in some areas.Even though she's known about her body and sex since she was 4 years old, she knew there were things going on with her body that she didn't understand. I do not want to make anything a huge mystery or attach a stigma to it, so I choose to buy her books that will make her feel more at home with herself.All in all, I'm very happy with the book and it's subject matter. It's funny, light-hearted tone doesn't hurt either."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very informative and worth the buy.","review":"I wish I had this book before I started. I was the laughing stock of the school. But now I know, only because of this book. I think there ought to be be a lot more of this stuff out there.

I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information","review":"I bought this book for my 8 year old when our pediatrician told me she would likely start her period in a year or so. It had WAY too much information for a young girl. It discussed sex, gynecologist visits, and had very graphic drawings. I wouldn't want my daughter reading this until her teen-age years. In today's society many girls are starting their periods by age 9 or 10. I'm returning the book today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took too long to arrive","review":"The book was in fair condition but took over a month to arrive.

She knew the very basics, but nothing physiological. I came across startlingly inappropriate information for the suggested age range of this book. It was just too much info for children.I was looking for a description of how menstruation work, not that you can get pregnant from sperm on a finger! How do you work that into a conversation with a 9 year old who isn't old enough to stay home alone, let alone start thinking about sex or boys in that light yet? This book may work for some families, but I chose not to give it to my daughter. Not now and not when she is older."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL BOOK","review":"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS 5 YEARS OLD.

THIS BOOK WITH IT'S WONDERFULLY INFOMATIVE AND PLAIN LANGUAGE WAS JUST WHAT WE NEEDED. NOW THAT SHE IS 11 AND ON THE VERGE OF STARTING HER PERIOD, SHE ISN'T IN THE DARK ABOUT IT AND SHE SEEMS MUCH MORE CONFIDENT WHEN WE DISCUSS IT.I'M AM VERY GLAD THERE ARE BOOKS OF THIS TYPE ON THE MARKET FOR YOUNG GIRLS TODAY.

You'll also have to plug the slots made for the blade tilt. If you do all that, you may expose the saw to more dust and heat may build up. You can't hook up a Slopvac or dust collector to the DC001 so as to suck up dust and pull in cooler air to reduce heat buildup. I solved this issue by plugging all the vents and gaps and then building a box which fits snugly under the saw--the box has a hole that will accommodate tubing from my Slopvac (or a dust collector when I get one). Under these conditions, I get much less dust scattered around. you can make one cheaply from 1/2\\" plywood because you have a table saw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed","review":"The ad states it will fit all Delta contactors saws, which is not true.I own a Delta Platinum Edition 10\\" Contractor's Saw and it does not fit any of what Dleta calls Contactor Saw.

The recording is very good and with ample sonic space.I have heard it twice already, and allowed me to explore Brahms.Highly recomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ALBUM","review":"The song 'Sandy\\" is one of my all time favorites.

He gives a very detailed introduction to several hand-techniques (especially the \\"Moeller\\"-technique) and explains it in a very understandable and entertaining way.You will find a lot of additional information and tips.

This dvd has really forced me to consider many aspects of my playing without forcing me to \\"forget everything\\". I have watched it several times now and have learned things everytime. If you don't own this dvd, and you want to improve your drumming, don't hesitate to pick this one over most of the \\"hey, look what I can do\\" dvd's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jojo is the real deal","review":"Love this video. Jojo's technique is inspiring to watch. The thought \\"It can be done!\\" appeared in head many times while watching. His explanations are very clear. I think the leather pants really help :-PJojo's playing is also great. The streetbeats section is my favorite.The longer solo's are good too, but don't do much for me. I mean, I understand that the point is, \\"hey, look how I use my technique on the kit.\\" But I just found them a little boring. I was also hoping that he would do more of his drum and bass thing that he is so good at.However, if you are into solo's or can't get enough of Jojo, I'm sure you'll enjoy them. I'm just more of a song/band drummer, so the streetbeat section is more my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohh.... NOW I know how to hold a stick!","review":"Who would have thought that my technique was soooo bad after 15 years of live and studio drumming?But alas, I'm back to practicing 1/4 notes at 60bpm to ensure I'm swinging the sticks properly.Incredibly informative DVD, but very talky.IF you're not totally dedicated to learning the drums, this might not be for you as it's mostly JoJo talking to camera and swinging his sticks in slow motion.Don't buy it if you're looking for a performance DVD.Just buy it if you want lessons from the best.I bought the Thomas Lang DVD and it was like watching a magician.The Secret Weapons DVD is like a magician giving away his secrets.Basically this is a true legend of the instrument giving you the most detail he possibly can about efficiency, economy, and clean playing.Highly recommended for anyone taking their drumming seriously and wanting to be a standout player with no injuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all levels, certainly beginners...","review":"I am a novice drummer, but been playing other instruments on/off forever. I found his bottoms up review on how to hold the stick, how to strike the surface, how the various arm/wrist motions are to be done, very very useful. I take weekly lessons in which I don't have patience to do this stuff, so I bought this DVD so as to catch up on the basics on my own cheap time. I learned a ton just from side 1 of the DVD.... he teaches this stuff with nice slow-mo closeups so that a novice like me could actually replicate his moves and stroke sounds.Jojo--- excellent job and you've done a great service for drummers everywhere. Not a cheap DVD, but worth it... I'd say this DVD is the same as about 10 one hour private lessons from someone of Jojo's calibre... do you think you could get that for $39? Nah. So I am happy with my expenditure..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it .......","review":"Jojo Mayer has put together the most detailed video for hand technique. I've spent years asking questions during clinics and to various teachers, regarding variations in hand technique and this is the only video that has been able to answer them.It may not be good for newer drummers. The basics presented in this video are brief. I also found the level of description for the fundamentals may be above comprehension for a beginner.This video will provide me with years of hand techniques I can develop. I recommend it for advancing players and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ALL DRUMMERS!","review":"This stellar release from Jojo Mayer is the science and history of technique, broken down to its truest forms. Using the laws of physics, Jojo breaks down the mechanics behind the masters techniques. Jojo systematicaly breaks down ideas from technique legends George Stone, Billy Gladstone, Sandford Moeller, Buddy Rich, Joe Morello, Jimmy Chapin, and Freddie Gruber. This is the standard for great technique for all drummers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This video is absolutely brilliant - incredibly clear, informative and insightful, while managing at the same time to be charming and original. (The production quality is top-notch, too.) Note that these two DVDs address hand technique only - nothing other than that - but I'm very glad I spent the money on it; it's more than worth it. Mayer very clearly explains the German vs. French vs. Traditional grips and shows the incredible power of simple techniques vs. what you might be doing if you didn't know them. Five stars without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"JoJo Knows Teaching","review":"JoJo Mayer's \\"Secret Weapons\\" DVD is worth every penny. There is a few good instructional drum DVDs out there, and this ranks as one of the best. It is straight forward, easy to follow, and very common sense. Every drummer ought to study this DVD. There is no way you won't grab positive useful information from this, that you can begin to apply to your playing immediately. Appropriate for all levels, particularly intermediate and advanced. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure techniques","review":"Problem is that the techniques are crazy advanced. Definitely not a beginners, not even an intermediate dvd. Maybe not even advanced; probably few drummers will ever master these techniques.So it comes across more like a talent show.That said, these are cool techniques and I will practice them. But they will not be the bread and butter of my routine. For thatI defer to the much simpler (yet powerful) approach of the Tommy Igoe lifetime hands video.Time will tell whether these 'super techniques' provide any value to my playing... they may. But I am not going to let myself be intimidatedby their complexity in the meantime....*** edit **Okay, gave it another star (on second viewing). The development of the moeller technique is first rate...."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least 5 stars!","review":"Honestly, I don't understand how anyone could rate this DVD under 5 stars. It is that thorough, that helpful, and that good! Compare the DVD's price with the price of private drum lessons, and the DVD's price is more than worth it. The purpose of my review is to insist that this product is nothing less than 5 stars.The only thing Jojo Mayer could have done better with this DVD, is offer a full refund to unsatisfied customers. That would help with buyer confidence. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing.","review":"This DVD is chock full of useful information.

Splendid preformance and good sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase","review":"Without a doubt, this was by far the worst and most disappointing product I've ever had the displeasure of wasting money on. It looks nice and shiny butthe quality of this product is subpar. Like glitter on a turd. The TV is hard to turn on and turn off, the inputs are difficult to reach, the monitor makes noises when it isn't supposed to and that's if you can get this thing to work at all. In effect, all this thing is good for is a paper weight. How did this product ever get to market is beyond me. I would not be surprised if this company went bankrupt. I can't find support services anywhere, and they have no website so I guess that means I'm right. I had to learn the hard way. Next time, I'll invest in a monitor/tv from brand that has been around for awhile instead of these cheap knockoffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star - One year","review":"Died after one year - ABSOLUTELY no luck getting hold of Astar service for any help...

These work great! One is in my son's room and one is in my closet. They hold about 1 1/2 loads of laundry and maintain their shape whether they are packed or empty. Very easy to carry up and down the stairs fully loaded. Assembly takes about a second and have withstood the curiosity of my son pushing his over in his room."},{"rating":"2","title":"great hamper!","review":"You know I've actually spent the last 30 years using a black hamper, so it's a bit of a shock to the system (seriously!) that I'm now using a white one! This one is a lot heavier than my older one, and a little taller, but the good news is that it holds more clothes. Not that it matters in the least- I'm not the kind of person to wait until it's completely full to wash my clothes anyway. Not my style. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Love this laundry hamper! Great box shape! Two side by side fit perfectly in my closet! Sturdy, and nice looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy hamper","review":"I ordered two of these hampers, one for each of my kid's rooms. I love how sturdy these hampers are. While they are a little heavier than the mesh ones I had been using, the construction on these will go the distance. I like that the inside of the hamper is water-resistant. (It might be considered waterproof, but I don't remember for sure and I don't want to give false information.) I have put used towels in it, and I am not concerned about mold or mildew. Of course, I live in the high desert, so those two things are not normally present here. The hamper itself holds one load of laundry for my high-capacity front load washing machine. I do have the carry the full laundry basket downstairs and through the house, but it is not too cumbersome. And it is definitely light enough for my 4 year old to carry it back upstairs. I would recommend this hamper to anyone with kids or if he/she was looking for a good hamper. I even like the colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Enough for the Money","review":"These hampers are nice enough. I thought they would be larger than they were. My dog (50 lb lab mix) can still stick her nose into them if they get close to being full and pull clothes out. If they were 6 inches taller she would not be able to do this. In addition, they do bend and once they bend/get a crease they are always creased. When filled to the top, I can get the entire hamper into the wash easily, which is nice. The hampers look nice in my room and look more expensive than they are. Overall, a good product that I would probably buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this.","review":"I purchase three of Rubbermaid 4D06 Configurations 23-Inch Fold-able Laundry Hampers at the end of June, 2010. And in early September, one of them has the bottom stitching broken. We do laundry once a week and the basic moves are just lift up, hold it to the laundry room, put down, and after laundry, lift up, hold it back to bathroom, put down. I cannot believe the quality is so bad that it can't even last three months. I heard the hampers from IKEA are better and cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"I bought this for my baby's nursery. The interior is wipeable and the outside has a natural fiber look to it which is very nice.

It folds up conveniently to hide if it's empty and is still small enough to hide in the closet if I have company coming over (I have a tiny little apartment). It holds about 2 1/2 loads of laundry in it and when I carry it by the handles, it doesn't buckle or move around.Haven't had it in the bathroom - no idea how it reacts to moisture.I would recommend it for anyone looking for a hamper.Update April 2012: Still using it, no odors, no tears, still holds its original shape. I would still recommend this for anyone looking for a hamper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It's a decently attractive piece.

But it's an outstanding value for what you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and large capacity","review":"The hamper is perfect!

It fits well in the corner and is very tough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"These fit perfectly under my vanity in the bathroom. They were easy to assemble but are not the most stable. I knew that purchasing them that a foldable laundry basket wouldn't be as strong as a non-foldable one.

I just wish they had darker colors bc I am hoping in time these don't get too dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"These Rubbermaid Hampers are awesome. They are really worth the money. My life is so much easier now that everything is sorted immediately. They are nicely lined on the inside, so they are easy to clean. They hold the perfect amount of laundry so you can carry one up and down the stairs without difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy and Worth the Wait","review":"These foldable hampers are an excellent buy and I only wonder where they have been all of my life. After reading the reviews I knew this would be perfect and I actually got on the waitlist as they were out of stock when I wanted them.I am a HUGE germaphobe so I love that fact that once I do laundry I can Lysol and Febreze the hampers. Also, I love the convenience of being able to fold them and take them when I travel (by car). Most importantly, These hampers hold A LOT of close. I purchased four but only routinely use two (one for whites and the other for colors) and can easily go up to 1 1/2 week using the two.I cannot imagine why anyone would not like these. Plus, the natural fabric material is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I had been looking for a laundry \\"system\\" for a while and just couldn't find anything that met the needs of the laundry factory that I run (one husband, age 32, and three kids: 10-year-old boy, 6-year-old boy, baby girl). I found these on Amazon in my \\"gold box\\" on sale. The dimensions were listed so I measured and ordered four of them. I gotta tell you-- I haven't sorted laundry since! These laundry hampers are neutral in color and are easy to carry. They each hold about a load-and-a-half of laundry-- two loads if you smash stuff down. I set them in a row on the landing outside of all the bedrooms and the husband and the kids simply put their laundry in the correct hamper. We love them. I wish the insides came out for laundering, but we just spray them down with cleaner and wipe them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but difficult to use","review":"I'm surprised by the positive reviews of this hamper. Sure, it looks nice and seems fairly durable. But it takes two hands to carry and the edges of the hand-holds are sharp, making them press deeply into your palms with heavy loads. This is a stay-put hamper that blends into a laundry room. It is not one to be carried from your apartment or dorm. This hamper is a total sacrifice of function for form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable cost, well made, looks good, compact/storable","review":"This hamper exceeded my expectations. It looks and feels a lot nicer than I expected. It assembles easily and can fold up flat for storage when needed.

The handles make it easy to carry to and from the laundry room in the basement.If you're looking for a long lasting hamper, this one is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-Looking basket","review":"I bought this basket because I don't do my laundry too often. This basket holds A LOT. I can get away with doing my laundry less than once a week. The outside of the basket is cloth, and the inside is thin parachute type of material. I'm happy with it. The only concern I have is if you wait until it gets full, it can get heavy, and I'm not sure how sturdy the bottom is and how long it will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great hamper!","review":"This is a great laundry hamper, especially if you have cats who like to scratch things (this is pretty resistant)!

These are better than I even expected. Great price, appearance, and for a pop up very sturdy. Quick delivery. Very Happy! Ordering 2 more :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sturdy","review":"You could probably body slam this thing, throw it off the balcony, recover it, body slam it again, and it would probably still be very useful. The quantity it can hold is exactly the size I needed. If I had a necessity to keep whites and colored clothes separate, I'd probably buy a second one, but no need when it all fits in one. It can hold quite a bit of weight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hampers","review":"Haven't had these very long but I would say for the price they seem to be quite durable and easy to carry. I've purchased two and will be getting two more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesthetic and Functional","review":"I've had this hamper for five months and its been an all-time great value purchase.

However, out of the two, one was missing a critical inset, that which creates a sturdy bottom.

Without getting wet or moist directly, the outside got very moldy. Difficult to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design flaw","review":"I left laundry from the wash cycle in this overnight in the back of my car trunk. The walls of the hamper became as limp as a wet noodle and never regained their form. It feels like the structure of this thing comes from cardboard. The manufacturer cut corners to save money and used a paper product for support when we all know once paper gets wet it's never the same again. The laundry hamper may as well be a bag because the walls that used to maintain its form are now soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the","review":"I have 4 of these and was considering another. They are extremely useful. BUT When I bought these in August 07 They were $11.99 each. I found this to be a reasonable price and a good value. $79.99 is absurd. Is this a typo or a multi-pack?? I find no reference to more than one being sold so it is either a major typo or highway robbery. I certainly hope it is the former and will be corrected soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"For how much I paid I wasn't expecting much. I ordered it mostly because it was cheap and had a lining. It is nicer than I thought it would be, the sides are still just like a cardboard insert but I wasn't expecting much else. It works great for my kids' room and has so far held up from my daughter trying to ride it around the house. When she finally breaks it I would probably buy this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Nice & Gets the Job Done","review":"I purchased two of these to keep in my laundry room. I wish that they were a little taller, but otherwise I really like them. The inside lining is bluer than I thought it would be, but it has a nice look to it, and I love that that inside material can be cleaned out. This would also work well in a closet or a bedroom because of the neutral clean and neat look to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hampers","review":"Bought 2 of these hampers to separate colors and whites - they are quite handy and can hold quite a bit of clothes but at the same time don't take up too much room. I've had them for over a year now and they are holding up very well and look like new still. I like the lining of it, doesn't seem to pick up any dirt and don't catch any odors either."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice price and space saver","review":"i got this for 11.99 on Friday sale .

It's the perfect size for our daughter's laundry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice","review":"I just go this hamper and I really like it. Size wise I feel it's just about perfect!

This edition is a scanned OCR of the original work. Obviously there was no human participation in the production process because the type is riddled with format errors, Greek characters that are not recognized, footnotes out of place, page and chapter heading in the middle of sentences, etc. In all this book is virtually unusable. The table of contents is nothing but a mass of type that cannot be deciphered without looking at the scanned original.

Although the paper can have hit or miss stories you have the option of bailing a few sentences in and turning the page. With the video you seemed to be held captive, you want to fast forward through a bad skit but you hope it may become funny any second now. Some of the skits were like a bad car accident, you know you shouldn't look....but you still do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous.","review":"This movie is absolutely terrible.

Most pieces are spot on, to the point, and hilarious. They dive deep, attack the road less traveled and use impeccable wit. This film cannot be anything further than that. Most bits typically run well after the novelty has worn off, such as the racist film gags or the pop star spots. The humor is well under the bar the weekly paper sets and attacks issues more commonly found on sketch comedy shows instead of a usual smarter, more biting social commentary. It was not only disappointing, but it was just a tremendously bad movie. It has train wreck appeal, but if you are an avid Onion reader, avoid this movie like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Area Man Disappointed","review":"As a more thorough review has already been posted here, I'll keep it brief when I say that I was fully disappointed by this film. I'm a huge fan of the Onion newspaper and the Onion online, especially when I rushed out to rent this movie the first day it was available (good thing I didn't buy it). The trailer that has been circulating the internet for some time is hilarious, but captures the only good scenes from the entire feature. Most segments are long, redundant, and unfunny, and although they are tied together in the end, the movie is missing the charm that I have come to expect from the Onion's caliber of work. Overall, rent this DVD if you have to, but it's something that should remain on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"This onion left a bad taste in my mouth","review":"Good try, but this one totally misses the mark. The humor is offensive...not funny. The acting is horrendous. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my family members or friends. They'd think I was warped...no sense of humor...just warped.

However, I can say with no metaphor or exaggeration that I found this movie nausea-inducing! Thank goodness my friends and I consumed copious amounts of weed while watching it or my unsoothed stomach may have attempted emptying itself in a misguided attempt to rid my body of its influence.Its fundamental problem is a nasty case of Self-Satirizing Syndrome. The attempts to parody American culture and the news industry completely backfire, coming off as a childish imitation of biting satire (isn't that what all the cool kids are doing? What about brain lesions, is that how all the cool kids are getting injured now?). The intelligence level of this movie tragically does not rise above its subject matter. There are a few good performances here (Len Cariou, Mousie Garner), and a handful of legitimately funny sketches, but overall I say NOT WORTH IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny....","review":"I am very surprised by the mostly poor reviews this movie is getting. I had never heard of it until I went to my friends' house last night and watched it. The 3 of us were laughing out loud almost from beginning to end. The skits are hilarious. And the movie is basically a highly scathing indictment of idiotic American culture and vapid tabloid \\"journalism.\\" Anyhow, don't believe the poor reviews on here. This movie is definitely worth owning. Yes, some of the humor is a bit obvious at times, but that doesn't make it any less funny.

It's worth renting if you like any of their other stuff, but nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Onion Movie","review":"Very funny. At times I cringed at certain segments I have to admit.

Wagner: Der Fliegende Hollander is a recording under direction of Pinchas Steinberg who leads the ORF Symphony Orchestra on this HNH International recording from 1992. The sound quality is good but not as good as Harmonia Mundi or Deutsche Grammophon. The booklet is a bit sparse being for a Wagner Opera. It contains no photograhps of the perfomers. It contains a short biography of Wagner and then follows a synopsis of the Opera itself. It ends with short biographies of the conductor, orchestra and performers. All in all a very good recording but could have been better. I also think that the pace is a bit fast and I prefer Karajan to Steinberg. Recommended. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful...with too few highlights","review":"I love 2 Banks of 4. Maybe that made the disappointment with this album all the stronger. It's simply awful. 2 Banks of 4 have produced some masterpieces in Gallagher's time since Galliano, and this is a blight on that record.

This DVD just didn't work enough of my problem areas (butt, hips, and inner thighs). It was heavy on quad work-lots of reverse lunges which lasted for almost half the workout. My quads tend to build up easily so I really didn't care for this. Also, this is an exercise I can get from just about any workout for the lower body.

The book collects hundreds of pieces, all from the D series. Most of the book is made up of Amano's ink sketches, but there are plenty of his lush paintings included. The book collects all of Amano's D work, so it spans several vears showing the evolution of his style. My one complaint is the size of the book. It's really a very thick book, but is about the size of a standard trade paperback book making it hard to open wide enough to see the true beauty of the work inside without damaging the spine. Everything else about the book is truly astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Else To Consider...","review":"This is a good quality hose and it will replace the worn out hose that came with your shop vac but there is something else to consider.

We use it most commonly with an older Sears large wet/dry shop vac. It is a far more practical hose than those provided with most vacuums; it has a far better combination of flexibility, length and resistance to crush (including under vacuum load) than the other OEM or replacement hoses available from Sears and several other manufactures. Be aware though that it has a smaller hose diameter than typical 2-1/2 vac hoses and that it does not come with an adapter to directly fit the female intake ports on 2-1/2\\" hose vacuums. You will probably need at least a male to male adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hose","review":"I'm very pleased with this sturdy 2\\"OD x 1 3/8\\"ID hose. 12' is a good length and keeps the noise of the vac away. It is crush and collapse proof but that also means that it is a little stiff when attaching to power tools. 2 1/4\\" end fits fine into shop vacs and the rotating cuff end is 1 1/2\\" ID and 1 3/4\\" OD and slightly elastic. I plan to use 1 1/2\\" PVC and brass drain parts for custom connections to my tools. The included claw and long nozzle are well made and I just might have to buy the floor attachment, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hose for dust collection","review":"I have used this as a replacement for the hose on my Fein vacuum for the last 5 years. Huge improvement. If your vac has enough guts, this hose has plenty of diameter, but is MUCH easier to work with.The black end fits perfectly on the Fein vac. The grey end is flexible plastic that works with just about everything. It slips right over the outside of a typical 1.25\\" vacuum hose wand. I use this for dust collection with a wide range of tools. It works better on some Festool tools than the Festool hose does. The Fein step adaptor is useful for some tools:Fein 921072K13 Step Adaptor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottleneck to your Shop Vac...if it even fits","review":"I bought this for an accessory to my Craftsman Shop Vac because I have had trouble with the hoses cracking and also because I wanted the extra reach. I thought that the swivel nozzle was a great idea to prevent distress on the hose which causes cracking after time. The first problem was that although it fits the 2 1/4\\" OD vaccuum outlet, the nozzle end is smaller, and doesn't fit my 2 1/4\\" wands. I had to go to a different seller and pay $8 + $5 shipping for the correct end, which doesn't have the swivel. Therefore it keeps coming off when I am vaccuuming. Beside that there is a ridge inside the adapter that cuts the size down to little more than an inch, so I had to constantly disconnect the wands to clear the debris out of the nozzle. I could have bought 2 craftman hoses for what I spent on this hose, and it is completely impractical for picking up anything with any size to it. The only good thing is that it is very sturdy and long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...

The text is filled with a multitude of helpful information and easy to follow applications. Of note are the historical information concerning various subjects like the birth of the Internet. Additionally, the exercises aid students in improving their skills as researchers. My students have raved about the text and have spread to word to other students that they must take the capstone course, partially because of the way the text allows for students to rethink what research is all about. I even have graduates who refer to chapters in the book when they call to talk to me about research opportunities. Moreover, the teacher's manual allows me to be creative and gauge how well students are progressing. I would find it hard to locate another textbook like this one.

The buzzword-speak is rife through this book, and it really hinders learning when you have to stop and think, 'Now what is that supposed to mean?'. I haven't learned much, and the only reason I don't give this 1 star is I got it for < $1 from amazon used. It had 3 1/2 stars when I bought it, and my new rule is not to shell out for anything less than 4 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much and Confusing","review":"I bought this book to get understanding of POJOs. To see how they are much simpler to use than EJB, if they really are!!But this book tries to pack the whole project into it, which makes it hard to remember things after few chapters. It also tries to explain technologies (like Spring and Tapestry) in few pages, omitting the explanations where required. My opinion is, it requires pre-understanding of these technologies before you will find reading this book useful.Also, I was not convinced with writing style of author. Author tries to use complex words where they can be avoided and twisted sentences where same thing can be explained in plain English statements.Overall, I guess author has in-depth knowledge but he lacks the ability to express the knowledge in simple words"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This is a great book.

Written in a style that smacks of listening to Dave talk, it makes for some strange reading, but once you get used to his language style, it makes perfect sense. There's a portion devoted to the complications with Eddie Van Halen, but the book doesn't dwell too long on this subject and spares the reader of too much mudslinging. The rest is the entertaining exploits of Dave and his friends and crew members getting in all kinds of debauchery and shenanigans. As for my tastes, I would have liked a bit more insight to certain songs and the songwriting process that Dave and his bandmates went through. Nevertheless its a good read and shows the reader that there is more than meets the eye when you think of David Lee Roth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary stories from rock's ultimate showman","review":"No band captured the spirit of the wild lifestyle of rock n' roll better than Van Halen, and David Lee Roth was the ringmaster of it all. The self-proclaimed \\"Toastmaster of the Immoral Majority\\" relives all those crazy years while in Van Halen, as well as the years before and after it, and tells it like only he can. Diamond Dave has always moved & talked 3 times faster than anyone else, and this book is a testament to his philosophy on life - live every day to the fullest and make it fun! I have already read it 3 times, and look forward to the 4th! I hope Dave takes time out of his \\"no rear-view\\" life and writes another great book.

There isn't one paragraph in the entire book which would have earned a passing grade in any school (any level). Mr. Roth has a great story to tell but lacks the necessary skills to relay it to his reader. From the first passages, he rambles on and on, jumping from topic to topic, unable to maintain a chronological order from one paragraph to the next. There are people who make their living assisting those who have a story to tell by writing it for them. Mr. Roth should have enlisted the aid of a skilled writer to put his thoughts and experiences in a readable format for mass consumption by both Van Halen fans and those who enjoy reading biographies. Instead, he attempted to chronicle his journeys by himself--a disappointment to all who are brave (or foolish) enough to plow through the muddled confusion of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for the inside scoop? It's not here","review":"Being a major fan of DLR (\\"Eat 'Em & Smile\\" still blows away anything VH has released since \\"1984\\") and classic VH, I looked forward to reading Dave's book. Talk about a major disappointment. If you're looking for interesting stories involving Dave and the rest of VH or the DLR band, they're not here; I guess there just weren't any worthwhile times involving these people worth recounting (or Dave's pulling his punches.) Want information regarding anything recorded between VHII and 1984? It's also conspicuously absent. Where's the substance? We get more information on Dave's Vegas band (who really cares?) than VH and the DLR band combined. If that's what you're into, great. If not, \\"Forget about it, Dave.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"For whats its worth","review":"For what its worth, Roth presents his side of the story and its presented well.

He is the quintisential front-man in rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Rock-N-Roll Story!","review":"I read the book and enjoyed it immensely. You must respect David Lee Roth in that he could have really dished some dirt on his former band members but refrained from doing so. Since the break-up of the original Van Halen, I have read so many negative comments from the Van Halen camp about Roth that it is sickening. I think Diamond Dave showed us who has some class and who does not. Regardless of what the critics, or anyone else for that matter, have to say about the book, if you are a classic Van Halen fan, it was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love with David all over again.","review":"I discovered David Lee Roth as a young teen. I began to search for anything Dave/Van Halen related. Soon I amassed over 2000 pictures and articles. And ya know what, I learned a lot more in this book, plus it brought back a lot of memories. David Lee raised me and has satiated my spirit. I realized how similar we are and how to apply some of my traits to be a better entertainer. Wouldn't you know he wrote this with Rollins.

You bet I wanted to read it... Being a fan of Get in the Van by Henry Rollins (documenting his life on the road with Black Flag), I figured this would be another series of road rash stories from one of the biggest stars of the 80s. Wouldn't you know I was both right and wrong? Right about great road stories, but about the wrong roads. The material about life on the road with Van Halen completely pales in comparison with DLR's experiences and travels while away from the band. Hearing his mountain climbing and Amazon river boat tales, you realize there's FAR more to this man than the music. He does have a brain and shows more insight into life than you might expect from a \\"rock star.\\" A great and natural read that reminds one of Lenny Bruce and the aforementioned Rollins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening, but no tell-all.","review":"Hard core VH fans may be dissapointed but Roth tells it like it is, at least from his perspective. Good to hear the other side of the story of the VH-1 Awards fiasco.

This seller is based in the UK so the DVD format 2 so I suspect this is the problem since all of my other DVDs read as a format 1.

A friend from the culinary school nearby said it might be because there is a lot more whole wheat in it (a good thing for the body, not as good in the bread maker). As noted in another review, baking it in the oven really did make a better and higher loaf.3) Butter is best - tried oil and butter and butter is definitely better.4) A little more salt - I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt and that seemed to help with the rise as well.It's a great backup for when you're out of bread flour or yeast but I still think the best bread machine recipe from allrecipes.com (subbing in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup whole wheat) makes for the most delicious and closest to store bought I've seen thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT like!!!!","review":"I have previously used the Hodgson 9-grain, and the White, and those were/are fine.

While marketed as a whole-grain product, it is not entirely a whole-grain product. However, it is still a great product. We (me, my husband and my four kids) generally make the bread sticks and then dip in extra virgin olive oil seasoned with oregano, basil, and a pinch of salt. We occasionally sprinkle with cinnamon and a little brown sugar.Because of its whole-grain content, it does have a slightly heavier and grainier texture which IMO adds to the experience, but initially it may take some getting used to if you are not accustomed to whole-grain products.When I first purchased this product I was set up on a 3 month delivery (12 boxes every three months).

It's almost as dense as a low gluten bread (like the Barley mix), which I was not expecting with this one. Their Caraway Rye mix has the same protein content, but rises much better than this one.

Once I got up to speed however, this book was hard to put down. Kate is a great protagonist.

However, I will be returning it. Woodcraft's website says this fits 2-1/2\\" shop vac hoses. Wrong. A standard 2-1/2\\" vacuum hose is too small to fit over the connector and too large to fit inside it. In fact, they are similar diameters. ONly the fact that the cyclone's connectors are a thicker plastic than the vacuum hose, make them somewhat different diameters both inside and out. I do not want to take time to force fit or search out adapters to make the connections work. It is also true the lid fits loosely on 5-gallon buckets and you would also need to rig a way to strengthen the fit so dust did not escape and so the lid did not fall off when hoses are moved or the bucket bumped. A total dud in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This thing works great. I had seen some complaints that the hoses did not fit snugly, but mine are tight and don't need any tape, etc. The only difficulty I have had, is that the hoses make the bucket a bit top heavy so it is easily tipped over, but watching how you set it up solves that quickly. On another note, I first used a bucket from Lowes. Although it is a good bucket, the handle did not lock down the lid. The HD bucket handle is of a slightly different design and locks this down easily. Nothing really wrong with either bucket handle, one just fits this devise better than the other. This is money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Openings are 2 1/4 NOT 2 1/2","review":"I bought this, along with two 2 1/2 - 1 1/4 reducers that Amazon suggested I purchase so I could use this with my shop-vac that uses 1 1/4 hoses. Well, the openings on the unit are not 2 1/2 inches but 2 1/4, rendering the couplers useless. Thanks Amazon for wasting my time. I could have made this at home out of plywood and pvc for next to nothing. It is all going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but what a hassle","review":"I read in WOOD magazine that applying some weatherstripping helps to keep the lid on the bucket when in use. It really doesn't do much, esp. when you factor in the big, relatively inflexible shop vac hose, too. So while this separator does in fact, separate the heavy chips from the dust, it's quite a hassle to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look before you buy.","review":"i purchased on of these separators, the mini, and found an immediate problems.

I would consider the larger adapter made for the fifty five gallon metal trash can. If not, you will be making a lot of adjustments and trying to find a way to seal the lid so that this will work. The manufacturer should re-mold this product to match the six gallon metal trash can to be usable.Before you buy this product, take a look at local sources for a metal trash can that will fit a twelve inch diameter lid.I hope this review is useful to those who really want a turnkey product without a lot of engineering to make work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emphatic, opinionated and sharply resonating discourse","review":"Compiled, edited, and with an informative introduction by John Wyse Jackson, At War is an impressive and much appreciated collection of the columns of Brian O'Nolan (1911-1966) which were originally penned for \\"The Irish Times\\" during the war years of 1940 to 1945 under the pseudonym of Flann O'Brien. An emphatic, opinionated and sharply resonating discourse that simply does not back off or back down, At War is a stirring account of real problems in troubled times and of one man's determination to speak out and be heard.

My only disappointment, and the reason for only 4 stars, is the editing job. I have found several glaring errors throughout my copy of the book.

As much of a pleasure to see now as it was when I originally saw it in the theater.While not in the same class as Chinatown, I also recently saw \\"Bodyheat\\" with Kathleen Turner. Turner's beauty and the classic noir nature of this film make it ageless.Unfortunately \\"Crimes of Passion\\" didn't age well for me. I found that the film felt dated and sexist in the way Turner's character is portrayed. Some people who have reviewed the film here found the film's \\"analysis\\" of relationships fascinating. I found it depressing and naive. The idea that a prostitute is going to fall in love with a client because of he has passionate sex with her is sophmoric.I wanted to rent this film, but I couldn't find it at the local Blockbuster. After buying it, I've put in the box for the used bookstore (which also sells used DVDs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crimes of Passion (Unrated)","review":"I was very pleased that Anchor Bay decided to release Crimes of Passion in its unrated version, the one that didn't make it into the theaters. This way, you don't have the constant frame dropping, which was evident on the R rated version. This way, the picture is intact, the way director Ken Russell envisioned it from the start, not the butchered R version that I don't recommend. They say sex sells and they are probably right, as all types can be found in this perverse movie. It's not the first time Kathleen Turner has shown off her \\"Body Heat\\" and Anthony Perkins proves that he's really typecast as a \\"Psycho.\\" I also love Rick Wakeman's score, which is a take off on Dvorak's New World Symphony, as the movie was originally made for New World Pictures - the company never got the in-joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought this movie because I like Kathleen Turner. Wow, she's got to be embarrassed looking back on this clunker. Did some high school senior write and direct this thing? It's clumsy, has no real storyline, and it's not even erotic. The acting is mediocre, too, by today's standards. About a half hour into the movie I got the idea that it was not going to get any better, and I had to force myself to watch it to the end. At least the video was crisp, which brings me to another point. Somebody goes to the trouble to clean up this piece of crap, yet there are good movies out there (All of Me, Roxanne, Cabaret, Another Woman, to name a few off the top of my head) that deserve remastering, yet are not.

The real hero of this film however, is its brilliant but twisted director: Ken Russell who delivers a mix of artistic and soft core porn elements to the viewer. It would be a good idea to be/ or get familiar with Russell's work before viewing this film.

The author, who was not a submariner, was ordered to join the crew of a U-Boat and to bring back photographs for propaganda purposes. Very soon he became appalled by what he saw and, using his unlimited stocks of film, began to photograph everything around him. Eventually he secreted away over 5,000 photographs until the war was over.More than 200 of those photographs are reproduced here as Buchheim takes us on a journey that is no joy-ride. Instead it is a blow by blow account of the lives of men inside their tin coffins who's only real orders were to kill or be killed.

This movie is packed with familiar character actors (Elliott Gould, Richard Roundtree, Shannon Tweed, Allen Garfield, Michael J. Pollard and Henry Gibson, just to name a few) and relies on strong storyline and performances instead of gore. Allen Garfield's portrayal of a Satanic Serial Killer is worthy of an Oscar.

I have mixed opinions about this movie. First off, the film itself is not that bad. The actors are good except for Derek Rydall and his girlfriend. This is the kind of movie that you watch when you really haven't got anything better to do.My biggest complaint about this film is in its portrayal of Satanism. As anyone who has knowledge of the subject knows this is NOT what Satanists do. With that said, Allen Garfield's ritual chamber is nice (love the goat head bell) and I also noticed that his text during the ritual (\\"I invoke thee from thy resting place...\\") is taken from the fabled \\"Necronomicon\\" book.As a Satanist, I found this movie laughable. Watch it, but don't take it seriously. If you want to waste time, see this movie.

Readers don't know if the algorithms have the potential to meet the various requirements of EC, i.e., residue error, convergence rate, complexity, numerical stability.

The coupler is professional grade just like the hose, but you need to remember that to unscrew the coupler, you must turn it clockwise since vacuum hose is a left hand thread like propane tanks.The assembly is airtight and works well with no water drips along the way. A 24 foot hose with a floor nosle provides the reach to get anywhere in the room without moving the waterlogged vac unit.Even exposed to UV (outdoors) this hose has held up over the years while other factory hoses have disentegrated into hoseparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE HOSE, WHAT DOES IT FIT?","review":"I recently received the kit with three different hose adapters, two tools (crevice and claw) and 12 feet of hose. There was indication in the write up that it would work on a craftsman vac. None of the adapters fit the vac. Only the crevice tool fit the Mr nozzle hose coupling. After much sanding and grinding on the claw tool I removed three plastic rings and got somewhat of a fit. I managed to cut the craftsman vac insert down and duct taped it to one of the adapters to get it to hook up to the vac. The hose is not all that flexible and holds a memory of the original packaging winding.

It had the handle coming out of the heater at 90 degrees and had no guard to keep your hand from sliding down to the heater. I couldn't find it (I think a friend borrowed it and never returned it), so I bought this unit. I use it to extend the season for my scooter riding. The scooter pretty much wants to have a 75 degree or hotter day in order to start. I have found that by using the heater, I can get the scooter to start as cold as 50 degrees. I really like the low profile of the handle, and especially the guard to keep my hand from sliding onto the heating element like it used to with the old model. I plan on using this on my car if the weather gets to cold here in the northeast. Definitely a good buy if you need this sort of heater (It is in fact a good heater to keep metal pipes from freezing as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnetic Heater","review":"It works but is very weak.

It works great for for the size and wattage. The magnet is strong enough to hold to the oil pan and the handle provides enough leverage to take it off, in fact, you can just pull on the cord and it will slid off so you dont have to get down on the ground when it really cold. That said, you do need to get on the ground to put it on. I am using it on a Nissan Altima and this week it got down to -20F and the engine turned over quickly and started fine. It wont get the engine to be warm to the touch at that temperature, but it will keep the oil warm enough let the engine turn over without straining.When it warms up enough for me want to stay on the ground for more than 15 seconds I will permanently attach it with metal strapping.Good buy, easy to use, works well for power usage.Would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I have this unit for a couple of days, got it to warm up my Branson Tractor had the unit plugged in for 3 or so hours the unit was hot but the oil pan was cold. dont waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job well","review":"Used on a small tractor.

Here's the breakdown - 17 are almost new (logos), 6 are OK, and 13 are too worn for me to put in play. Half are red Big Berthas, half blue.

Really, I didn't know what to think since noone I knew had seen it, neither had I seen any reviews written anywhere, and it didn't stay in the theater long here. So I rented, and watched it. It seemed like forever while I was watching it. All I am asking is why waste GREAT talent (Freddie Prinze, Jr., Julia Stiles) on such a dull movie. Don't get me wrong, their acting was great (except for Selma Blair playing a porn star), but the plot was totally predictable. When the credits rolled, I understood why noone reviewed this nor saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry But I Actually Liked This Movie","review":"It was set out to be aimed at 13 year old girls but somehow it got a wider audience. Most teen movies take place when the stars are in high school but this taked place when they are in college. This movie shows that not all relationships are fairy tales. The theme is giving first love a second chance and while it does give audiences a dose of reality it does seem to give a little too much information sometimes. Julia Stiles is smart in her career choice because while she does movies aimed at teens her films are somehow more serious but at the same time fun. This film deals with heavy issues but it doesn't let you know that it's getting you to think about certain things like teen pregnancy, drug overdose....and so on and so forth. If you are a fan of Julia Stiles or Freddie Prinze, Jr. then I recommend this movie. It's not your typical run-of-the-mill teen flick. But beware guys, this is a chick flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie that's down to earth","review":"this is a nice movie about first falling in love.Freddie Prinze and Julia Styles meet at a bar and fall in love. you go with them through out their relationship and you watch them grow and learn.a nice movie with a good cast. the cast includes Austin Kutcher, Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions), Shawn Hatosy (The Facutly), Rosario Dawson, Zak Orth and Henry Winkler.i enjoyed this movie every much because it's a feel good movie about first falling in love. it's also more down to earth, more real life than some other cheesey love movies. but this movie just doesn't deal with love, it deals with friendships and growing in life as a person. Shawn Hatosy is freaking awsome in this movie. i also like Monk. just a very feel good movie.this movie also happens to have my favorite song of all time, Al Green's Let Stay Together. Not only does this song come out in Down to You, but Julia Styles also dances to the song.a very nice movie.i liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"I rented this movie when I was home with the flu. I was bored and wanted something to watch. But even though I was bored and would've watched about anything I did'nt even watch the whole movie. It was that bad. It's a really typical romance movie and you know what will happen all the time. The actors are'nt very very bad but they can't make this movie interesting. If you like hollywood romance movies maybe you'll like this. Otherwise DON\`T buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Julia Stiles was awesome in 10 Things I Hate About and that's when I started to like her a lot. When this movie came out I really wanted to see it and ended up renting it. Good thing I did because I usually just buy movies w/out watching them first. This movie was very disappointing. There was not a real plot and the movie moved on very slowly, I was dieing for it to end! The way they met was dumb and I didn't even want them to be together. The charactors lacked human abilities such as conversation or good intelligant conversations. My advice is to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre movie at best","review":"This movie was horrible! I admit that I am a typical Hollywood fan and am not above watching light, teen, romantic comedies (eg-Drive me Crazy, 10 Things I Hate About You). I loved Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You, but her character in \\"Down to You\\" was absolutely pathetic. This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only funny part was when Freddie Prinze Jr's character drank the shampoo, and that was supposed to be a 'tragic' part of the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone- save someone with absolutely no theatrical standards. If I had been watching this in the theatre, I would have walked out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth renting...","review":"I wasn't forced into seeing this movie while it was in the theater, I actually went willingly. I can't decide if that or the actual watching of the movie was more painful... I hated this movie. It was boring, unfunny, and immature. I thought the acting was second-rate(at best) and the plot could have used a LOT of help. But overall the most annoying thing about the whole affair was how utterly unrealistic the whole thing was. For one, they have unprotected sex about 300 times! Did she really think that she could do that WITHOUT getting pregnant? Give me a break. And who drinks a bottle of shampoo to get over a lost love? That's not romantic, that's just plain sick. In short, if you want to watch a good romantic comedy with Freddie Prinze Jr in it, rent She's All That. If you want to see Julia Stiles, rent 10 things I Hate About You. But don't waste your time or money on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most can relate to this one","review":"When you see Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles as the main characters you probably think its another movie about college wackiness. This isn't that type of movie, its a bit more serious and realistic. The gist of the plot is a guy and girl meet in college, end up falling in love, and throughout it all different issues such as pregnancy, cheating, etc. are disccussed. Overall its a nice romantic movie with bits of comedy here and there, and the acting was pretty decent. A definate for fans of Julia Stiles and Freddie Prinze Jr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with down to you","review":"This movie focused totally on sex. I really feel that in a society where STDs and prgenancy out of wedlock are common this movie was unrealistic because the characters had no real consequences for their actions. This sends a bad message to teens, especially sense the movie was advertised as being geared towards teens and seemed particulary clean and sweet in previews. I like a love scene or two but really, come on. \\"She rubbed my stomach when she wanted some in the moring.\\" Where are we going with this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"Overall I would say this movie is a waste of film. The unoriginal, unentertaining plot was only outdone by the level of poor acting. I actually thought Julia Stiles was a really good actress before viewing this movie. I already knew Fredie Prinze was a bad actor. Anyway, I would not recomend this movie to be viewed by anyone. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Story","review":"I also was of the impression that this film would be just another teen movie. I was completely taken aback by the superb level of acting by both Julia Stiles and Freddie Prinze Jr. I am not usually a fan of romance movies because they are almost all exactly the same. This film possesses something that sets it apart from every other julia roberts/richard gere sappy love story. It was a very entertaining piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite dissapointing","review":"With so many good acters in this film you would think this would be a good film.Its a rubbish love story.It had a few good songs and thats why i havwe giving this film 2 stars.This movie is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"if i could give it no stars, i would.","review":"ok, i was reading the other reviews (most GOOD) and I was thinking :Are these people out of their minds! \\" This is honestly the WORST movie I have ever seen! The story makes no sense, the acting is horrible, and it is dragged out for WAY too long of a time! I would not reccomend this to anyone, considering the funniest moment of this \\"romantic-comedy\\" as when someone told an 11-year old Julia Stiles she \\"kissed like a fish\\" and followed by throwing a basketball at her. This moie is just too ridiculous for words. If you don't believe me, attempt to watch it and find out for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't See It!","review":"You can't say I don't like this movie because I'm to old to get it because I'm 17 and I still hated it. The characters and situations were so unrealistic and I was embarrassed for the actors that they had to deliver awful lines. I didn't connect with the two leads at all. I enjoyed Julia Stiles performance in 10 Things I Hate About You and I like Freddie Prinze Jr., so I thought I would like this movie but it was so dissappointing. Just trust me, don't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"I suppose I could describe this movie as thought-provoking, because all my thoughts were permeated with this movie for days. It's just... so incredibly bad. Don't watch it. It just made me feel sick. It makes me feel sick now just thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"Ok, I didn't like this movie at all. I watched it with high expectations, expecting a light, funny, happy romantic comedy. However, with all the narration I kind of lost interest. When it was over, quite honestly, I was like, \\"Was there a point?\\" Despite all the main characters' struggles, it seems like nothing dramatic or exciting happens. Its just kind of a story of the ups and downs of a troubled relationship, which is definately nothing worth making a movie about! There was simply nothing that made \\"Down to You\\" stand out from any other romantic comedy in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"I wanted to see another movie with my friend but couldn't so i suggested this one. I had seen maybe one commercial and thought it might be good, but i didn't know anything about it. About halfway through i wanted to cry. Selma Blair, Henry Winkler and the 'Jim Morrison' guy were refreshing, but other than that, it was painful to watch. The plot would suddenly jump periods of time for no reason. Freddie Prinze was awful. There was absolutely no reason to care what happened. The story was extremely detached and I would have left in a second if i had a ride home. Please, never see this movie unless you have an escape route already mapped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just another Freddie Flick","review":"This movie is not worth renting, buying, or seeing. It's just another teen Freddie Flick where guy meets girl and they fall in love. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Freddie Prinze Jr. is in it. It's so similar to \\"She's All That\\" and all his other teen \\"romance\\" flicks it's not even funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello? Story?","review":"Nothing much to this movie, actually. Two people fall in love, then they break up. Yeah great. There's nothing much to say, because there isn't much going on. It's like a nice praised vase, only empty. Really futile time spending. I've rated this movie 2 stars because it's not all bad. The director / writer have put their thoughts into the actual presentation of the film, and it kinda reminds you of an Ally McBeal episode - a collection of associations, and memories, presented in a nice, attractive way. It's like a nice gift, where you open up a great wrapping and discover a pencil sharpener at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extras? No deal!","review":"Now, I'm a person who loves DVD, even though I have a very small collection, but I'm building! But my concept of a DVD is that any idiot can watch a movie, but the extras are more entertaining! And as of this movie, I believe any idiot SHOULD watch this movie, it's very romantic and entertaining. But come on.....NO EXTRAS? I'd rather buy the VHS! They could of included a trailer, I would of bought it, MAYBE some commentary, MAYBE a TV spot, I would waste no time to buy it. But NO! Nothing! All I can hope is that Miramax comes out with a collector's edition pretty soon, and give this wonderful movie the treatment recieved by \\"Scream 3\\", \\"Good Will Hunting\\", and \\"Shakespeare In Love\\": the collector's edition treatment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best movie I have ever seen in my whole life!","review":"This is the best movie in the whole world!

Plus there's a kickin' music video at the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Funny that most movies with Freddie Prinze, Jr. aren't very good. In this one, he plays college student Al, who falls in love with fellow student Imogen (yup, that really IS a name) alias Julia Stiles. Al definitely thinks that Imogen is the love of his life, but soon nothing is as happy as it used to be, especially when Imogen cheats on Al with a reincarnation of Jim Morrison (Ashton Kutcher). But...surprise, surprise...the movie still has a happy ending.\\"Down To You\\" is not a desastrous movie, but it's really nothing that you'd like to see more than once. The story is old and shapeless, the jokes are not funny and the dialogues are flat and not very smart. The cast, however, doesn't make the movie any better. Julia Stiles was in better roles already, Freddie Prinze, Jr. is acting like a piece of wood and Ashton Kutcher's part is simply bad. Not to mention the supporting actors like Selma Blair and Zak Orth.Don't waste your time or money on that one. It's no good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I loathe to actually give this movie 1 star. VERY rarely will I rent a movie and actually stop watching it halfway through. This is one of the first I've done with. The only movie I've seen that's worse than this is \\"Simply Irresistible.\\" No, correct that. This was worse. I'm a big fan of teen movies and Julia Stiles, which is why it hurts me so much to say how bad this film is.

Having already read those two books, I didn't get what I had expected from reading Unstoppable Confidence. Unstoppable Confidence does contain some useful and effective ways to improve your confidence, but the book is poorly written and organized. I was pretty disappointed in this book, to say the least.

It reads like a car salesman warning you of other salesmen and telling you how honest and no-nonsense he is, but in the end you feel like he was just like the ones he warned you about.There's a lot of repetitive terms and sentences throughout the book. It almost feels like the author was trying hard to actually add a lot of fluff to turn a number of interesting bullet-point advice into an actual book.I'd have enjoyed this book if it'd been a powerpoint presentation, because in the end, all the endless usage of the coined term \\"unstoppable\\" in every other page, and stories that you don't know whether they are made up or not, made the book seem too \\"fluffy\\" and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Unstoppable Confidence","review":"Unstoppable Confidence is a highly readable book that is well organized and chock full of practical tips on how to gain more of the confidence we all need to be successful in life.

I'm sure that it may actually have a profound impact on the lives of some, but I couldn't get through the first half.The style is as though the author were giving a long speech, tending to ramble in places and not effectively communicating the key points. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the first half of the book, and the poor formatting makes it even more difficult to read.Overall, the book is poorly written and edited, hiding some of the author's ideas (many of which seem to be fairly good ones) and getting the reader stuck in woefully incorrect grammar, punctuation, and formatting.Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"I read a lot of inspirational/self-help books, figuring that if I find one new, workable technique per book it was worth the cost.I'm only on page 24 but I LOVE this book!

This is the REAL sixties, with all it's viewpoints and very basic ideas on simple living, unvarnished by the passage of time and the \\"re-remembering\\" we all tend to do.As well as a very good sourcebook for crafters, it's also a time capsule from the countercultural movement of the Sixties and early Seventies. Hippie Philosophy, inventiveness and outlook fills every page.

You should be prepared incase we are thrown back into the dark ages or you child finally gets around to asking you life's questions like what is \\"Tie Dye?\\"Wood stock provided the incentive for Jean Young to write this book. It is actually an aggregate from many authors that specialize in each craft. The book is divided into 11 distinct chapters, each on a different craft (skill). I use the term skill as the term craft has lost a great deal of meaning these days. These skills are candles, crochet, organic leather, embroidery, pottery, home recording, beads, weaving, tie die - baktik, silkscreen, and macram��. The home recording can be in a museum, the other skills are timeless.The book has b & w photographs and diagrams with a Woodstock motif. It is a must for your library and for those embarrassing questions.This review applies to the 1972 Praeger hardcover edition"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite","review":"This is one of the best albums yet.It is one of my favourites,especially this tracks Queen of Hearts,How I Need You,Chains of Love.I love to listen to their albums and would recomended to anyone who like's good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiatsu","review":"I found this to be a fascinating read.

I opened the simple plastic bag containing what I thought would be the tiny pieces of heaven in foil. I was so disappointed. I've try all the different flavors and none of them are tasty. They all taste like old chocolate. If you can you can find this chocolatier somewhere fresh don't think twice, don't bat an eye.

Fast moving and flat-out funny, the action draws you in at the same time that the characters make you laugh out loud. Daisy and Marcus are to die-for. Daisy's family members are as charming as they are quirky and Marcus's right-hand-man Rufus is so sexy, you'll be as thrilled as I am that he's getting his own book.I rarely read paranormals, but I heard so much positive buzz about this book that I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did. The Van Buren ghosts are a trio you'll never forget. The author does a great job with their 1920s lingo and style. You'll find yourself falling for them as much as you do for the modern day hero and heroine.If Scandalous Spirits is any indication, CB Scott is an author with amazing fresh, lively storytelling talent.

James does in 13 forever-haunting pages what it takes Kiernan 129 to do with far less success. And I was so irritated at how she avoided telling the story she sets up in 125 of those pages that I hurled the book across the room. They are called \\"obligatory scenes\\" for a reason. The reason being that the author never wants to write them, and the editor usually forces the writer to write them, and the book is always better for them being written. I'm aware that Kiernan may well think it is her own cleverness but she should see H.G. Wells' hundred year old, tale \\"Fear Itself\\" which did it better. I call this book a cop-out and/ or a failure of the imagination. Too bad, as the book is nicely written with interesting characters and a credible future set-up, and with real propulsive motion you can't buy with money. Of course, I saw the other \\"plot-turn\\" coming forty pages early, too.

My cat used it only a few times before it fell down - the glue on the velcro taped to the window sill wasn't strong enough to hold it in place. I put it back up and made sure it was as steady as I could make it and it fell again and my cat stopped using it.I called the company and they said maybe the glue was old and they sent me new velcro tape. I installed it as securely as I could using the new tape. My other cat started using it and it fell down again. The glue on the tape simply is not strong enough to keep the perch in place and this is a poor design on Lazy Pet's part.My cats loved it while it was installed - the perch is cushy and the fake sheepskin cover is washable. But I can not trust it not to fall and potentially hurt my cats so therefore do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more product info!","review":"The perch itself is nice. However, the support bars had to bent a little to fit flush against the wall (the perch was leaning!). My biggest complaint is that the product description failed to mention that the perch mounts to the windowsill via a velcro strip, which has an adhesive strip that is applied directly to the windowsill! No thanks! I found some large curtain brackets at a local hardware store and mounted them on the bottom of the perch so I could hang it from the windowsill. Also, by doing so, I can move the perch to another window!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was o.k.","review":"The perch stayed attached to my window sill for about 5 minutes with my cat laying on it and then there was a crash. the tape holding the velcro bits to the sill did not work very well.

Does anyone want one of these things, cheap?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of cat perch","review":"The seller was wonderful to deal with.

However, the perch fell off the window sill in less than a week. I ended up using shelving brackets to attach it to the wall, so the cats can still use it, but for that I might as well have gone with a perch that attaches to the wall in the first place.One note - the sill I attached the perch to was marble, not wood. It may be the case that it would attach just fine to a wooden sill, but it certainly doesn't do very well on stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable Product","review":"This product was a disappointment.

The set up was easy to do. The first time it fell down, my cat was lying on it. Imagine his surprise! The second time it fell, the support pulled out of one of the legs. So now I have a shelf with no way to support it. I must admit the company was quick to say they would refund my money. too bad this didn't work. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Great for the price. The \\"free toy\\" included was cute but very cheap and would not stick to the window with the suction-cup provided.

I will continue my search for a vendor that will allow me to select a cat perch in a color of my choosing -- or at least one that allows me to know the color before I order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nappa-lishious!","review":"This is a great window perch. Don't pay full price for it, but at just over $20 it's a good buy. Very easy assembly, no holes in the walls or sill required. Very stable. My cat loves it, massaging it with his paws sometimes. He jumps up on it from the floor, no problem. I like that it's not sticking out into the room to far, but because it's wide kittie has space to stretch out and lounge. I can definitely recommend it. In fact, I'm ordering a second one and just regret that I didn't get two right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap but the cat likes it.","review":"Eventually -- at least in dry, dry southern California -- the adhesive strip securing the perch to the sill will dry out. At this point, down falls kitty, and if she's young she'll just land on her feet and glare at you and scamper off to lick her dignity.But BEFORE that, she'll have several years of being a happy couch potato on the windowsill, watching birds and passersby. I have gotten one, replaced it when it fell down, gotten another, and replaced it. Each one lasted 3-4 years. The adhesive leaves a little sticky residue on the windowsill but it can be removed with some effort and/or rubbing alcohol.Alternatively, if you have an older cat and don't want to risk spraining something worse than his/her dignity, you may want to nail it (the shelf, not the cat) or use a stronger adhesive such as superglue.Oh, yeah, the washable cover is handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"I decided on this perch after reading reviews of it and others window perches. It works well even when our two one-year-old brother and sister cats jump on it. The cover removes nicely for cleaning, and it hasn't harmed the wood sill.***************************************************************************UPDATE:I had to move this perch to another window but couldn't find any industrial-strength Velcro to replace the used Velcro on the first window sill. I carefully removed it and it was so sticky it stuck to the other window sill. I left it on the sill without the perch overnight, then attached the perch the next day, and my cats have been jumping on and off it with no mishap for about a month now. I'm impressed with the Velcro included with the perch, although I'll need to find it somewhere for the next move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned product","review":"I had to return the product because even after following the instructions exactly, it kept on falling off the windowsill. My cat weighs about 10 lbs and everytime she got on it, it would fall off. Not strong enough for a average size cat. Wouldn't go with the velcro adhesive type again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Pet kitty window perch","review":"The concept here is good \\"no tools needed\\" to install. The product itself is well made, but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to, the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it. If there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better.I prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do NOT fall down."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous!!","review":"I love the product!

They are probably their favorite places in the house to sit and sleep. The seats are plush and fit well into our windows. The only problem we had was with the velcro that held them up - the one seat would fall down - but we used some screws and now they're solid. (I think they only fell because one of our cats is kind of a big girl!) I frequently work from home and it's nice to see the kittehs lounging and enjoying themselves on the seats. Each seat came with a feather toy too that was a big hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly strong!","review":"We love this shelf. It is soft and squishy so the cat is on it all day long.

A great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Thumbs Down","review":"Spectacularly unimpressed with this product and with the whole transaction. I ordered this cat perch but the item I received looked nothing like the photo posted at Amazon. The product description says there are assorted colors, but there is no way to select a color when placing the order. Based on the photo posted with the product description, I expected to get a white cat perch with simple \\"L\\"-shaped arms that would hold it to the wall. Instead I got a brown cover and the arms had curly cues on the ends; these did not hold the perch securely to the wall at all and the Velcro did not adhere to the window sill for more than a couple of weeks. (I've had other cat perches at the same location in my home, and the Velcro lasted for years.) If it was possible to give this item 0 stars then I would do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your cat is going to get hurt.","review":"Think twice before buying this. My cats loved it and spent hours sleeping on it. Until it fell to the floor because the particle board cracked around the bolts. I fixed it. I should have known better.

The cat is fine after a visit to the vet, two stitches, antibiotic shot and a $150 bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for heavy cats","review":"My cat loved this perch as soon as we installed. However, my cat is a 14 pound Maine Coon and is probably bigger than your average cat. After about three months of use we came home to find the window perch on the floor. Over time my big kitty manage to bend the supports. So don't buy this one if you also have a larger type of cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for cats","review":"I purchased this a few months ago and it stays on the window for a while and then falls off unexpectedly.

The book opened my eyes to the incredible struggle and long odds that Dominican players - or any Latin players - face to make it in the major leagues. It makes Tejada's accomplishment seem that much more amazing and important to me. His story is interwoven with a lot of baseball history that I would not have otherwise known, and it is one that kids my age and up (8th grade) would enjoy because it makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important Issue, Badly Written","review":"Breton and Villegas make the case that Latin ballplayers are exploited and then, in the overwhelming majority of cases, tossed away by major league teams. Miguel Tejada was one of those who, it turned out, wasn't just cheap filler for an organization's minor league chain, but instead broke through to the majors. This surprised the A's organization which originally ranked him below other Dominicans who have since faded and returned to island obscurity or the life of an undocumented alien in New York City. Unfortunately, the author's case is buried by some truly stilted prose in a narrative that wanders all over the map without giving Tejada himself much more life in the book than as a paradigm for the author's argument. I happen to know already a fair amount about Latin ballplayers so this book brought me neither increased insight into them as a group or to Tejada as an individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball books don't get any better than this. A great read.","review":"This is more than a story about one Latin baseball player, Miguel Tejada, but is the story of all Latin baseball players. It's the Jackie Robinson story of Latin baseball. Well researched and a fun read, with details that keep it interesting all the way to the end. This should be a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, well-documented, and well-liked","review":"I saw the authors on a local TV program and was intrigued by their subject matter. Coming from a baseball-loving cuban family and growing up hearing about and actually meeting latin players I was interested in seeing if the authors got the story right. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Away Games was both informative and entertaining. I found the book to be an excellent blend of meticulous research and heart-felt emotion. You learn that it takes more than god-given talent to land and keep a coveted job in the \\"grandes ligas\\". I recommend this book to anyone who loves the national past time and is interested in learning more about the latin version of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but not right","review":"This handle went on very easy, but the swoop is upside down...other than that it's great.

Lack of illustrations make for dry reading, even about this great city. Frommer's, Eyewitness, and National Geographic are a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealized potential","review":"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. But, the hero is a rogue of the worst kind for some time, the heroine is both too good to be true and too naive, historical innacuracies pull the reader out of the story, and King's style can become too sentimental and repetitious.King's style tries to be reminiscent of Jane Austen, but often feels forced and sounds trite. Plot elements often fail to become fully realized, especially as to their effects. A smile and a smoothly delivered line cannot end all potential scandal. King does, however, have a good handle on the seesaw type of relationship that permeates romance books. The too pat, but still entertaining fates of the heroine's sisters are also noteworthy. The villain was adroitly handled, and this heroine is one who can certainly stand on her own.Great potential in this book; I just wish it had been executed with greater care. Enjoyable, but hardly exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letters from Harrisburg: Ordinary Days by Dorcas Smucker","review":"We all have ordinary days, don't we? Most of us don't make a book out of them, although we would have enough experiences to do so. No doubt they'd be just as fascinating as the days that Dorcas has written about. It's the way we look at life that counts. It's then that ordinary days become extra-ordinary. Because those days are filled with family, friends, daily and not so daily events and longings which give way to heart-stuff.You'll laugh, sniffle some tears, and have a snuggy down-home, comfy sense of 'there's something right with the world sometimes'.Dorcas is a down-home mom, with a down-home sense of delight and right.

What a treasure! I was more thrilled to see the recipe for the Banana Cream pie that my husband and I had at his restaurant in New Orleans. I decided to make it for a special occassion. I knew something was wrong when it said to mix 3/4 c. corn starch with 1 cup cream. I stopped there and looked up the recipe on-line. I found other mistakes but it was to late...we are having banana soup on mushy crust for my husband's 45th birthday today. This wasn't the first recipe errors I've found in this book, but the most expensive. (Price vanilla bean right now and you'll see what I mean.) Now I understand why this 'treasure' was put out for 'trash'. Quantities are wrong and important directions are omitted. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"This is a fun book. So far, I've made and loved the Goat Cheese Quesadillas with homemade pico di gallo and guacamole. It was fantastic! The Southwest cheese pie is incredible as well. The cilanto potato salad was so-so. The recipe's are definitely impressive. The main caveat is that you need to plan to spend a lot of time prepping! The recipes are not difficult, but it seems that Emeril never buys anything pre-made. Make your own tortillas...your own pie crust...your own seasonings! I definitely take short cuts (i.e. pie crust, tortillas). But I did make the seasoning.I recommend this book for anyone who really likes to spend time in the kitchen and do a lot of work. For people who don't really care to cook, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book from a Great Personality.","review":"Emeril's books are sometimes criticized for the immense popularity of the writer. But this one does not deserve such an attack. I am an avid amateur chef who loves spicy food and New Orleans cooking. This book does a fantastic job of giving you the down earth cooking that we all need in our lives. Yet, to call some the recipes unsophisticated or the like would be an insult to the variety of flavors and techniques within its pages. I think this by far his strongest cookbook and one I have bought on a couple of occasions for friends. This is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This is way overrated. As Mr. Peabrain below proves, there are just some people who can't tolerate any criticism of their clown-prince Emeril. How typical of him to label all who dissent as 'dumb'. Emeril is not GOD. His food, while innovative, is mainly an exercise in ingredient overkill. Most chefs will try to use the right balance of ingredients to enhance the flavor just right. Instead, Emeril's motto seems to be more, more, and lots of it! Simple dishes end up being complex piles of things that just don't go together. Just once, I'd like to see Emeril make something as simple as a peanut butter sandwich without turning it into a heaping pile of glop."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Orleans","review":"This is NOT how people in New Orleans eat or cook. Emeril Lagasse took some extreme liberties with what he calls 'old time recipes' and changed them into things that are unrecognizable. The recipes in this book are not that good. To this day, I haven't yet figured out what all of the fuss about Emeril is. He's overrated as a cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money and ingredients","review":"This is the most overrated trash ever compiled into a 'cookbook'. Emeril wouldn't know what to do with an honest, simple menu. His cult like status has warped his ignorant mind to the point that he can't make one dish without overdoing the spices and performing his cartoonish buffon act.

All the recipes I cooked turned out great! I especially like the chicken soup recipe and the seafood gumbo (no rue, so it's lighter than regular gumbo) recipe. However, Emeril usually underestimate cooking time in this book for soups and gumbos.

But if you are a NO foodie, you must own this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"New New Orleans Cuisine","review":"I really liked this book.

And what to my wondering eyes did appear but a book with no food pictures. The only pics here are black and white shots of street signs, bags of grain and other such useless objects. They aren't even worthy of New Orleans tourist memorabilia. Good old Emeril in true form is chasing the dollar. I think he should hang his head in shame for presenting this book and especially at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louisiana cooking","review":"Emeril does not know about Louisiana cooking.

I think Mage is the easiest to follow out of White Wolf Role Playing games, and with the simplicity you get an understanding of the game and the way Role Playing works.

It's just like the Imax dvds except you're not bouncing all over the place, giving your weary hip flexors, hips and knees a nice break from all the other crap you do. That said, don't think it's easy. The blasts get you anaerobic by attacking your legs with a series of varied lunges, squats, etc.That said, it is true that this is not one of her hardest dvds. When you're an advanced exerciser, low impact cardio is not going to get you very out of breath. However, you don't mind because you're still breathing hard from all the zillion lunges you just did and your legs are like jelly anyways.

This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but Korine replaces them with a series of random lists, scrawlings, and formulaically obscene snippets. One could praise this failure if it failed because it was over reaching itself, but throughout one gets the impression that Korine was never really shooting for anything at all. The book attempts to look thrown together, but unfortunately the writing appears to be so also.

The story line is wonderfully set up, the characters interesting, the plot seems wonderful. But then the author writes the book as if she is attempting to re-create stereo instructions. Every scene is met with about two pages of unnecessary and often confusing descriptions. I couldnt get past the first two pages when there is car crash and the author spends too much time and energy describing the fathers antique car. I dont recommend this book unless you enjoy reading novels written as a complicated Medical Journel article."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO WILL ADOPT THE ORPHANED ONE YEAR OLD","review":"What a heart wrenching story - a young child is orphaned when her parents are killed in an automobile crash and both sides of her family (grandparents and aunts/uncles) want to raise her. This is a wonderfully tense and moving story. I really felt the emotional upheaval they were all going through. There were many thought-provoking issues the book.Gordon and his parents quite naturally assume that they will be one year old Keefer's guardians. However, Ray's parents believe otherwise. There is little time for each family to mourn their losses before an ugly and long drawn out custody battle ensues.I found the story fast pace and engrossing. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing","review":"I couldn't get past the first 70 pages. I found her writing style to be very confusing.

I'm pretty open minded (especially after having read \\"Running with Scissors\\") so I'm surprised it didn't enjoy it.The characters were well developed but the writing was hard to follow. Hence, I too, caught myself re-reading portions to clear up the confusion. A lot of tangents...kind of like conversations with girlfriends over a few glasses of wine.Being from Madison, it's always nice to read references to places you know but even that didn't excite me that much. I wonder if I had been involved in an adoption issue that I might not have found this a better book? Hmmmm.The best part was the last chapter and Keefer's voice of a child having gone through a tough life experience. A good reminder of how resillient children really are.I will try another couple of Mitchard's books to see if this was indeed an \\"editor\\" related issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and thought-provoking","review":"This is a wonderful book. (I listened to it on audio cassette) The people become so real that you can picture them as you go along. I found tears in my eyes a lot which can be dangerous if you're listening in the car. Knowing that our society continues to consider adoptees to have fewer rights than the rest of the citizens is shocking and helps one examine one's own attitudes. The interactions with a toddler seemed so true that I felt that the book must have been written while someone was trying to care for a two-year-old. This book couldn't have been much better although I did feel that the ending seemed a little contrived. Get ready for an emotional experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I read it","review":"I almost didn't read this book because my husband and I were involved in (and lost) an extended legal battle to adopt a foster child that had been in our family for 2 years. I was afraid reading it would be too painful. While I found some parts of the book emotionally difficult to read, I'm glad I read it. The author sometimes gets off track and I would like to have seen more space given to what the child was experiencing. But over all, she does a good job of showing how desperately strong non-bloodline family ties can be and that is at the heart of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential, but so disappointing!","review":"I became a fan of Jacquelyn Mitchard after reading--and LOVING--The Most Wanted. I immediately went to my favorite Borders and invested in The Deep End of the Ocean, which is one of the few books that has actually made me cry. I waited on pins and needles for Jacquelyn's next book and bought it in hardcover as soon as it came out, but what a disappointment.The premise is strong, but the execution does not rise to the challenge.

After doing some research I read that Scholastic at first did not want to include the inappropriate content and asked the author to edit it. The author refused and Scholastic agreed to publish the book with the smoking scenes. As a parent I do not think any child should be reading a book that \\"glamorizes\\" smoking.

The ideas are okay, but the story did NOT need to be so long-winded and overwritten. Also, the main female character is supposd to be a genius, really brilliant, but every time we get into her thoughts, she's a moron! She is slow to understand EVERYTHING around her, she has to ask stupid questions, and she is shown to be a semi-hysterical idiot. When we're told someone is brilliant, they have to ACT brilliantly and THINK brilliantly. If Sherlock Holmes was always saying, \\"Duh, Watson, I dunno whaddya think?\\" we wouldn't believe his genius, and the same is true of Williams' lead female.This series is like running a 100-mile marathon, but the story it covers is only a 10-yard dash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Action","review":"Well, I've now finished the whole Otherland series and it was basically a drag. The pace was way too slow, much of the plot was extremely predictable, and the overall length of the series could have been shortened into two 400 page books. Specifically, waiting until page 740 of book four to bring Orlando back from the dead was silly when it was obvious from vol 1 that was the most likely thing to happen.

The book raises countless issues; issues not restricted to the fictional world, but applicable to our own. A profound and engrossing novel.The only downside is that the book does not seem to know when to quit. Sure, Williams wanted to wrap up all the loose ends, but his conclusions are less than satisfying and the book could do without the last 75-100 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series, Great Book","review":"(very small spoiler alert!) Tad Williams' Otherland series is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy series out there.

It could be compressed to about 400 pages, if the more useless parts were cut out. It was a very interesting story, but it was executed in a wrong way. One thing that bothered me was the excessive use of profane language. Does cussing really improve a book any? The thoughts of these people are horrendous. Women are constantly called names, and people suddenly yell out \\"S.O.B.\\" in capital letters in their minds. The idea of a nuclear explosion at the Super Bowl is pretty exciting, but you have to read a ways to get to the real action. Read \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" instead of this.

But this novel shows that the world still need a Jack Ryan. Actually I would like to hear him say \\"Mr. President, you are acting irrational\\".Terrosists who steal nuke from Isreal and detonate at Super Bowl series sounds so real now that bandits that might do the same abound. Situation is close as well. Russians are now allies not enemies. And rising tension in Mid East. It's a bit long and tedious for non-native speakers of English. And as a Japanese who heard about Hiroshima and Nagasaki about 60 years ago, lack of radiation description is a big disappointment. Despite that, the last 200 pages compensate all the frustration.

Yes it does play a significant role later in the story but do I need to know the name of the guy who cut it down and how he came to be a lumberjack? We're given 3 pages of background on a cop who is murdered and never mentioned again. And the building of the bomb! I skipped many pages when it came to this. It's by sheer luck that I happened to stumble on the only significant part of the bomb's making.This book almost put me off Clancy for good. I haven't and probably won't read DEBT OF HONOR or EXECUTIVE ORDER. I did read and enjoy the John Clark stories WITHOUT REMORSE and RAINBOW SIX. Retire Jack Ryan and stick with Clark and Ding Chavez."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good from start to finish","review":"I read the book for the first time in several years and re-discovered how good of an author Tom Clancy is. The writing style is engaging and keeps you involved in the plot as the different characters are developed. This kind of book is a great read for a lazy summer vacation.I didn't want to stop reading as I followed the Jack Ryan character to the end of this adventure.Highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Fiction","review":"As we again face turmoil in the Middle East, this book becomes more timely than ever. The story of a nuclear warhead falling into the hands of very determined terrorists, it winds throughout the world, through characters that come to life, and terror and suspense that will surely amaze and satisfy the reader.Almost too true to life to be a work of fiction, this book is more technical and heavily written than earlier Clancy works, but the high degree of detail and heart-stopping tension more than balances the scientific complexities in the narrative.At times the characters a carbon copies of earlier Clancy protagonists but the brilliant use of them makes up for some of their predictability.Ryan and crew are back with a vengance and the safety of the world are in the balance. A must read and a well and worthy effort. Not perfect, but by far, one of the finest nuclear terror novels ever written.And keep in mind, it could all happen as soon as today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and dry","review":"Until \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" came along, this was my least favorite Clancy novel. Unlike his earlier stuff, he takes FOREVER to get the story cooking, and it's the first one where his personal politics really start to get in the way. In a book where it takes a whole chapter for a nuclear bomb to go off, you can expect to read some fairly arcane technical trivia.(\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" also has this in common with \\"Sum.\\" They're the only ones where he tries to write sex scenes, and, well, let's just say it's not his forte. He should have learned from this novel that he doesn't do it well, and left it alone.)This is the only Tom Clancy novel I have been unable to reread. Some of them I've read five or six times. This one I just can't make it through a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Start Here","review":"I have read every Clancy book in the Ryan series and this is clearly the lowpoint. I saw some folks rating it highly and I wanted to throw my two cents in: This one contains almost endless pages on some suspected affair he's having from his wife's perspective, etc. By far the most soap opera-ish work he's done, making it hard for a regular Clancy reader to get through. The stuff on building the bomb is also protracted and uninteresting.If you're just starting with Clancy, I'd start with Clear and Present Danger or one of the more recent one like Rainbow Six. I'd start just about anywhere else if you want the best of this excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most intensive Tom Clancy novel since \\"Red October\\"!!!","review":"This is one of Tom Clancy's best works yet. He shows that he can be a progressive writer, by showing us a different look at the heroic Jack Ryan. I am very impressed with the sheer intensity of this book. There is a line in the book that is used to describe DefCon ONE and I think it applys to the feel of the book. It basicly says that the Americans and the Russians have their guns out and they're pointed at each other and the saftey's off and their finger is on the trigger feeling its preasure. I have yet to read the next in the Jack Ryan series, but I am looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER CLANCY MASTERPIECE","review":"Another of the great books in the Jack Ryan series The Sum of All Fears is about a nuclear bomb going off in the United States-something that has never happened before. This book, like all of his others posses several tightly woven plotlines. The best to me was John Clark, marriage counselor. The thing I found especially interesting was that Clancy finally showed a chink in the boy scout armor of Jack Ryan (he was really getting on my nerves). After reading this I can't wait to tackle Debt of Honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"I have read all Jack Ryan books except debt of honor and this is among the best to me. The story is convincing and the description of the character like Liz Elliot and Bob Rowler is perfect. He shows his knowledge on military field again by predicting the reaction caused by a nuclear detonation. The book is exciting overall but brought into a climax after 700 pages which is the most suitable place. The story developes into a state of total confrontation between each characters which is absolutely incredible. By the way, I like Tom's way of bringing up new characters for future use. He has done this to Clark and Ding and now to Durling and Daryaei. I must say this is an uncomparable effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clancy's best","review":"Even though this book has a believable storyline, it is a slow read. The first 600 pages go incredibly slow. It is not until the last part of the book that the pace picks up. I am a Tom Clancy fan and have read the entire Jack Ryan series, but believe that this book was overly technical for no useful reason, which did not add to its readability. It could have could have and should have been streamlined. I much preferred Clear and Present Danger. I also recommend Vince Flynn as an up and coming political thriller writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall great book","review":"The Sum of all Fears is 914 pages long, and the first 600 or so are all character problems and a GIANT rising action. After this the story really heats up. The climax is phenominal and the ending is very good. The plot in the book is very good, and this is a MUST if you have the time to read the monster :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for another.","review":"This book was great, although at times it could get boring-mainly in the beginning-an author has to lay his foundation though, doesn't he? Anyway, it was intense and I really enjoyed it, I can't wait to read another Jack Ryan novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"This was described as \\"very good\\" but looked like it was old, discolored throughout, with significant cracking all over the spine, cover, and pages. The cover was ripped and folded and some of the pages were falling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read a lot of Tom Clancy and this I couldn't even finish. He jumped around so much and a lot of information during one of his jumps didn't even seem to relate to what might turn out to be the story. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit boring but still good","review":"This book was the first book of clancy that i had ever read, and as soon as i read it i read debt of honor exc honor and some others.the one bad thing is that for people who nothing about miltary stuff it can get a bit long in parts. Still a good read though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is the first Clany book I've read and I have to say it's perfect. This is a true novel. He goes from discussing history with a Georgetown professor, to blowing someone's head off, and then to passionate love making in a single stroke. It's just incredible. This is one of, if not the, best books I've ever read. I'm 17 and enjoyed every word. Keep up the good work. I recommeneded this to everyone including my AP English teacher. She typically hates works of this genre, but couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slow Start That Builds","review":"'The Sum of All Fears' starts off rather slowly. The beginning deals with Jack Ryan's headaches as the number two man in the CIA and waging political battles with the President and members of his cabinet. Meanwhile, around the world, communist-arab-native American terrorists recieve manna from heaven- an atomic bomb. While most of the novel deals with preparing the bomb and Ryan's own personal and proffesional problems, The last two hundred pages are among the most thrilling ever written. The terrorists' atomic bomb is only the begginning of a much larger plan to bring the world, not just the USA, to it's knees. The payoff of this novel makes the whole thing worth while. In addition it acts almost as a manual for creating your own atomic weapons, should the need arise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The Sum of All Fears follows Jack Ryan as he fights from Washington to stop a nuclear crisis started by a band of Palestinian terrorists. To make things worse, he is faced with a president blinded by emotions. As he tries to defuse the crisis, he wil face problems like none of his other adventures.Clancy does a great job with the story, and the characters are very believable, as always. The only bad thing about this is the pacing. The story is a little slow, and it feels like two-thirds is devoted to setting up the climax, but after the bomb goes off, it is impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom at his best","review":"Next to Clear and Present Danger sits The Sum of all Fears!These two are my favorite novels by Clancy. Where C&PD; has action and political intrigue, Sum is pure action. The suspense of the novel is great. The technical part of how he explained the Detonation was very good, I think that is when Clancy shines, when he takes something so technical and writes about it.If you have seen the movie, you need to read the book! When they make a movie they say no person is meant to be characterized and such action is deemed \\"coincidental\\", well the movie and the novel, if they line up was by pure coincidence. The novel shows just how plausible it is to have a nuclear detonation go off on American soil and once again Clancy has foresight to see something like this happening and then weaving a brilliant story around it.I hope this never happens, but he showed just how \\"easy\\" it might be. Clancy seems to be a prophet of the techno-thrillers. This book is one of his best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Plot Lines; Not Enough Direction","review":"This book has too many plot lines going on at once. The only one worth reading is the one about a revolutionary group who uses a nuclear warhead to destroy the football stadium the Super Bowl is played in. The other plot lines are extremely boring and have no relevance to the one about the revoluionary group. You should only read that one plot line and skip everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie not so hot!","review":"I could not get into Ben Affleck playing the role of Jack Ryan. I thought the movie was mediocre and just didn't do it for me. In my mind stick with the novel and pass up the movie.If you like Harrisson Ford as Jack Ryan then Ben Affleck is surely going to disappoint in my mind. Doesn't live up to Ford's persona on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not reccomend this book.","review":"700 pages on how to build a nuclear bomb. Thanks but no thanks. Clancy's worst book by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but religious prejudice","review":"The book was a typical Clancy novel...except the prejudice seems to switch from women (as in his previous books) to Muslims...whom Clancy seems to demonize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical errors abound in this embarassing Clancy effort.","review":"I'm not sure from whom Clancy is getting his technical information, but he ought to be fired. It is obvious that Clancy hasn't got a clue how things operate with regard to NORAD, missile warnings, or the military's reaction to such. His weapon's effects tome and its effects on commercial satellites is riduculous. Give NORAD and the U.S military credit for not being total idiots. The correct information is out there. Mr. Clancy, hire a real researcher! The end of the book is ludicrous. Let's hope the up coming movie is better than what Clancy has wrought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sum of all fears is a techno thriller","review":"Tom Clancy made a another great book. The attention to detail and the suspense is second to none. The book makes you feel like the events that are happening in the book are actually happening in real life. Its terrifying to think that we could be swept up so easily in thermo-nuclear war. The book is second to none and is a marvelous masterpiece. Each character is well thought out and the detail about each character is great. I feel like i know each character personally, almost like they are my own neighbors. Clancy out did himself when he wrote this book. He should write a sequal to this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish This Trash","review":"Once again, Clancy has proven he cares more about trash than truth. This book is full of meaningless profanity and disrespect for Christianity (with a strange love for Islam.) The book also speaks quite disrespectfully of America in general, especially it's government. To top it all off, I read a review somewhere that this book had mature sexual themes in it too. So what's one to do? I quit this book... and I advise anyone who cares about their purity and soul do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinking Abridgement","review":"I've been a big fan of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series for many years. I've read all of the books several times. When this came out on CD I searched the packaging carefully for an indication of abridgement and couldn't find one, so I bought it. It is cut so severely that it might as well be a different book by an inferior author. The small amount of the story that remained after the butchery was so disjointed that had I not known the story well I would have been lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best Tom Clancy book I've read.","review":"Of the four Tom Clancy books I've read this one ranks #1 for sure. I have yet to read his two newest one's, so I may change my mind after that. I doubt it though, unless they are just really excellent stories. As I was reading this book, I though to myself \\"Why hasn't something like this ever really happend here\\"? Because it's so possible. Of all his books, this is the one that should have been made into a movie. It's such a good and realistic story. It's the longest of his books that I've read, but I finished it at least twice as fast as any of the others. I though I was a Tom Clancy fan before I read this book, now I know I'm one"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tom Clancy book I've read.","review":"This is my favorite Clancy book. It doesn't contain as much right-wing diatribe as some of his others (as a Hollywood liberal I don't go for that stuff). The plot is fantastic...a Middle Eastern group of terrorists discover a nuclear bomb in Syrian farmland and try to get it working again. They set it off during the Super Bowl & along with another terrorist group in Germany, try to trigger WWIII. This is a scary part of the book as the US and then USSR go to the brink of nuclear war. Jack Ryan is able to save the day...as much as this sounds completely sappy it actually works. If you're new to Tom Clancy you can start with this one...his other stuff is great, too but this is by far the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This tool box is terrible.

It is a piece of cr*p."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of PK Dick","review":"I've read more than a dozen of Dick's novels and this one is by far the worst I've encountered. As in too many Dick novels, the main character is an idealized (but still highly annoying) projection of Dick's own personality. The main female character is as empty as any adolescent male fantasy. The writing is horrible, full of awkward and improbable turns of phrase - usually made while Dick was attempting to show off his rather blue-haired erudition. The plot is a lame attempt to grapple with a juvenile theological question. The narration in general is full of contradictions and abrupt shifts of tone and character presentation. And the flaws just keep on coming.In short, Galactic Pot Healer is a compendium of the worst aspects of Dick's writing, storytelling and ideology. Strangely, the one that followed it, Ubik, was one of his best. Dick was unpredictable in that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT","review":"I really liked the film, in fact, I've seen it twice (The Day After).

I'm glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cover almost says it all!!","review":"This movie may or may not be accurate (the disclaimer at the end of the movie says it is an actual *under*statment of what would happen).I saw this movie the last time about twelve years ago. Apparently, it is set off by Soviets invading and nuking Germany, eliciting a US response that results in the holocaust of the movie. The scenes are graphic and the first airburst in front of the camera happens almost without warning and with a loud thunderclap sound. What follows is some of the most unnerving footage I have ever seen, showing the immediate effects in horrifying detail.It is a very good movie (wish it would come out on DVD), but it is not for the weak-hearted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie was essentially left-wing propaganda ... nothing more.I thought it would be more entertaining, but it was more fantasy than fiction.Only the blast scenes were worth watching ...I bought this movie and became so grossly bored watching it that I still haven't finished it a year and a half later.

It was the Sunday and Monday before Thanksgiving. Of course, as a native Kansas Citian and a KU student, I recognized almost all the sscenes shot in both KC and Lawrence. I thought it was fitting to see the missles shooting out of the area between Wescoe Hall and the Military Sciences building. :) I believe that I had classes in both buildings that semester.

A powerful and devastating made-for-TV movie via the 80s, THE DAY AFTER depicts global thermonuclear war like it had never been seen before (or since). I first watched the picture sitting in my junior-high history class when I was 12 years old, and while I didn't remember any specifics of the film, I do remember it terrified me. The movie may be nearly 30 years old, but it's still very intense and carries a powerful punch. While I do not believe that this event will ever become a reality, I do think the film is a very good tool to get people to thinking about the future and where they'll spend their eternity (Heaven or Hell). THE DAY AFTER is a powerful, sobering picture of global destruction - not recommended for children 12 and under."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth and Will Happen","review":"Though this senario in the movie happened back in the late Carter or early Reagan Presidencies, It could happen any day now. Americans, as a majority, are totally unprepared and unaware of the seriousness of our present day situation on a global scale. The destruction shown in the movie, IS NOT indicative of the real horror that will be when the US is hit with atomic weapons. This movie is a fictional senario of what will happen in the fairly near future and was fairly well made. It is a must see.

In my opinion, the most chocking fact is not the harmful effects proceeding from the radiation...The most chocking is the social chaos.Without laws nor order, people will start to live \\"each one for itself\\", literally...I remember a scene when a family keep to its shelters and provisions with a gun, from another possible survivors.

Not knowing what I know now about nuclear war and seeing other films that portray it much more accurately, this movie is not worth the money or time. Nuclear war would be a nightmare. In watching this film, it didn't seem that bad at all. If you would like to see a film that truly displays the true nightmare of nuclear warThreads [NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2&4 Import - Great Britain]shows a much more realistic view of what would happen. You do have to have a DVD player that plays DVD's from Great Britian. I can only give \\"The Day After\\" one star as none of it seems believable in the light of what information is available online.

Unfortunately one of those moments has been destroyed on this DVD. When a fellow doctor asks the Jason Robards character what he saw, he replies: \\"...it was high in the air. Like the sun exploding...TWO suns.\\" His colleague appears crushed by the revelation. It's an emotional moment. On the DVD it appears to be just before the layer change.

However, I was ready to throw this one out after one day of struggling to figure out what was wrong with it! I was vacuuming my area rugs and wood floors. There were quite a few fake pine needles left from my Christmas tree, mostly on the wood floors. In years past, my VERY cheap Kenmore canister vacuum had no trouble with the pine needles. This new vacuum, however, ceased to function after just a few minutes. I emptied the dust bin, cleaned out the hose and the long wand - with no results. Maybe the belt slipped - but I do not want to bother with using a screw driver to take the thing apart and follow complicated instructions in order to find out.Back to Hoover it goes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction!","review":"Best vacuum ever!

The first thing that struck me was the sturdy construction. It seems solid and very well made. (However, it's not heavy by any means.) Also, the filter cup doesn't bother me like other reviewers. I tap/rinse it out every ten vacuumings or so, and that's with two cats and a carpet. The canister that substitutes for a bag is large and intuitively easy to pull out, tump out, and put back. Also, I find that the vacuum works perfectly adequately on bare floors. The cord retracts easily -- perhaps my favorite feature! The carpet brush spins well, too. All in all, I'm in love with this little thing (especially after years of wrangling with a Eureka upright), and pray to the consumer gods that it never stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover S3755 Bagless WindTunnel Canister","review":"The cord retractor stopped working the second time I used it.

Suction is still great and I haven't emptied the dust canister yet.... pretty good, as far as I'm concernedCons- the weight of the vacuum is manageable (i'm 5'4''), especially since it's a canister one rather than upright one. But no, it's not as light as feather.- only major thing i would change is the fact that the brush attachment doesn't move relative to the handle, so going around corners needs a bit more effort.Overall I'd definitely recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good solid workhorse","review":"This inexpensive vacuum cleaner does the job. It has good suction and draws dirt and accumulation away. I am remodeling so it has been put to the test. I like not having to have bags to change. It empties easily.

My old model was such a great vacuum and I thought this one would be an upgrade.I have all hardwoods with a few rugs and a canister vacuum is usually best for hard surfaces. This canister is the exception to that rule. There is no separate floor tool so cleaning hardwood and vinyl is through the bulky power nozzle. This nozzle will suck up almost nothing that is on a hard surface with the power nozzle turned off as instructed. If you try to turn the power nozzle on and go over the hard surfaces then it scatters everything around. The only way to use this machine to clean these surfaces is with the 4 inch dusting tool. I gave up after only one room.This is great on carpets but the dust cup that looks large in the picture, only holds about two cups of dust so I emptied the cup twice cleaning one rug. This machine is going back after only one try. Sorry CONSUMER REPORTS.

The issue i have with this product is in the connection with the electrical. After a year of light use in a small apartment, I began experiencing shortages between the hose and the vacuum canister. During a normal vacuuming session the machine turns off several times, then being prompted by a good shake will revive only to occur again in a few minutes. It's to the point now where it's almost impossible to use when it decides to even turn on anymore. Very very disappointing I would have thought a product in this mid-price range would have lasted a little longer than 1 year. With that said, unless you plan on replacing your vacuum within a year I would steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't BUY THIS!!","review":"Unfortunately, this Hoover lasted one year.

After about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way. Still has very good power. Bad news, it doesnt move around easy. It is like dragging an old tire around, hard to turn and direct, canister always rolls over. The only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt, and dont vacumn that often, i guess because i dread using it.

I've noticed some grammar and punctuation problems that is common w/her some of her novels(Lesbian Love times 4,etc). This book is full of love and romance and even some suspense!

It's when the cheerleaders are all being held in a cabin after having been kidnapped by the three bad guys and one bad woman. The bad woman, who also happens to have been the school nurse at one of the high schools, decides she likes this one pretty little blonde cheerleader, so she takes her into the bathroom, undresses her, and gives her a bath!!! Yowzers!!! It was the hottest scene on the entire tape, bar none! Really, really erotic! They don't make scenes like that anymore, and I for one wish they would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Clamps for Ribbed Hose","review":"These work great on the \\"ribbed\\" hose that most shops use for dust collection. The solid strap clamps tend to slip and skew when tightened and allow tiny leaks where these wire clamps seat on the hose solidly. You can also use a nut driver or socket wrench to get them REALLY tight, tighter than just using a screwdriver. If you are using Woodstock International hose, use these clamps."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"These are high quality and far better than the band type.These are clean looking and fit over the ridges on the pipe instead of crushing them. They tighten up with a screwdriver or wrench and really sinch down tight.Because the dust collection hose is made with a continuous ridge and not seperate sections. You will have to cross over some ridges on the collection hose but, it still comes out clean.Forget the old rubber hose type clamps and go with these you wont be sorry. Now get out there and clamp some hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rip Off","review":"This is an adequate clamp. It attaches dust collector hose to outlets and appliances. It is, however, a total rip off in price. Amazon charges $5.40 for ONE of these clamps. This despite customer reviews of the item that put the price at 55 and 59 Cents for one! This is misleading. Don't believe it. It's $5.40 EACH. Elsewhere on Amazon other vendors do indeed sell these same or equivalent and better clamps for only 55 cents and 59 cents each. Mine are going back right away. I foolishly believed that the reviews supplemented the item description plus I was incredulous that anyone would charge TEN FOLD what the others on Amazon were charging. I was taken and it has damaged my trust in Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful - Big Ripoff","review":"The narative about this 4 inch dust collection clamp is not clear about how many are in the package. I had purchased wire clamps before and got 10 for about $7.00. When this one arrived it was only one - not two or five - just one. How can one cost as much as five or more? I would not click this item for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage product","review":"Don't waste your money on these. First of all, the metal of the screw itself is flimsy garbage that bends under the slightest pressure, making the entire thing broken. As I write this, the pile of bent, broken, or otherwise useless clamps is steadily growing.Secondly, and more importantly, the screw is too short, meaning that you will max it out to the maximum tightness possible, and your dust hose will still slip off the fitting. I've had to wrap every single fitting with three or four layers of duct tape, simply to give it enough traction to let the thing clamp properly, and even then it still sometimes slips off. Absolutely infuriating. I'm ordering some Jet clamps to replace this useless crap. Don't make my mistake, its worth the extra couple bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mix of NU Metal and Death Metal make a pleasent surpise","review":"Gizmachi's \\"The Imbuing\\" is a treat to listen to, espically since alot of NU Metal seems to be rather stale these days. Gizmachi's vocalist does an excellent job on vocals (I am sorry, I dont have the Disc in front of me, and I cannot remember his name) but he almost brings a \\"Death\\" Metal feel to the vocal, unlike some Nu Metal which uses the traditional yell. Even though not perfect, its still a great buy for the price and it has its share of solid songs to make it a strong album. I am hoping that this band is still together, since I couldnt find them on the web, but I havent tried myspace music yet. They bring a good combination of styles to their music which should be a treat for all heavy metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all metal fans!","review":"4.99 stars-- Gizmanchi sounds like no other metal band. Their unique blend of technical rythmes, explosive drums, and melodic vocals make this a must have for all metal fans. Don't be misdirected, most of the vocals are not melodic. Sean Kane (vocals) has the most intense, unique scream I have ever heard. Another highlight of \\"the Imbuing\\" is the intricuit rythmes and tempo changes. I've been playing the drums for 14 years and I have trouble playing along to these rythmes on my steering wheel. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because there aren't enough tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman in the 60's","review":"Superman in 1966. WOW.

This is his least favorite of the three collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very lame show that I remember","review":"When I ordered this DVD, I forgotten how bad this show was. In 1966, I was a 13 year old dreaming of one day becoming a top notch cartoonist. I've reading comic books since the age of 6. So I know what's good and what's awful when it came to cartoons and comics. This show which was showcased as the man of steel's long awaited return to TV. I was very disappointed. The animation was stiff, the stories was weak, It was as if they forgot those great superman cartoons of the 40's.I took a chance on seeing this stuff from adult eyes, and not of a 13 year old.

And all the segments are connected to each other and form a integrated work of art -- not just visually, but in terms of ideas. And make no mistake, it is a wonderful piece of art. They arranged some of the music into shorter-than-composed bits? Hey, symphonies do that all the time. The important thing here is the synergy between the sound and the image.If you can't see what's going on, try watching Seven Brides for Seven Brothers first. That will spur some ideas.Fantasia 2000 is a perfect example of Disney's best work. It's appropriately rated G, but is filled with so many ideas that people of all ages and backgrounds may enjoy it in many different ways.Better than the first? No but just as good in its own way."},{"rating":"1","title":"classical music for those with add","review":"I was not a big fan of the first Fantasia, but this is so much worse.

It didn't happen. Fantasia was a beautiful movie with good music. Fantasia 2000 made a mockery of the artistry that went into the original. It was like taking \\"Star Wars\\" (circa 1977), and since it was old, replacing it with (you name any bad flick). Yes, the graphics were a little better, but the movie, and the whole feel of a once masterpiece, was disheartening. Only the people that had seen Fantasia in the original will understand; I would pay to see the original Fantasia on the screen, although the newer fantasia disgusted me. If you change the name, it would be OK, but don't defame fantasia.

Those familiar with the tragically beautiful story of the Steadfast Tin Soldier will recognize this happy-ending version as a desecration. And just how is the original \\"Sorceror's Apprentice\\" improved by the addition of a trash-talking prologue by Penn and Teller, suitable for a college crowd but not for young kids, about how \\"magic is lies\\"? (Who is it at Disney that thinks snide, wisecracking irony is the stuff of good children's fare?) The \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" segment is indeed impressive, but on the whole, \\"Fantasia 2000\\" does not approach its celebrated predecessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasia 2000","review":"Nothing wrong with the film; the DVD was obviously a counterfeit reproduction of the real thing.

It is not as good as the original but it is just as vibrant and colorful. This film has something that the original did not have, celebrities. Steve Martin, Better Midler, and Angela Lansbury introduce some of the musical pieces. The animation is really beautiful to watch. I highly reccomend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasia 2","review":"Not as good as its essential award-winning predecessor, Fantasia 2000 is too computer animated for my liking: Sometimes the most beautiful animation isn't the most realistic-looking. Loved the idea for the humpback whale scene but disliked it for its overusage of computer animation. Still good, but no cigar to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"If you ask me, this is certainly the best Disney movie, I have seen in a long, long, time. I feel that to get more people to see this version then the original Fantasia was to get celebrities, and humorous cartoons inside the film to introduce each segment. But, if you're a fan of the following songs, Beethoven's 5th symphony, Pines of Rome, Rhapsody In Blue, Piano concerto no. 2 (shostakovich), Carnival Of the Animals, Pomp and Circumstance, or the Firebird Suite, this is a must see film. The animation is surely more clear and clean than the original. If you own a collection of Fantasia movies, this is one you must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantasia","review":"I was not new to this video. I saw the original on a huge surround screen in Columbus, Ohio. While critics say this is not as good as Fantasia \\"1\\", it is something original and beautiful and may not have passed muster with Walt (he was a perfectionist) it is a continuation of the art/music thematic material of original Disney...not the totally \\"commercial cutesy\\" that \\"makes a buck\\". I am shocked that very young kids \\"get it\\" as well as adults. Not many keep a dry eye with the Donald Duck/Daisy Duck \\"Noah\\" theme. And if one does not have Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer's Apprentice, you have it on this disk and updated in color and sound. A collector's item, yes.

This new version of Fantasia is much more entertaining for the modern movie-viewer than the older one (which I always fall asleep during).

Most of the 'new' animation is inferior to the first Fantasia. One of the better segments is Socerer's Apprentice, directly taken form the original Fantasia. Too much time wasted in pointless celebrity introductions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When Fantasia came out in 1938, it bombed. Many years later, the movie received the acclaim it deserved. Fantasia has enchanted me since I was a child, and I eagerly awaited Fantasia 2000. The possibilities! I was sure Disney would come up with something to rival the original.What I saw was a humorless, boring mish-mash with only a few bright spots. The opening segment of whales flying through space was embarrassingly bad. Silly flamingos also fell flat. Donald Duck as Noah was terrific. The Gershwin piece was ok, but not for Fantasia. And what should have been the crowning achievement, a forest nymph battling to save her beloved forest, was predictable and stale.This film was almost a complete waste of my time and money. I heartily, heartily, endorse the orginal Fantasia as a timeless classic for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantasia","review":"The Disney animators have done an outstanding job connecting images to great works of music, bringing them to life for today's audiences. As a music teacher this is an excellent resource for stimulating interest in works by the great composers. Teachers and students at my school are mesmerized over and over again for 16 minutes as they take in Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue with its multiple storylines illustrated in the style of Al Hirschfeld. All of the selections are presented in unique and interesting fashion. There is something for everyone. It's an entertaining, inspiring and educational movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Original","review":"Fantasia 2000 is even better than the original Fantasia. It really is laugh-out-loud funny in some areas, particularly the flamingo and his yo-yo segment. And other segments are absolutely visually dazzling. It's virtually impossible to find in retail stores now (because it's in Disney's Vault Collection). I bought a \\"like new\\" one on Amazon and it really is like new, and a great buy!

It is terrible. The pieces are mere snippets of the original works. The animation was way below Disney ability and the awkward dialogue from famous people in between pieces was HORRIBLE. Dont waste your time with this one. You would be better off purchasing the original works (for instance, Stravinsky's Firebird) on CD and listening to them with your kids. The first Fantasia is heads and shoulders above this cop-out-cash-in production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disney Disgrace","review":"While Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940) expanded the animation frontier and was also the first film to have a stereo soundtrack (it was called \\"Fanta-Sound\\"), this sequel to Fantasia is a poor excuse for a film and is another fine example of Disney studios' drop in producing quality films. While the choices of music for this film were wonderful, the combination of computer animation and cell animation created an awful looking mess for one to view. The introductions by people such as Steve Martin and Penn & Teller only cheapened the film and Walt Disney's original intentions of creating a visual concert.The only highlight of this film for me was Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue set to animation done in the style of Herschfield. With all that has been said, I personally do not reccommed this film. Instead watch the original Fantasia or Snow White. This film is good to place under wobbly furniture or if you need a frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I adore the original Fantasia and was eagerly awaiting Fantasia 2000. There were only 3 segments of the release worth seeing - the whales in \\"The Pines of Rome, the flamingos, and the spectacular \\"Rite of Spring\\".While the Gershwin piece is well done, it just doesn't fit the theme of \\"fantasy\\" I associate with Fantasia. There is even 1 piece that looks as if a 2-yr old did the animation!Not worth seeing if you loved the original.

Maybe not every song is complete but it covers alot of ground and the picture and sound quality is top notch. The Rolling Stones material is greatly improved, which bodes well for the upcoming Stones on Sullivan set. And although it isn't listed on the packaging, there are 2 excellent bonus features, where David Crosby and Michelle Phillips think back on their Sullivan appearances and the 60s in general. Phillips gives a really in-depth and honest explanation of the breakup of the Mamas and The Papas, which is really interesting to hear, and the Crosby interview is a lot of fun.

I suppose, though, that King has very little understanding of self acceptance and that it would have been even more dangerous had he offered advice to others.In a time when there is an increased scrutiny of anyone in the GLBT community, King has taken only one step out of the closet and pushed many of his brothers much deeper inside.

They are confused because they are missing the one big piece of the puzzle that would allow them to make sense of their lives.

I believe J.L. trying to help his pockets more than help the black sisters. And second book \\"Coming Up From The Down Low\\" proves this. All he doing is capitalizing on the hype. Now I'm not saying that there aren't down low men preying on our black sisters, I just didn't like how he basically tells his readers he confused and distorted version of homesexuality. For a grown man to sit there and tell me his not gay but he haves sex with other men is obsurd. QUIT MAKING UP SAD PITIFUL EXCUSES FOR SLEEPING WITH OTHER MEN. Accept your sexuality and deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"This is one of those books that make the reader wince and almost feel like a voyeur. But it is also an important book for all people interested in why people choose to live a lie, or live a life devoid of concern for the other gender as well as innocent children.It's an excellent book as far as a wake up call for those who wonder why a certain segment of our society seems to be floundering and destroying itself.I also suggest that this isn't a black issue, but one that crosses ALL racial groups, since I have heard for decades that Latino men live similar choices sexually.As a woman it is a book that ALL women should read a be forewarned about.Knowledge in power!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BASH YOUR BROTHA's","review":"J.L.King, may have meant well with this long an dwordy piece but all he did was badh his own people.

I never thought I would see the day when one man took the Church's condemnation and made it PC. That hurts alot of people in the process. The Most horrifying thing about the book is that it is being revered for its stereotypes of men. Now he has given homophobia a new weapon against the homosexual community.

The best advice is do not have sex until your married and get him tested too.We really had a problem with the author talking about everybody else's story and not enough about himself. In addition, I didn't like the comment the author made: sleeping with men is no longer a sin because he doesn't lie to women about his life.

I know plenty of women who desire a man so badly that they would never suspect anything and would take what on earth they can get. This is very important book for all females. The novel starts with a tough masculine security officer, a husband and father, unfaithful to his wife by having sex with a transvestite. He tries to deny his appetites but he lost the battle becomes sexually engaged with the transvestite, other men, women, and adolescent boys and girls.

However, YOU usually sign yours, Ms. Diva, so why are you hiding behind the mask of anonymity on your bogus five star review of this book?

It could have been a great opportunity to relate different experiences, so that all walks of life can understand (or at least realize) the desire for a married man to be with another man. King blows it, big time. There is no grasp of story structure, no levity attached to the people described and (most damaging) no sense of confidence within the writer and his sexuality. This book exists for the sole purpose of capitalizing on controversial topics for the sake of money. If you bought it (like I did), recycle it in hopes that a better book will be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"King's book is paranoid and uninformitive.

God isn't man and doesn't work like you all work, thank goodness for that. Not all gay men hav AIDS.....and think........your negative attitudes are what make it so hard for men to come out and be themselves. Its such a catch 22.

One of my African-American friends educated me about the pervasive homosexuality among Afrcan-American men. The rate of homosexualiy and bisexuality among African-American men has been reliably estimated at 33%. This has created a dire situation for African-American women and African women as well. These \\"Down Low\\" activities are spreading HIV like wildfire through the female black community. The epidemic of black men having sex with each other and hiding it from their female partners is common in and outside of the United States. \\"On the Down Low\\" is a education tool and a courageous eye on an African and African-American cultural epidemic. It takes courage to admit to a problem and this problem is taking innocent female African-American lives each day. Great book! A good start in the quest for solutions to HIV! Super work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but....","review":"This book seemed like Gay 101.

WOW...And because the DL man is your everyday Professional, Thug, or Ladies' Man - it makes me more aware of my husband's actions. He is definitely a Man's Man, but I see that no one is excluded from living life on the DL!A great book! I give it 5 stars, an A+, and lots of kudos to Mr. King for being so candid!

I have a daughter myself and I would hate for her to became victim to the thoughtlessness of her male partner.

It has been the subject of a lot of dialogue, as it should be, especially in African American and other minority communities disproportionately affected by AIDS.On the whole it was enlightening, and also surprising how wide-spread the DL is. What appalled me about the author - even more than being on the DL itself - was the rampant promiscuity! So there seems to be another issue here that was neither addressed by the book nor by some of the reviews here -sexual addiction. I lost count of how many partners the author had, how many were forgotten, and how many were not mentioned for the sake of space.The other issue with the DL subject and society at large is education.

I bought this book because of a review that said Nicholls was a writer on the UK Channel 4 show, Cold Feet , which had some of the sharpest scripts on TV. Nicholls has grown, his first novel captures the period from high school to college, where teenagers find themselves in a whole new world which is both exciting and unnerving.The story is very basic but the way he has captured the attitude to life, love, friends and family of a teenage boy is spot on. The real skill here though lies in the comedy. There are some very humorous situations that are laugh out loud funny but the book is also rich in subtle and extremely hilarious observations. This really took me back to my college days and captured the experience perfectly.If you are looking for a book that makes you laugh and (if you are old like me) reminisce, this novel delivers the perfect combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"This book was great.

The trials and tribulations of Brian's life and loves make for some of the funniest prose I've read for a long time. The author nails the mid eighties time period, along with those painful years of young adulthood. You'll be thankful you're not eighteen again, but you'll be smiling all the way through. I loved every page of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"David Nicholls knows his coming-of-age angst","review":"David Nicholls' 'Starter for Ten' was originally released in the US as 'A Question of Attraction.' With BBC Films' cinematic release under the 'Starter...' title (starring James McAvoy of 'Last King of Scotland' fame), Villard is now re-releasing the book Stateside under its original title in order to capture some 'oomph' from the film tie-in.Anyway, it's a nicely written and enjoyable tale by Nicholls, who surely knows his coming-of-age angst. One observation about the movie vs. book: Nicholls' book version of Rebecca Epstein is a lot more sharper-edged and grow-on-you pretty than Rebecca Hall's on-screen portrayal. Ms. Hall, by contrast, will have you at 'hello.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"pale","review":"This novel rambled on and bored me.

As the novel begins, Brian Jackson, the eighteen year old narrator of this charming novel is about to set off for university in England during the mid-1980s, leaving his widowed mother, friends and working class background. Brian yearns to have knowledge, to learn, to have witty conversation, to meet that certain special gorgeous supremely intelligent someone. He gets to college and spends a bit more time than he would like recovering from hangovers and pining away after Alice, the perhaps unattainable girl of his dreams. He finally gets to fulfill a life-long dream: he will represent his university on University Challenge, a quiz type game show. This novel is funny, witty, heartwarming and endearing (but not sappy, not by a longshot). It's great fun to read.

The first section (dealing with birth and early childhood) is kind of neat. But, as the book progresses (through the school years and adulthood), I found myself becoming more and more discouraged. The mostly dysfunctional father/daughter relationships did nothing for me. In fact, several of the anecdotes really disturbed me. The book becomes more of a downer with each page. I ultimately set it aside and did not finish it. To the authors - nice try, but, in my opinion, you did not do what you set out to do.

Because it was published in the 1940s, it includes things that are nearly forgotten, that tie us to our grandparents time. The title word \\"Familiar,\\" is misleading because of so much obscure material. The coverage is so broad it's hard to define. It's definitely in the top dozen or so of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GREATEST book ever !!!!!","review":"I don't remember when I originally got this book, but I can only remember reading and loving it. My Dad loved literature and instilled the appreciation of poetry in me. I can remember him quoting poems word for word from the time I was young until he died at the age of ninety. On his death bed he was still quoting \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee\\". My book was well used. It brought back many memories of my family and I enjoying the great literature in this book. In 1980, our apartment burnt. The book wasn't burnt too badly, but it fell apart. For several years, I looked for it and it was always \\"out of print\\". I finally found it and was ecstatic to have it in my library again. My daughter called me and wanted to get a copy for my grandson who is 12. We have found it here and I just know that he will enjoy it as I have throughout my life. You could say, I grew up through this book.

It had all of the malfunctions the others have described, as well as others--it rang for no apparent reason, would beep for no reason (not necessarily at regular intervals), the speakerphone is SO quiet it's unusable. The backlight on the handset is SO dim you can't read the buttons, and they are very small, so are hard to read even in the light of day.I was so excited about these phones--but this was a huge disappointment.

Dom Joly explores a number of themes (answering an absurdly large mobile phone, running away, cliched spy scenes) in the same way as a painter explores the themes. I would say get this collection as compared to the whole series, it has the best skits in about the right quantity.There is no \\"canned laughter\\" laugh track in the background - which adds kudos to the production.

Chambers writes well, but doesn't have much to say. Having lived a complex and troublesome relationship with my mother (I am now 53) I found Chambers skimmed over and oftentimes left out the most critical things that happen between mothers and daughters. I attribute this to her youth. You can't write a memoir like this when you, like Chambers, are a single woman in her early twenties. As the mother of teenage daughters I can understand and sometimes forgive what I went through with my mother. Mothers and daughters need the distance, experience and maturity that years provide.

Until someone sits down and records the whole ballet - and offers it at a sensible price - this will have to do. Just a point in passing ... why does ballet music, opera and classical CDs have to still be so expensive? Almost all of the composers are dead - most a long time dead - so whose pockets are we lining .. and why? ie: The 3 ballets by Delibes (Coppelia, Sylvia & La Source) = 30+ delivery @ ROH; but only 12 delivered from Amazon ... for the same thing!

If your USB ports are on opposing sides of your computer (as they are on mine, a PowerBook G4), you'll need to either get a small USB hub or some other external power supply for the drive itself, as it needs both USB cables to be plugged into the computer to function without external power.Aside from that irritating fact, which I imagine is only a problem for a small percentage of customers, this drive looks good and functions as advertised.

Perfect for pancakes, grilled sandwiches and quisadillas: especially if you want to make enough of them so all of you can sit down and eat together.

The action scenes were pretty well written, but when it came to character development, there was far too much \\"tell\\" and not enough \\"show.\\"There were numerous clunky phrases, and many descriptions (especially of Jannes' history) were repeated over and over again.I was disappointed.

We have a copy that was given to us and my son sometimes asks for me to read it to him. I cringe every time. I should just get rid of it. The baby bunny wants to run away and every idea he comes up with is squashed by his mother until he is so defeated he just gives up and decides he'll stay after all. The mother bunny doesn't talk to him about what feelings are causing him to want to run away or all the reasons that running away is not a good idea nor does she try to distract him with positive attention. Instead she forces him back to her. I am sure that this baby bunny will turn into a rebellious teenage bunny because he has such a rigid, controlling mother bunny. There are many other books out there that do a much better job of portraying a mother's love. On a positive note, the color illustrations are lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who finds the message of this book troubling?","review":"I've never quite understood the appeal of this book. I received it for my baby shower along with some other board book classics and had never read it before. I immediately returned it. All I could think was -- wow, this bunny really hates his mother. Maybe if the mother would give him a little space he wouldn't put so much of his energy and imagination into how to get away from her! Especially the part about if he were a sailboat who she'd turn into the wind to blow him where SHE wanted him to go (not to be the wind in his sails). And he only even wants to stay with her in the end because clearly trying to have any independence is a lost cause. It's not like it occurs to him how much she presumably loves him. Ugh.

This is a tale of a small bunny who says he is going to run away from home. His mother tells him she will pursue him.For instance, the bunny says he will become a fish and swim away. The mother says she will become a fisherman and catch him. Each of these pairs is done illustrated with a black and white drawing (very nicely done) and a color spread (too garish and lacking the detail of the black and whites).In the end, the bunny's spirit is defeated and he resolves himself to staying home with his mother (Well then, I might as well just stay home). The underlying message is that you can not get away from your mother so you may as well not even try.This is my opinion, my wife's, and the four grandparents'. Friends with children have agreed with us about the depressing nature of this so-called classic. There are plenty of better books out there for our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so scary...","review":"I think this book is awful. My little sister received it from a relative, and actually had nightmares about it. It's not a good thing to stalk your kids, seriously. Let them have a bit of autonomy and some room to grow and develop in their own ways. Heck, even if they run away, it's probably okay.

In the story, the childrabbit wants to separate from his mother. For each methodhe comes up with, the mother tells how she will, in effect,hunt down the child. I did not get the feeling of the mother'slove from this; rather, I felt that the mother was assertingher \\"ownership\\" over the child.

It soon becomes clear enough. She threatens to stalk him wherever he goes. There is little love or support expressed, instead it comes across as, \\"you'll never escape my clutches, no matter how hard you try.\\" No wonder he keeps trying to get away.A much healthier message would be, \\"I will always love and support you as you explore the world and develop your own identity.\\" Those looking for a book conveying parental love could check out \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" (although it does contain some competitive overtones).

Who knows what the magic formula for children book success is? But Runaway Bunny, like Goodnight Moon, is one of the magic, perfect all-time classics. In our house, when we asked the kids to pick out a book to read, they more often than not chose this one from the dozens available on the bookshelf. The main bunny character wakes up early while the rest of his family is still snoozing. He goes about his fun adventure, then when he returns to his bunny home, his family wakes up and goes about their day, while Runaway Bunny goes back to bed. The idea of the bunny being alone in nature for a while seems to appeal to a child's fear of isolation, while also stimulating the idea that a bit of solitude is needed to stimulate creativity and personal growth. A joy to read. Your children will love it and you'll love reading it to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's favorite","review":"My 4 year old loves this book and has for atleast 2 years now!

One, this book has a narrative thread: it has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It's the next step beyond recounting a list of items in a room and then wishing them a goodnight. Two, my son Ethan loves this book above all others. That's the single most important factor to me.It has pretending in it, some minor adventure, and hidden gems if you care to find them (especially if you notice the tie between all three in the series).

Looks like some people like to overanalyze. I enjoy the message and don't view it as an overprotective mother stalking her child. Instead, I viewed it as a mother who watches over her child no matter where he/she may roam or whatever paths he/she may take. This mother remains constant in her love. I enjoy the playful banter between parent and child and see it as a positive book, not a \\"creepy\\" tale as other users have put it.

It's like a horror movie where the mom has gone insane and hunts down her child who dearly wishes to escape her.I understand that most people see this book as a mother reassuring her baby that she will be there for him no matter what he becomes and where he goes... But it doesn't read that way at all. If you were to read this book not knowing that it was a children's book, you would be scared.I found it menacing. I own it but I don't read it to my baby. I don't want her to feel that it's likely that a mom would treat her baby this way. It's evil stuff.Check this book out of the library if you must. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunnies do not talk.","review":"This book gives children the wrong impression. As we all know, bunnies do not talk, fish, climb, or run away. This is yet another one of those books that will likely ruin a young child forever. If you read it to your child, he will likely grow up to be a serial killer. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"review by worldoflil.com","review":"My girlfriend reads this to her daughter every night. Being a single mother, it definitely reinforces the love a mother has for a child - and lets the child know that wherever they go - the mother will follow. If you believe in instilling these values in your child at a young age then this is the book for you. It's also a cute tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy will ALWAYS love you.","review":"My mother read this to me as a child. We haven't always had the most stable relationship, and in my teens, I WAS a runaway. Now that I'm grown, we share this book as a symbol of motherly love. I highly recommend this book for mothers and their children. It is sweet and comforting and loving and will stay with your children forever....just like you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrations are the best","review":"This book is adorable! Such beautiful illustrations and such a sweet momma/child message. I highly recommend for anyone's collection ---adult or child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter likes it !","review":"My daughter loves the story and pictures. I find it alittle boring but she requests that I read it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite for our family","review":"This is one of those beloved childhood classics for many people -- but, despite its reputation, it's not a favorite for our family. The mother bunny's pursuit and control of her baby seems more like persecution than tenderness -- i.e., when he becomes a fish, she catches him on a hook, not exactly a loving act. I like the one image of the baby as a bird, coming to roost in the tree his mother has become -- but otherwise, this isn't a book that portrays the kind of relationship I have (or want) with my little son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic snoozer","review":"I know she's a respected author, but aside from Goodnight Moon, I find her rhythm to be flat and the storylines rather boring. I can't get through this book without wishing it would end. My daughter doesn't seem at all excited about it either. We like Sandra Boynton stuff better. Classic or not - this book is a snoozer."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book may grow on your kids, it did mine!","review":"My 7 month old daughter won't even sit through 2 pages of this book. I think the black and white pictures were a bad idea on the part of the publisher.Update: Now my daughter is 2 years old, and she likes the book much more than she did. She likes finding the bunny in some of the pictures. Sometimes you might think a toy or book is not going to be too popular at your house, but sometimes you have to wait a while and try it again. Kids will sometimes change their minds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"General Dislike for such a Classic","review":"Wanting my child's library to include all of the classics, The Runaway Bunny seems like a perfect fit. Unfortunately, it is one of my least favorite book purchases. The reviewers that state it has a creepiness to it are spot on. The story is neither comforting or enjoyable. The colors used, on the few pages that are in full color, are very brash. They remind me of the colors you see in a 70s style kitchen. I regret the addition of this book to my child's library due to not liking the story, its illustrations, and color palette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The book and pictures are fine, but the story is awful. The mother bunny is totally smothering - give the kid some space! Just because the little rabbit needs some space doesn't mean the love is not there. The only part I like is when the mother turns into a tree. At least the little rabbit can choose to fly back instead of being constantly hounded! I have to explain to my kids (2 and 3 years old) that it is okay for them to want to be alone sometimes whenever I read this book to them (which is not often)."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful in its creepiness","review":"The illustrations are lovely but the whole story is just creepy to me and smothering. I think there are better books to illustrate that you'll always be there for your child and love them in a non-creepy way. I like \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" or \\"Kiss Goodnight\\" or well almost any other book. This book just seems to squash a child's imagination with a doggedly determined mother that will go out and capture you and bring back where you belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite Book","review":"I bought this book for my 17 mo old b/c he is quite obsessed with Goodnight Moon and I like the black and white and color illustrations in both. I knew what The Runaway Bunny was about, but I don't feel that comfortable reading it to my child.I understand that children need to feel secure in their world and know that their mothers are there for them. I understand that that is the book's message, I also feel like I am telling my child that I will thwart his attempts at independence.I don't want him to think that is what mothers want for their children. I feel compelled to clarify this for him as I read it.The illustrations are great though. A better book that deals with a child's autonomy is \\"I Love You Stinky Face\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runaway from this book","review":"I'm sorry to be so negative but I don't really like this book. The story seems to long and the pictures are kind of weird. AFter reading and loving Goodnight Moon, I found this story not at all interesting and it felt like it was just thrown together.My little one loses interest in this book about halfway through so we have never read it in one sitting.Borrow this."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Overprotective Moms","review":"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyThis imaginative book reassures children that Mom will always love them and be there for them, even if they are angry or feel like running away. Yet, I find it unsettling how the mother bunny is so determined to undermine her child's sense of independence. One line is particularly disturbing: the little bunny says he will become a sailboat and sail away, and the mother answers, \\"I will become the wind and blow you where I want you to go.\\" I'm not a psychologist or anything, but this line seems so controlling - not a message I want to give my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the message here?","review":"I have read it a few times because my son likes it. Every time I read it, I like it less. Here is the message I get from the book:Don't spread your wings... because if you do, I'm coming to clip them.It reminds me of the lyrics from Pink Floyd's \\"Mother\\".Mother (1994 Digital Remaster)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book's Good, but the CD Rocks!!!","review":"All the children to whom I have given this book enjoy it very much. However, I also always give the book along with the CD. With Brook Shields narrating, and wonderful music, the CD makes the book \\"read along\\" in a way that every child seems to really enjoy. I highly recommend the music/narrated version as well. Together, they are a great gift. I reall like the Brooke SHields/Glen Roven version.The Runaway Bunny/Paddington Bear's First Concert/Tubby the Tuba"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing more than a classic transformation story","review":"This is a type of story that has been told almost as long as there have been storytellers, except that this story is (uniquely?) suitable for preschoolers and babies.The little bunny declares he'll run away for no other reason than because he can say such a thing. At that age, children say all sorts of silly things, but they really still want their parents to run after them and hug them - which is what the mama bunny here does."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"i love this book. It is THE present I give at baby showers. I think every child should have this book in their collection. It is such a precious and tender story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"This touching, classic story is beautifully illustrated. The board book version is the perfect size for new \\"readers.\\" It's a great one to cuddle up with before naptime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Runaway Bunny","review":"This was one of my boys favorite books when they were toddlers. I bought the book and the bunny for my granddaughter and I'm hoping she will love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for board book","review":"This is a lovely book but my daughters did not have the attention span for this book until they were at least 18 months - 2 years. Therefore, there's no need to have a board-book version of this book. It's really not intended for infants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book on tape","review":"My children love to listen to this story. After the story is read on track one, it is performed by two folk musicians on track 2. We are really enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From then 'til now","review":"Packing for college, I ran across my battered copy of Runaway Bunny. It came with me... and trust me when I tell you I run in the opposite extreme of overpacking. I would still have my mother read me this book if I could have brought HER with me too, but for now I know that I'll someday read it to my own children. This classic came from the same author as Goodnight Moon, and I must say this was certainly up to that standard. I think the mother bunny in this book provides a great example to other parents, not stifling a child's independence or creativity, but building on it, while at the same time providing love. The Runaway Bunny spoke to me then and now in different, but equally strong ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the first book","review":"This book takes place back before the the first book. Sisters were not yet searching for lost Taelach children. Rankil is born in a time when the Taelach are hunted and burned like witches. They have yet to find their power.I think this book was much better than the first and the next book is even better yet.The struggles Rankil goes through are very close to the stories I hear over and over again from many of the teens I meet.Read them all and you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"still waiting","review":"A few weeks ago I ordered a swiss army knife and it was not the one I wanted. I called the company that I had ordered it from and they said to send it back and they would try to get me the model I wanted. I asked for an RA number and they said I did not need one. This was a mistake because it has been weeks and I have not heard anything. My credit card was charged for thirty some dollars and I do not have anything to show for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it zero stars if I could","review":"This book was terrible. I read Goethe's and Marlowe's versions of the Faust legend a few years ago. The Faust legend is one of the best stories in literature, but \\"Jack Faust\\" is disgusting. It is unnecessarily profane. In my opinion it is an insult to the venerable Faust legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book before you read Hillary's new book","review":"In this intruguing expose by the former FBI agent who spilled the beans on Bill and Hillary Clinton back in 1997, Gary Aldrich reminds us all why the Clinton's aren't to be trusted. Aldrich goes a step farther in Thunder on the Left and shows how the entire Democtatic Party is now beholden to the Clinton's and other left-wing radicals. Aldrich writes like a seasoned investigator and this book is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"A must read for anyone conserned with the state of the nation - on par with Coulter and Noonan."},{"rating":"2","title":"keep up exposing the left's threat to America","review":"My thanks to Mr. Aldrich for giving us this fine book. Exposing the serious threat to America and our way of life is something there cannot be an overabundance of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that...","review":"I can see why none of the larger conservative publishers wanted to put this out. And don't give me that \\"liberal media \\" bunk. While a poorly written book, it's better than most of the hack jobs that come out on Regnery (his former publisher) or Sentinal, Crown Forum and WND for example. But really, this is just a dull book. I'm a democrat, and would probably be considered liberal by Mr. Aldrich. But that doesn't mean I'm a blind sheep who doesn't see the corruption of politicians on all sides at the top. That's the problem with books like these. It almost reads like a superhero drama with the Republicans and conservatives as our valiant heros, and the Democrats and liberals as villians. When you start with a premise that small minded and immature, you come out with a poorly grounded book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disappointed","review":"Gary's new book starts promisingly enough, sketching out how a vast left-wing conspiracy has inched its tentatcles throughout the chambers of the Democrat Party's heart. Gary skillfully reveals the hidden connections between such well known figures of the left as Ralph Nader and Al Gore. But then, with his discussion of the \\"UFO crash\\" in Roswell, New Mexico, Gary makes an astonishing leap: We are to believe a Democratic cover-up has, for decades, concealed the introduction of Martian genetic material into human DNA? This might an interesting premise for a science fiction novel, but I expected more from a serious work of political theory. Sorry, Gary. You let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"Mr. Aldrich's thesis is that everything evil in the U.S, is due to the \\"hard left\\" and can only be corrected by the \\"soft-hearted right.\\" THUNDER ON THE LEFT describes his hatred of the Clintons, the Democratic party and anything he sees as liberal. Reading this book, one can almost imagine Mr. Aldrich's red face, the spittle dripping from his mouth and the veins standing out on his neck.If you're not convinced by his show of emotion, you won't be convinced. The book references no evidence to back up its' charges, nor the reasoning behind any assertions. For example, \\"It's a fact that Clinton's like-minded political operatives monkey-wrenched national security safeguards in every important agency in the executive branch.\\" The book gives no evidence or examples of this \\"monkey-wrenching\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rant from one of the polar crusaders.","review":"Every political book that is released these days, apart from being unconditionally lauded by the leading newspapers, reeks of politcal polarity where the authours tout the general reader to whichever end of the political spectrum they associate with, using petty ad hominem attacks and facile moral oneupsmanship. The result is a thinning of genuine political discusion where policy issues and direction are argued with their 'team' and the associated policy bagage in mind and not considered reason and concesional admittance where it is due.Thunder on the Left is no exception, if you root for the reds, you'll love this book, if you barrack for the blues, try Hillary's Living History.N.B. to barrack is Australian for shouting support for your team."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"This looks a lot like the one I bought at home depot.
