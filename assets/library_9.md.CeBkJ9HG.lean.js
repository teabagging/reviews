When I saw the album cover with them larger than life, I thought cool more fantastic KISS. I am not a fan of Disco then or now, and I listened to this and was broken hearted. It was some of the worst crap I have ever heard. Charisma is the only decent song on it. I had not listened to this in a long time so I did the MP3 download to see if time changed anything. I still hate Disco and I still do not like this one, but being a loyal KISS fan I own it. The best version of I Was Made For Loving You is on Alive 3. Paul Stanley growls it up so it is not so disco like. I would not recommend this one if you want a taste of KISS. Instead, go back to the beginning, up through Love Gun, and you will not be disappointed.

I wasn't a KISS fan during the 70's -- I was still a bit young -- so I didn't hear this album until the late 80's. At that point, KISS were a different band, and it was easier to look back on their older material with a more detached perspective -- I wasn't expecting anything in particular from each album. That being said, this is a very good, consistent album. Sure, \\"I Was Made For Lovin You\\" is goofy, but the rest of the album is great. \\"Dirty Living\\" is the only song Peter plays on (and sings lead vocals on), and it is my all-time favorite Peter Criss song. Some of my favorite Ace songs are here as well.

It sounds okay. the first movement seems a bit short. It's about 4 minutes long. Symphony no. 29 doesn't sound too bad. Like Symphony no. 25, the first movement is about 3 minutes shorter than usual. The last selection on this CD, the \\"Haffner\\" symphony, is performed the best. It is a good performance, but it cannot compare to the live performance given by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra during this past season. Like the other symphonies, the first movement of this one is also a few minutes shorter than usual.

It touches on the important stuff, but doesn't delve into nearly enough detail. Too much of the book (2 big chapters) is devoted to going through a single example design for a microprocessor, instead of going through multiple smaller designs which could give a better overview of the possible language constructs.The most serious problem, in my opinion, is that the index is terrible. I find what I want only about 50% of the time. Try looking up how to invert a signal, for example. It's not under NOT, Invert, or anything else you might think of.Otherwise, the book does provide some useful information.

Paul preached specifically in Corinthians on the subject of grace giving, not tithing. As New Testament believer's we are to give as we are led by the Holy Spirit. This is important for you to know: Your \\"Blessing\\" and the gift of the Holy Spirit come by faith in Christ, and that alone (read Galatians).

The movie has as a background the historical clash between Islam and Christianity that started since the birth of the former and where Christianity was most on the time on the defensive until the Crusades came about.

It's not something I would want to watch over and over again either. The battle scene is great though. People talk about the crusades as some foolish thing in the past, but try to imagine riding a horse and taking a ship over a huge distance like that to fight for something you believed in. We can only imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, though not Sir Ridley's finest","review":"It wasn't Gladiator but it wasn't bad. It was actually very entertaining, which is the director's intention. I'm a Medieval History buff myself with particular interest in the Crusades, and I (like some of you) could go on about this film's historical inaccuracies. But being historically accurate is NOT the director's intention. Ridley Scott directed a work of fiction, not a documentary.As to the film itself, I viewed for what it is and enjoyed it very much. The climax seige of Jerusalem was very well done; I'll never tire of watching trebuchets in action (especially real ones as opposed to CG ones). Good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be honest . . .","review":"This film is HORRIBLY inaccurate, historically. It is, in fact, a \\"nachtmare.\\" The acting isn't bad, and some of the action scenes, as far as they are *just* action scenes, are good. However, the historical inaccuracy of the film is just something I cannot get around. If you like this film, I do not wish to insult you - just please, please, please . . . do NOT think this is in any way actual history, or any sort of fair to middling approximation thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extras on Blu-Ray version","review":"My comment is not about the movie (excellent) or the Blu-Ray transfer (also excellent), but the absence of extras on the Blu-Ray release.

This is nothing more than a \\"poke in the eye\\" with respect to current US political stance on the Middle East. The nauseating pontificating from Orlando Bloom and his ilk during promo period for the film confirmed this. Islam WAS NOT tolerant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm, 4 and 5 stars? You sure you don't work for the studio?","review":"Seriously, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in awhile. I was really hyped up and saw it the first weekend of it's release in Theaters.The reasons:1) For me, I can only feel and get attatched to 1 char in the movie; which was the leper(Edward Norton).2) If this movie wasn't cut to pieces, then it was one of the worst put together movies I have ever seen. The movie just jumps from one scene to the next, with no rhyme or reason. It is missing alot of filler that is needed to flesh out the script.3) I actually felt jipped when leaving the movie, don't think I have ever felt that way(there are bad movies, but this set a new standard).I'm really, really hoping that there is a Director's Cut. A little redemption would go a long way in making me feel better about this film.AVOID this version, wait for Director's Cut if the rumors are true!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice one","review":"the BD version had a very nice and clear HD vision, it's really good about the physical side, but I am not quite like the story. it's just like other history movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the movie - hated the packaging!","review":"I'm writing this out of frustration. I saw the ending twice on HBO - Free week-end - liked what I saw so decided to order from Amazon. The only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that I have yet to figure out how to open. There is a red plastic piece on the right side. It can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open. I tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked. Those discs are inside for good. I'm going to Best Buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab. Obviously I'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened. But, as I said before, what I did get to see of the movie, (the last half hour) on hbo . . . I liked. A slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie, was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladiator caliber","review":"This is an excellent movie with good casting, story, special effects, camera work, music, and sets. If you enjoy movies like Gladiator, The 13th Warrior, Troy, Robin Hood, et cetera you will probably enjoy this movie. Our main character played by Bloom finds himself in a ackward predicament in protecting the crown and being infatuated with a beautiful young lady. A great deal of epic battle scenes, knightly honor, and court intrigue make this well worth a look. It may not have been a big hit at the box office, but it certainly merits at least a rental. I didn't catch it at the theater, but after renting it I ended up buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"I have read the story and the movie already on TV.

It's not even Hannibal or GI Jane or (heaven forbid) 1492.Christians are for the most part, bad. Moslems are good and you best get your roman tails out of Jerusalem.With that said, Orlando Bloom cannot carry a movie, you don't care about most of the characters. Christian religious zealots are bad (I feel the need to repeat it because the movie certainly does ad nauseum). The script and the story are light brush strokes on what had the potential to be a lovely colorful canvas.If you can suspend your tolerance for indifferent writing and some poorly casted parts - I am sure many will enjoy the special effects.While Ridley Scott has successfully created other worlds you feel a part of, this isn't one for me.Rent, don't Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Inacurate / Politically Correct","review":"This was a great film, but if your looking for true history, you will be disappointed. Also, he (Ridley Scott) makes Saladin a hero of sorts and does not mention his massacres at Hattin or the massacres that were about to ensue in Jerusalem. I only wish it would have been more \\"politically incorrect\\" so it could have been closer to the truth. The majority of the reviewers here are primarily apologetic left-wingers that like things sugar coated. For them, i recommend reading the New York Times Bestseller \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and The Crusades) for starters, so they can see what Islam is really about. Thus, this film remains together with Aliens, pure fiction.p.s. I don't subscribe to either religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"More effective than counting sheep!","review":"The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson (sp?) are good actors.

It was torture to watch it. I finally gave up after an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing film","review":"I was ready to love this film but was bitterly disappointed. For one thing, a man did not just decide to become a knight at age 18. He had to begin training when he was three years old. Chivalry was a way of life, not a career. The sets were very authentic but if they had stuck more with the real story it would have been magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"False history","review":"Although I had a little hope that Ridley Scott wouldn't have given the crusades a Hollywood treatment, Kingdom of Heaven turns out to be utter crap! Everyone who even has the slightest historical knowledge knows, that the cristian knights butchered all Arabs that weren't willing to accept their religious thoughts. And what do we see here? The cristians are nothing but good guys that mean no harm and the Arabs are like the indians from Dances with Wolves: humble, brave and sophisticated men with a noble code of honour.The only villains in the movie are the Templars that are looking for a holy war. To achieve this they murder some innocent Arabs for no reason...so this way giving the peaceful Arabs a reason to start to fight. This movie clearly tries to build a bridge between the Western and the Eastern civilization, but fails hopelessly as it is not telling the truth.(SARR)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good product, delivery was slow and not on the date requested but came a few days later.

Pity that it's such a colossal bore. Ridley Scott's a master artisan whose skills are fully on display in this sumptious production- but even he's struggling to haul a good movie out of a terribly wobbly script and fly weight leading man.There's definately a lot of quality in this elephantine film, including the stellar supporting cast and terrific action scenes, but it doesn't come together with any narrative drive or vigour. And Bloom simply lacks any real screen prescence or charisma to be the hero of this-and he appears much too young to be credible. He'll have you pining for Russell Crowe and (if your a die hard movie buff) Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous unproduced movie about the Crusades that was going to be directed by Paul Vehoeven."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"sleeper\\" crusade movie","review":"This is a good movie. Its flop at the box-office may have more to do with contemporary theatre economics than production values and storyline. The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets and music are outstanding. It is a different angle on the crusades. No, it's not pro Muslim, although it does provide useful glimpses of their viewpoint. It's not particularly pro Christian, either; it shows that all Christians were not of one mind when it came to ruling the holy city. The leaders of both armies, espcially Saladin, come across as decent men dealing with a complicated situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"obviously the \\"too slow\\" guy isn't a histoy buff, or else he wouldn't be saying it was to slow. the movie was full of historical events and it was pretty interesting, and about 10-20 minutes into the movie there is a pretty sweet skirmish, and alot of continous or important information from there out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cult classic","review":"I am sure this film, the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven, will gain a growing reputation over the years, and become another Blade Runner, another Scott epic that initially bombed, but later became a cult item, and then a recognized masterpiece. Shame on studio executives for screwing around with cinematic artists.

It was filmed at dark, at dusk, inside a building or tent with only one candle for light . We turned it off 3/4 of the way through because we could not see it.

This director's cut fills out and expands the story, without making it feel a moment longer.It answers the questions of \\"how did Balian know how to defend a city\\" and \\"How did he know how to fight so well\\" and \\"Why did Sybillia go bonkers like that\\" and all the others.The deep, deep cuts in the theatrical film made so many complex political, religious and personal layers in the story and the characters just go away. They are restored in this cut and it is a glorious movie.Fox really screwed over Ridley Scott, Eva Green and Orlando Bloom by making Scott cut this movie the way they did. The Director's Cut would have been Oscar material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much bad political commentary on this movie","review":"I just read a 1 star revue by a Mr. Volk who blames the Arabs for the crusades.The political truth is that the European crusaders were completely corrupt; they ended up sacking Constantinople on orders from the Venetians and raped and killed wantonly.

The beginning is great in that Mr. Scott comes up front and explains in short what we are about to see and why the story is what is was supposed to be. The characters are more developed and the Orlando \\"pretty boy\\" problem seems to be absent in my opinion. I would agree with, \\"Bloom doesn't have the gravitas of Russell Crowe in the lead (then again, who does?)\\" The director thought he was the right person for the job and he's the boss applesauce. Great editing, and a wonderful soundtrack.I love the way David Thewlis pops in and out. He comes from and goes into nothing a couple of times. Ghassan Massoud is wonderful as Saladin. Eva Green's role is the only fly in the ointment. Her lines seem forced and sometimes a little corny. Her fault or the writer, who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect HD Transfer!","review":"Although this Blu-Ray edition does not have the supplements as the normal DVD version, it is still worth the buy. If you are just getting into the Blu-Ray family, this movie will make you proud. Not only is the picture & sound quality amazing but the movie itself is great. I have notice not all Blu-Ray movie tranfers are amazing due to which studio is doing the transfers. So far in my experience, 20 Century Fox Blu-Ray movies look the best hands down! And this movie is by that studio. So do not be shy, get out there Blu-Ray family and purchase this film, well worth the Buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie and superior DVD release","review":"Presumption: Although I like historical movies, I thought the box office failure indicated a rather long, boring movie. I was not particularly thrilled with Orlando as the lead. I thought the DVD extras would make it worth purchasing.Result: The movie was much better than I thought it would be, and deserves 4 stars on its own. Although long, it was not boring.

Additionally, the Pilgrim's Journey has an amazing amount of information for anyone interested in this time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace Be With You Always","review":"I liked this movie for the obvious reasons, good direction, good acting, and good action. But, the best thing about this movie, in this Hermit Crab's view, is that it isn't just about the action scenes at all. In fact, there are very few extended battles scenes, saving the one at the end. It is more a tale of what true honor is all about, about staying true to your heart and never selling your soul out. This is a message that needs to be integrated into movies, and society itself, more often. Also, it has a strange parallel to what is going on in the Middle East right now. Peace be with you always!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Director's Cut","review":"I really cannot wait for this to come out.

The sets and costumes are just breathtakingly beautiful, with a soundtrack to match. It is even more impressive that it is largely factual, though of course \\"Hollywood-ized\\". The director's cut is almost an entirely different story than the theatrical version, with a huge amount of added material and actual plot changes. While the theatrical version is good, the director's cut is far superior (and makes a lot more sense). It is quite bloody and gory, so probably not great for kids.This is one of my all time favorite movies, which I recommend to everyone.

Therefore, when I found out about this \\"better\\" Director's Cut from Ridley Scott recently, I decided to give this version a try.The movie was about 3 hours long and was indeed much richer than the so called \\"action adventure trailer\\" the theatrical was said to be of this full version. With the extra materials, motivations, backgrounds, and character developements were explored much deeper and gave the film the kind of unity it lacked in the theatrical version. Also, this version is much more graphic then the theatrical version from what I remember.

And the character \\"Belian\\" that he plays - a blacksmith turned warrior/military leader in what seems like 2 seconds flat is just ridiculous.Now the message of the film was very good - about respecting another faith/religion - that we're all part of humanity. Yes, i agree. But Ridley Scott's directing here was 'too much', that is, over-indulgant (especially with respect to the fighting scenes) and too characterized by feigned or affected grandeur.Simply put 'Kingdom of Heaven' felt contrived - and 'epic-ish'."},{"rating":"1","title":"hollywood view","review":"Yet again, Hollywood's political correctness seeks the almighty $.This is Hollywood BS at it's worst.

The reason it failed at the box office I do not know, but when I first saw this movie, i was truly moved by its engrossing storyline. Its magnificant use special effects. I could not find one element of the film that I did not enjoy. You don't like the fact that the christian crusaders were heartless murderers? THATS WHAT THEY DID! They murdered thousands of muslims during those dark times. You do not believe me? research this topic online, read a book on the crusades. or watch the history channel. ALl of the things the christians did really happened in the movie. The names(all but Balian) were real!. NOT FAKE. And yes Gi De Lusenyon'(pardon if i spelled it wrong) did lead an army of 17k christians with his buddy Reynold and was massacred. But besides me correcting all of you non-historians.

It's a movie about medieval siege warfare, and probably the most accurate depiction which you will ever see. Hollywood however loves flaming projectiles. In Middle Ages they had Greek fire, however they did not use flaming rocks or arrows. A better title for this movie would have been Crusade.This movie shows what can go wrong when people start taking greed and fanaticism in the name of religion or any other subject to far, and forget our basic humanity.The movie is visually stunning, and the extras are very good. Particularly the production grid, and Hollywood vs. History. If you find that you like this movie: you might also like, The Wind and The Lion, The Lion in Winter, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and Ivanhoe with Robert Taylor.

Orlando follows him, then inherits his estate after his untimely death. Suddenly, everyone is listening to this nobody from nowhere, and Orlando ends up heroically leading the army of Jerusalem. Huh?I guess movies like this about interesting historical periods are very hard to make. Look at Alexander and Troy.

While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any \\"interesting\\" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release.

I have no problems with the Crusades being told from the Muslim point of view; the problem with this movie is that the Christians are shown as oozing self hate, doubting their mission in the Levant, when in reality, even this late in the Crusades, they deeply believe in the righteousness of their cause (the movie is otherwise relatively accurate in historic terms). Add to that that the action scenes are very poor, that the acting is uniformly bad (Jeremy Irons is particularly terrible, but you can't forget the awfulness of that new invention of the star system, Orlando Bloom, a stand-in for Argentine footballer Ariel Ortega) and you have a very disappointing movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I was a fan of the theatrical release that came out about a year ago.

The Director's Cut is far superior to the original version, in that it fills in many of the holes in the story line.I consider this one of my all-time favorite films - IN SPITE of Scott's ridiculous view of the crusades and the crusaders (many reviewers below fully agree with him, the poor misguided saps) without mentioning the atrocities commited by the Muslims here and in preceeding years. An uninformed person would come away thinking (as many have) \\"Those terrible Christian crusaders. Why would they attack those wonderful, innocent, Muslims.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worth a watch","review":"If you are expecting a movie like gladiator then I will stop you from putting this in your dvd player.

I disagree with some of the other reviewers about the acting, I didn't think it was that bad. Others claimed it showed some Christians as too fanatical, I somewhat agree with them however remember this is not a documentary. I think the intended message behind this was you will find fanactics or idiots everywhere, however you will also find good people as well. There were many historical inaccuracies, however I enjoyed the movie as a movie. If you go to see this movie watch it as a movie not as a documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"do not watch this 145 minute version","review":"I love Ridley Scott. Please watch the Director's Cut (194 minutes). The film is richer & more coherent. It goes from three stars to 4+ in the longer cut. I take off a smidge because there are other actors I would have preferred in Orlando Bloom's role. And, face it, if you're going to watch an historical epic, you want it over 3 hours. Please just let the man work. Beautiful movie, great production, trademark Ridley Scott panoramic shots that look like giant moving oil paintings. Amazon, you suck a little for not offering the Director's cut on Instant Video. Fix this please."},{"rating":"2","title":"KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AN EPIC OF A MOVIE","review":"I found this to be an extremely well done and inspiring epic of the Crusades and some of the things that have been ignored for so long about the realities of those times.

No doubt, it's good action. BUT, Orlando probably wasn't the best choice for the role, and the story is just so bland. Liam Neeson is in it for a whopping 90 seconds.Your thinking \\"Ridley Scott; it's got to be awesome\\". But alas they gave him a budget for good production value but the rest just sucks.

Blooms character would be seen as an infidel. He also does not become a great fighter after 5 minutes of lessons from his father. He says he has no religion, so why even go to Jerusalem?A fiction movie to attract Orlando Bloom fans all for the $$$$$. It's not bad but it's not accurate either.

Maybe a \\"guy\\" thing but I'm tired of movies just going from one battle to the next. I want a story line which this movie didn't have. Yes, there was a story there but not clear and rather improbable.Good costumes and scenery.I kept waiting for something really bad to happen to the son after his proposed wife said he needed to do a little evil for the greater good. Nothing happened except he fought another battle and went home.This high profile movie with good actors (wasted) falls in line with Troy, Alexander and all those huge movies. Just one battle to the next and snippets of dialogue here and there.Bought this movie, but giving it away because it isn't something I'd watch again or give shelf space."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie doesn't deserve stars","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so historically inaccurate it wasn't even funny. I watched this on vacation on the in room movies and I wanted to throw myself from the balcony. The acting was terrible, but that doesn't even matter. It was like they completely ignored the histoy while writing this movie. I had just taken a college history course at my university and we had discussed the Third Crusede (the one this movie is supposed to be about). The main struggle was between Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin. Not Saladin and some random blacksmith. Yes, Saladin took Jerusalem before the Third Crusade, but it did not happen in any way like it was portrayed in the movie. And that's not even the half of it. There were so many things in this movie that were historically inaccurate I could probably write a hundred pages on those alone. Stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kingdom of Ridley Scott","review":"Historically illiterate, intellectually bankrupt, morally confused, absurdly plotted, abysmally acted, and virulently anti-religious (Christophobic and anti-Catholic in particular). In addition to its pernicious agenda, the film delivers its ugly message with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Pretentious, bloated, and full of itself (without the slightest warrant), this is among the worst movies I've ever seen -- and that's saying quite a lot.Anyone who likes this movie either knows nothing of history or shares the abominable Ridley Scott's philistine contempt for and loathing of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I was very pleased with this purchase.

Mack's story revolves around Echo, with DD playing a supporting role and Wolverine makes a surprising appearance to help Echo on her quest. Mack's storytelling is solid, but his superb paints are what the main attraction is here and help the story progress. The only problem with Vision Quest is Mack's superb art. As contradictory as that may sound, his art is and has always been an acquired taste; and that alone will either turn you off or sell you the book. All in all, if your a fan of Daredevil or David Mack, this is worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfect","review":"The Mendelssohn trios are some of the most beautiful music ever written. While I thoroughly enjoyed this recording and would highly reccomend buying it (at a bargain price here), i do have one small problem with it. Stern and Rose accompany each other quite well and while Stern here is at his usual, fiery and passionate, i feel that the pianist, Istomin, failed to match the fire that his accompanists create. Mendelssohn is said to have called his piano trios, \\"piano sonatas with accompaniment\\", as Mozarts works; which puts more emphasis on the piano part. And unfortunately here, there are more passages in whcih Istomin fails to live up to that than there should be. But where he fails, Stern makes up for, and that is why this recording is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Masters, No Waiting","review":"Isaac Stern, Leonard Rose, Eugene Istomin.

Today we have Martha Argerich leading the way; forty years ago it was Isaac Stern (and many cohorts from the Marlboro Festival rallying around Casals and Serkin). On the whole, I enjoy the relzed older style that is represented here. The Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio was made up of virtuosos, but they don't show off in the genial Mendelssohn piano trios. rgerich does, and her propulsive, nervy, spontaneous style lights a spark under the Trio #1 (EMI) in a way that we don't get here. Just compare her feiry palying in the Scherzo to Istomin's more correct, elegant approach. In every respect these are fine performances in an older style, recorded well by Columbia/CBS. I just think that these two trios need a bit more advocacy of the kind Argerich, and also Julia fischer (Pentatone), provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"passionate and lyrical","review":"My most beloved piece of music, Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in D minor.

I envy the students fortunate enough to take a class with him. the Professor makes history and culture vibrantly alive and meaningful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his book. I highly recommend it to anyone serious about learning a totally different perspective about Dominican culture.

Her \\"Maybe I Know\\" is perfect. The 2nd CD contains less good songs than the 1st one, as \\"What's a Girl Supposed To Do\\" or her cover of \\"Young Love\\". It seems that by the end of the decade, she tried several different styles, according to the changes in public's favourite styles.

I truly do, but I do not think that the Nanny should have let the kids eat junk food and participate in activities that the mother was against. In the end, the mother changed her ways and was feeding her kids what she had considered junk food earlier. The Nanny ended up with everything she wanted. The mother became more fun like the Nanny.

Even Stravinsky, who loved to steal from Mozart as much as Rickey Henderson steals bases in baseball, thought Walter conducted Mozart like no other. Some conductors, like Karl Bohm, thought Walter was too sentimental in Mozart, but all I hear is perfect balance, perfect tempi, perfect performance. Forget the sonic limitations here from the 1950s.

I couldn't put the book down until I finished, even asking my wife to drive to the grocery store just so I could sit in the passenger seat and continue reading for an extra 15 minutes.This book shows a side to the Beatles that few people know about. It tells of their habits and behaviors in good times and bad, and although it never tells too much about the world outside the studio you can infer so much from what went on inside.Essential reading for any fan of the group. Essential for any musician wanting to know about the first band to use a studio as a creative tool.

After you finish this book, you will never listen to another song by The Beatles the same way again.Mr. Emerick gives us a humble yet inside account of his recording career with the most famous group of our time.

Then, once you're finished, you will use it as reference while you re-listen to the music all over again.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback Writer","review":"This book spends too much time criticizing three of the Beatles,John, Ringo and especially George Harrison.Geoff's obvious dislike for Harrison really detracts fromwhat at times might be an interesting read.I actually put the book down several times during thefirst few chapters, driven away by his constant criticisms.To hear Geoff tell it, he's the one that should be calledthe fifth Beatle, not George Martin.reads like a novel that Paul would write....Let It Be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice look inside the studio","review":"Interesting look inside the studio, but don't expect any insider info.He has most to say about Paul, and relatively little about the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless tripe","review":"With the exception of sometime employer Paul McCartney, no one escapes Emerick's petty, self-serving tirade. At times you almost get the impression that Emerick thinks that he and McCartney could have done as well without those other pesky people. Let's see, George Martin was a scene stealing sop who took credit for all of Geoff's wonderfulness, John was a space cadet, George was a subpar musician and Ringo was unfriendly. (In Ringo's defense, if Emerick is as graceless in person as he is on these pages, I'd avoid him too.)Emerick had a wonderful opportunity to pen a truely insightful book on a grossly overwritten topic. Instead he let his ego and vanity dictate what is no more than a transparent tribute to his mentor, friend and meal ticket, Paul McCartney.Frankly, the Beatles and McCartney deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul McCartneys apologist","review":"Obviously slanted in McCartneys favor, Geoff Emericks book portrays the other Beatles as inept and un-talented.High and mighty praise for McCartney aside, I would not reccomend this book for any serious Beatle fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A completely different perspective","review":"and one that I would highly recommend to any person interested in music and how it is recorded. Of course having The Beatles as the examples takes this book to another level altogether.I've read dozens of books about The Fabs and this perspective, which is more of a mature business and professional look instead of one of constant praise and adoration, is extremely interesting. It brings out a human element that I've not read before...You mean The Beatles were human ? Yes they were ! In fact, they were the hardest working band around and with the help of Geoff Emerick became the greatest rock group of all times...Without Doubt !If you're looking for a great read, please select Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles...It will be worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Book! First Choice!","review":"I won't take long, as other 5 stars reviews have already written quite a lot.This book is one of the BEST if not THE BEST book I have ever read about the Beatles. I couldn't put it down.This book is the best insight into the intimate creative times of the fabs + George Matin and the author in the studio. This is something I strived for and finaly found it.Only thing I miss in this book is that Geoff Emerick was not present at all Beatles recording sessions so we don't have the full report. I could just hope that Norman Smith would publish a similar book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and only","review":"This is the only book I've ever read about the Beatles that gives much insight into their personalities as musicians. No psychoanalysis. No posing. It just seems real.I would have liked more details about the recording process, but even with that I think this is perhaps the best book about them I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"This book could have been great, but is actually quite disappointing. It reads like one of those \\"as told to\\" celebrity biographies, with Geoff being the focus and hero at all times, especially during the Beatles' recording sessions. There's very little new insight or information here (other than Geoff's personal opinions about the Beatles as people and performers). Instead, we get a rehash of the old stories and anecdotes that have been around for years. George Martin told these same stories much more interestingly in the past, and with a great deal more humility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geoff Emerick and the Beatles","review":"I have never been so anxious to read a book and subsequently so let down by one. One would think that Emerick, with help from McCartney, were the only two responsible for the Beatles success. It seemed to pain him to give George Martin any credit what-so-ever and the three remaining Beatles were trashed on nearly every page. It seems as though he feels he must tear everyone else down to make improve his own status. This man is clearly bitter that he hasn't achieved the legendary status of Martin and the Beatles. But what he forgets is that to Beatles fans he has! It is also clear that the book is so slanted toward McCartney that it almost gives it a ring a fiction and gossip rather than an inside look at the music, which is what we all thought the book was going to be about. I gave this book two stars because there were a few interesting nuggets in it, but really it deserves one star for turning what should have been a landmark book into a gossip column."},{"rating":"1","title":"This boring guy really hates George, John & Ringo","review":"If you think only Paul McCartney is the ONE TRUE GOD then this is the book for you. If you like the whole group, avoid it like the plague. What a waste of my time. He spends most of his time cutting down poor George Martin, this guy either had no control over the final version or he's a back stabbing scumbag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming to a Bargain Bin Near You!","review":"Emerick and co-author Massey can't seem to get out of their own way in delivering the story of Emerick's days recording the Beatles. Their awkward, uneven account reads like a 300-page high school writing assignment.This book desperately needs a talented co-author. Even more, it cries for an editor to give the book strong direction, eliminating diversion and self congratulation while focusing on the kind of detail and anecdote that could truly shed new light on the greatest musical story of a generation.The story might have been compelling, except for the ego, cliche, pettiness, and sycophancy leaking through nearly every page. I will say that this book does reveal a few insights, but must also caution that the effort required to find them will require a thorough cleaning of shoes afterward.The book is destined for the Dollar Bin here, there, and everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book. Great even if you're not a big Beatles fan","review":"I'm not much of a Beatles fan, but I could not put this book down. It's a fascinating look not only at the Beatles but at the creative process at work, and the inner dynamics of a band on it's rise to the top. Along the way you get an insider's view of the creative decisions that lead to the songs and sounds we know so well. For anyone into recording, this book will inspire you to try something new and experiment more. Great book and a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll read this one again, soon!","review":"My favorite Beatles related book to date. Geoff Emerick and Howard Massey captured a straight forward account of The Beatles in the studio from beginning to end. Added bonus includes Paul's sojourn in Lagos recording Band on the Run. The interesting happenings their, were not in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Fantastic book about Geoff's time working with The Beatles and afterwards. Extremely well written and insightful, I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone interested in The Beatles or recording techniques of the 60s. I didn't want the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, worth the time","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. There were lots of insights into what really happened in the recording studio during all of those great recording sessions. I also liked how the book followed Paul to Nigeria during his Band on the Run album. Awesome - and a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"here there and everywhere by Geoff Emerick","review":"Not for the casual fan, this book delves into how the records were made, layer by layer. You also get a flavor of the moods of the Beatles during this time as well as insight into the creative process. I marked up several pages and passages because they made me want to go back and listen to the vinyl recordings to see if I could pick up on some of the subtleties he talked about.After reading this book I think you might agree the Beatles were the most creative, prolific band of all time... it really hits you in the face when you consider the limitations of the technology, the sheer number of songs...the melodies. Emerick was one lucky guy for sure... Beatles 4 ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Geoff, the 5th Beatle","review":"I like the insight that Geoff brings to the actual recording of many of the Beatle's albums. However, he makes George out to be a hack musician and not much of human being to boot. He also gives himself enough credit to perhaps make you wonder why EMI never built a statue of him in front of the Abbey Road studio. I think the book is overall a good read for any Beatle enthusiast, but Geoff would have done himself so much more good to not make George Harrison, Ringo, and often George Martin look average. ...of course he has an undying love for Sir Paul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for ANY Beatles fan","review":"I read a tremendous amount and haven't read a book through twice since I was 13. I cannot recommend this book any higher for a Beatles fan. This is an incredible read with so many gems. My favorite quote from a good friend who read the book: \\"So what were you doing at 19? This guy was engineering REVOLVER.\\"There are so many gems in this book that you'll find yourself going back many times just to reread how a recording was done. I'm a musician, but this will be a great read for any fan of the Beatles. To hear how they recorded things back then with such limited equipment and with some pretty insane politics at the recording company EMI gave me a much greater appreciation of just how the Beatles broke the mold. Geoff was the unsung hero of these albums and is humble in his recounting of the recording sessions.I couldn't recommend this book any higher. If you're bothering to read this you are definitely a Beatles fan, and you need to buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential technical info on many Beatles classics","review":"This book is essential to anyone who is curious about the technical aspects of the Beatles music from Revolver through Abby Road. With some added insight on Let It Be. Mr. Emerick does a great job of sticking to what was happening in the studio and not giving his version of Beatle's history. I disagree with some of the reviews I have read stating that Mr. Emerick gives Ringo and George a bad rap while painting John as moody and Paul as some kind of saint. Mr. Emerick is merely describing his interaction with the Beatles in the studio. He does an excellent job of explaining the recording process at that time and gives some insight on just how far we've come in today's recording studio. The book was easy to get into and hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Important Book","review":"This book (mine was purchased from an Amazon Affiliate) is absolutely essential if you are involved in a recording project.With all the techno-toys available to the enginner today - it is important to see how it was done when there were NO TOYS and NO HUGE PROCESSORS and NOT MODELING, etc. This is ingenuity at it's finest.Here, There and Everywhere shows straight up hard expirementation and documents in detail \\"HOW THESE TRACKS WERE RECORDED\\". I am not sorry I bought this and I only wish there were a lot more books like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The origins of the sounds","review":"This is a fascinating story, told from the viewpoint that we haven't gotten before: a sound engineer who helped bring to fruition the ideas in the heads of (mostly) Lennon and McCartney. When Lennon would want to sound like he was singing \\"from the moon,\\" it was Emerick who had to translate that image to an actual sound when Lennon sang. The stories of how McCartney's crisp bass sound was achieved during Paperback Writer, to the frantic recording of All You Need Is Love, and many others, satisfied this reader's curiosity about what actually went on in the studio for so many great recordings. Obviously Emerick's love of sound and his ability as an early creative rock engineer is evident throughout. He broke lots of standard rules, and came up with other ideas that are now standard. His book stands as a welcome addition to what has become a tired genre: Beatles books. Highly recommended to fans who know the songs all too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Any Music Fan","review":"Loved it, couldn't put it down! Mr. Emerick provides insight into the recording techniques that made The Beatles music special. His matter of fact portrayal provided unique insight to the bands talent and interpersonal relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU ARE IN THE STUDIO LISTENING ... WATCHING.","review":"Excellent book by Mr. Emerick by someone who was \\"there\\". The reviewers below nicely sum up my oberservations, save the one reviewer who commented about inaccuracy (Emerick was a key contributor to Anthology and other Beatle historical documentation!). His accounting of historical recordings will drive you back to your CD player (or, as he strongly prefers vinyl) to listen to what he describes (e.g. Patti Harrison providing background scream in Yellow Submarine). Buy it and \\"listen\\" ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top pick for any avid Beatles fan who can't get enough","review":"Another Beatles coverage wouldn't seem necessary, but there's often a new angle to explore - as Geoff Emerick provides in HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE: MY LIFE RECORDING THE MUSIC OF THE BEATLES. Emerick came to EMI Studios on Abbey Road at the age of 15 to interview as an assistant engineer and helped out on sessions with producer George Martin. His involvement in a new, popular Liverpool band gave him a front seat to their heyday of achievement, allowing him to observe close-up the collaborations, competitions and interactions within the group. His insider's observations are unparalleled, making this a top pick for any avid Beatles fan who can't get enough.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, insightful, and inspirational","review":"If you've ever wondered what REALLY went on behind the scenes at Beatles recording sessions, this is the book to get. Geoff Emerick was there at the beginning, and he was with the Fab Four all the way through to the end, an eyewitness -- and collaborator -- to the way they shaped and remolded modern music. This book isn't just about the way the records were made -- it's about the people too, and Emerick's keen insights into the personalities of the four bandmembers provides a new perspective, making for a fascinating look back at an amazing, and important, era. I couldn't put this book down from start to finish -- it's a fast, breezy read, and the subject matter is engrossing. Kudos to Emerick, and may he inspire many more young people to follow in his footsteps."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this book!","review":"Geoff Emerick writes as if he is still there. it is so clear and detailed. A must-read for anyone who records music.A great history lesson on music recording in general, but also the Beatles specifically, and other bands who were there at the time. More insight into the Beatles' lives and personalities than you probably have read elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"Great book. The picture of what went into recording the music of the Beatles is fascinating and what makes this book stand out. The inside stories are wonderful. His descriptions of the Beatles are filled with admiration and praise at some points, brutally honest at others, but ultimately seem fair, from the perspective of someone who was there. Best Beatles book I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most well written and interesting Beatle book ever!!","review":"I have read more Beatle related books than is normally allowed by law. Geoff's book was so easy to follow, well written and full of interesting and insightful tidbits! After finishing the book I now have visuals of those recording sessions that will stick with me for a lifetime. Hands down my favorite Beatle related book ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book!","review":"Loved every page of this book. The best insider book ever written about the group. No sacred cows here, just honest reporting of how the individuals including George Martin, behaved in the studio. Being a musician and recording engineer myself, it was amazing to read how they worked their magic in those days. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Inside Information","review":"Fascinating and nicely written account of many of the Beatles recording sessions, including \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". Emerick only writes about what he witnessed, so there is a real feeling of authenticity throughout. Highly recommended for fans who want all the details..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is such an annoying book...","review":"You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: \\"You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man\\". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, \\"it's a drag, a well-known drag...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bag for the money","review":"I have no reservations recommending this bag.

I would like to know what kind of background Ms. Conway has in the area of handwriting analysis. A lot of the information in this book is so far off the beaten path. I have read many books on handwriting analysis including Graphology, Graphoanalysis and Graphotherapy. I am returning the book. It is a great dissappointment. In my opinion there is more information that is inaccurate than accurate. It is very misleading to the novice. It shows me that anyone can write a book and sell it. Not good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so Pictographic","review":"This was my first Graphology book, and it was dissappointing. If the author has done any systematic research, it found no mention in the book. Instead, the analysis seems to be based purely on visual lines (references to \\"foetal position\\" shapes & musical notes' shapes & \\"smiles\\" in people's writing). Agreed that all script started out as pictograms, but this drags things a bit too far.Also, she completely discounts the fact that many people write upto 60% of their alphabets in so called \\"print\\"& that non-cursive writing could also exhibit many numerous variations & unique traits."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious","review":"Don't waste your time or money.

Gavin is a movie star and Rosie designs costumes for his movies and, in theory, other people's movies. Kevin is Rosie's brother and an NYPD officer. Nell is a successful publicist. The first 140 pages of this book introduce these people and tell us what they all think of each other. The next third of the book elucidates how, even though they are all fabulously rich and successful (except Kevin's not rich, because he's a cop, but he's still very good at it), none of them are very good at having a personal life and managing romantic relationships.In the last third of the book, the four friends seem to begin to suck slightly less, but alas, they do not. The book also begins to suck slightly less, but then, just as it threatens to have some sort of plot, the loose ends are abruptly severed (NOT tied up) and the book ends happily ever after.

Back then everything was still pure, no one came and bothered the environment. It taught me to be more careful on how to save electricty and to not be so wasteful, because we can't expect everything we have now, we'll have another 50 years.

I bought this for my grandson who is 10, I bought one from another source for his brother that arrived at the same time. The other bean bag chair is far superior, and the costs were nearly the same...However, the Saints Bean bag chair will now cost me MUCH more by the time I buy additional filler and try to find or make a liner, and spend time chasing after the materials.

First, as he explains his therapeutic approach he makes reference to feeling magnetic fields from the subject's body. I highly doubt that this is possible for any human, but even if he is able to do this it is not reasonable to assume that this skill can be transferred. Second, he repeatedly recommends feeling the underlying tissues and bringing them into alignment. While this seems more plausible than feeling magnetic fields, it remains highly doubtful that anyone not doing this on a daily basis will ever develop the skill to feel tissue below several layers of skin, fat, and other connective tissue.My final complaint is that the writing style hangs heavily on technical jargon and repeatedly makes reference to techniques to be explained on other pages, which of course, never are satisfactorily addressed.

I admit, I was disappointed. Many of the stories in this collection were written in the 80's and early-to-mid-90's, and they haven't worn well over time. Some themes (like an attempt to hop on the anti-political correctness bandwagon) seemed a bit archaic...the modern equivalent of mentioning \\"free love\\" and \\"The Man\\" in the books of the sixties or seventies.The parade of surprising, star-crossed romances in story after story began to wear thin too...it became formulaic, and even made some of her novels less satisfying in retrospect (because they adhered to the same formula, and sometimes, the same research).I'd only recommend this book to someone who wants to revel in the Connie Willis formula...otherwise I'd give it a miss and stick to her full-length novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst movies ever made.","review":"This movie is an embarrassment.

(His first misinterpretation was his 1971 flick, \\"Von Richthofen and Brown.\\") No one who knows anything about the Red Baron could accept a movie in which he kills a young boy's father at home as well as a nurse in a hospital. This movie could have been a spoof of films like the \\"Chucky\\" movies but it just is not funny.

My 13 year old son last week had as many laughs as I did while watching it together.

The other contender is that by Ivry Gitlis. (#2 that is; the first concerto is really the composer's \\"Two Portraits\\" renamed, a pleasant but unsensational opus).The collaboration is about perfect, and Stern is here at his absolute best. His affinity for modern music is uncanny, and I would also recommend his Bartok Rhapsodies and the Berg Concerto, as well. It doesn't get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stern in Phenomenal Form in Bartók","review":"Stern was a world famous soloist, but in his later career he was inconsistent. I heard him in terrific form in the 1980s in a recital in DC, and heard him quite off form around 1978. I have owned the LP version of this record since 1959 (I'm dating myself!) and just got the digital reissue.This recording from 1958 shows Stern in tremendous form at age 38--a real world-class virtuoso. This is a muscular performance of the Bartok 2nd concerto; he is consistentIy on top of the work's technical demands, and makes it a real emotional musical experience as well. Bernstein and the NY Philharmonic are in good form as well.I have heard other violinists do this great work, and most do well by it. Szeryng and the Concertgebouw are good, Pauk on Naxos is very fine also. Neither is up to Stern's level.The sound of this recording, despite it's being 50+ years old, is splendid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Gay Sketch Show Season 2","review":"The \\"Dynasty\\" sketch and the \\"May-December Romance\\" sketch are my favorites.

There are a few misteps, but for the most part it is very funny, even the closing comments by Rosie O'Donnell and Chastiy Bono are fun.

It was heartless, pointless and meaningless. Sure you can just go along for the ride, but if your time is important to you don't waste it watching this. The cast, especially Bardem, does its best but can't save this absurd flick because essentially it's a load of old rubbish.

Can the elementary education student understand what is being described?*) Are the examples ones that the students can relate to? Are they artificial or do they have real meaning to the student?*) Is the coverage within the bounds of what I want to cover in the course?The book meets every one of my requirements; I found the explanations very clear and within the bounds of the weaker students. The examples are understandable and I found myself mentally doing a few of them as I looked it over.

These are not songs, but rather multiple 20 second jingles joined together to serve the movie, but not the listener. You can't even call them a medley. Silvestri is amazing, but the soundtrack leaves you yearning for more. A twenty second blurb is not enough to be a whole song. Multiply this accross the entire cd and what you have is nothing worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Score","review":"Yesterday I went out and bought this CD. I love it!

The music actually turned out to be better than good. It was awesome! I thought the pulsing bass drum was a brilliant touch. Throughout the movie references were made (usually by Dracula) about heartbeats. The use of a pulsing bass drum really accented this aspect of the storyline. The only disappointing thing about the soundtrack was that the first part of the end credits from the movie were not on the CD. I love Silvestri's grand finales, and I am still fuming about the fact that this was left out. Regardless, I would highly recommend this score to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Van Helsing has always been my favorite character in Bram Stokers world. Now that a younger Van Helsing fights Dracula in the Hugh Jackman film, Im all in! This film is under rated but it is none the less action packed and fun. But it wouldn't as good(for me) without Silvestri's amazing score. I love his work in Back to the Future and Van Helsing is up there with it. I own the complete 2 disc soundtrack, which is nearly impossible to find, and I must say that this one disc 14 track score doesnt give the film justice whatsoever. The fun pieces like Translyvanian Horses is a good listen as well as the emotional 'Reunited'. All in all, I love the movie and the sountrack does more than complement it. Also, if you can get your hands on the Complete 2 disc 54 track album, get it! I had found it by luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recording of the Ninth","review":"This is absolutely the best recording of the Ninth out there. It far surpasses that of Karajan, who (despite fine recordings of some of the other Bruckner symphonies, most notably the Sixth) does not appear to like the Ninth that much. Walter seems to understand exactly what Bruckner had in mind, and always gets the tempo and the instrumental balance just right. What's more, the sound of the recording is quite good good given its age.Until you have heard Walter's interpretation, you just haven't heard the Ninth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Compared to Karajan's 1976 recording of this most profound of symphonies, Walter's late recording is nothing less than disappointing. He tends to rush through some of the more contemplative passages and fails to reveal the inherent luminosity and spiritual depth of this work. Needless to say, Walter's Hollywood recording orchestra is not a patch on the Berlin Philharmonic. This is not the best version of this work by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EQUINOX","review":"i bought this item to go in my 2006 stock equinox, and it's not compatible the plugs are differnt and don't fit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Prayer by Timothy Jones","review":"The Author is easy to relate to,unpretentious and practical in his advise on prayer throughout the book.

The cover and reviews portray the work as an analysis of post-2001 Afghanistan, and an indictment of the errors of the US military and the Afghan government. The book focuses on the governor and police chief of Kandahar from 2002-2005. The book does describe Ms. Chayes' experience working for an NGO, but never covers the political-military situation, and charges of U.S. government mismanagement that the publisher advertises. It seems an incomplete ramble on the injustices of political reality in Kandahar, and provides no new insight into what has always been perceived as a corrupt and ineffective Afghan government, and a meddlesome Pakistani government that is often at odds with U.S. goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge and Understanding are Priceless!!","review":"I made a wise decision to buy this book after listening to Ms. Chayes on PBS.It was a fascinating interview about living and working in Kandahar. Please read all of the other reviewer's opinions about this book and awesome woman. I have a better understanding and knowledge about the culture and sacrifices of the Afghani people. Today, I read about the senseless murder of Safia Ama Jan who was an advocate for women rights. She provided schools for vocational training and helped improve their education.

She is scholarly in creating a narrative that describes the geo-political realities affecting the region, and intensely personal as she describes her own experiences resulting from those realities. Her journalistic prowess shines as she makes some necessary history lessons flow. Her access to key players and the personal danger with which she lives on a daily basis give her the gravitas to make \\"Punishment of Virtue\\" a serious indictment of those she places in her cross-hairs. Sarah Chayes has masterfully written a book that exposes the buffoonery and corruption in the rebuilding of a country that was and is the stage of revolving wars by proxy. If you have read Sheehan's \\"Bright, Shining Lie\\" about Viet Nam, you will experience deja vu as you read \\"Punishment of Virtue\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never invade a country without a plan.","review":"This book was written based upon a single point of view but a very clear and sad perspective of some of the results which actually took place. We provided a whole range of wrong information to the Afghan people, the American public, and the military from intelligence we received or made up; however, the events covered in this book are pertinent for our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Book on Afghanistan","review":"Sarah Chayes' provides an excellent look at America's post-9/11 involvment in Afghanistan. Chayes' portrayal of how Gul Agha Shirzai became the governor of Kandahar province and Hamid Karzai became the president of the country is thought provoking. Chayes neatly ties the history of Kandahar province to the creation of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 'The Punishment of Virtue' is a good supplement to the works of Thomas Barfield, Ahmad Rashid, and Steve Coll. The book is also an excellent parallel read with Rajiv Chandrasekaran's 'Little America.'

That said, I probably wouldn't recommend this recording as an introduction to Catherine Wheel, even though it's most definitely representative of the band's work. The songs are dark, moody and atmospheric, yet strangely uplifting. The perfect musical guide for an evening of introspection, it's a collection of B sides, covers and, I guess, alternative takes, yet the whole stands as a cohesive package, worthy of album-hood. It's a creeper, too; the songs reveal more depth with repeated listening, rewarding the attentive listener.

I also liked the other 2 books in the series. But i was dissapointed with this movie. I am not saying that its a bad movie but i think that it took most of what was special and magical and left it out. And also the book didn't take place in the 90's it took place in the 1940's. The acting was average nothing else. the only one to live up to the charater in the book was ms. O'toole as keri.

Not only do many of the titles in this series offer Walter's \\"Indian Summer\\" recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, but they also feature many of the conductor's performances from the 1950s during his association with the New York Philharmonic. On this CD you get some of each -- a classic mono performance from 1953 with the NYPO of Haydn's 102nd Symphony, and Symphonies Nos. 88 and 100 in stereo with the CSO from 1961. I should conclude by saying that since making a point of acquiring all of the Bruno Walter Edition titles earlier this year, I have witnessed several of them falling prey to silent deletion. So order the Bruno Walter Edition titles quickly, because these recordings made during the twilight of Walter's career, seem to be in the twilight of their own life as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big and too heavy","review":"I was looking for a leather rolling laptop bag with room for clothing for a day's trip.

Of course, if you can forgive Roman Polanski for raping a little girl, you can also feel sorry for this killer (he was having creative troubles with the channel).A 20 minute segment about this guy and the channel, on 60 MINUTES or 20/20, would have been enough.And, of course, Quentin Tarintino shows his bizarre face---enough of his giant jaw, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I guess my disapoitment with the ballets have to do with my expectations from them. Both ballets are minor works of great russians composers; I had never seen them on stage or video. But the music appeals to me. Then, having a first experience based on poor soviet productions, where the emphasis is on big pannels and less in showing the best the dancers can perform is rather less than one should expect as a reference recording. It has all the vices of sovietic recorfings of ballets, and was badly edited for modern patterns. To me, it's value is purely bibliographical: compared to modern creative and/or sumptuous productions, it makes one think: What marvellous ballets Nureyev, or Ballachine, could have done of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven by geiiuses","review":"I was 13 when I discovered for the first time classical music and the Beethoven Triple with this recording was my first encounter thanks to a mother who had a passion for it. We were back in Paris definitely and French people did not even know this concerto and many still don't. Walter and his soloists are probably among the very few to have understood that this is chamber music and not the stereo spectacular that Karajan and Rostropovich massacred a few decades later as many others interpreters. Only the Marlborough festival edition of Alexander Schneider a few years later, this one recorded in full stereo, equals this fantastic performance any real classical music lover should possess!

I was surprised to see her in such a crappy movie. If you watch it and think it is as crappy as I do, be sure to watch the \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette.

The story is a disjointed mess, seemingly without purpose. The story starts with an introduction to an American woman in Nicaragua who has to sleep with a plethora of government officials in order to keep her press pass and make money in order to live.

She then gets herself in a big mess with an English business man she meets and then sleeps with for $50. They end up on the run from the Costa Rican OIJ(police), with disastrous results.While there were some moments of poetic writing and insight on the whole the characters lacked motivation for just about everything they were doing.

On the first he takes a mild Calvinist stance, on the second a moderate but evangelical view, and on the third a pretty neutral view.

McGee flushes out the book's ultra-villain, Boo Waxwell, and does what he can to rectify the wrongs done to an innocent man. All, I might add, without reference to the Cold War, Carnaby Street, Hippies, or anything else which would have identified the book as a product of the Sizties.MacDonald's villains are the seven deadly sins, with an occasional personification of evil from the swamps like rapist-murderer-extortionist Waxwell thrown in.

Poeple would think this book is about a teenager who is making bad choices then they are stupid. this book is about a young woman finding herself in a harsh world. I think everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah picked a winner","review":"A simple tale like I thought they didn't write anymore, of a young girl's discovery of herself. Novalee Nation is an innocent who learns the facts of life without the author's forcing them down her (and our) throat.All the characters in this story are wonderful and believable - Novalee, Sister Husband (where did Ms. Letts come up with that name?), Lexie Coop, Forney Hull, etc. And with Willy Jack, Letts has come up with a character you thoroughly despise - someone you absolutely don't want to read about - while making you stay riveted to the page to find out what happens to him next.Surprisingly, the most powerful character in the story is not Novalee, but rather Moses Whitecotton, the photographer who becomes Novalee's friend and teacher. Every scene he's in literally leaps off the page. I think a story with him as the main character would result in a novel that's just as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"Letts did an excellent job with all the characters in the book. Each one grabs you very quickly and you really get attached to them all. I found the book impossible to put down.... as a matter of fact, after taking a break after the first hour of reading to go out to dinner with our family, when I returned I did not stop until I finished the book (something I NEVER do). I am going to check out \\"The Honk and Holler Opening Soon\\" by the same author next."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"I loved this book soo much.

Unfortunately the writing does not meet the potential of the idea. The characters are unlikable, the plot reads like a bad TV sit-com, and there is a disgusting indecent scene that no one should want to read. If you still feel you must read it, borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT just a children's book!","review":"JK Rowling has a wonderful imagination.

I didn't care what happened and couldn't finish it because it was so boring. I wouldn't bother with the book, maybe the movie will be better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice outline","review":"Yes, this is a nice outline but I'm still waiting for the fully developed story and characters. Seems the author spent her time finding quirky names for her people (one more cute name and I would have thrown the book out) and did actually find herself \\"stumbling from one chapter to another, from one event to another\\", as she states in the \\"Q & A\\" with the author. Several major events occur but Ms. Leitts is happy to just drop us off a cliff. Oh, what a big, rich book this could have been had the author made the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sugary sweet","review":"I picked this book up as I had heard the buzz from fellow workers.

I'll spare you the description of the story line, others have done it nicely for you on this page. Novalee is a believable character and one you feel for from the beginning and instantly you're happy she is left my her deadbeat boyfriend. Sister Husband is too good to be true, but sometimes angels are found on earth. Lexie, who becomes Novalee's best friend, goes through her own trials and between them, Novalee and Lexie support each other. Americus is a darling baby whom everyone loves and adores, and through it all, Novalee still feels she is undeserving of Forney's love. It takes several disasters and deaths for Novalee to realize her love for him, but then fears it's too late ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that keeps you reading for hours!!","review":"It is a great book for anyone who likes to read a true story about a real life situation.

At least is that was what I thought when I first bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in Oklahoma is THIS???","review":"This book reads like a high school creative writing assignment. It's predictable and not very deep. When I first came to Oklahoma, a woman said to me \\"[Us Oklahomans]aren't like in Where the Heart is, but we're some of the nicest people you'll ever meet\\". The movie is cute, but the book is rather silly. Take a vacation to Oklahoma and walk around the Wal-Marts here, it's far more entertaining than the book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart is","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I like how the author, Billie Letts, kept the plot interesting by telling the story of both Novalee and Willy. I also liked how Letts foreshadowed in this book. When Letts says sevens were bad luck for Novalee (on th first page) you knew right away that something bad was going to happen if it involved sevens. I really can't say it enough how much I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"...The story line was dull and boring. Just when I thought it might get interesting the story just became even worse. The characters were one-dimensional. Whatever happened to creating a story where the characters had actual feelings? Novalee goes through disappointment after disappointment in her life and acts like nothing bothers her? Maybe the author should have spent more time on character development instead of wasting so much time on their names! There was nothing amazing about this book, amazingly boring and unintelligent is more like it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found myself reading at night w/ a flashlight","review":"I loved this book this is one of my favorites, couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the whole story made me cry. Wonderful Story"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointingly predictable, syrupy-sweet fairy tale...","review":"The beginning of this book is excellent, promising an original story with intriguing characters but further reading reveals the disappointingly predictable, syrupy-sweet fairy tale that it actually is. I ordered Where the Heart Is despite it being an Oprah selection because of the rave customer reviews and now I wish I had followed through with my vow to avoid books that Oprah recommends after forcing myself to finish a couple other of her selections!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am an avid subscriber to Oprah's Book Club.

Granted, most of it was pretty light weight and predictable. But there were still scenes that kept me from sleeping and had me checking on my kids all night. Are there no novels without topics like child abuse involved? If you don't want dark pictures invading your sleep, I suggest you skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"the movie pretty much stayed true to this wonderful book.i read it because i loved the movie and after i got finished i let my friend read it and she enjoyed it. i reccomend this book for all fans of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This reads like the novelization of a movie","review":"This book is vacuous and the characters seem like cheap imitations of quirky country folk. Walmart is depicted as some sort of haven for troubled souls which indicates that this book would have to have been written by an American. I am not surprised that Oprah picked this sappy, tugging at the heart strings book. The writing style is approachable and credible which redeems it slightly and allows it to earn two stars. The plot is thin and convoluted. What is clearly intended to be an inspirational \\"girl climbs her way from bottom to top\\" story is lost on me. I could not warm up to any of the characters including and especially Novalee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart Is - Friends","review":"This book is full of laughter and tears, determination and love. It is a story about a young girl, Novalee Nation, who finds herself living in Wal-Mart after being abandoned by her boyfriend. While there she makes several lasting friendships that become a foundation for her and her child. During Novalee's life she has experienced her share of heartache. She find the strength and determination to push foward through the hard times with the help and support of her new found friends. This book makes you realize the importance of friendship, and everything gained from it. Friendship provides a person with love and support that may not be found anywhere else. Novalee finds these things - love and support - through her friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read something that is not challenging...","review":"If you are out for a book that takes little brain power and is a quick read, you may find this enjoyable. This book is has a very simplitic writing style and reads at about an 8th grade level. On the other hand, if you are looking for something that actually makes you think and reflect on society, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't find where the heart was...","review":"This is one of the few books that I quit reading half way through. I could not have cared anything for the characters with their silly names. I really could not find \\"where or who's heart it was! \\" Oprah let me down on this one, along with The Pilot's Wife. A silly read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart Is","review":"I caught the movie one afternoon and really got into it so it made the book even more enjoyable because the book actually explained a few things from the movie with more detail. The character that Ashley Judd portrayed was really the only one that did not fit the look of the person in the book but all the personalities came alive. Great read about a young girl destined for failure only to rise above the ashes of despair. Too many people prefer to stay down and she inspires us all to achieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"the heart","review":"This book was easy reading about real things. I loved the characters. Each were so intriguing in their own simple mind. I would love to read another book of this caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart Is review.","review":"The book Where the Heart Is by Billie Letts, is a very good book. I really enjoyed reading it. It tells of a girl with bad luck with 7's and how she has a baby in Wal-Mart and how her life changes thereafter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"Okay, let me admit first off that I am an English teacher, and with my critical eye turned to this book, I see its flaws -- namely that it isn't realistic. Ah, who cares. I loved it, and I admit it freely. It is one of only three books I have read in one sitting. I loved the story, and I loved the characters. I was pulling for Novalee and Lexie (and all the rest) for the whole novel. I was so angry at Willie Jack I could spit. Who cares if it isn't classic literature (come closer ... I'll let you in on a secret ... some of that so-called classic literature is soooo dry ... and I don't care for it at all). Give me Novalee Nation, in all her unrealistic splendor, over Captain Ahab anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart is - an excellent novel for all ages","review":"I am 14 years old. My mom recommended this book for me to try to read. After I started reading it, I could not put it down. Billie put so much emotion into the making of this book, I would love to find out where she got her ideas. I laughed, I cryed, and I felt all different emotions. It was one of the best books I have ever read and I reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a good book to sit down and read. I got through this book in 4 days, school days, so I could only read at night. It is very easy to catch on to and is a quick paced book. Thanks to the wonderful author - Billie Letts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning","review":"This is one book that you don't have to read the first fifty pages to \\"get into\\" it. It grabs you from the start with great characters and poetic justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I've Read!","review":"I found \\"Where the Heart Is\\" to be great summer reading! The characters in this book are real people, and it is easy to identify with them. While Novalee is definitely the best and main character in the book, I also like Lexie, although she has to overcome hardships, too. I also liked the way we see what happens to Novalee's ex-boyfriend, who seems to be the scum of the earth! And at the same time goes through Novalee's life. This is a great book. It's got something in it for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern to the bone!","review":"My sister in Savannah gave this book to me a year ago and I read it on a plane back to San Francisco. It made me think of old friends and lucky breaks. It made me laugh and made me cry. What a book. Fannie Flagg lovers will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book to be boring and predictable.","review":"I have been reading a number of books from Oprah's book club, and I must say that this is the worst I've read. The plot is merely a story of a girl who goes to a new town where she runs into one problem after another in a seemingly disconnected series of events. Letts seems to have said, \\"OK, what can I make happen now?\\" It's predictable, and it's a book where you just pray for the boring and obvious ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no","review":"We read this in my book discussion group and it keeps coming up when we discuss other, better books we read. For example, the characters in Where the Heart Is are flat: They're either saintly or evil. Instead try Wicked, a novel that turns the Wicked Witch of the West into a sympathetic, human character. I'm only giving Where the Heart Is a star because the form won't take a blank."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful story to read and re read for years to come","review":"I have read this book more times than I can count and each time I can find new beautiful details and ideas within the book that make it all that much more special to me each time. Letts manages to introduce her characters to you in such a way that you really do feel as though you have known them for your whole life. Descriprions are poignant and capture the essence of human emotion flawlessly. The names and personalities of all of the main characters make you wish that you knew people just like them. Where the Heart is will continue to be one of my all time favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best of Oprah's picks","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It's so uplifting and inspirational and I felt so good after I finished it. Novalee and the rest of the characters had such great STRONG names and were developed in such a way that made me care for them. I only didn't like the rape/assault scene, since it seemed forced and didn't go with the flow of the book. But a must-read nonetheless. The ending is a tearjerker, and very heartfelt. The best thing about the book is that it includes an interview with Billie Letts and allows her to explain why she chose certain plot developments (like why Wal-Mart, why names like Novalee and Americus, etc.). It made it a better book after reading the interview."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"Where The Heart Is is a great read, not to mention would make an even better movie...but it's pretty over-the-top and fake! Of course it is-it's a great story..but connection with the characters was not even close. Just borrow it...don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"captures ur heart","review":"i really loved this book,it captured my heart from the beginning till the end. I applaud the author for this brilliant masterpiece"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, wonderful plot and difficult to put down.","review":"I read this book in about three sittings because it was a wonderful story of a young girl's desire to be a mother, cultivate friendships, and explore her interests and talents. Novalee, as a child, did not have the support or love of a family. No one was more alone in the world than she, when Willy Jack left her at the Wal-mart, 7 months pregnant. In this town, she met caring people who became the family that she never had. The author has a writing style that is very appealing and dares the reader to put down this excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Enjoyable & Uplifting","review":"Well, my one-line summary says it all. There is not a person alive that could not see themselves in one of the characters. Especially those who believe they \\"don't deserve the pick of the litter.\\" Bravo! This book has made me look around and see my Angels guiding and helping me along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this for their own sanity.","review":"This is a moving story that connects you immediately with everyone you've never met. No one is questioned in Ms. Lett's world, and everyone should live there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet novel about a woman learning how to live...and love.","review":"Letts has written an unbelievable tale. She flourishes her words with quaint details and interesting dialogue. This captivating story about Novalee captures the readers heart. At the start of the story, Novalee is seventeen, pregnant, and unknowledgable, growing up in a strange world without ever really having anyone to care about her. When her boyfriend strands her at a Wal-Mart store in the middle of a tiny town, her new life begins. She meets people who are much different than those she is used to. They are friendly and sweet, and she learns to care for them and trust them like family...real family. Novalee finds undiscovered talents and feelings deep inside her that she never would have thought she had. In this tiny town, she changes from a confused child into a beautiful intelligent young woman. The types of things she experiences show her how perfect life can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a FANTASTIC book!!!!!!","review":"Where The Heart Is is, by far, the best book I've ever read. It was touching, humorous, and sad, yet it maintained a sense of home. The characters were all true to life. I became friends with Novalee, fell in love with Americus, hated Willy Jack, and basically felt like I was one of the characters in the book. I laughed, cried, became angry, and was uplifted. Reading it was a wonderful experience, and I would like to read more from Billie Letts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read!!!","review":"Billie Letts is an excellent author. She has a way of letting you know exactly what is going on without spelling it out for you. I was constantly reading \\"between the lines\\" throughout the entire book. The story of Novalee made me angry, made me laugh and made me cry. It is truly an amazing, and unforgettable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to read","review":"Very easy to read, something to slip right into and read in one go. It had the quality of that which is surreal, though, and never really impacted. This wasn't helped by names such as 'Americus' and 'Sister Husband', tornadoes, and babysnatchings. Still, it traced the growth and strength of Novalee in an uplifting way and made you feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it! I couldn't put it down...","review":"It only took me 2 days to read this book. The story gets you from the beginning and it's hard to put down! Novalee has so much bad luck, you just want to cry for her, but she triumphs. It's wonderful how she makes a family and a life for herself and her child with the people she meets - and they are a diversified group! Billie Letts really shows how home is not where you live, but where you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Uplifting!","review":"This was an excellent novel, a tale that young girls around the country can relate to. I loved Novalee and her plucky spirit, and the other characters added to a colorful story. Moses reminded me of the men in my family, strong and determined, yet hiding some sadness. Sister was a hoot, the kind of fun-loving woman that you want watching your child. And the focus on Wal-Mart, an American icon, was fascinating. This was a quick read that will keep me thinking for a long time to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quirky and fun","review":"Through a band of unique characters, emotional struggles, and humorous anecdotes, Letts creates Novalee's world. This is a mostly light-hearted book for anyone looking for a good page-turner. Great beach reading! I recommend the movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart Is Good Where It Is","review":"This book is better than I expected. When I first saw it, I thought it would be boring, but its storyline is fairly complicated. They have okay dialogue, for example, \\"The name has to help them through bad times.\\" Most of the people that are in the story have personalities that act like this. The phrase has meaning. That's why I like it. One of the characters will be named because of that too. There are advanced words, but they're not so complicated that you don't understand the story. It has many people with various characteristics. The details are the best that you can hope for. The book starts out with a teenage pregnancy. Then it becomes a love story of a guy and a girl. It circles them and the people that encounter them. It mostly concentrates on how the girl gets over pregnancy and homelessness and finds strength in herself. This book moved me, slightly, during the sad parts. This is a passable book, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book and THEN see the movie","review":"Read this book before you go and see the movie. The book contains so many layers and layers of Novalee and her friends that the movie was not able to even wrap its arms around. This is not the sort of book I read but I was inspired, not overwelmed, with the goodness of heart within the pages. Read. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"This book was so heart-felt and thought provoking, I was deeply touched by the characters and the things that went on in their lives. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot development?","review":"The other reviewers are right: this book was entertaining. But it had no plot development and just plain no plot - unless you count people who are mean to Novalee getting their just deserts as a plot. It was just an entertaining ramble, no beginning, middle or end, pointless.Like having marshmallows for dinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours of my life that I will never get back were wasted.","review":"It serves me right for buying another Oprah selection. When am I going to learn that even if Oprah makes it sound good, a book with such a ridiculous premise is not going to work. My six year old son could have come up with a story that was more realistic, less contrived and less predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass by this one","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and didn't even bother to finish it. If you like dysfunctional lives go ahead. Personally once I read about a man being attracted to a 12 year old girl the rest of the story seems a bit of a waste. I prefer books that are pleasant to read and not brutal. Call me strange but I'd read any of Jan Karon's Mitford books 10 times over than start another like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, however ultimately very simplist.","review":"I found this book a delight to read, and foundd myself finishing it in one sitting, and glad that I did not purchash it, but borrowed it from a local library. I can understand why it has recieved many adult fiction awards, because it really suits that particular age group with its simple style of writing and happy-go-lucky ending. I can hardly say that it was an overly emotional or difficult read, however the excellent storyline was enough to entice me. I found this novel interesting enough, without tedium and simple to read, hence well worth the effort. Perhaps it is not the best book to purchash however, and it more suitably borrowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite make the grade","review":"This book is too superficial and sappy to really satisfy. The characters could be interesting if they weren't either completely perfect or completely evil. A more balanced and realistic approach would have been preferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"I couldn't even finish this.One character is a stalker whom we are supposed to like.The main character is a thief and we are supposed to like her.I don't think so.I know this was an \\"Oprah\\" book so that was supposed to make it literature????I don't think so.Perhaps a publisher paid Oprah to promote this drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The main character killed it for me","review":"I stopped reading this. I was 200 pages in by the time I stopped. I like the author's writing style, easy to follow along with and not overly bogged down with descriptions. I was hoping for this to be a charming southern novel, but the protagonist was so naive and dumb that I just got tired of reading about her. I didn't relate to her one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart-warming, inspiring tale!","review":"One of my all time favorite books. When you start reading this book, it is super hard to put it down! \\"Where the Heart Is\\" contains relatable themes and teaches many life lessons about love, family, the power of friendship, and growing up. This is one story I will continue to read over and over again! Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening my eyes to a different world","review":"The entire book was a joy to read and it took me on a journey. I was hardly able to do anything else while I was traveling into the world of Novalee Nation, the main character. I learned of a different part of America in this book, not just the landscape, but the people and their motives. To move from the innocence of youth into frightening and sometime disheartening adulthood in one giant leap made me realize so much I have to look forward to and the things I have already experienced. In some books you tend to fall in love with the characters and this was a great example of that type of novel. Billie Letts did a great job on this book and I look forward to future endeavors from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay read if you have nothing better to select from.","review":"This poor girl has more bad luck than is believable. The character names were also pretty unbelievable. I did not find this book to be very witty or entertaining. I did find it to be rather a ho-hum read. Definitely not worth the purchase price. Come on Oprah, you can pick better books than this....there are plenty of them out there!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that you can read quickly.","review":"This was an ejoyable book. Novalee really grew up from her experiences. It was great to read a book that puts some much emphasis on the joys of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"yech.","review":"When the reader-reviewers' enthusiastic words of praise include \\"Quickest read ever!\\" and \\"Finally, a book you don't need a degree to understand!\\"-- well, you know you're in trouble. The characters are two-dimensional and utterly predictable; the plot even more so (if that's possible). Billie Letts works every poor-but-plucky small-town-gal cliche in the book. As I said, yech.If you want a REAL slice of small town life, with characters you can believe in and whose problems you actually care about, try Barbara Kingsolver. Now THERE'S a writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Worth Ten Stars","review":"The only reason I insisted on buying this book at first was because I had seen a preveiw of the movie and I love Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, and just about every one in it. But the first page pulled me into it, and I couldn't stop until I'd finished it. Novalee Nation is an all American teen, dealing with, an unfortunatly common problem with us teens, teen pregnancy. But she overcomes it and becomes the gem of a small town in Oklahoma. And yes, the dialogue and overall word content of the book wasn't challenging but the things suggested in it were so overwhelming that Billie Letts seemed to know her readers might not be able to handle it. Even though the names are a bit unrealistic, they add spice and character to the book. It was a great read, and I hope the movie does it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Menace to Aviation","review":"I bought this book in Atlanta to read on a 5 hour flight to San Diego. From the premise, I thought, hm, a modern _Evening Primrose._ But no such luck. If I could have opened a window to toss it out over Abilene, I would have. I know that opening a window at 40,000 feet would probably have killed everyone on board. I would have taken that chance. It has just enough nastiness in it to make the treacle resemble real life to the young or uncritical reader but not enough insight, observation, or style to make either worth enduring. At least it should give hope to every hack who thinks (s)he has a bestseller living in the cupboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and Insipid","review":"I am amazed at the positive response this novel is getting! I did not realize that this was an Oprah-sanctioned read when I purchased it--I guess that explains some of it.How sugary sweet, isn't life wonderful, blah, blah, blah! Just what I want to read about.As a general rule, I abstain from Oprah's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break....","review":"This story was so contrived. The characters were silly. I am from the south and I never ran accross so many trumped up names - Moses Whitecotton and his sad, childless wife Certain Whitecotton. Lexie Coup and her gaggle of snack food children. This was ridiculous.I enjoy an easy read some times but this was beyond that. For example, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" was not a book that spent alot of time pondering the deeper questions about the heroines predicament. It was well written, interesting and brought some light to an area of life that I have not experienced. Light reading does not need to be simple, corny or predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the paper shredder?","review":"I'm not sure if you can give a book 0 stars, but this would be the one! If people actually find this book inspirational then they are the hopeless ones. This book is so unrealistic. How many pregnant 17 years olds could get it that easy? I'll admit this book makes it look pretty good. Maybe we should all get pregnant, head to Wal-Mart, meet Sam along with the other wonderful people of this Oklahoma town where money just comes to us in the mail. To top it off Novalee is an empty character. She has no personality and I saw no change or growth in her character througout the book. Some good uses for the book shreddings: a) line hamster cage b) good for packaging c) fill room with shreddings as a joke (that way you'll need to shred even more of them)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was able to put this book down and not pick it up!","review":"I bought this book because of all the hype I've heard about it. However, I was very disappointed. I didn't even finish it. The characters are underdeveloped and overly stereo-typed. The romance is this book was not developed, and as a result made it hard to relate to the characters. This book is too simplistic for any adult of average intelligence. The story and its characters are too suger-coated and unrealistic, therefore teaching nothing about real life. If you like supermarket paperbacks, then you will like this book. If you enjoy great pieces of literature, then save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I found this book sugary sweet and the characters unbelievable.

But the book reads too much like a Hallmark card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"The story was pretty good at first, but after I was done with half of it I had to force my self to read the rest. It was so unrealistic and had a child molesting part that I didn't like. It wasn't worth my time. I'm sorry that I got it. It disturbed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have been a Wal-mart commercial.","review":"This is a poor excuse for a novel.

The plot line will hook you right away. After starting to read I had a hard time putting it down. It is great heart touching story. The character describtions are great; you feel like you personally know each of the characters in the story. I have read it more than once and it is still great the second and third time. If you have seen the movie the book is ten times better. I personally didn't enjoy the movie and I read the book first. The book is so great that the movie just doesn't give the same experience as when reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood will like this one","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The writing is deft and flowing, and I wish thie world was as sweet as this book, but it is not. Billie skims over her characters' lives, too many are just cute eccentrics with little or no substance. Worse, however, is the shameless and predictable manipulation of the reader's feelings. Perhaps I am an old cynic, but our dear Novalee is just a bit too perky for me. Oddly, this character also appeared in Stephen King's Bag of Bones, also with the cutest daughter, also falling in love with a middle aged man..somehow, perhaps wrongly, I feel these writers are patronizing these women by making them a little too sweet and ernest. This is not a bad book, just very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was able to put this book down and not pick it up","review":"I bought this book because of all the hype I've heard about it.

Amazingly she lives in the Walmart by night and devours books at the library by day. All the characters in this book are a little over the top. None of the events in the book have much basis in reality. It is enough to start to believe all those bad \\"southern\\" jokes that are popular on the internet. The be true to your heart ending wraps it all up in a neat package at the end. This is not a terrific book, but has enough character appeal to help you make it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid plot, idiotic names, cop out ending","review":"I think this book was really terrible. It was so contrived that you could guess what was going to happen. I found it predictable and boring as well as on the insipid side. I think Oprah can choose better books than this for her book club!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read- Fun book","review":"I usually enjoy the Oprah books and recieved this one for Christmas. Within 2 days I was done. It seemed like every chapter ended with a cliff hanger and you just had to keep reading. It did have a soap opera quality that was very endearing. But having lived in Oklahoma for 4 years, I truly did believe the people Novalee met could be real. I am recommending this book to my reader friends for a nice, light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm wisdom that soothes the soul and lightens the spirit.","review":"Ms. Letts' writting style is nicely reminiscent of Pat Conroy's and Ann Tyler's.

The characters are bigger than life, similar to those in Fried Green Tomatoes and her writing style a close match of Barbara Kingsolver. Having grown up in Southeastern Oklahoma, and in a town where the Walmart grand opening was cause for the National Guard to arrive, I can attest that all the characters COULD be seen at the Walmart on any given day. She writes about a way of life she knows - and it shows. Anyone from any small town will recognize the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, lots of fun!","review":"I really enjoyed this story. It's not the most scholarly book I ever read, but one of the most engaging. I was sorry when it was over, because I had become so involved with the characters. This would be a great vacation book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifts the human spirit!!!","review":"Billie Letts writes an account of human endurance and our spirits' ability to triumph despite terrible circumstance. Novalee Nation is an inspiring character who teaches us the power to overcome and not be weakened by a \\"victim-mentality\\". An incredible read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A soap opera for teenagers","review":"I think that with this book, Oprah has reduced her book choices to the lowest common denominator. The novel is at best an instructive read for a 14 or 15 year old girl because it contains straightforward, canned lessons on the dangers of teenage pregnancy and the importance of building self-esteem as an independent woman of character and substance. As a literary work, however, it is predictable, with rather flat sterotypical characters, and simplistic expressions of what could be complicated themes. It is an insult to the intelligence of most mature adults. Over all, it is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of heart","review":"Bill Letts book is astonishing...I am a braillist and a writer, I would love to braille this book, it is full of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting book","review":"I enjoyed this book, although I thought I would not because I usually do not like Oprah's picks. I was impressed with this one. Wouldn't it be nice for our communities to come together the way the people in Sequoya Okla. did. There was an interesting mix of characters that made this small town unique. And Billy Ray, a perfect example of when you do wrong to others, it will come back to haunt you. He floundered while Novalee rose to new heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"This book has touched m like no book has ever before.

The writer really grabs my attention and I absolutely loved each and every character!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I loved this book! Where the Heart Is is a heartfelt book full of laughter and tears told through the eyes of a young girl who finds herself in a small town in Oklahoma. I love the names in this book.

How many times can we read about some poor soul that has lost their way and tries to find it throughout the book! this is just so far fetched and sugar coated. this book did start off okay, and i did somewhat like the style of billie letti's writing. but then it just got to the point where nothing good was happening, i totally lost interest in the characters and couldn't even finish the bore. i skimmed the last couple of chapters just to see what happened..which wasn't much! total disappointment on my part. if you have found any of oprah's selections bad in the past, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Where the Heart Is\\"","review":"I first experinced \\"Where the Heart Is\\", when I went to the movies w/ my best friend to see the movie.

I fell in love w/ the movie, and cried, and laughed, not nesscerely in that order:) I can tell you that I am about to read the book, and relize that it will not be the same as the movie, but I don't care, this girl has found her favorite book and movie, I have became a devout reader of Novalee Nation, and I hope to read more about her, if Ms. Letts is reading this, I hope she will write a sequel:) Novalee and Americus have so much ahead, and i would love to be there to see. GREAT BOOK:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Heart Is","review":"I found this book overly simplistic.

I thought it was appropriate that the story centered around Wal-Mart. That chain has really has become the center of small towns.By the end of the book you feel you have known Novalee and Americus for years and they are your friends. Their lives make you look and question your own. The writing style was interesting and kept my attention. I do wish the ending had been a little more definitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the book was a total put down.","review":"I think the book totally miss lead you.

This story was way to unrealistic, and sugary sweet. Everything was wrong from the way Novalee (a 17 year old) handled things, to the number of things that happened, from a killer tornado, to child abuse. This is like all of the worst soap opera's combined. I definantly wouldn't recomend this book to anyone with a mental ability above that of a third graders"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"Someone loaned me this book -- I would not have bought it on my own or even heard about it, since I'm not an Oprah watcher and mystery is my genre of choice. I gave this book 2 stars, even though I didn't finish it, because the characters are memorable -- I just grew weary of reading about their depressing lives. Later, I ran across the movie on TV -- in progress -- and I watched it to find out what happened in the end. I liked the music in the movie very much. I guess you could say that I was just not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic story","review":"Where The Heart Is was a very good book with a realistic story. It was about somthing that could actually happed today. I liked the fact that it didn't focus on just one person the entire time, but told little stories about other people also."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY REVIEW","review":"Where the Heart is was very intertaining book. It let us understand the headaches people experience through out life. In this particular case, it showed a young woman having to manage herself as well as her unborn fetus. She tries to survive life and it's obstacles. After being left by her boyfriend she has to find shelter and care for her and her baby. Lucky for her she runs into alot of people who cares and help show her the way. This book show you that even though you go through many situations there are always a cause to everything that happens. The book tells us that you can still enjoy life with a child. That the world does not end just because you had bad faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was captivating the first time, but the 2&3..","review":"I loved this book the first time I picked it up. I loved it so much I decided to read it a second time. Good decision. I realized that this book is basically a series of tragic events, one after another, no climax, no plot. Some events are completely unnecessary and just confuse thereader further. There is too much going on and there no clear point to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking and unnecessary violence","review":"I was enjoying this book until I came to the shocking violence involving children which I could not get past. When I picked up this book and read on the back \\"...moving, funny, and unforgettable journey..\\" I did not expect such disturbing content that I cannot get out of my mind now. I am surprised that Oprah endorses this book involving the violence against children. I think the book could have hinted some sort of warning for the weak hearted like myself. It seems everyone enjoys this book and the wonderful characters, but how do they get past a boy getting raped?"},{"rating":"1","title":"bubble gum book","review":"I found myself wanting to keep reading to find out what happened, but at the same time not believing how incredibly HOKIE it was! (example-Sam Walton visiting Novalee in the hospital) I was very surprised Oprah picked this out out of all the books that could be chosen and how are they possibly going to make a movie out of it? If this is the best book so many people have ever read I feel sad for them. It just felt to me like Letts was trying too hard in her writing or that she would write any unbelievable thing to sound original. Didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Charm to Disarm","review":"Where the Heart Is by Billie Letts is the funny and touching story of Novalee Nation left pregnant and alone in a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma and her struggles to pull herself together and upwards. She works at this through the help of many of the colourful characters of the town, particulary some fiesty women such as Sister Thelma Husband (my favourite) and Lexie Coop (with her large brood each named after candy). There are many setbacks on her upward trajectory but the author and Novalee handle each with heart, which this book is stuffed to the brim with. A delightful read on a summer's day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the video version","review":"Novalee is a teenager when she is pregnant with her daughter, to whom she gives birth in a Wal-Mart. She is taken in by a wonderful \\"family\\" and makes many new friends, including Lexi. Novalee spends time with a man named Forny Hull whose sister is the town Librarian.I think despite the misfortunes Novalee encounters, she brought a lot of them on herself. I also think that the way she treats Forny toward the end is wrong. However, it is a true taste of life, and the book is definitely better than the video version. In the video, the actors and actresses are always beautiful and unblemished. Billie Letts' intention was for the characters to all have some blemish or physical problem to make them seem more human and to show that we all have weaknesses. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing and crying go hand in hand while reading this book.","review":"A truly well written novel. I giggled and cried my way through this novel. Billie Letts creation of Novalee Nation is wonderful. I think we might all have a bit of Novalee in us, or wish we had. I caution you about reading this novel in a public place, as it pushes a full range of emotions to the surface with each turn of a page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I thought this book was very good. Many people have writtent that they didn't like how unrealistic the things that Novalee faced were, and in many cases they may have been...however I think that this book accomplished what it set out to do, and that is give a sense of family as a community, and to show what is possible when people care about each other. I would recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching read....","review":"This story is about a seventeen year old girl named Novalee.Novalee is superstitious about sevens for some reason; but she's thirty seven pounds overweight, because of her baby that's soon to be born.

People will know what I mean.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chewing gum for the eyes","review":"A great book if you like your reading to be totally undemanding.

For soap opera adicts everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"As a college student, I spend my time reading and writing papers for four English classes. I was relieved when Winter Break came around and I had enough time to read a book of my choice. I chose Where the Heart Is because one day as I was channel surfing, I saw a recommendation for it on Oprah. I was persuaded to read it because I was so impressed with She's Come Undone, that I hoped that it would be its equal. Imagine my disappointment as I read this book and waited for something exciting to happen, it never did. I can't believe that I wasted my time and money on this flop. Maybe during Spring Break, I'll rent some movies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin, simple book with no plot or character development","review":"I found this book to be very thin in character development and kept waiting for the plot to thicken--it never did. Kind of felt duped when I finished. Characters were rather depressing and had ridiculous names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"What was Oprah thinking? The characters are ridiculously one-dimensional, the plot is ludicrous, and the story is laughably sentimental. More than anything, though, the writing is just flat-out bad. Strives for a \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" feel, but falls miserably short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, ridiculous","review":"This book is a real chore to read. You have to endure sleazy characters with nauseating names behaving in subhuman manner. I would not want to know these people in real life, nor would I want to read about them again. Please, Oprah, with all the good books out there, why did you choose this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quality reading","review":"I found this novel to be ridiculously contrived. From the precious names of the characters to the totally implausible story line, it was like a particularly bad after school special with a little child molestation thrown in. Isn't is just wonderful how poor little Novalee's life goes from downtrodden to happily ever after all wrapped up in a neat little bow. It was like a southern trailer park fantasy story. What a syrupy waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"The only reason I finished reading this book was because it was an easy read and I knew it would only cost me another hour or so. It was a lifeless book, with kooky characters thrown in to make it interesting, but one never gets a good sense of who they are and everything stays very much on the surface and extremely predictable. It was a serious disapointment, even for a book that I had expected to be fluffy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn,t Recommend It","review":"This book feels like fiction.Novalee is the most unreal of any of the characters.The plot moves along without me caring about her, because she continues to sound like a paper figure. The other characters are better drawn. Also I'm offended by the child rape scene. Why does Ophra often pick books with horrible things happening in them? Skip this book and don't look forward to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel rich with heart","review":"I borrowed a friend's copy for a day, but after I got through half of it, I realized I was going to REALLY enjoy the novel, so I purchased my own copy.It is a sweet story about a young girl finding herself. This has since become one of my favorite books, because I love the way it seems so real. These incidents could really happen, and might have. I fully recommend this novel to anyone searching for a good read, and can hardly wait to read another of Lett's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a BREAK!","review":"Letts should take lessons from some of the great authors and develop fewer characters. This book had so many unbelievable characters and situations. Things happen to people but not all to the same person in real life. Once again, Oprah picked a strange book. If people feel like this is a winner, our country is in trouble--what is normal anymore? What are we trying to teach our kids is normal? People obsessed with band aid?!? That is when I knew this book was a waste of time! Oprah should pick books that make people think about ways to improve their lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was billed as a \\"funny\\" read...I saw NOTHING funny about a small child being subjected to sodomy. As for the rest of the book... the transitions were sloppy, jumping months or years without a hint until the middle of the next paragraph, the characters were cute but not believable. And the character's names? I only bought it because the previous selection, Midwives, was excellent. This was not. I have half a mind to send Oprah a bill for my purchase price! HAHAHA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Formulaic","review":"I just don't get the enthusiastic five-star reviews for this book. It was trite, formulaic, and unbelievable. What bothers me is that in the reviews of this book that I read, not one person seemed disturbed by the totally gratuitous rape scene of the young boy. This scene was just a cheap exploitive attempt at drama which did absolutely nothing to further the plot. Letts is certainly lacking in creativity if she has to rely on gratuitous child abuse to shock her readers. I'm saddened by the trend I see in books today of using child abuse as an easy means of creating a crises when it's not necessary to the story. Doesn't this bother anyone else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book speaks for itself.","review":"An economic cop out. \\"Where the Heart Is\\" gave up any chance for lasting impressions on society when it traded thought for readers. It becomes evidence for proof of Marxism as philosophy and feeling fall victim to money. I was disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenging situation for a strong woman","review":"This was a fabulous book! Billie Letts creates a wonderful character who discovers her strengths as a mother and learns that despite others opinions, she is a valuable human being. Although placed in the most trying circumstances, stranded in a strange city 8 or so months pregnant, she overcomes the odds and is able to resolve the past. She's a complex character with lovable quirks. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!! Wonderful writing and a good story.","review":"Billie's use of words creates a world which is accessible by almost everyone who has the great pleasure of opening it and entering the world of Novalee. I remember the beginning of this book, and a wonderful dinner party whree Billie shared her story of a young woman enduring what so many young women do. Now, to see it not only published, but also award winning show that dreams come true. The book speaks to the young and old alike. It is a book daughters and mothers can share. Make it part of your Christmas list if you have any young women on your shopping list. They'll enjoy the book and the wisdom held within."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be o.k.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Living in a stressing area where pressure to attain a certain salary, job, lifestyle is predominant, it's nice to read a simple book like this. It reminds us that no matter what the circumstance, if you are a nice person and try just a little, that you will be o.k. With or without the fancy suit, house, or car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad editing!","review":"I was very disappointed. The idea of a girl living in a Wal-Mart was interesting, but that is all about this book. Letts should have developed and integrated the plots if she intended to make the story longer than she had thought at first. It's not \\"twists and turns\\" as she said, but rather adding ideas repeatedly. I wonder what the editor was doing. I think the biggest weakness of this book is it didn't have good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This person paid Oprah to recommend this book","review":"I just want to know how much Billie Letts paid Oprah to suggest this book. It's dull, boring, and the plot leaves way too much to be desired. In many parts, the story dragged. Hey Oprah, get some sort of clue in the future. Heck, with our luck, this will be your next movie. I think it's time to terminate the Oprah Book Club!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the stupid names.","review":"One of Oprah's book club books I read and decided if she recommended it, I would either hate it or just tolerate it. It was really a shame, though, because the book could have been edited and been a good one. I loved the part of the plot where the main character lives in Wal-mart. Haven't we all thought about what it would be like to be left in a store at night after it closed? What would we eat? Where would we sleep? Where would we hide?PLEASE REWRITE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit by the club","review":"I will no longer be reading books on the mere basis of them being from Oprah's book Club. I, for one, am disturbed by graphic images of children being raped or molested which seems to be an ongoing theme in these books. (Why did none of the other reviews mention this)? I did not \\"love\\" any of the characters, nor did I find them to be very realistic...except for Novalee's best friend, Lexie, who's lack of discretion and protectiveness where her children are concerned, and promiscuity contributes to what is wrong with the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story","review":"This book really touches the heart. I loved it, I own the book AND the movie. Worth reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is too corny to be believed","review":"I simply cannot believe that the American publishing world would fall for this kind of inane levity. Every character/plot device has just been repolished and repackaged from a poor variety of films, tv shows and novels. As far as reality goes, I am not sure whether a girl of 17 would have acted as wisely as Novalee did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...but can pass as a beach novel","review":"It started out spellbinding and caught my attention from the get go. Young, pregnant girl- abandoned- and living in secret in a Walmart store where she's been dumped by her crumb of a boyfriend. (Admit it, isn't is a great fantasy to think of living in a store and getting to use all the merchandise at your leisure when no one is looking?). And then it got silly. Totally unrealistic. A little too predictable. Some authors can carry off nutty characters but Billie Letts didn't convince me with the people in this story. Novalee Nation is just a little too perfect in her abandonment. Just a little too wounded. The ending is pat and contrived. And then they went ahead and made a movie about this book? I heard that it, too, was pure drivel. Skip it unless it's the only book left in the doctor's office waiting room."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book","review":"Wow, this book was great.

I figured for 3.00 how bad could it be? Not bad at all. I was wary because the movie looked overly sappy and retarded, the book is none of those things. This is a fantastic read, all at once funny and heartbreakingly sad. The main character, Novalee Nation is a strong and proud heroine. This is a terrific beach read (or a saturday afternoon find!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Novalee An Inspiration","review":"Where the Heart Is by Billie Letts is a novel about a young pregnant girl named Novalee Nation.

I really enjoyed this novel but I lost interest in it half way through. I got busy with leaving my home for the first time in my life. I left for school and when I returned home in the spring I was lost and confused about my life. I picked up 'Where the Heart Is' hoping to find some clearity. I found Novalee very inspiring and I grew attatched to her. I realized that I am so lucky to be where I am and not have to deal with what she has to. This novel put my life into perspective and I realized what I had to do. I recomend this novel to anybody who is looking for clearity. Remember what you are blessed with and go from there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"didn't think l was going to like it at first","review":"I was not hooked by the first sentence or chapter. For me it took a little while to get into it. But the characterisation was just beautiful, each person individually real, with their own little quirks. I liked how it wasn't really glossy, that there was tragedy woven in with the good times. Heartwarming story that makes you smile and weep."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw the movie before I read the book...","review":"I admit it... I saw the movie before I read the book, but the movie was sooo good I had to read the book... The book is exceptional, but the movie is great! I loved the characters, and the novel was written very well... and it's an easy read... I read it without thinking \\"I have to hurry and get to the end\\" it's a very mellow novel and I just took my time reading it... I think alot of readers need to read this book, just to relax and not be too anxious to finish it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This was one the best books I have read in a long time. I was really draw to Novalee and the other characters she meets along the way. I found it interesting how Billie Letts kept you in touch with Willie Jack and how his life turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"One too many tradgedies","review":"In seven years Novalee experienced homelessness, having a baby inside a Wal-Mart, death of friends, kidnapping, rape of children, near death of her best friend by an abusive boyfriend, a tornado that made her homeless again. We thought the author had a wonderful story to tell about a sweet girl trapped by poverty and circumstances. But she was unsure of how to best convey the emotional weight of that and so she produced almost endless tragedies to tug at your heartstrings. Wal-Mart was almost saintly in this book. It came across to us, as an advertisement for a store that the author knew would sell a lot of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildy amusing but inaccurate","review":"The book was amusing no doubt, but I grew up in Oklahoma and now live in New Mexico. I found the characters missing the feel of these two great places. I've been to Santa Rosa many times and have never even seen a mosquito...NM is not known for their mosquitos...The choice names of the characters was a classic case of an author going \\"over the top.\\" Why wasn't the indian boy from one of the five great tribes of Oklahoma instead of a tribe no one has ever heard of. Finally, does anyone out there believe that Sam Walton would uphold a 17 yr old pregnant teenage mother??? One last thing that really bothered me. Novalee won a Southwest photography contest. No one that I know thinks of Oklahoma as being in the southwest. Small annoyances; i admit. They are so numerous that they distract from the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters brought to life...","review":"I found the characters in Where the Heart Is to be very well described and I eagerly devoured the story. I especially thought the Walmart part was a unique twist to what could've turned into a predictable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed reading this book, it was so true to life.","review":"This book was very true to life. I could honestly see someone going through everything that she went through. The misfortunes with the number 7 and how it worked out in the end was exciting. When I read this book, I did not want to put it down. It was a great book in which I would recommend to anyone who would ask!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A WARM, DELIGHTFUL, FEEL-GOOD BOOK!","review":"Once I started this book I couldn't put it down! I was so drawn to the main character that I wanted to see how her life was going to end up! Unlike many of the other Oprah Bookclub books, the main character in this book is NOT a victim. She turns an unfortunate situation into a positive one and turns her life around! The book is a fast read, that's warm, touching, lively, entertaining and funny. Read it - you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly enjoyable read","review":"One of the best of Oprah's suggestions! I enjoyed the characters and the warmth. With all the troubles Novalee faced, what joy she found! This is a book you will not want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading book with some thought provoking one-liners!","review":"Being from a small town in Texas, I could relate to the \\"Wal-Mart scene!\\" I enjoyed the book very much and did not want to put it down or want it to end! Novalee was an interesting character and so were her friends. I wish the world were filled with more Sister Husbands! How about a Part II?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!! Delightful story, I really cared about them","review":"I really loved the way Billie Letts developed the characters. I really cared about what happened to them and simply couldn't put the book down. I just loved the whole story!!!! Thank you for a great book and am looking foward to reading The Honk and Holler Opening Soon. Thanks to Oprah for introducing me to such fabulous reading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read about Characters who are REAL","review":"This is an enjoyable novel---as entertaining and well written as Barbara Kingsolver's fiction. Letts' personal experiences in Oklahoma bring life to the characters, and the realism and charm of the story captured me. I don't buy many books; this one proved worth the investment. It was too good not to pass on to a friend. What a great antidote to the slick personalities we get thru the media in America; Novalee is genuine, and her friendships and struggles are, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of great tenderness and the spirit of forgiveness","review":"I loved this book. It is one of the few that I will probably read again. Novalee is a great heroine. She keeps on going in spite of difficulties with the ability to form loving relationships with people she accidently comes in contact with; relationships that become permanent in her life. Although she received little love in her early life, she certainly has a lot of love in her that she shines on her \\"family\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it down....","review":"My cousin was reading this over the summer and I stole it from her. I refused to give it back until I finished. Billy Letts forced my to not stop reading this book. I was up til 4 am reading it. It really makes you think about things in different light. And the 7's thing. I loved that. $7.77. How genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great uplifting story...I loved it!","review":"I love the way Billie writes! Her story was about down to earth people...people that you just fall in love with. I loved Novalee Nation, what a powerful spirit she is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully refreshing!","review":"What an absolutely wonderful and refreshing book! I was drawn in to the cast of characters. Letts uses a play on words with the character names and each one couldn't be better described. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a fun simple read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was outstanding","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't bare to put the book down from the birth at Walmart to the death of sister husband this book is excellent!!!! i would recommend this book to anyone and everyone first time readers and book lovers.... enjoy !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming. It's okay to fall for its charm.","review":"This book was a purely enjoyable read. I was bummed when I finished it because I looked forward to reading a few chapters every night. I must agree that it does exude a Forrest Gumpish optimism, but I don't see anything worng with that--in fact, I find it refreshing. The characters are charming and the story is heartwarming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly entertaining!","review":"After a heartless abandonment, Rosalee and her daughter are embraced by the loving characters in a small southwestern town. You can't help but cheer her on, as she rises above her circumstances, gradually transforming from a teen with no roots, into a woman with a home and a purpose. Rosalee's love and unconditional acceptance of people are what make her character so attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, life, and all that junk that clutters life","review":"Enjoyed this book because it showed us that friendships don't always come in perfect little packages. It was truly a heartwarming book and I highly recommend it to anyone.Also enjoyed Mail by MM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Preserverance is an Accomplishme","review":"Novalee is proof that you cannot judge someones attributes by their outerward appearance. She also demonstrates through her inner strenghth that lifes sorrows and difficulties do not have to be a hinderance to ones aspirations in life. Anyone can be anything they choose if they set their heart and mind to it.Also recommended: The Broken Mirror by Kirk Douglas. This is such a soul-touching read that I can't figure out why I never see it advertised. Especially for young adolescent readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning the meaning of life","review":"This book is captivating and funny. Being 19, I related with Novalee through her successes and her mistakes. The names of the characters are strong and everlasting. I missed them all as I read the final page. I even gave the book to a lady I met on the train. Such a story needs to be passed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is good","review":"I thought that the new Oprah book is really good, and is a good addition to her book club :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relative to todays society","review":"Where the heart is, is inspiring to the heart and cleansing for the soul. It has a realistic portrayal of life as a teen mother. It gives another angle to life that many teens miss or disregard. I am Novalees age and I really could relate to her and after reading the book I know why I want to wait to fall in love and get pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I read it!","review":"I am glad that I picked this book up to read. I got it at a yard sale and was pleased that I read it. It is a simple story and easy to read. If you like a book with quirky characters, you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Light Read","review":"This book reads quickly and is a delightful tale that is much better than the movie. I found it to be a very light read but still heart-warming and endearing. The fluid style of writing contributes to the ease of how this reads (a great job by the author.) This is perfect for in between those more brain-taxing heavy 500+ page books, or great for summer vacation. Do add this to your list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of heart, flat characters","review":"Novalee seemed to drag as a character. Perhaps, she was more take than give which bothered me. The Wal Mart experience should have been lengthened. How did she dodge the nightwatch, the janitor? How did inventory account for the missing clothes and food? Willy Jack was an interesting character, although he was the villain. Forney was too good to be true. In spite of these traits, the book reads fast and has memorable instances (the tornado, Jolene's bar scene, and the tragic chapter 29)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was tricked!","review":"The story was going along fine, just fine and then the author delved into explicit child molestation tabloidism. Why? There are already too many stories about women and children being brutalized. I thought this would be different but I was tricked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Although I liked the main character, the pacing was choppy.","review":"This book started off great. I really liked the main character, and the way she took up residence in the Wall Mart. But I didn't like the way she integrated the story of the \\"bad\\" boyfriend and the \\"good\\" girl. It was so choppy. Then she threw in a rape scene - wow! I just didn't buy it - that's been so over-used to get the \\"Bad Man\\" idea across. Most of the men here are either jerks or wierd. I'm so sick of \\"Oprah\\" books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have really enjoyed the other Oprah book club selections, but this was one a flop. The characters lacked depth, the storyline lacked substance and I lacked enthusiasm by page 200. Sorry to say I wasted my time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Island","review":"I read this book for a book discussion club. The book is trite and obvious. Poor, ignorant, pregnant teenage girls turning out to be loving, competent and intelligent mothers... violent, drunken, lazy red necks see the error of their ways..reclusive bookworms find joy and love..the rich and educated are really villans..and every minorty character is warm, kind and welcoming. Politically correct fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please","review":"To be honest, I found it difficult to read this book completely through. It came to me highly recommended, and I must say I was extremely disappointed. The characters were unbelievable and annoying to me. The book was overly sappy and sentimental, and at times just plain ridiculous. And I am quite sure that no one bothered to proofread this edition. I noticed that someone mentioned that it is recommended to teens. I think that it is best left to those at a ninth grade reading level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing to Say the Least","review":"As a huge fan of Oprah (ie. I really trust her judgment), I cannot be more shocked about her picking of this book for her book club. I felt Letts was trying too hard to make this book the classic, cheesy tale of a girl faced with much contrived adversity, who finds all these wonderul, caring people, who give her all of life's answers! Puhhlease. The story didn't flow well, and I didn't feel that characters were realistic or well developed at all. For example Novalee's mother and Sam Walton were snuck in for about a page! Readers who give this book anymore than 1 star, can't have read too many good books. I don't think Letts is a bad writer, I just think she tried too hard with this one. And Oprah, please make better selections in future. Please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, Aimless Story","review":"Not a lot in this book made sense, so I wasn't sure I would finish it. But, I did - as there wasn't much besides fluff between the covers, the pages went fast.I wanted to like the characters; they were just so flat it was hard to have empathy for them. The worst part, though, was all of the contrived, random events that required the reader to suspend all belief in order to swallow the mush this author was serving up. All the things that happened to Novalee were a string of ridiculously unbelievable incidents that seemed to serve no real purpose as far as moving the plot forward was concerned. It's like the author was trying to write like John Irving, trying to make you laugh one minute then cry the next. She can't pull it off, however; but does succeed in making me laugh at this book's absurdity and cry at the fact that I spent a portion of my life reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where The Herat Is","review":"where the Heart Is, is a book about a young girl named Novalee Nations. Novalee was left in a wal-mart in oklahoma by her boyfriend Willy Jack. They are on there way to California to start a new life. Novalee was seventeen, seven mounths pregnant, thirty-seven pounds over weight, with a supperstion about sevens. Novalee was now on her own and without a place to go. So she decided to live in the Wal-Mart. The Book just gets better and better from this point on. It shows the compassion that Novalee has and how strong her faith is that everything will turn out OK. Where the Heart Is, is the best book i have read in a long time. Go out and Buy it TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart Shines","review":"I never heard of the novel before watching the movie - In fact, I just happened upon the book in the bookstore and was surprised the movie was based on a novel.I like the issues the book deals with - Teen pregnancy as the highlight, of course. I have known young women who have gotten pregnant and left school, some giving their children up and others working as single moms.I think Novalee is a good example of how one can continue on and be successful despite early unplanned childbirth and no support from the father. Sure, she makes a lot of mistakes but she grows, and in the end you see that she is a stronger person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I loved reading \\"Where the heart Is\\", from Billie Letts. It is a very sweet novel, and I fell in love with the characters. This is an irresistible story about a 17 year old, pregnant, abandoned by her boyfriend at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma when they were driving to California. She soon finds out about the interresting and loving people that live in that little town. Some people might find this book \\"cheesy\\", but I enjoyed it and recommend it too. I've read some other Oprah's Book Club books, and thought they tended to be a little depressing. Not this one, though. It is a great story, easy to read, and one of those books you want to read again someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the heart is, is the best book!!!!!","review":"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down, I read it from cover to cover twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond horrible","review":"This is the worst book I've read so far this year, and I read approximately 3 novels per week. The characters are flat and one-dimensional. All of the \\"crises\\" that the protaganist faces are contrived--they serve only to allow her to overcome them.I found the novel to be a candy-coated, sticky-sweet piece of dribble, more appropriately classified in the same genre as a Harlequin Romance.\\"Where the Heart Is\\" is yet another reason to steer clear of Oprah selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"All around good Book!","review":"This book really kept me going. It was an all around good book that will keep your interest. I didn't want to put the book down and read it in two days! Not very predictable, but great ending! (also while passing through Sallisaw, OK- the town the book was set in - I had to make a special trip by the Wal-Mart.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book shows you the true meaning of life in moving way.","review":"What would you do if you were left at a Wal-Mart is some town that you don't know, when you are seventeen and pregnant without any money? That is just was Novalee Nation had to do.Novalee never really had a good childhood and when she met Will Jack she thought she was in love. That was until she got pregnant and left at Wal-Mart.The little town that Novalee is stranded at makes her feel welecome. A blue-haired religious woman takes Novalee and her baby, Americus, in as her own and the librarian falls in love with her. This book shows you the struggles of life that Novalee goes through to make all ends meet and all the struggles of everyday life. It also shows you the true meaning of life in a moving yet funny way. This book definitely shows you \\"Where the Heart Is\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great and Fun Read!","review":"I love Billie's style of characters. She paints a very vivid picture of the characters. I couldn't wait to go back and read the previous Billie Letts book. I am anxiously anticipating the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful book. It kept me hooked from the very beginning. Trials and terrors that she went through were amazing. I am glad that I don't have the unlucky sevens. If anyone knows any books that I would like if a really liked this one. Please e-mail me LaurenL@gps.eduLauren"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming and tragic tale with a touch of innocence","review":"I found this book to be touching and sweet. The characters are well defined and you really get a taste of life in the heartland of America. The ending needs a little more exploration by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in Ages","review":"As a high schooler with a high reading level I rarely find a book that will strike my fancy. I have tried everything but not every book satisfies me. Where the Heart Is was a wonderful book! I couldn't put it down, I read until 1 in the morning just to finish the book. What makes you connect with Novalee is her vulnerablility. Sure I now realize all she went through may not happen to everyone, but you follow her will until the end. This book actually made me think about MY life and where I was going with it. I don't want to end up in the situations that Novalee went through, but I Do want the will that she had, that guiding force that tells you everything will be all right. All I can say is, Sequel anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story With Heart","review":"Where the Heart Is definately comes from the heart. Billie Lettes writes with such candor and ease that by the time the heroine has been dumped at Walmart there is no way a reader would dare to leave her there alone. Thanks!!! I loved it. I read this book several years before Oprah brought it to the public's eye. It definitely belongs in this winning circle. Pat Grissom email me at lgrissom@flash.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved 'Fried Green Tomatoes', her","review":"This is a very compelling story. The characters all have their 'quirks', but the author portrays them in a sympathethic and understanding manner. I got this book for Christmas, and had finished it by Boxing Day evening. I thought it was well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully written story!","review":"\\"Where the Heart Is\\" is a beautifully written story of a young girl and her adventure through life in a small town. Wonderful characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love about the Wal-mart baby!","review":"Humor. Pathos. Drama. Quirky characters. This book has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read with plenty of emotional punch","review":"The critics who ripped this book should remember that it really is targeting teenagers. Letts gives us a charming, fast-moving story that chronicles Novalee's transition from abandoned pregnant teen to happy, well-adjusted mother and community treasure. While the good seems a little too good (gifts of money, a rich boyfriend, photography awards) and the bad a little too harsh (kidnappings, beatings, rapes, natural disasters and deaths), this really is a story worth your time and attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal Is Where It Is","review":"From the characters' ridiculous names to their one-dimensional and unbelievable behavior, this reading left me cold. Absolutely nothing in this sorry tale rang true. I cannot imagine how this book received such glowing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame, weak, lame, weak, lame, weak","review":"I was sorely disappointed.I had been a devout Oprah follower up until this point. I loved SONG OF SOLOMON, BELOVED and SHE's COME UNDONE.But WHERE THE HEART IS does not appeal to the same crowd.I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the names. Americus Nation!!!!! I mean, come on!!Over all, the book is very contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was an over rated book for simple minds","review":"this book was an enormous disappointment. It's lesson was more for a third grader than an adult. It's unrealistic, hapilly-ever-after ending left me bored to tears, and begging for the pages to be shorter. i regret ever reading this book, because of it's childish storyline, and predictability. I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Unenchanting","review":"In Where the Heart is, everything is like that small town where Novalee lands--boring, slow paced, and uneventful. The book is terribly predictable and unexciting. I do not reccommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I READ FROM THE OPRAH BOOK CLUB, AND IF THIS IS ANY INDICATION OF THE REST OF THE SELECTIONS, IT WILL SURELY BE MY LAST. COULD THIS STORY HAD BEEN ANY LESS BORING? I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH. I JUST DIDN'T GET IT. I FELT AS IF I WAS READING THIS BOOK FOR A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT. WHAT WAS WITH THESE WACKY CHARACTERS? BAND AIDS? HOW ABOUT HAVING SOME NORMAL CHARACTERS WITH AT LEAST SOME SEMI-NORMAL NAMES???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I picked up this book because I've read \\"Honk and Holler Opening Soon\\" and really enjoyed it. This book is nothing like it. It's raw and gratuitous. I'm not easily offended, but please, did I have to know in graphic detail how a rapist sodomized a young boy? Do I need to know that a woman's eyelid was split open and the eyeball protruded through it? Disgusting!Here's the funny part. I finished the book (I'm neurotic like that) and left it in a restaurant in Malaysia. The restaurant calls the room in the hotel I'm staying at to tell me I left it behind. I thank them and hang up. Two minutes later the doorbell to the room rings and it's a waiter from the restaurant with the dang book in his hand! I can't even lose this thing!Long story short - pass on this one unless you like gratuitous, forced violence. \\"Honk and Holler\\" is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIVEL","review":"Not my type of novel. If you want interesting Southern 'life lessons' read Frannie Flagg or Rebecca Wells. Both have much more style and flair than Billie Letts. Novalee et al were cardboard cutout characters. Such that you would find in Walmart. How fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, LIGHT READING","review":"Billie Letts' cast of characters in Where The Heart Is are so endearing. Each is quirky in their own way but so very loving except maybe for Willie Jack who I disliked immediately. I loved the Wal Mart references and I'm sure the Wal Mart company loved them even more. I would have given this book 5 stars but I felt it got bogged down 3/4 of the way through. If you're looking for a nice, easy, get away from it all read, then this book might be the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say?","review":"I heard such great things about this book, so I decided to check it out. A quarter of the way through the book, I realized I was still waiting to get into it. It was not boring, but it sure was not exciting. But, what can I say, I finished it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"This book was absolutely ridiculous. The characters are contrived stereotypes and may I ask why all of them have equally ridiculous names (Americus sounds like the name of a naval ship, not a baby)? The characters in this novel are completely 1-dimensional and Letts doesn't stray far from stereotypes: the inhabitants of small-town middle America are friendly, simple, open-hearted and have no personality whatsoever! There is seemingly little plot and the love story between main character Novalee and the town's librarian has no chemistry.I thought this book was humiliating to read. If you enjoy books found in the aisle of your supermarket this book if for you (I imagine it's 1 small step up from Fabio). If you care for something with a little more substance, I advise you to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"\\"Where the Heart Is\\" was not a great book. I didn't like it very much for a number of reasons. The thing that bugged me more than anything else was the language. Whenever the character Willy Jack was involved, there was an unreasonable amount of vulgarity. A close second were the character descriptions. Billie Letts did a wonderful job describing the scenery, but she tended to forget about the characters. She only described characters when speaking about their deformities. When I read a book, I like to be able to picture the characters. As far as hair, eye color, and skin tone are concerned, there was very little description. When she did describe them, she did it without motivation. Altogether, the book was very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and funny!","review":"This book was funny. One can't help but love Novalee Nation. She embodies the phrase, \\"give me lemons and I'll make lemonade\\". Novalee finds a way to make the most of the life that she has, even when things are pretty bleak. Of course, it helps that she meets people who taking a liking to her and give her lots of support. It's a quick read, uncomplicated, hilarious. Take this on a cross-atlantic flight as I did....the 8 hours will fly by:)))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart Is","review":"A pregnant Novalee is left in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart by her boyfriend Willy Jack on a trip to California.

This is one of those books that you can read over, and over again. Billie Letts brings out the truly good in people, and gives you something to cheer for, as well as the evil in people to give you someone to loathe.While the book does handle many complicated, and sensitive issues, unplanned preg., homelessness, violence, it provides hope the entire way.The character in the book become real, and through it was hard to pick up to some the there speech, Moses after a few pages it all starts making sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few books I have read more than once.","review":"I found Where the Heart Is a heartwarming, fun, imaginative look into the lives of simple people who made me appreciate the simple things in life.

It really opened my eyes and made me realize how quickly my life could change, and taught me that everything happens for a reason. It does a wonderful job of explaining the hardships and adventures she encounters along the way.This book reads quickly and is a delightful tale that is much better than the movie.

I enjoyed the book at first, but the more I got into it, the more bored I got. I do admit, that I often read \\"action\\" or sci-fi books, so this is not my usual genre. I would suggest the book to people who really enjoy reading about something that turns out happy, even through bad luck. This is a good book for people who enjoy reading about every day lives and like calm books. I do not think this was a bad book, I just do not think this is the type of book for someone who is accustomed to reading books that involve complex plots with lots of twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart is","review":"Where the Heart Is was an outstanding book. I loved the book and the way the characters developed. Novalee was a character that had so much personality and so much initiative that she went so far in her life, throughout the book, that made you fall in love with her. The way she was motivated made me think about my life and how I needed to stay motivated and not give up. Only part I didn't like was how the story jumped back and forth from Novalee and Americuses story to Willy-Jacks because I was so into Novalees life that I got distracted by the details of his life. I loved the ending of the book because I finally realized all of her strength and her love for Forney. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart is here.","review":"Do you like heart warming, dramatic books well then you sure would like this book. This book has very unike names and wonderful characters. and how Novalee has wondrerful miricles and devistaving tragices.This book has a wonderful story written to it.

It made me physically ill and I didn't even finish it. I realize life isn't always pretty, and that bad things happen to people all the time, but please, this book should have come with a warning label! I'm sure it would serve well as a Cautionary-tale for Single Mothers Prone to Dating, but shame, shame on Oprah, Billie Letts, and the publisher for not warning the rest of us of the graphic, sickening nature of this allegedly \\"heartwarming\\" story. Quite disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Heart is.= A++","review":"I loved this book it is great for all ages. The story starts out with Novelee getting dumped by her boyfriend Willy Jack. When she finally births her daughter Americus she has made many new friend.

The first thing that struck me is that it is not very professionally written I deem it to be written in a pretty childish way and it only makes me feel anyone can get away with producing a successful book. The story line and the characters are both incredible.The book I guess has a positive message: Anyone can make this world a better place in their own little way, (but with a lot of incredible luck and help from others!).I have read a lot of books the past half year and though this is an easy read it is the \\"cheapest\\" story I've read yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I had read that it was on Oprah's list, so I bought it.

Made returning it much easier. All I can think is that the author is pulling my leg. She is trying to see how badly she can write and still get someone to read her book. Apparently she is in luck.

The are many worlds of creation and this is one yet. My favorite part is when Novalee and forney fall in love and Forney is attached to Americus with his heart and has much love for the little girl like she's his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart warming read","review":"While shopping around one night in book store, long before this novel was ever advertised by the movie version, it caught my eye. After reading the back summary, I did not expext much-you know the average teen age girl gets pregnant, struggles a little, and finally makes it to a stage in her life where she can be content-Wrong. This book was one that kept me turning the pages, as you read each chapter, Novalee, with her residence in Wal-Mart, Sister Husband, with her crazy, personality, Forney, with his stong and honest passion for Novalee, are sure to make you laugh, cry, and even at times think about the people who have touched your life. This story is beautifully written, while revealing some of the toughest situations in life that deal with a little bit of every department."},{"rating":"2","title":"could not put it down","review":"Okay, I bought the book because I've been wantin to see the movie and figured I'd compare.

Just a good, all around book, that almost anybody will like. And the movie wasn't to bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read...","review":"Billie Letts has created a very rich and entertaining novel with true to life characters we grow to truly care about. I read \\"Honk and Holler Opening Soon\\" right after completeing \\"Where The Heart Is\\" and found the same true for both books. Her characters are full of down home charm and character. I highly recommend both novels. I am eagerly anticipating her next submission."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was entertaining","review":"Though this book was a tad bit predictable, it made you feel good when you finished it. It is just a classic story about a girl with a not so good life that finds that there are careing people out there, and you can turn your life around. It isn't heavy reading or anything, its just a book that you sit down with and read in a couple of days, and enjoy. I recommend this book to anyone who just wants a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"Why would I want to read about a 17 year old girl that makes bad decisions and the rest of her disfunctional friends?

I admired Novalee's strength and her will to survive. She also proved to be a wonderful, caring mother even though her mother was less than kind to her. I rooted for her throughout the book and I was happy for her when she finally found the happiness she deserved. I look forward to reading another one of Billie Letts' books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book - I didn't want it to end!","review":"The fact that I liked this book so much really surprised me. I was not expecting to like Novalee, a 17 year old pregnant and uneducated teenager, but I did.

Everything is skimmed over, very little detail and is very biased. It's like a government pamphlet on all issues related to women's health presented in a very dated fashion.

My doctor said that is not unusual and told me to count only the lowest of three readings each session. Then the measurements were mostly consistent showing an average of 158/90, which is high. Now that I have been on high blood pressure medication for a couple months, it has dropped to an average of 135/80.So I'm convinced the device is accurate.

This instrument simplifies the process greatly, without complicating itself with automatic pumps or other diagnostic equipment the layman is unlikely to need. It collects data on blood pressure and heart rate, and can even track up to ten readings in memory.People who don't have a lot of hand strength or patience with manual cuffs will probably prefer a motorized version with its own air pump, but for my money and the use I put it to, this is absolutely the best buy for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

The simultaneous readings agreed closely during several trials. The batteries (four AAA) should last a long time since they do not have to pump up the cuff.A minor nuisance: sometimes it indicates a read error for no apparent reason, especially the first readings in the morning.

I wanted something that I would put the Nikon digital SLR on and not have to worry that a gust of wind would tip it over. The legs are a little stiff when you go to setup or take down.

However I need this tripod for panoramic shots using a panoramic head attached to the removable plate. The fatal flaw is that the head does not fully lock, so that when the camera is attached to the pano head the vertical tilt does not stay locked, and can topple the entire head. My much less expensive and \\"fancy\\" old tripod has a ratcheded vertical tilt so that when it is fully locked down it can not move even if forced. I actually called the company to see if this is a design flaw and they assured me that the replacement would fully lock. Alas, it doesn't.

They could have just done what every other band out there did and go Grunge but instead they brought in several influences. They do have some 90's downer rock in \\"Deliver Me\\" but they also have R&B in \\"Breathe a Sigh\\". They have the funky rock of \\"Slang\\" and the more subtle \\"Where Does Love Go When It Dies\\". The pinnacle of the album however is \\"Work It Out\\" which oddly enough was Vivian Campbell's first songwriting credit. Overall this was a great breath of fresh air for the band and fans alike and it still stands up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Leppard-Slang","review":"This is one great cd by Def Leppard.

I remember that I didn't have too much interest in it at the time. Basically, it wasn't like their old stuff and I was looking forward to a more typical sounding Def Leppard album. Recently, however, I listened to Slang in its entirety and I seriously love it. I realized that at the time I bought it, I was too busy trying to compare it to Pyromania/Hysteria that I couldn't appreciate it. Now, I can't seem to take it out of my CD player. I absolutely love \\"Turn to Dust\\" and \\"Deliver Me.\\" The entire album flows together really well and every song is really good. Phil Collen really emerges as a songwriter on this CD. I recommend listening to this it with a more open mind before dismissing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this one last, if at all","review":"It is hard to handle when a hair metal band decides to grow up. If I wanted to listen to more mature artists I wouldn't buy a Def Leppard album in the first place.

Give this one a miss, you won't regret it. Work It Out is the only half decent track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only three songs worth a listen..............","review":"In my never so humble opinion, \\"Turn To Dust\\", \\"All I Want Is Everything\\" and \\"Deliver Me\\" are the only tunes on Slang worth having.

Tracks such as \\"Truth?\\" and \\"Gift of Flesh\\" feel angry and cynical, and \\"Deliver Me\\" and \\"Pearl of Euphoria\\" shed light on a darker, more sinister side to the band. Even their slower ballads, such as \\"All I Want Is Everything\\" and \\"Where Does Love Go When It Dies\\" seem anguished and sad. I found the electronic beats and the lyrics of the pop-ish single track, \\"Work It Out\\", very annoying; it's the track I almost always skip. I find myself coming back to the darker strains of \\"Truth?\\", \\"Blood Runs Cold\\" and \\"Pearl of Euphoria\\" again and again.I keep wondering whether many of the tracks, especially \\"Blood Runs Cold\\", were born of the death of lead guitarist Steve Clark..."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"I agree that dep leppard changed big time. I think this is one of their best albums ever. The only reason it didn't do well is because there isn't many people out there who listen to that type of music anymore.

I can care less what the critics say"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is good...","review":"\\"Slang\\" is probably the most different Def Leppard album to have been released since \\"Retro-Active.\\" The entire album pulsates with a new energy of dance oriented rhythms with the same edgy guitar work the band has become known for. In other words, this album changes the direction every other Leppard album took, towards a more mature, less heavy, and maybe a little more introspective musical path. Whether it is comparable to \\"Hysteria,\\" or \\"Pyromania\\" is debatable, but it certainly is worth the listen, and is worth keeping in your Def Leppard collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slang: A Sell-Out Album (Metallica Fans Take Note)","review":"Def Leppard created a style all their own in the '80s -- a style copied by many bands but Def Leppard did it best. They combined the heavy distorted guitar sound of '70s glam rock bands such as Mott the Hoople and T.Rex and fused that sound with elements of Led Zeppelin (pounding drums and bass) and Queen (catchy vocal melodies).But in 1996, after pop metal had fallen out of popularity, Def Leppard made Slang.Slang copies every succesful grunge and alternative band of the '90s. Slang does succeed here and there but it ain't Def Leppard at their best. People accuse Metallica of selling-out (a term that is over-used) but if Metallica had really sold-out, wouldn't they have gone grunge or alternative? Metallica did not sell-out. Def Leppard attempted to sell-out on Slang. Slang is a true sell-out album, not Metallica's recent stuff.But it ain't all bad -- there is a good song or two to be found on Slang. It just isn't Def Leppard at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY BEFORE YOU TRY !!","review":"This album rocks !! This is so great and altogether different from the other Leppard discs, but I really love it. It hasn't got the typical Leppard sound to it, which gives the other cd's a bit of 'again?' (just!!!) sound and that makes this cd so special. I read an interview with the singer and he stated that they wouldn't make a record like Slang anymore and I found that very disappointing. Probably they won't do it again because it was (financially) not such a big succes as for instance Hysteria or Pyromania.

Coming from the other direction, if you are a classical fan, and you prefer pretty powerful classical, this is definitely for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"The only good thing I can say about this CD is that it is certainly an interesting twist on Metallica, but why buy it when the real original songs are so much better. If you are going to buy anything like this, buy the S&M DVD and use the special symphony only feature. That way you can hear Metallica with a full symphony.

Probably some of the worst cello tone I've ever heard. And believe me, being a string bassist...I've heard plenty. I could only force myself to listen to half of a track before I had to just turn it off. This is a disgrace to Metallica, and that's really saying something, considering how bad they are.

I don't even like Metallica that much. Yes there is something special about Metallica though. They have this dark, almost medival sound that you must listen carefuly for. Nobody else has that. This band Apocalyptica captures it completely!!! Better than even Metallica can!! Its like a band has taken another bands music, and perfectly, beautifuly spelled out for you what you love about it!!! I was skeptical at first. Sounds so corny. 4 Cellos play white trashy metal. But.....its amazing. Keep an open mind. It is note for note. Listen to it for the darkness. Very ancient sounding, almost religious. Once in a while you discover something really special. It doesnt happen often because there are no resources like Mtv for great music. Only crap. This is special."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little silly, but fantastic","review":"I just can't help but crack a smile when a cello breaks into the main vocal parts, like in Sandman, but the rhythym and solos are very impressive. Parts of Metallica songs, like the slow part in Master of Puppets seem as though they were made for the cello, and it is beautiful. If you can just get around the funny part that where James is supposed to be singing, there's a cello. They did miss the big solo on Master of Puppets, but I imagine it would be next to impossible to do that much on an instrument with no frets. My next purchase is going to be the Inquisition Symphony, which is supposed to be better than 4 Cellos since their success with the first one has lent itself to a greater degree of freedom to exercise their expertise in cello and make the piece almost seem as their own. Plus, their original efforts, according to other reviews, are almost better than the Metallica songs themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique look at Metallica's classics","review":"It is a new look at some of Metallica's old favorites.

The cellos don't blend or mix well together, and there is a distinct lack of bass-range sound, while the higher notes simply sound whiny. Much of this even sounds totally out of tune. Apocalyptica's music after this album was great, but the only thing good about this particular album is the (previous) quality of the material they butcher.

UGH"},{"rating":"1","title":"read the spoilers and move on","review":"read the spoilers and move on, there wasnt one second in this movie that had me in suspense. i wanted to love this movie. why cant we just have a good old fashioned horror movie without a twist? once you know the surprise ending its not worth watching twice. this was just boring. i turned all the lights off in my house hoping i'd be scared to go to bed but there's nothing to be scared of here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a remake.","review":"Before this movie even came out, I saw the original here at Amazon.com. It was filmed in Europe, I believe. The original has a bit more of suspense and bite to it. I think the original maybe cheaper to rent at Amazon.com also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scary movie with a twist.","review":"A young woman who is moving out of an old home with her father begins seeing and hearing unexplained things. She is extremely frightened as she runs from whatever or whoever may be lurking. Featuring the highly talented Elizabeth Olsen, this movie is quite scary up until the final minutes when the story takes an unexpected turn. This is when the film loses something, but it does distinguish it as more than just a standard horror film. I found the movie very frightening and unpredictable. Liz Olsen is such a talent, she is able to project true fright throughout, and the film is able to maintain this until the surprising conclusion. Overall, this is a solid effort in the horror genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her performance is well worth your time!","review":"Okay so the fellow playing her dad is dull. Her performance is amazing. Especially when you consider she IS the movie! This movie is brilliant! Hitchcock would approve. It's a thinker not a gore fest. I LOVED IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Shot Awesomeness","review":"I see a lot of reviews on this but I haven't seen anyone point out that this movie is film to look as though it was filmed in one shot, which is freaking amazing. The camera stays on Olsen the entire time and stays in focus. Also the DP or Camera Op was literally sprinting after Olsen. The post production VFX is amazing if you think about it. They stitched together all the shots to look like 88 consecutive minutes.Now if you think about the fact that the spanish version IS actually one shot, the American version becomes less impressive. But I think this movie is amazing none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"Ugh. Pretentious film trying to be deep/arty, but is ultimately a silly, hokey mess. One could argue that it starts out okay - the behavior of the two male characters is an instant clue that something is amiss, but once they disappear, things do get creepy for a while. But once the film reveals its true nature, it becomes a bad joke. It's not nearly as clever as it thinks, and the final act is downright groan-inducing. Once again, Elizabeth Olsen's performance has people talking, but she has yet to make a movie that I actually think is worth seeing. This one was definitely not a good use of her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Haunting meets High Tension","review":"This movie is not original at all. The \\"twist\\" has been done, and much more successfully than in this film. If you have seen the movies mentioned in the title of this review, you know who the culprit is and what the motive is. At least I'm lucky that I only wasted $3.99 to rent it rather than purchasing the digital download. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking and screaming","review":"Wow, I've seen some stinkers in the horror genre but this one is near the top. It should have been titled; \\"Walking around in a house and screaming\\". Not only is this movie tedious in the pointless wandering of the main character, but she screams constantly and sounds alot like she's laughing while doing so. I found myself waiting impatiently for something, ANYTHING, to happen throughout the movie. Usually the end of horror movies (unfortunately not the entire length of a feature) have a payoff with a scary or surprise ending. Not this one. The end is unoriginal and laughable, not making the near hour and a half of sitting through a pointless plot worth your time. Finding good low-budget horror movies is hard enough, don't waste your time with this one. Take one look at the cover and you've pretty much seen the entire movie and it's \\"point\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Get Into This Movie","review":"This movie starts out so slow, with such cheesy acting, I did not even finish the entire movie, although I had already paid for it.

I fast forwarded the gore and terror, and got done with it in 30 minutes. Next. Why do I keep expecting Hollywood to entertain me. Comedy and horror are a recipe for boredom. All it had was Elizabeth Olsen's nice chest for the first 15 minutes.

Stupid dialogue and one continuous shot that drives you crazy. it's like watching a movie without blinking.

He was right about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrific thriller","review":"I've seen some low budget horror films that were far superior to this movie and provided nice \\"twists\\" at the end. I'd definitely recommend The Pact, or The Innkeepers over this film. I grew so tired of this girl screaming throughout the entire film. It had the feeling of \\"been there done that again and again and again\\". It wasn't scary, it was predictable and the characters just acted stupid. I wouldn't recommend this movie even if you are bored. There are so many other films that deserve your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to turn it off!","review":"Not because it was so scary, but because there was no point. The bouncing camera, poor setup of the storyline. Super cliche' no cell reception, no light, strange sounds. And it's short - 1.5hrs if that. Don't spend your money on this folks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for something to happen then it was over.","review":"I purchased this movie on pay per view for 7 dollars.The previews looked great but the movie was just stupid.Loud thumps someone standing in the hall one second and gone the next,very cliche.The ending was not very suprising and really didnt explain the rest of the movie.The acting wasnt all that bad but not enough to make this movie good.If you want to see all the best parts just watch the preview for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Psycho Flick","review":"I have long been a fan of horror movies, but my preferences have changed with the passage of time. To state my biases clearly, I enjoy a good ghost story or a \\"creature feature\\", but I dislike horror movies about psychotic maniacs: you don't need any movies to experience these, just tune into the news. It is, of course, a personal preference but I particularly dislike movies that play games with what is reality in the context of the story. I always feel as if I've been tricked. I have no complaints about the acting or cinematography in \\"Silent House\\" , and the actors and staff deserve credit for a performance well done. I just wanted to see a good ghost story not movie about a mentally ill person. Obviously, many people have different preferences and tastes, which I certainly respect, and really enjoy this subtype. I intend no insults, but I do think potential viewers should understand precisely what the movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"I'm sorry but personally this movie sucked so bad and it was so drawn out and it wasn't at all worth watching.

I rate it a 1 out of 5 for at least trying to direct it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I felt this movie was terribly disappointing. My issues are:1. She seemed to get freaked out/scared WAY to easily. I was wondering why she would react so terrified to such simple stuff. She knew her dad and uncle were there, so hearing sounds isn't really abnormal.2. They advertised this as in real-time style, but by the end of the movie, you realize that was entirely pointless (SPOILER: there is a twist that makes the real-time aspect completely bogus since what we've been watching isn't what was going on. So what we saw wasn't even the correct unfolding of events).I feel the movie was very cliche with an ending that's been beaten to death. Some may find this scary, but I was just scratching my head wondering why she was so freaked out so quickly. And wondering when I would finally get a good scare. Never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"silent house 2012","review":"5 words can describe this movieBORING, INSULTED INTELLIGENCE, CHEAP, BORINGreal yawner, plus the fact is was so cheaply made. most of the picture was out of focus, photographer-director-writer should watch some old speghetti westerns and take notes.the best part of the move was\\"the end\\"Silent House"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"This movie was nothing that we haven't already seen with Hide and Seek or Secret Window.

I was so excited about this movie when I saw the trailers. The idea that the piece was going to be happening \\"in real time\\" seemed like a really cool and unique way to shoot a horror film. And....for about the first 2/3 of the film it was. But that is where it all fell apart. The ending of the movie was so out of left field and so incongruent to the rest of the film I literally had to rewind it to make sure I didn't miss something. Sadly, I didn't.It's too bad because the acting and premise were very good. The ending was just a sad letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Thought the movie would be suspenseful and interesting, instead it turned out to be one of those cliche' psycho films.

I had even read a bunch of reviews that made it sound \\"promising\\". I was wrong and so were the good reviews. This movie had very little going for it. The story line was weak, the characters were mediocre at best and the so-called \\"twist\\" ending was a complete letdown. I won't ruin the ending for those who choose to suffer through this lame adventure in a dark house, however, I will advise you to save your money. This one was so much of a sleeper, that it made me doze.If you want a good flick with one of the best twist endings ever, buy or rent \\"Fallen\\" (with Denzel Washington and John Goodman). Now that was a worthwhile movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One (if not the best) of the best horror movies of 2012","review":"When i went to go see this at the movie theater i walked in not really expecting much . boy was i wrong! this movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies i have seen in a while. im suprised this got a wide release since it really feels like a film that would be in one of those independent film festivals. the ending was really trippy and i enjoyed it alot. buy this movie if you are a hardcore horror fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you forget me?","review":"First off, this movie probably will not be what you're expecting. That being said, I really liked this movie, take it for what it is. It's a simple premise, and while some say that the twist was predictable, I felt like it was done very well & honestly, more disturbing that I had expected. Call me naive, but this movie terrified me right up until the truth was revealed. Yes, I had suspected the twist for some time, but that does not change the fact that this movie really shook me up. The action begins pretty early into the movie, and doesn't let up. I know a lot of people have said they felt it was crap, too predictable, and terribly done but I felt that it was none of these things. Olsen did a fabulous job at portraying terror, and that made this all the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned...","review":"This movie is clunky and the supporting cast is terrible, BUT watching Elizabeth Olsen in a single take for an hour and a half might still be worth your money. Go, Elizabeth! Rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS HOUSE IS FAR FROM SILENT","review":"During its theatrical run, SILENT HOUSE was touted as 85 straight minutes of terror, suggesting the movie was shot in real time without edits. Research on IMDB clarifies that the movie was filmed in scene order but only in 10-minute segments and was edited. I mention this only because a real time filming would have strengthened the movie's originality.Alas, I don't think anything could have salvaged this disappointing movie.In a dimly lit house, we get Elizabeth Olsen running hysterically through the house from someone who has ostensibly attacked her daddy. Later her uncle returns to assist Olsen in finding her now missing dad. The movie's obvious \\"twist\\" is inevitable and elicits chuckles more than surprise.Writer/director Laura Lau has no sense of characterization and settles for uncontrolled performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak movie ,","review":"Lots of screaming and BS , very weak movie . wasted money .

If you've read \\"Sanctuary\\", then this book might be worth reading....once. Don't expect the usual Faulkner greatness, however - it's readable and that's all. There are about, oh, say, 20 or so Faulkner works I would recommend before this one. \\"Sanctuary\\" really didn't need a sequel, IMHO.If you haven't read \\"Sanctuary\\", don't even bother. I can almost guarantee you'll dislike it and/or be confused by it. Not highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful","review":"Avoid this Faulkner work. It will not enhance your appreciation for his writing; rather, you are likely to regret ever having guiltily enjoyed Sanctuary. Other than his two Snopes novels, none of Faulkner's work after World War II is worth reading, and I include Intruder in the Dust in that assessment. Instead, go back to the works that demonstrated a gift for story-telling and language, rather than sales. Sanctuary is unique in that the lurid story of course was sellable yet Faulkner was able to infuse it with his own unique vision and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"No notation","review":"Hate to leave one of these kind of ignorant reviews...but I don't speak spanish, so I gave it 5 stars in case it's a great translation.What I DID want this book for, the notation of the Cantigas themselves, is not included.

And there's a wealth of books dealing with scripting for the web. But if you're planning a database-backed web server, where contents is driven from what's stored in a database, this book is a must-read.The writing style can be best classified as \\"colloquial, without being unnecessarily stupid\\" which means that it's easy to read, but doesn't leave out the necessary technical details.Though the book is slanted towards Unix and Oracle, there's good advice regardless of the ultimate platform the reader chooses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically Superb and a Page-Turner to Boot!","review":"This is a very informative book that is also a joy to read. The author is the prime developer of numerous high-traffic and technically complex websites, so he speaks from deep experience. He has a gift for presenting the subject matter with a fresh attitude that will keep you chuckling while you are learning. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh and insightful webdevelopment book. Lots of fun!","review":"This is an excellent book. In a straight forward manner, it offers a personal project to improve the quality of Internet services and the development of virtual comunities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web savvy, uncommon sense... and funny too.","review":"One of the few technical books that has made me, at times, laugh out loud. For all the right reasons. The book covers essential understanding for building useful web sites. The author gives working examples from his own code base, which may be unusual to some (AOLServer/Tcl in particular), but the principles are independent of the code: they are universal, and the software is available with a little effort but no money. Dr. Greenspun writes with purpose, drama, a biting wit, high intelligence and above all a desire to communicate what he knows for the benefit of others. Available online, but beautiful in print. The one web book I recommend buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be Appreciated on Many Levels","review":"An extraordinary vision of web publishing, a wonderful coffee table book of photography, and, since it's printed on quality heavyweight stock, a darn good paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important book on the subject","review":"I have read a lot of material on design and content of web-pages. One of my biggest gripes with much of the publishing industry is that they consistently take pretty good magazine articles and fill them with redundant examples or boring autobiography and convert them into \\"books\\". But a book is not measured by length. It is measured by value--The Great Gatsby is more of a book than most other novels, regardless of length (e.g. I Know This Much Is True). Philip (not Phil!) has filled this book with content. There is something provocative and interesting in every chapter. I have wasted a lot of money on these fluff books in the past, as well as on books that told me self-evident things in a convoluted way to make it appear exotic or profound. This book avoids all pretense. It is concise, funny, specific, explicit and direct. Worth the price to buy even when it's free on the web. The only web-design book I will read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully opinionated, original, and effective. 5 stars.","review":"Philip is refreshingly opinionated. Within the first few pages, you get the sense that he is giving you the straight dope on a topic he is well-qualified to teach. His style is entertaining, original, and effective. Great book. Highly recommended.The rich color photographs are a nice suprise for a technical book. My 2-year old daughter currently considers it to be one of her favorite picture books. She asks \\"what's that?\\" and \\"what is she doing\\" at picture after picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Joking","review":"Hey, I really think this book is worth 500 stars, but who'd bother to pick this review out from the rest if it was headed with 5 (boring) stars just like all the rest. I have nothing to add to all the nice things that have already been said, so here is some fawning hero-worship instead: This is a great book, a Magnificent book, A STUPENDOUS book. Buy it, read it ... lots of times ... meditate on it, and be grateful that there are people like Philip Greenspun in the world to light the way for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applications Developers Turning Web Application Developers","review":"Beth Keller, my business partner at Integrated Technologies and Systems Group, found Philip Greenspun's book at Barnes&Nobel one weekend in a fit of frustration as we searched for a set of tools (a.k.a.

I bought \\"Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing\\" from Amazon so I could not browse its content before purchase. Well, its practically exactly the same (excellent) book with a new title. Not much updating has occurred. The Oracle information is somewhat out of date and was out of date well before the new publication date. A dishonest re-packaging by an author who revels in dishing out the dirt well deserved by many software vendors. Still a good read but I cannot give BOTH versions of the same book 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but woefully outdated","review":"Let's face it folks, this book was already outdated when it came out in 1999 and today it's even worse. The book *does* provide a good high-level discussion of how this stuff works (like you'd expect from an MIT prof), highly recommended for the utter novice. For everyone else, I'd pass until we see an updated version with less Microsoft bashing and even less demagoguery. But if you want a good history lesson, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful even for the experienced nerd, and enjoyable for all","review":"Though I'm already an experienced web-head, developing many of the kinds of web-enabled services Greenspun discusses, I found lots in this book I didn't know, and found it a tremendously enjoyable read as well. I suspect that even the material that I already knew well will come in handy someday when I'm called upon to explain something to someone and don't have a ready-made explanation of my own. Congratulations to the author on a very fine piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a web book for engineers written by an engineer!","review":"I admit, I was forced to read this book for a course at MIT, but this is the best $30,000 I ever spent! The most valuable lesson you take away from this book is that the web is a tool NOT a \\"solution.\\" Phil shows you how to use that tool successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoid Headaches - and Profit from the Web","review":"If you're planning to build a web site to make money, whether for an existing business or a new one, Buy this book!!!! It will become your bible. Greenspun's writing is funny, entertaining and above all incredibly useful. As an advertising sales rep for an internet company I've seen companies launch painfully slow, hard to navigate, counter-intuitive sites after months of big promises. It's a shame they didn't read this book first. Now I've got an idea for a database driven web service and found Greenspun's book online during my research. As a non-techie I can now talk the talk with developers and make sure I get the best site possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Researcher Rave Review","review":"This is a copy of the actual email I sent to Philip.I was researching books for my husband to study, since he wants to get into Web Publishing & I adored the book cover on sight.

I had some ideas, but wasn't sure about the right way as I don't have that much experience with firewall setup. The same night, while browsing Philip and Alex's Guide casually, I found a good run-down of different options. You may call this serendipity. Yes, it certainly was--which brings me to why you should get your own copy.Philip and Alex cover the entire spectrum of web publishing in both breadth and depth. And they try not to bore you with technobable. So, if you do anything with the Web, you will increase your \\"luck\\" in finding sound advice and seasoned opinion by keeping the Guide handy.Don't worry. This book won't embarass you in front of your \\"normal\\" friends. With its beautiful design and sideline photos, Philip and Alex's Guide can easily cloak on your coffee table next to that design book you bought in NYC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, some bad","review":"The one point Phil brings up that I heartily aggree with is that Computer Science is a religion. While he does bring up some good points and gives good advice when designing a DB-backed website, he spends much of the book proselyting his own brand of religion (AOLServer + TCL + Oracle) and one comes away with the impression that his book is a thinly-velied advertisement for his company, ArsDigita. This would be fine if the title of the book was something like \\"Using the ACS to build websites\\" or \\"Using AOLServer with TCL.\\" The actual title of the book suggests something that should address web design in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"Philip Greenspun is the creator of photo.net and a very entertaining author as well. This a great book for beginners to get an overview of web publishing, online communities, and databases. Some of the specifics of the book are a little dated but the concepts are not. I often refer back to this book for ideas and inspiration. The online version of this book is free, but the print edition has great glossy pages and is packed with gratuitous, full-color pictures from Philip's image library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but sadly dated","review":"Greenspun writes well. He gives a good, clear explanation of web development and e-commerce. And the jokes are often funny.But - the world about which he writes no longer exists, and possibly never existed. This book is about as dated and as irrelevant now as those \\"how to survive the Y2K catastrophe\\" things that were all over the bookstores before December 31, 1999 and in the trash on January 1, 2000.I suppose, like other dotcom executives, he's writing his \\"what went wrong\\" memoirs now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, Alex Doesn't Have Much Advice","review":"If you bought Philip's last book, you, like I, were probably amazed at how much advice Philip gives. You thought, hey, how can his editor let him get away with all of this product-specific advice and all of these stories of projects gone bad? And you stayed up late at night reading the book, because the stories were just too good.You're in for a treat, because this book is just like the last one, only there are pictures. The same biting humor, the same battle-weary author, and this time the book has as many high-quality photographs as Philip's web site, not to mention new content. And the photos are as good as (if not better than) the high quality writing that Philip is famous for.Buy this book. Save yourself man-years of work, promote the use of photos instead of code listings to pad computer books, and stay tuned for the next one, SQL for Web Nerds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for techies","review":"I'd highly recommend this book for non-technical people who have to direct a web development project. I found it packed with useful insights. I'll feel more comfortable about voicing my opinions they next time a web developer tells me I need lots of graphics, lots of animation, and frames, frames, frames. I will tell him that visitors come to our site because they have questions, not because they are bored losers looking for entertainment - just one of the common-sense tidbits I picked up from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is a joy to read (and to look at as well, with all","review":"Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing, is, in a word, great! The book is a joy to read (and to look at as well, with all those great photos). Philip has a very direct and straightforward way of thinking and writing about the web and the functions of web pages, and he keeps it all fun to read with his wonderful sense of humor. This is not the book to turn to if you want to learn how to make the flashiest pages - you know, the ones that are so full of bright blinking graphics that you can't figure out what they are about even after waiting a couple of minutes for it to finish downloading. This IS the book to turn to if you actually have some content that you'd like to make available to as many people as possible. Philip can show you how to get it out there in a clear and appealing way, while wasting as little time (both yours and the viewers) as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that realy want to tell you the web publishing.","review":"I learned web publishing by reading Philip's guide to web publishing through his photo.net.

But I can confess that I was absolutely captivated by Curran's sharp but intimate description of K2 1986 fatal summer. His posture of total witness is the main fundation to this shacking book. Curran lived almost directly every event - and foremost disaster - that occured on the mountain at that time (Barrard death, the first climb of Magic line, Casarotto's last breath, Britain flop on the north-west ridge, Al Rouse and Kurt Diemberger stubborn persistence, the atrocious august storm on the shoulder which killed Tullis, Emitzer and co., etc.).

While Prof. Wickens has a distinguished history at Kew, his sense of economics of plants, understanding of plant utilization and the hard facts of introducing little used methods or plants is uninspiring. Specific points are the introduction of urban hydroponics in Cuba, the roll of coppicing and pollarding for fuel, the indisputable utility of commercial hemp for food, fiber and fuel, that all seem to have escaped his notice. The statement, \\"The amino acids are a large class of organic compounds containing both the carboxyl, COOH, and the amino, NH2 group\\" while technically correct is naive. The utility of the book is enhanced by donnish word origins but otherwise has little to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter nonsense.","review":"Perhaps the most outlandish and misguided book ever published on the subject. Despite an appealing premise, the writer fails to deliver anything resembling a guide for a successful marriage. In its place, we get ultra-conservative hogwash that will surely doom any couple to an unhappy marriage. Indeed, no self-respecting woman will tolerate a husband who accepts Andelin's advice. Written by a dentist, the book recommends a course of action that will prove more painful than a visit to his dental office. This book would make a hilarious read if it were not meant to influence naive young men.

Reed's handling of the ideas is well-done and her juggling of tenses and voices is unconventional and refreshing. The unflinchingly dark qualities of the book are also a plus. Disappointing, however, is to find a clasically Dastardly Villain behind the scenes; and moreover, a Dastardly Villain whose dastardliness can be traced back in one facile swoop to a Defining Moment of Disappointment in Childhood. This is like those hokey Spider Man bits from the old Electric Company: And then he turned to a life of crime! (After not getting a pony for his birthday, etc.) Reed also employed this trope in The Night Children, but that was specifically a book for young adults, so it worked to better effect. I expect something a bit more complex from an adult novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phat chance","review":"I enjoyed the sheer audacity of this dystopian escapade. Even as Reed's text is a little lighter on characterization than her beautiful \\"@Expecations,\\" this one makes up for it with the sheer fun she has exploring a future in which thinness has become gospel, and anyone who can't shape up (either obese or anorexic) is expunged. It's a roadtrip through an America caught between the strip-mall-fueled urge to consume and the advertising-fueled desire to look younger and prettier. The best character of all is the Rev. Earl, whose preaching the \\"afterfat\\" hides a bizarre and ultimately distructive secret. The open-ended finale is challenging as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worst-Dressed List of Our Collective Unconscious","review":"What is perhaps most disturbing about Reed's cautionary tale of the pursuit of phyisical perfect gone awry is not the horrific ends to which her characters go to appease the insatiable god that stares back at them from the mirror every morning, but rather, that no matter how outrageous the plot becomes, no matter how wild her characters' acts of good or evil may appear, we never have to work too hard to believe what's going on.By turns dramatic, hilarious, ghastly and gripping, a kind of suburban magical realism runs through Reed's pages like blood, infusing the story with both the intimate and the fantastic while she slices into our egos like a knife so sharp you don't know you've been cut till you hit the floor.One of those rare books that will surprise both an author's veteran fans and those just discovering her, Thinner Than Thou is a must-have with an epilogue written on the happy meal boxes and weight-loss pill bottles of an entire nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a really bad souffle.","review":"The premise of \\"Thinner Than Thou\\" is awesome and the sole reason I picked this book up. I tried reading Kit Reed's \\"Enclave\\" and found it...crappy, to put it nicely.Unfortunately, it appears Reed and I are just not going to get along.I hate her run-on, stream of consciousness writing style. It works for some writers, and it works in some situations. But when every single one of your characters is narrated in the exact same way, it gets redundant, ridiculous, and old. Fast.There's sporadic language, but the perversion meter is really off the charts. I'm not sure why I suffered through this travesty of a novel. It was only vaguely interesting. I get that it's supposed to be all allegorical for our current society blah blah blah, but seriously, it was awful. It was like baking a cake and accidentally using salt instead of sugar. Nasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby talk for those who miss storytime witn mommy","review":"This book is baby talk for those who miss storytime with mommy. There is more text devoted to fictitious scenarios that don't impart any understanding of accounting, than to simple and thorough explanations of accounting. The author introduced new terms without explanation, and skimmed over new concepts with scant explanation. That's frustrating after slogging through fictional Bob the plumber's feelings about his fictional red truck's motor.I'm an adult, and I'm busy. Get to the point. I bought \\"Financial Statements\\", by Ittelson -which is much better so far. Also, \\"Schaum's Easy Outline of Accounting\\" -which hasn't arrived yet.

The author manages to convey the innate wisdom of a three year old with convincing snippets of conversation that are tucked away in the heart of a mother about to lose her daughter.For those who have been in this situation, no matter what illness put you there, this book will unleash the tears that you thought were gone. It will allow you to feel again the presence and loss of someone you loved more than your own life.

The light moments grabbed me as much as the sad ones - Hannah freezing in place and staring when she saw Cinderella and another time grinning broadly while the wind whipped her \\"hair\\" that spring morning in the convertible. I also liked the fact that it didn't end after Hannah's death but that Maria stayed with us to detail the struggles she endured and the life changes she made as a woman. I definitely learned a lot about living with illness and grief.

But she does. She sings with her usual committment vocally and the audience love her. The staging is impressive and the chorus and orchestra under Edward Downes add to the production. The remainder of the cast perform excellently."},{"rating":"2","title":"great vocals","review":"Productions in Verona are designed to appeal to the thousands of viewers seated far from the stage. Performing in this ampitheatre is basically like performing in a stadium so that does affect the performance. Fortunately Verona attracts some of the great Italian artists who may not have become familiar (or overly so) to American opera fans. I was fortunate enough to hear Martinucci sing Cavaradossi in Naples in 1981. The voice was everything one could hope for as it is here in this performance of Aida. I have no problem with a tenor who settles for producing the best high notes of the 80s. He sings Celeste Aida with absolute ease. Cossotto delivers a classic big Italian performance that fills the stage and Chiara is a distinguished Aida."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheap-O","review":"I bought this Aida because of Cheryl Studer. She did not disappoint. Luciana d'Intino as Amneris lent credibility. The rest stunk. I expected more from the Royal Opera House. I cannot imagine worse staging: meaning-less background screens, and poles with silly emblems. Radames had black hair. After he was sentenced to death, his hair turned completely white. Edward Downes' pace was uncoordinated with either the chorus or the singers at spots. The worse part was the intended triumphant scene. It was Eurotrash, with top-less acrobats jumping around. Verdi would turn over in his grave. As a final insult, Kultur managed to mis-spell Cheryl Studers' name.The Aida to buy is the one by Kate Aldrich, Adina Aaron, and Scott Piper. It is beautifully done, guided by masterful mentors, Franco Zeffirelli and Carlo Bergonzi."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!","review":"Singing isn't all that great, but it was probably the best part of this production. The conducting was bad, the acting was bad, the staging was bad...I think you get the clue. I couldn't watch it all in one sitting. I had to stop after the first act and watch the rest later. Poor Verdi, he'd be rolling in his grave if he knew these terrible musicians had ruined his art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wooden production","review":"Very disappointing production.

I had some very basic understanding of related concepts. Even with that I found it difficult to follow this book.I think Charles Poynton knows about his subject well but the way back and forth references are used without explaining a concept completely makes you feel you have not understood something completely.

They seemed like X rated Keystone Kops at best. The picture on the cover of the DVD was beautiful and promising. But the DVD made me feel awful and had the oposite affect that I had hoped for. I did not think I would recover my libido ever. I couldn't get the horrid depictions of sex out of my mind. The bodies were not natural and beautiful, they were gross and ugly.

Sure, they're just ordinary people, with the lumps, cellulite, and excess hair that ordinary people have; as such, I found it a pleasant antidote to the ridiculous excesses of modern porn. It also gives some explanation for the French reputation as lovers: every straight coupling starts with getting the woman off.

Bruckner's \\"Te Deum\\" has never been more granitically powerful, and the soloists are downright rapturous (Frances Yeend, you go girl!).

I was ambivalent about chamber music at the time, but the beauty of the piece won me over. The stark simplicity of the second movement was unlike anything I had heard before. The climax of the final movement echoes Appalachian Spring in mood but the triumph in the sonata seems somehow harder won.The Hindemith and the Bloch (particularly the Bloch) are well worth hearing, too.The CD either reveals a bit of the original's sonic limitations or wasn't done perfectly.

This film has various twists that keep the audience on edge. Character development and story progression are compelling and believable. The majority of the film takes place in a flat of an unspecified city in Britain. Acting is superb! Who gets away with all of the money from \\"Daddy\\"? Well, you'll have to watch and find out....Bonus features include deleted scenes and the director's commentary. For this modern day, the Bonus features are sparse. I would have loved to see an alternate ending - Hence, I took away a star.Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Myopic, taut, Quirky","review":"Ah, the Brits! The thinking cinephile's 90 minute quiz but with quirky British plot twists. The rather punctilious methods are an alert to simpler failings, such as individual motivations and dominant human fears: loneliness, abandonment. With a cast of three, a disproportionate responsibility for carrying suspense falls on each actor's character, but in independent film fashion, it holds interest with a nice measure of suspense, albeit, somewhat predictably. While it won't enrich your life, it's entertaining and fashioned into a single, cohesive dramatic fabric. One caveat for Americans: depth rather than superficial violence and tawdry sex prevails. Begs plausibility at key points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I think it's a good movie. I had not heard of it before buying it and I was looking psychological thriller, which this seemed to be. I was not disappointed at all.

Very intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable plot, not much of any twist if you watch closely","review":"During my first view of the movie, I had a solid idea of what was going to transpire based on the body language and behavior of the kidnappers. The ending wasn't that much of a surprise, but it is both kind of anti-climatic and plays to the original title of the movie. It makes you wonder whether the title of the movie was related to the events that lead to the ending, or whether the ending starts the real story.That said, the cinematography was high caliber. The dialogue and scenery was very spartan, but serves the plot extremely well. Keep in mind that humanity has been entertained by dialogue, and a few scenes for thousands of years. CGI and green screens have only become popular in the last few decades.Overall, I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on England!,","review":"Almost, but not quite.Not sure about the twists and turns either, saw them coming at me like a truck.As a made for TV drama this would have been top-notch.

I happened to watch this movie right after watching a very dissapointingly bad film, so I was doubly appreciative of how good this movie was. I only find it unbelievable that 4 people gave this film only two stars! The acting was exceptionable (try to find a more scary kidnapper than Vic!), there was a well thought-out script, good directing; what else do you need in a thriller? The beauty part is that it remains a mystery as to what Danny's real agenda was had not everything happened as it did. We know what he does in the end, but we do not know what he would have done had everything gone according to plan. No Hollywood-style explanation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Nice twists and turns. Sure some are predictable, but dang there you are caught up in it and waiting for what's next and hoping for this or that to happen. Good drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Twists and Turns","review":"The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a simple movie, we only see three different characters thought the whole film and ninety percent of the film takes place in a nondescript room. But that is the mastery of the acting, directing and the writing that they can take such simplicity and still make a compelling hundred minute movie. The plot is also simple, two men kidnap a daughter of a millionaire and hold her for random in the before mention room.And then the twists start to happen. The first one can be spotted from a mile away, and I got a sense that it would happen from a moment Alice Creed first comes on screen. The second one: not so much in that I had to rewind to believe that I saw what I just saw. But by the end there are so many twists and turns you begin to expect them and start think maybe the writer went with one too many of them. But the movie is still compelling enough that it is still worth giving it a look to see how many twist you can see coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"And K9 makes three...","review":"The Doctor and Leela have entered the TARDIS' secondary console room when it is entered by a mysterious force, which effects the Doctor.

Plus the show's theme song wasn't included at all in any of the episodes, which is ridiculious.But all in all the show is an excellent show for anybody to enjoy cause guys don't mind seing 2 girls kissing. this show I considered it an open-minding show to the gap between our past generation, our generation & our future generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Pick-Me-Up, Great Stow-Away Gift","review":"When I think of matchbooks I think of small. Matchbox? I think of those little cars my son used to play with. Now I have a whole new take. This Matchbox is just as full of light and fun as either matchbooks or matchboxes but it IS also full of wisdom, just as the box says. And the packaging? Very amusing. I thought for sure when I touched the side where one would normally strike a match, I'd feel real sandpaper! This is a cute little under $10 gift.

Judy gave the best performance I have ever seen, Tony was not far behind.How wonderful to finally have the entire concert at last. You are reminded time and again how Tony picks the very best songs to sing. There are a lot of gems here, but my favorite 'new' song is the one from \\"I Can Get it for You Wholesale.\\" With Tony singing you wonder why the song did not become a hugh hit. Tony is still around, bless him, but I had forgotten how rich and glorious his voice was 42 years ago. I would classify this concert as one of 10 best live recordings of all time, pop or rock. It just does not get much better than 2 hours of pure Bennett at his peak. The live concert brings out the best in him.This is the one indispensable Tony Bennett CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally clear, live performance from 47 years ago. Great!","review":"This is such an impressive recording. Hard to believe it was done live almost 47 years ago. Bennett sounds terrific, not just on the big band numbers, but also on the small pieces where there may be just a piano or a few other instruments behind him, like \\"Sleepin' Bee.\\" His voice is so clear. One of the best live recordings I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially dangerous design flaw","review":"I bought this cooker at a big box store and have been using it for about 2 weeks. I cooked a large pot of rice for my dogs yesterday using the time delay feature. When I got home yesterday, he told me that the rice cooker had exploded! Apparently, the steam vent on the rice cooker had gotten clogged with rice gluten, and the cooker pressurized, causing the lid to pop open and rice to fly everywhere! If someone had been standing there when it happened, they could have been seriously burned! The steam vents on this unit are easily clogged.

This is my favorite. It has a great mix of uptempo and slower songs.Poor poor pitiful me may follow the Linda Ronstadt arrangement in general terms, but Terri's version is country, wheras Linda's version was pop/rock. All the other songs are original, co-written by Terri with various others.Neon flame is an amusing song in which Terri explains to her man that the man she sometimes sees at the bar isn't a threat. It's a piece of fun which (like the man at the bar) is not to be taken too seriously. ...Terri is more downbeat on Keeper of the flame, in which she senses her man is not that interested in her, but overall, this is a very upbeat album. I find it highly entertaining - and that, after all, is what music is supposed to be about."},{"rating":"2","title":"There isnt one bad song on this cd there all good","review":"I think Terri Clark is a great singer and a great person.

This album would be flawless if they had used the original single version of 'Summer Night City' because the extended part was added using \\"non-digital\\" efforts and has a noticeable drop out when the song picks up at the single version.Drop this CD in and press play.

Any ABBA fan should include this album in their collection because the 18 songs on it really capture their talent and they're just so much fun to sing! I love that the album comes with lyrics, also. In my opinion, out of all ABBA hits albums, this one is the best, especially for the price; you won't find a better value for your money. It has all the songs that made ABBA so popular and continues to keep their music alive today.

This book--or at least its theme--is sure to spawn an army of imitators, since it really IS torn from today's headlines. Fueled by the trauma of pedophilia, a serial killer targets wayward priests as a detective races to stop him. The conflict is cranked up a notch when the killer becomes possessed and loaded with destructive supernatual powers. There is a LOT of violence in Killing Faith, and it won't make you proud to be Catholic, so be warned. Still this is KG's best work yet--packed with horror, suspense and controversy. It'd make a HELL of a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful mirror.","review":"After looking around for a mirror to add some \\"umph\\" to my living room wall I discovered this one.

Based on the other reviews I decided to order it. The price certainly was great. It arrived quickly, and was wrapped very professionally. It took me some time to get it unwrapped, and of course, it is just as lovely as everyone else describes, and is very large and impressive. But when I inspected the mirror a little more closely, there was a chip along the inner edge of one of the small pieces that outline the central mirror. After inspecting it carefully, I don't think it was damaged in transit, it was shipped this way. I am going to keep it because I really do love it, and am hoping I can hang it in such a way that no one will notice the chipped section."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAIRE SUCCESSFUL AGAIN","review":"I found the book to be a very pleasant mixture of seriousness and humor. Claire is undeterred in her search for the solution to this mystery, yet endearingly down to earth. Many of the characters are weird in a humorous sort of way, while not intending to be.For those who know Portland, OR, Claire's searches there add the interest of 'following' her around as she goes to familiar areas.I found the plot both coherent and cohesive.

Give this one a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You've never heard this before","review":"Those eager to hear something really unusual might want to check out this CD, a homage to Albert Schweitzer that combines the music of Gabon, Africa, with that of Bach. Schweitzer worked in a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon, and, as you may know, was a Bach scholar and organist. While, the concept sounds almost as bad as Roy Orbison tunes performed in traditional Celtic style (there really is such a CD), surprisingly it's wonderful music. The disc's best pieces combine excerpts from Bach's St. John Passion with Gabonese percussion and chants. It's truly amazing how well such disparate music blends. The track \\"Sankanda\\" which features incredible vocals by a Gabonese woman combined with a chorus singing a slowed down and rhythmic version of \\"Lasset uns nicht zerteilen\\" is simply stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good fit","review":"I'm not sure what Bach ever did to deserve this treatment. What we get is an overlay of Bach with African music, much as one might hear going down a street with radios playing on both sides. A cello gigue in triple meter against drumming in some unrelated duple time, for example. I don't know what one reviewer found sinister about cut #6, but this is the first time I've heard \\"sinister\\" applied to \\"Herr, unser Herrscher.\\"If you want Bach, buy Bach.

To me this approach is completely misguided.On track three -- which shows what the album might have been -- it's evident that the two percussionists, Nana Vasconcelos & Sami Ateba, are actually hearing the opening to Bach's St John Passion, and are responding to it. Purists will certainly still hate it, but with an open mind, it's actually fairly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry to disagree","review":"I'm sorry to disagree with all the positive reviews, but even though I usually like wild juxtapositions like this, I don't find this pairing at all successful. The whole CD reeks of the editing room, with the music of Bach being performed throughout in a stiff, stilted manner in order to synchronize with the African rhythms. All I could think about was the singers with headphones on in a recording studio trying to cram Bach's fluid phrases into the rhythmic straitjacket of the drum tracks. The 3-part invention is played on (or rather programmed into) an electronic keyboard with an ugly fake organ sound - why not have a real organist play it on a real organ? And the clapping overlaid on Bach's sublime \\"Ruht wohl\\" is just lame! I can't speak to the authenticity of the African element of this CD, but as a classical musician I can tell you that the classical element is severely compromised - even rendered lifeless - by the pairing."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, poor execution","review":"Bagdikian manages to take an important subject -- deserving of sober and careful analysis -- and buries it in a shrill, overwrought and largely useless diatribe. His general thesis, that the mass media are undergoing consolidation antithetical to consumer interests, is beyond serious debate.

I was very surprised to find the product was much better than I thought it would be. The mouse tracks well on pretty much every surface I've used it on though I do occassionally have to blow dust out of the open optic well to keep it from sporatically jumping around the screen. This drawback is inherent to pretty much any other optic mouse that I've used with an open space under the tracking window, however, so it's to be expected.The shape is slightly odd (the sides of the mouse angle outward and lie flush with the mousepad) though honestly, it's not a big enough problem that I'd drop the rating. Once you get used to the feel, you really don't notice it. For the price, this product has exceeded my expectations quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the music melt your troubles away...","review":"I absolutely adore this cd.

By the time this film entered production, the TV special that would represent his return from the ashes of low-budget Hollywood pap, was already in the can, and he had only one more movie to go (\\"Change of Habit\\") before bidding adieu to the film capital that saw him as nothing more than bait to reel in an often undiscriminating teenaged audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS THING!","review":"This is certainly the WORST movie that Elvis had anything to do with, unless you count the final televised which can be just as disturbing and difficult to watch at this \\"ATOMIC\\" bomb.

I would recommend you buy this to add to your collection of 4400 DVD's if the price is good because the first half isn't so bad but you will notice your interest rapidly declines by the final disc possibly mostly due to character inconsistencies.I'll be generous and give it a 5/10, although I am saddened to do so as it was once my favourite show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"This book doesn't cover half the topics that are asked in the exam.

There is no action to this tale, but the way that Philip Gourevitch manages to get inside the minds of the two prime players, Koeller and Rosenzweig, is incredible. This character study will provide insight to the inner turmoil of a veteran cop and the convoluted logic of a lifetime felon and murderer. As Rosenzweig asks \\"Who speaks for the dead\\"?

For example, you must send them a copy of your orginal, clearly dated receipt before they will even respond to warranty inquiries. Then, after they verify the receipt, you go through an elaborate registration and approval process before you can return the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"The Oregon Weather Forecaster worked exactly as described.

GENERALLY HAD PROBLEMS WITH THESE TYPES OF ITEMS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has its problems, but still a good device","review":"I have had this unit for a few weeks now and have had a pretty decent experience. The temp and humidity seem accurate enough for my own personal use and the weather prediction is accurate more than 75% of the time.I did run into the same problem as one of the other users where it wouldn't take the information from the remote unit without it being right next to the base. I proceeded to change the remote and base unit to channel 2 and reset both devices (as I didn't feel like trying to figure out which one needed resetting) and it work immediately.For the price, this is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise, but not very accurate","review":"This is a good price, so I gave it 4 stars for value. They say it is a precision instrument (OK, it measures temperature to 0.1 degree F). However, it is not very accurate (I put the remote and main units next to each other and over a two day period the temperature difference between them varied from 0.5 to 1.5 degrees F). I called the company and they say they only guarantee it to +/-2 deg. At least LaCrosse is up-front and tells you in the description of their similar product that it is accurate to +/- 1.5 deg."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"The base unit would only find the remote when the two were right next to each other. Poor poor poor customer service/tech support. I recommend the Springfield Precise Temp. It works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Predictor of Weather","review":"I bought this unit due to it's ability to tell me the weather changes. It is poor in this ability. If you have a sprinkler running within 100 feet of this unit, it will tell you it is going to rain...even in the middle of July in California when a heat wave is occurring. I would not recommend this product, especially if you are thinking it is going to tell you the predicted weather due to barometric pressure.If you want to know the temperature, time, date, this will do it, but you can purchase a much less expensive product to do that. The clincher with this weather unit, was to predict, or interpret the barometric pressure, not tell me I had my sprinklers on. Oh, and if it is foggy, it will tell you it is raining. Look elsewhere, don't waste you money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent Signal Receipt","review":"My unit often fails to receive any signal at all from remote units (even when they are a few inches away, and with fresh batteries in everything) or from the atomic clock. Occasionally it works as advertised. Buyer beware...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work - Poor Support","review":"I purchased the unit, new. From the start the outside temperature did not work, the display indicated that the temperature was out of range. Since the unit was indoors, it's hard to believe that 69 degress is out of range. Dealing with their support has been painfull. They will not support the product when you make the call. They put in a case, and say \\"Someone will get back to you\\" Well, I've put in three cases now, and no one has gotten back to me.Dealing with Oregon Scientific has been a miserable experience. This unit is a POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have had one of these for several years and I am very disappointed. Although it seems to have good features they just don't work that well. The controls are confusing and you cannot do anything without the manual in your hand. I live in the middle of New York City and, despite trying from several locations (miles apart) have never been able to get a signal for the atomic clock, so we have to set the time manually every spring and fall, which requires the manual because you could never figure out how to do it otherwise. To put batteries in the remote sensor you need a tiny philips screwdriver and the screws get stripped easily. And the thing is very innacurate. Right now I have the main unit and the remote unit sitting next to each other in front of me, under identical conditions. Yet they show different temperatures by several degrees, and an almost 10% variance in the supposed humidity. Overall look and feel of the main unit is flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect alarm clock","review":"Forget the weather features, this is a great alarm clock. Completely battery powered so no power outage issue. The atomic clock feature keeps perfect time. The snooze/indiglo button on top is very convenient. The alarm on/off button in the front is convenient, but not so much that you turn it off instead of snoozing it. Very smart alarm tones, changes throughout the course of a few minutes before giving up and then tries again after an auto snooze period. This makes sure you get up, but doesn't disturb the neighboring rooms for a whole day/week/month that you might be away and forgot to turn off the alarm. Very portable... I like knowing the temperature outside when I get up. The only thing that could be improved is the visibility in the dark. The indiglo works great, but only for a few seconds. This is good for battery life and if you like to sleep in darkness, but bad for seeing the time in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Month/day wrong starting Jan 1, 2008","review":"A decent product but beginning Jan 1, 2008 the month/day began being reported as 00/30.

All 7 were within plus or minus one degree, but the BAR608HGA base unit was off by over 3. I emailed Oregon Scientific about recalibrating the unit, but was emailed back that there was no way to recalibrate and that the inaccuracy are acceptable to them. I just left it at that, even though they advertise accuracy within 2 degrees. In conclusion, I use it, but when I look at the base unit I just have to mentally add three degrees to the inside temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Of A Deal","review":"This really isn't much of a savings versus just getting it at the grocery store or Sam's Club.

The writing and imagery took me back to in time to when I was a little girl, sitting in my grandmother's kitchen in Makakilo, listen to her and my aunties \\"talk story\\" as they cooked, laughed and remembered. I loved that book, but I have to say I loved \\"Song of the Exile\\" even more.Kiana has managed to do what I have never seen before and what I wish that I could do: present the Hawaiian experience to a mainstream audience not as the \\"aloha-sterotype\\" that many people have, but life as it really is, with all of its struggles and its everyday conversations and rhythms. I only wish that her work would receive the recognition that it deserves.

It was incredibly tragic and haunting. It made me feel for those women like Sunny, the ones who became nobody, because their minds couldn't get out of the past yet their bodies moved on through time. It really is haunting and although I didn't like it at first, because it was an unusual style for me, I grew to appreciate it. It's powerful and sad, and wonderful, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Shark Dialogues instead!","review":"I don't know what happened here, but Ms. Davenport's earlier book was much better. This one was such a disappointment. There are two very big flaws in this book. First, there are far too many ridiculous and totally implausable coincidences. Coincidentally meeting old friends and enemies in different parts of the world? Several times??? It's lame. I can't believe how weak this book is... Enough already with the textures and colors again and again...The constant sex dialogue is RIDICULOUSLY graphic and INCREDIBLY uninteresting. Really, the text could have been so much better without having to read the minutae about hairs, girth, etc. Follow me?\\"Shark Dialogues\\" was much better. I recommend that or, better yet, \\"In the Time of the Butterflies\\" by Julia Alvarez.

The writing and imagery in her previous book were wonderful, but the allegories just a bit far fetched. Thus, I read Kiana Davenport's new book with the hope that she would use her considerable writing skills \\"for good\\". Unfortunately, I think she went the wrong direction.

I have tried for over a year to find a book that will excite him about colors. This book has done it for some reason.

To me it is a huge breakthrough! I love it that when we are done reading it and I tell him all done he says \\"again\\" so hopefully. We are currently reading this book at least 4 times a day. So, not only is this book teaching him his colors but it is a plus for speech for a non-verbal child."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Father","review":"My father wrote this book.

Having read the other reviews, I was prepared to find the Dalton character (lead RUC inspector) much more brutal and simplistic than he was.

Flint has done a masterful job of bringing this era to life. I particulary like what he has done with the Native American issues which treat them realistically, in the reality of that era, and without worrying about what is politically correct or installing some kind of revisionist history.You won't want to put this one down, and I think you will find it is well done. No real faults, although the dialogue amongst characters is not as crisp as it could be...but all in all , a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly irresistible","review":"The War of 1812 seems, to most Americans, as a minor war, dry and forgettable. But Mr. Eric Flint uses it as his starting point for his alternate history. He brings it to life, with such colorful characters, but also REAL people, as Andrew Jackson, Sam Houston, Winfield Scott, George Cockburn, Robert Ross and others. From Chippewa to New Orleans he creates a plot that draws you in. It never slows down yet it never goes so fast that you can't keep up. The American Nation, still young and a little rough around the edges, fighting for its rights and beliefs must deal with a NEW Nation being born even as the conflict rages. Mr. Flint brings Indians, freed men of color, escaping slaves and powerful whites together in a cooking pot of power and ideals. Ideals that will be tested, shaped and forced to deal with the judgment of history, the issue of slavery and growing pains of the young United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very satisfying read","review":"Eric Flint continues to be one of my favorite authors, and The Rivers of War is a great addition to my \\"what if\\" collection. The War of 1812 is given a neat twist, without the fantasy of the U.S. conquering Canada or the Spanish solidifying their hold on Florida. Each character, from Sam Houston to an Irish sergeant are well developed with strengths and flaws. Houston's defense of the Capitol, the widely varying quality of American militia, and a sense of hope for the Cherokee nation definitely brought the alternate Napoleonic era alive for me. I can easily recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange anti-British rant","review":"I have always enjoyed Eric Flint's books and so happily bought '1812' believing it would offer some interesting variations on a poorly understood subject. Instead I found myself immersed in what, from this side of the Atlantic, appears to be an anti-British rant. Why Mr Fint feels the need to invent battles between the British and Americans so as to chalk up a few undeserved wins for his home team is beyond me. The more I read the book the worse I felt and in the end gave up in disgust; a first for me with one of his book. However, I shall not be buying any more of his books in this ilk. I'm just glad that his low opinion of us is not shared by the vast majority of his countrymen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Alternate History","review":"To qualify as an alternate history, there must be a critical point which results in a completely different future. The problem that I had with this book is that the point chosen to diverge from actual historical events is so inconsequential that, other than a few battles which only a historian would be acquainted with, the reader is hard pressed to know or care about the alternate outcome.In addition, this book lacks the scope or vision which one usually expects from this type of work. It reads like a college history book peopled with a few characterizations of the people of the time. From a historical perspective, the only really interesting character is a minor player compared to the other historical personalities which are mentioned.Finally, this work appears to be only the first of several, designed to drag the reader through a tedious serialization which only a scholar, intimate with the minute details of Native American history could appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start for a Promising Story","review":"Rivers of War suffers just a little from being a preliminary for what will likely be the main story in the second book. Nevertheless, it stands up pretty much on its own. The premise is that Sam Houston is only slightly wounded in a battle during the War of 1812 (in real history he was laid up for the rest of the war.) That starts a whole series of events that brings not only Sam Houston, but some of his Cherokee relations to the Battles of Washington and New Orleons and what promises to be a far kinder (and more exciting) fate for the Cherokee nations years later, which doubtless will be related in the second book. I'm looking forward to it.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Alternative History","review":"This is another outstanding effort from Eric Flint (The 1632 series).

Then, its James Monroe's turn to do the same. Then, it's someone else's turn. This style of writing is so frustrating that I put the book down about halfway through and I can't pick it up again.

The author has a religeous/philosophical point to make and uses his characters to make that point. They are wooden and unbelievable. It's mostly a rage against Communism. There are many good books telling both sides of the conflict that are much more accurate. I can't believe God chose any side in this tragic war. Some books that are much better are: Laurie Lee's, A Moment Of War; Andre Malroux, Man's Hope; Forging Of A Rebel, Arturo Barea (A BRILLIANT BOOK); Bruce Palmer's, They Shall Not Pass; Clive Iving's Comrads, Paul Preston's Doves Of War (the war from women's view from both sides) and of course Hemingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls. This is a bad book by those standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"the title should have warned me","review":"Wayfarers of Fate is exactly what it sounds like;a soap opera put to print, a tele-novela without the \\"tele.\\" For research the author relied upon a Spanish aristocrat's pro-Catholic, pro-Franco view of the events of the Spanish Civil War. I can't be sure of this but I don't think the democratically elected government of Spain was ever referred to as a \\"Republic\\" nor were the rebellious Franco forces referred to as \\"Falangist\\" or \\"Fascist\\", nor was there any mention of Mussolini's or Hitler's support of Franco.

But even the Master himself once proclaimed that Tony was the best of the rest. Personally, I feel that Bennett, for a breif tenure in the late 1960's, knocked the Chairman of the Board off of his perch with his album entitled \\"Something\\". Although most of the numbers on the album are covers, he somehow managed to leave his own heartfelt trademark on these songs. His voice was at it's peak and the arrangments of these songs are timeless. This album is , without a doubt, a must have for the serious Bennett fan. And, incidentally, don't just take my word for it. It's one of his all time favorites as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when used in conjuction with the audio devices","review":"This is probably one of the most comprehensive Italian lesson books on the market.

Here's a review I wrote of the original CD issue:This is a knockout. Du Pré and Barenboim dig deeply under the surface of these sonatas. I was struck by what a gritty sound Ms. du Pré goes for, especially down low on the C string, when the music calls for it. She was obviously capable of a \\"prettier\\" performance, as many passages of sheer tonal beauty reveal. But these are fearless renditions, played with abandon, with nothing to prove except to find where this music lives. Barenboim is a more than capable partner, though unlike other reviewers, I find his role to be further in the background than in many performances of this music. Not to worry, though -- du Pré more than fills any sonic void. The background story of this partnership and these recordings is the stuff of legend, but the depth of commitment to revealing this music is what's really important here. I love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of his better books","review":"The story lacked deep character development and seemed to rush through setting the stage for the drama.

Dr. Miller shows that the conventional view of Morris has been much too limited and is due for thorough revision. This study is much more thorough than the recent popularizing biography of Morris by Richard Brookhiser.

My daughter just loves for me to read these out loud to her each night. This book seems to focus more on Mabel's home and family life and times with her best friend Sarah Jane, and less time bringing in other characters we'd seen before from school and church. Each story focuses on either something funny (as most stories are years later!) or some other tough lesson she learned. Things that seemed dull and repetitive to her as a child are now treasures for us to read, through the eyes and imagination of her granddaughter.This book can be read alone or with the series, and is a great read-aloud book for children.

She tells the funniest stories from her own life on a farm in early America. Quite clumsy and full of mischief she and her friend and two brothers learn the hard lessons of life through laughter, sorrow and getting in trouble with each chapter. As she matures, her father and mother instill moral values along the way. However, much like Anne of Green Gables her young spirit full of life never leaves her a moment of rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandma's Attic FINATIC!!!","review":"I love Grandma's Attic!I like when Sarah Jane and Mabel get into trouble and try to hide their sin from their families.I recomend this book to everyone and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!:)PS:friend of Legleg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great day time fragrance","review":"A great day time fragrance.

Stallsworth did not balance such intricate and complex characters, I did not feel like I got to know each character until about the sixth chapter! Stallsworth did not bring the characters alive, in my opinion. It takes a true writer to bring that across, I can see that potential in her writing. Basically, her use of words and phrases were not detailed enough. I was disappointed because I looked forward to reading this short novel. Also, it was obvious, Stallsworth tried to take a vastly different approach towards the end the story remained predictable. Her twists and turns were not polished. Towards the end I did feel the pain and suffering of Mary, but it was not long lasting. I thoroughly did not enjoy this book but I will read the sequel because all writers deserve a second chance.

I looked into it, and the manufacturer said they will send out a new puzzle if you mail them the proof of purchase, but they can't promise that it will have all the pieces either. What?! In the end I decided not to mail them proof of purchase and plead my case and we just tossed the puzzle out. It was a waste of money, but honestly, I shouldn't HAVE to ask for a new puzzle.

I was leery at first about any of them, but the first three (Nutcracker, Swan Lake and Rapunzel) were good. A bit sugary but nothing offensive in them. This one however ... The heroine sneaks out and deliberately disobeys her parents on several occasions, yells at them disrepectfully and is generally smartmouthed. The hero (Aidan) is just as bad. Even the animated looks they give sometimes, turns my stomach as a mom. I wouldn't recommend this movie to little girls ... especially if they like to repeat what they hear!

Its not one i can watch over and over again (not too entertaining for me) but its alright. The 3-d option is cool but a little too big of a concept for my daughter to understand (she's 3), but she loves the movie. She likes barbie, we own all the other movies and, really, she is thrilled with all of them. If your kid watches disney movies, then dont sweat this one. The story line is not much different.

While the villians in Fairytopia are on the comical side and not that threatening - there are dark and scary villians in this one (to a 4 year old) and abundant use of weapons/swordplay - not appropriate in my book. I can not rate the 3D - as we did not watch it in 3D - but my kids loved playing with the glasses ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to expectations","review":"I have watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter only once and had a very bad experience. This movie will not be seen or shown again in my house, at least not for a few more years. Perhaps its creators tried to make the movie \\"more edgy,\\" which is completely ununderstandable, as \\"edgy\\" is not something little girls want, and presumably they are the main audience for a Barbie movie. Those who are looking for gentle, beautiful princesses and polite knightly princes should not buy this movie. The characters are shallow and sometimes display a bad attitude. Their manners and style of conversation occasionally borders on bratty. The plot is rather forced. The \\"bad guy\\" is beyond bad and is way too scary. Only occasionally do we get to focus on the lovely colors and beautiful pictures for which we watch Barbie movies. I would highly recommend Barbie of Swan Lake and Barbie as Rapunzel instead. To sum up, this movie is just too much, too over the top for little girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't watch all of it, but not happy with what I've seen.","review":"Just wondering... since when did Barbie start to look like Paris Hilton? The package doesn't show any resemblance, but as I was watching a preview of this DVD... I couldn't miss the obvious similarities.

The heroin sneaks out against her parent's wishes then yells at them for being upset. Then she manages to get her parents and her townspeople turned into stone and saves a sister she didn't know she had all from being disobedient. This Barbie is snotty and mean, but somehow still gets the guy (who by the way, gambles his families life savings away and instead of repaying his parents runs away from home, sounds like a real winner to me!) and saves the day. To top it all off the villain has three wives that he has turned into ugly trolls and is now looking to marry again!

I am a little more forgiving in my review of this film having read other reviews and seeing what it took for the director to complete this film. Filmed in Russia, it was anything but easy. The whole thing was destined for failure with the ripoffs, location changes, etc...Either way the director was able to pull off quite a nice film in the end. The ending, however, was thrown together with no real explanation for the ridiculous creature. I think this is one time where the visual gave a bit more than we needed. I feel that it should have kept with the mystery and maybe eluded to the evil behind the wall with only noises, growls whatever...Maybe even just a shadow of things to come so-to-speak.

It now lists among some of my favorite and most played movies, alongside such classics as Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Liquid Sky, and The Evil Dead. Needless to say that with its appearance on such a lofty list of films one could be overwhelmed by the hype! I assure the reader that this could not be further from the truth. Dark Waters is stylish, coherent, artsy, and deeply disturbing, all rolled up in one. You owe it to yourself to go out and pick up a copy of this right now.

Limits of Law is, hands down, the most thorough, effective and devestating analysis of the UN ever published and the problems under international law.

Australia and New Zealand, for some reason also pass. He says that maybe Japan is okay. He doesn't care what any country thinks of the US, especially insignificant non-countries like France. He says the bad countries hate Bush because of his religion. He likes Bush because rather than waste time talking... he acts to set things straight.He seems to have been Bush One's Paul Wolfowitz.

However, the good things end there. The camera (7.1MP) takes poor images for your average (out of water) shot. The shots are blurry and it is hard to find the proper settings in each condition. The Xd card is super slow, takes several seconds before the camera is ready to shoot again. My suggestion buy the canon elf and just take the extra time to put it in a waterproof housing. My 4MP canon elf takes a much better quality image. I will not buy another Olympus product, my next camera will be the 7.1MP canon elf."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed..soon returned","review":"At first the camera seemed like a great buy with lots of unique features.

If you use this mode, it cancels out any other mode you try to select.*Recharger is very bulky and not travel friendly, combined with...*Short battery life.Positives are that this thing is bullet proof and can take underwater shots... that is about it!

The underwater pictures are cool, though not the best. The outdoor pictures are good in bright light. Where this camera may disappoint is in lower-light settings, including indoors. For that we have a different camera. When I was reading reviews deciding if I should buy this camera, I found one comment that really summed it up along the lines of: the best camera is the one you'll actually have with you at the time.

This one is so tiny it fits in your pocket. The different picture modes ROCK, I went on a Cruise and used most of them and they produced BEAUTIFUL Pictures. Once you get used to how to get your camera to do what you want it to do it really is one of the best cameras.

I took it snorkling and parasailing and got some awsome pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in it's league","review":"I can do nothing but rave about this product. I have had no problems with it what so ever. I took it on a 3 month trip across Europe and through 15 countries. With a 1 gig SD chip and extra battery it makes a great companion. It fits in your pocket like a deck of cards and is very durable so you don't have to worry about it. The battery life is long and reasonable, the picture quality is excellent, and the controls are some of the most intuitive that I've seen. I've owned many pocket cameras and I think this one is the best. Also to reemphasize: I lost this camera in Greece during my trip and when I got back to the states I bought a new one.

I've tried changing the settings to no avail. I have a much older Sony digital camera -- other than power up, its speed is comparable to this piece of junk. At least my old bulkier slower Sony takes decent pictures. I'm returning my new Olympus! I'm incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this camera","review":"I purchased this camera in December. It was broken out of the box. The resulting images are rotated about 15 degrees clockwise. I sent the camera back to olympus for repair, ad received it back in exactly the same broken condition. I called olympus repeatedly to try to get the camera repaired or replaced (it is still under warranty) and have had no luck thus far. In short, avoid Olympus products, particularly this one. Check out a Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous recordings, favorite version of Boccherini's minuet","review":"Amazing...the result of his voice added to some of these scores is so gorgeous. He doesn't overdo it, so that it adds to the music without taking away from it. This is a positive review from a very conservative classical enthusiast who usually doesn't tolerate adding anything to the original score. One of my favorite CD's. I think many children who like to hum to music would also like this CD as an intro to classical music. His conducting of Mozart though wasn't to my taste, try Sir Neville Marriner and the Orchestra of St. Martin in the Fields."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This CD is an interesting take on these familiar pieces.

I'll admit I don't look at it with the same eyes as a 34 year old, but it brings back good memories. I always liked the music and was happy to see it on this CD. The price for a new CD was a bit steep, but I purchased it anyway. People who have not see the movie a few times may not appreciate CD. I can picture in my mind certain scenes as they play. It may even sound spooky to someone not familiar with the movie, but I don't think would not recommend it. My wife who never really saw the movie, just does not get why I was looking forward to listening to it! 5 STARS just for something like this making it to CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This is a terrific book.

It assumes no knowledge and takes you through the whole editing process. The appendixes alone, with advice on purchasing DV decks, the hardware you need for setup, plus tips and tricks makes it worth the price. I also feel more confident as an editor--the book covers Express as the vehicle for teaching about editing principles. It goes beyond the usual button pushing software books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving book by a gallery owner","review":"This book does not reflect art in Alaska.

I first connected this to my 2hp cyclonic dust collector. There was barely any air movement at the 1\\" end of th hose. I then used my 6.5hp shop vac with similar results. I went back to duct-taping a 2\\" hose to the underside of my bosch sander handle which works fine, except that the hose is a little unwieldy. Better unwieldy that dust all over my shop and the work. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud to Use","review":"Sounded like a great product to hook up a small hose to my Bosch sanders. But when connected to my 6.5 HP ShopVac it creates such a LOUD high pitch it is just beyond any hope of using, even with highend ear protection.Turn it on and even our Beagle inside of the house runs for the hills.Product connects well as described. Just don't connect it to a ShopVac.Bosch should porvide a disclaimer NOT to be used on a ShopVac."},{"rating":"1","title":"minimal suction at best","review":"I'm not sure this extremely thin and long hose produces enough suction to pick up any sawdust. I was using duct tape to connect my Rigid vacuum hose directly to the output of my Bosch sander and the vacuum was so strong I had to pull the sander off the wood. Then I purchased this hose and have been totally disappointed. Make sure you buy a dust mask if you use this product you'll need it.

I purchase the Vac001 to use with my Bosch detail sander and orbital sander. I hooked it up to my 6.5 HP shop vac and it screamed like a banshee.

This item is garbage. DO NOT BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for a shop vac - better for a tiny vac","review":"Keep in mind on this hose it is only 19mm - 25.4 mm would be 1 inch - 38mm would be roughly 1.5 inches, so this is HALF the diameter or 1/4 the cross sectional area of a typical shop vacuum hose which will drop airflow significantly - fine for drywall dust but if you get a piece of paper or a edge strip sucked into this hose you are likely to clog it. The fitting on the vac end is the standard 2\\" (50mm) fitting, so your hose is going from 19mm to 50mm with a high probability of clogging with any large object (nail, drywall screw, paper, etc) which would fly easily through 1.5\\" hose (38mm).Perhaps packaged with a small nozzle for computer keyboards or a dusting brush for computer fans and laptop fans it would be useful - as it is it's trouble - look at the Mr. Nozzle hoses - much better professional grade hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Durability","review":"PROs - Lightweight, flexible and easy to use with portable tools. Really works well with hand drywall sanding tool.CONs - Contrary to the photo on the amazon website, this hose is not reinforced like the original equipment hose that came with my Bosch 3931 professional vacuum. It is constructed of a very flimsy flexible plastic which is very easy to pinch. Once pinched, the hose collapses whenever the hose intake is restricted and further reduces air flow. It was a waste of money. I will need to obtain a reinforced hose which does not have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK","review":"After reading the reviews on this product in conjunction with the RS006 I was concerned. The hose friction-fits both the RS006 and my craftsman shop vacuum 2 1/4\\" female port just fine. I just took another look at the web offering and the shop vacuum male end is listed at 2 1/2 in\\" diameter. This is most confusing. The cost of the hose was a little high, considering what it is made of. My only other thought is that there is direct relationship between length of hose and suction. My shop vacuum sings as if the hose was plugged, signifying limited air flow. Shorter may be better. To those needing a hose, it works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screaming meemie","review":"This hose fit all that they claim it does but when using it with a vacuum cleaner it screams so loud at the tool end that I have to put on hearing protection.

If your library uses Overdrive, you can borrow the kindle edition.I couldn't get past page 5. This book contains numerous examples of bad writing: adverbs and adjectives everywhere to prop up weak verbs and nouns (respectively), info-hiding, direct (as opposed to clever or original) dialogue, and no actual setup of a plot. I could not sympathize or identify with either character--I was simply bored. Jacobson tries to make up for this with shock. Yawn.

Though the action is exciting, it's a little far fetched. Some of the scenes actually made me stop reading and say to myself, \\"Yea, right\\".

One interesting point of the story is how it moves from one character to the next, being passed along, so it isn't focusing on a singular character. Something the other movies didn't really do. Because of this, it feels more like an American animated film (except in art style, naturally) and this brings my single complaint; It isn't long enough. The story could've been even better if played around with me. But I suppose Japanese children and teens don't have high enough attention spans... ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best DBZ Movie Yet!!!","review":"This is the final DBZ movie and is by far the best of all.

My other problem is is that I thought it would come with a whole turkey and instead it only came with 2 wings.

Why the two star rating, you ask? The author's positive bias destorys the book's credability. The book didn't need this bias in order to describe Ken's triumph over his past and his inner demons. He is a man who has gone from being a thug to a more complete human being (who now plays a Thug on TV.) This is the real story, and his wins and losses (especially against Severn) doesn't change that. Too bad the author didn't understand this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information hidden in jumbled text","review":"So far I've only read the first half of the book on the biography of Ken Shamrock. There is priceless information about his life from childhood on up. There is great stuff on his physical and mental strength as well as his philosophy on fighting and life. However, the book jumps back and forth leaving the reader somewhat jumbled up. The grammar of Richard Hannar is by no means impressive. His sometimes fantastic descriptions leave out valuable information that lead to a not so realistic view of what took place (people who witnessed the fights will know). Shamrock, however, is without a doubt one of the most successful and influential mixed martial arts fighters of this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for fight lovers, very inspirational","review":"I love this book.

I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the martial arts and especially those of us who are inspired by the life of someone who's been victorious over adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book records a series of voyages by Frank Dye in a 16' Wayfarer dinghy, over the course of six summers, starting in Florida, continuing up the east coast of the US, and into Canada, ending finally in the western Great Lakes. Given the vast distances & challenging sailing conditions, and the author's wonderful previous outing, \\"Ocean Crossing Wayfarer,\\" I expected a gripping read. No such luck. Dye's wife Margaret started out as crew, but bailed on the voyage about 900 miles in. I bailed at the Bay of Fundy and didn't finish the book. She was tired and cold and sick. I was just bored. Margaret Dye edited \\"Ocean Crossing Wayfarer\\". This one was Frank Dye's alone. He may be the sailor of the family, but she is plainly the writer. I have no doubt that Dye experienced some remarkable things on the voyages described. Unfortunately we aren't privy to them. Its title notwithstanding, \\"Sailing to the Edge of Fear\\" reads little better than a log book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Gem!","review":"What a brilliant album this is.

I must admit, when Roger and Andy left the band I lost interest in them as to me is just wasn't Duran Duran without the 5 original guys. Now that they've come back to the fold, well lets just say this DVD truly brings back the passion for performing that they shared. My biggest regret is that I never had the pleasure of seeing them live, but this DVD is almost like being there in the front row. Even if you are just a casual fan I highly recommend seeing it. It will give you a new appreciation for them. Even my 8 year old son loves the DVD. It was great seeing them perform all of their older music (How much do I love New Religion and Careless Memories..

I sat through the whole movie, waiting for the plot to start. The characters were undeveloped. THe story line was not plausable.

I am a huge fan of disaster movies. I have seen most of them (Twister, Day AFter Tomorrow, Independence Day, Jaws, and many others). This has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen.

So all in all I have had two of these and not been able to use either one even one time. Perhaps I was just unlucky, but I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is poorly constructed with rivets that don't hold the straps on, so I would be wary of even using this thing with a bike, since the straps can't remain attached when they are not under load. At least Amazon is good about returns, but even so my experience with this item is you will be out the high cost of a really low quality item for as long as it takes to receive a refund and be making a few trips to the UPS Store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Non Front Wheel Removal Pickup Truck Bike Rack","review":"Assuming there is no front fender on your bike, this is the best pickup truck rack where you do not have to remove the front wheel (I have tried others).

It also folds down so that the bed can be covered without rack removal. Yes it is true that you have to lift the bike up over the side into the truck bed due to the fact that it works easiest with the gate closed. Keep that in mind if you have a heavy bike (which should have no bearing on a rating for this product). I have a Ford F-150 full size bed pickup truck with bed liner and 2 of these racks fit nicely, I doubt a third rack would fit.

The plot is vague and rambling, peopled by unbelievable and unlikeable characters.

Most of the functionality in Office XP is the same as it was in these earlier products, so it leaves the user with the question, what am I paying over \\"$\\" for? Even the upgrade price is ridiculus. My opinion, check out Staroffice or if you can't afford that then check out OpenOffice.

Cambeira's visual style of writing painted a detailed picture of life in the Caribbean. At times the realism of the story made me uncomfortable, but I think that was the desired effect. The personal conflicts and struggles of the characters in the story reminded me of Arthur Millers \\"Death of a salesman\\". While the education and development of the Azúcar reminded me of a modern day Edmund Dantes from Alexandre Dumas's \\"the Count of Monte Cristo\\" as he was educated in the Chteau d'If. I especially liked that the story held a theme similar to many works in literature that emphasizes the importance of liberty and the determination of the human spirit to over come oppression."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Best Seller In The Making!","review":"This is truly a marvelous book. Cambeira's love for the Caribbean is so evident and eloquent on every page from start to finish. This story is filled with intelligent, strong and sensitive women characters.

A true best seller on any list!My Highest Recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing tour de force!","review":"This book is so beautifully written it is to be savored over time, like fine wine. It moved me deeply, delighted me in a literary sense, and was always a compelling joy to come home to. Alan Cambeira is a stellar writer; surely he could speak of the phone book and be just as mesmerising, but when the topic is the struggles of sugarcane business in the Dominican Republic, it is indeed a rare and wonderful feast. Brava to a sublime author and a worthy topic. This proves that Hispanic literature is one of the worthiest to read. I recommend it not just as a library piece, but also as a special gift for any friend with a soul..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Treatment of Tough Subject","review":"I was born in the Caribbean (St. Lucia) many years ago and Alan Cambeira's novel took me back to my native island. His work is brilliant, fresh, and brutally realistic in every sense. You have got to be ready for this story. I also learned a great deal about my own 'backyard.' The suspense and intrigue didn't allow me to put down the book even for one minute. This is really one powerful story! I have never read anything like this before. It is so unusual and so shocking. I definitely recommend this novel to anyone genuinely interested and open to new cultural experiences. Cheers to Professor Cambeira.

Like I said, Cambeira tiene tumbao. Azucar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've read in a long, long time!!","review":"This books has all the elements of a great piece of literature.

I eagerly await more works from this talented historian/writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Wonderful Journey","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was recommended by a friend who really knows the literature of the Caribbean and so this reading came on very sound advice. I wasn't the least bit disappointed.

Azucar herself is an unforgettable character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down by bad editing and an unrealistic storyline","review":"I was very excited when a friend bought me this book from my wish list for Christmas. With all of the excellent reviews on Amazon I couldn't wait to get started. Initially, the book was very good, however, the further I progressed, the harder it got to read. I felt that the book was let down by poor editing as it was full of spelling and typographical errors which were extremely distracting. The deathbed confessions were simply blurted out, almost like the author had to finish the book quickly and the reveal the 'mysteries' - and to be honest, I would have been happier if the book finished there. From hereon in, the storyline became predictable but at the same time ridiculous. The final chapters were particularly weak and simply unbelievable; reminiscent of a trashy cheap novel. I won't be purchasing the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Writer Cambeira, has a real winner on his hands with his Azucar! The Story Of Sugar.

Well, sista-girl, forget about digging those old chestnuts (as great as some of them are, of course) out of that musty storage bin!There is a dynamic new Caribbean voice that will be hard for audiences anywhere to ignore. Just as Azucar's voice can't be silenced, the Dominican author Alan Cambeira is far too brilliant a voice to overlook. In this most imaginative story --loaded with suspense and intrigue and an abundance of unforgettable characters-- Cambeira resurrects a vital link in the spiritual and cultural chain that connects people across time and space. And he does it beautifully. This is a marvelous tale, exceptionally well written in all its secret intricacies and complex mysteries. This author deserves kudos for his imagination and daring.Very Highly Recommended. Hurry up Ophrah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly Imaginative","review":"In Cambeira, we have a fresh and welcome voice from the Caribbean. Azucar's story is beautifully told in all its naked boldness and carefully unfolding suspense. This unusual story captivated me with all its realistic characters and shocking events. I have read quite a few Caribbean novels by truly wonderful writers. But this story is absolutely one of the BEST I have read. I thought I was actually watching a suspenseful movie.

I also learned much that I didn't know about the real Caribbean and the horrors of sugarcane.

I'd love to see someone make a motion picture of it. Ophrah or Spike, are you listening???"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important New Literary Voice","review":"Alan Cambeira, an exciting Dominican author, writes fiction without being outlandish. However, he is conspicuously unconventional. His words are carefully selected and positioned just right to concoct a dazzling and suspenseful tale set against the deceptive beauty of the Caribbean.

His flow, pacing, \\"delivery\\", and choice of material fits with the concept of a comedian on stage, giving a show with nothing but a microphone. His books are almost all based on the idea of picking a topic, then making lists of sub-topics, and cracking jokes about them. So to translate this into movie form required that the material be augmented and sometimes significantly changed. The writer of the movie had two choices I think. He could have turned it into a kind of sketch-comedy show, with a series of sketches but no attempt to connect them. The second choice, which he took, was to try to architect a flow more akin to a tradition scripted comedic story. I just don't think it worked. Maybe if it had a screenwriter with talent equal to Dave, it could have worked.So basically, some of it was funny, but more often it was just dumb, and the \\"flow\\" was awkward. I say, read his book, and skip this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Product","review":"The device appears to be well made and is simple to operate.

So I bought the cuff recommended by OnlineSupplier and it does not go with the 780 BP unit at all. Online Supplier refuses to respond to my complaints.

Since then, repeated problems despite being VERY careful about cuff placement, checking for no cuff leaks, etc. I am also a bioengineer with 40 years of experience - 15 of which were spent in developing blood pressure instrumentation.Troubleshooting myself, I discovered that if I artificially squeeze the cuff to allow the pressure to go over about 14 mm Hg during inflation before 6-7 seconds elapses, I can get it to inflate.

We tried cutting the plastic insert to relieve some of the pressure and managed only to break the device. It now errors all the time, and of course we can't return it given that we cut it.

This seems to be one of those movies that take top shelf in my video storage, but that I hesitate to recommend to friends. As I said: weird. If you like seemingly mainstream movies that have a twist or quirk in them, you probably will enjoy this. If your tastes run to the traditional, you may be better off sticking to Die Hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This was a great movie. I really enjoy Samuel Jackson movies and was surprised when I received it. I knew Geena Davis is great actress but it really showed in this movie. I loved the plot and was \\"surprised\\" at who the villian is. It was recommended by my uncle and I usually don't take recommendations by people but this one was movie well spent. Wish it could've been a little longer to explain some of the situations but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will there be a sequel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Packed movie!","review":"My husband and I have had this movie for years and never tire of watching over and over again. (there are very few movies we watch more than a few times) It's a classic \\"must see. Samuel Jackson's character is hilarious & Geena Davis plays her roles perfecty. I will state that I do not like movies that have gratuitous cussing. With that said, although there is cussing in this movie, it is appropriate to the character's personalities.It's an action-packed thriller, that keeps you in suspense til the end.I bought this for my daughter because as soon as it hits a used DVD store, it's snatched up right away and is difficult to find. It was delivered at lightening speed and am happy to report my daughter loves it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, \\"the torture thing\\"","review":"Craig Bierko is very nice looking and lots of fun playing evil.

It is an action packed film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, Not for young children (Some language and brief nudity) I recommend this as a good movie to watch when the weather is bad and you want some exciting entertainment"},{"rating":"2","title":"A POPCORN MUNCHER'S DREAM FLICK","review":"The plot of this movie is absolutely tired, but Harlin's over-the-top, go-for-broke direction, and the chemistry between Geena Davis, and Samuel L. Jackson ( who is simply hilarious in this film ) turn what should have been a run of the mill actioner into a hyperbolic, funfest. THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is more than just a little fun to watch, and describing Davis as a Sigourney Weaver wanna-be is more than a little simplistic. It's fun to see a kick-ass woman protagonist who can dish out some great one-liners, and blow the bad guys away with the same aplomb as Clint, or Bruce- or Arnold for that matter. On top of that, Craig Bierko made one loathsome, but fun-to-hate villain. I fully admit that this movie is a 'guilty pleasure,' and I'm quite guilty of loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feminist manifesto in ice....","review":"Aside from Smilla in Smilla's Sense of Snow, Samantha is the greatest dark heroine on film. Both tales involve the \\"thawing\\" of female characters deeply buried under the ice of regret, rage and mutable identity. Both surround their ice goddesses with snowy scenes of violence and death. Both end with the merging of two personalities; an integration that is as welcome as it is feared. Brilliant, just brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Kiss Goodnight","review":"Like the fellow from Egypt...I just heard about this film....and it is now Nov 2002...the part to which he refers is the scene in which Samuel Jackson is told that \\"it would be hard to fake the death of 4000\\" and so they will have to die in order for the US to get funding for the military...and the last line....\\"To blame it on the Muslims\\"....I found this 1996 film astounding and horrifying..What is even worse I suppose is now believing that the govt is capable/willing to do anything on behalf of their goals...namely seizing oil....anything is now possible....shameful...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvement over dvd","review":"I've always loved this movie and been waiting for blu ray.

Both Geena Davis and Samuel L Jackson give rich, multi-textured performances in this story of an amnesiac who discovers that she used to be an killer for the government! And that they are after her!

It is spunky, witty, funny and both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are fantastic. I give it four stars only because of the annoying and, in some ways, unnecessary child. Maybe if they made her less whiny and just as spunky as Davis I would give it five stars. Everyone I've told about this movie likes it at least as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome. Extra spicy. SO MUCH BETTER THAN LEONARD MALTIN!!!!","review":"The best movie ever made. Very very funny funny movie. Sammy Jackson is as good as a goose in time for a morning snack in the summer, with a little bit of salt and peppa added to make it SUPER COOL. There is a certain critic out there who is a stinker, leonard maltin. BOOOOOOOO! to him. He said this was a bad movie, and he is about as wrong as eating a pretzel with Susan B Anthony in the middle of August when it's raining. Very good movie and funny+ good= better than Leonard Maltin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and action packed","review":"After a nice run of feature films, for some reason this turned out to Geena Davis' last live action feature film for a thirteen year stretch.In \\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\\", Geena plays a super-spy assassin who, through a case of amnesia, had been living the life of a normal mother and schoolteacher for several years. Eventually the memory of her assassin life and skills begins to come back, and the list of people who want her dead turns out to be a long one.Geena is convincing in the role of a competent spy/killer who slowly awakens to her former very formidable talents. Samuel L. Jackson plays somewhat against type as a bumbling private eye and sidekick.Of course, the movie is a complete spy fantasy, with lots of shoot 'em up, bust 'em up, incredible escapes, catchy lines, evil villains, and righteous come-up-ances. For sheer escapism, this one should be among the films at the top of your list. James Bond could take lessons. LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 10!","review":"There hasn't been a review on this movie for a long time.

A great action-comedy movie. I highly recommend you watch/own this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geena Davis looks great","review":"I think this is a great movie, very entertaining. I think Geena Davis is a talented actor, I admire a woman, who does at least some of the stunts herself. I just loved the part where she changes her looks, from a house wife, with long brown curly hair, to a sexy spy, with short blond hair. There is lots of great action sceenes, I don't think Samantha Caine would survive any of it in real life, but that's not the point in a movie is it? She jumps out of a building, survives car crashes, explosions and lots of other stuff. If you like this movie, I also recomend: \\"Face/Off\\" \\"Con Air\\" \\"The Rock\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Kiss Goodnight","review":"One of my favorite movies.

Being a life member of the United States Naval Institute I have some knowledge of the proposed \\"Arsenal Ship\\" that the author used.

Give Douglass his due...the man knows how the military functions, and how it can respond in times of national emergencies.

He is funny, literate, superb at story construction and a genius at character development. I am surprised he is not far better known. Like his first novel, Dear Will is a delight. Anyone with any interest AT ALL in the publishing world (ie, anyone who is interested AT ALL in books) will find him or herself laughing on just about every page, while loving both Will and Annie."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Barracuda Stars from Start to Finish","review":"Karl writes with such an easy intelligence and humor that his keen insight into the workings of all his beloved characters is natural and warm. I loved it from the first page to the last and would protest loudly if forced to skip through any sections as a few of the earlier reviewers advocate. Ackerman's characters are so realistically flawed and human, that I think of them as friends and find my self starting to tell \`stories' about them to other people over tea. Why, I must ask, are the bookstores in the world filled with so many flat and lifeless books while Karl's are hidden treasures?? Six stars (find and read Karl's other book The Patron Saint of Unmarried Women - NOW!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I bought this book for my monthly book club and was very impressed by the research and stories that were chosen for the book. The author is adopted and had some great insights into the era when women were expected to give up their illegitimate babies. I would highly recommend this book as it really gives you an idea of how much or how little (depending on your point of view) things have changed over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls who went away is a insightful and moving book.","review":"This book means a lot to me and I'm sure to many other women of my generation.

I knew I had to be like her, and come to find out I was. Sadly, my mother had committed suicide when she was 33 years old. She had dealt with a lifetime of depression. I was born in 1980, so it was after the time this book deals with. It gave me insight on how my mother must have felt. I was lucky to have siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins who all knew about me. They provided me with pictures of my mother and were able to talk to me about my mom. This book has helped me realize that adoption is an issue that affects so many parties and there is not much help p=out there. I am a strong believer that someone who has been through the experience can help the most. I want to help people with their searches, issues dealing with being adopted (especially teenage girls), etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone whose life is touched by adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gift of understanding for adoptees and their first moms","review":"This book should be required reading by everyone who has been touched by adoption. Those particularly in need of its information are those in the healthcare and counseling fields who for years have said we moms would just move on and forget the child we lost.I'm going to suggest it to the doctor who told me to read, \\"Don't sweat the small stuff.\\"Thank you Ann for giving us moms a voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartrending Reading","review":"Personally, reading this book affected me in a very unexpected way; it changed my mind about the subject of adoption. Prior to reading this book, I had believed that young women who became pregnant and were unmarried should strongly consider completing their pregnancy and surrendering their child for adoption. But through reading the feelings of the women interviewed for this book, I found new compassion for the impact that surrendering a child has on a young mother. And I have a new view and opinion of the unsympathetic and callous society that would require women to surrender their children in order to induce conformity to disingenuous values and cultural status. There's much for all of us to discuss and ponder after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective","review":"This book really gave me new perspective on what my birth mother went through during her pregnancy in 1967. We have such a hard time relating now and the women's stories help me to see why she made decisions later in her life. Her pregnancy and attachment to me is so much more emotional that mine with her and reading about journeys of other birth mothers helps me to understand that a little more. She never had any other biological children, and strangely neither did my birth father."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried when I read this book","review":"I loved the way the author incorporated real life stories of women using their own words into excellent factual and exhasutive research. I could feel their pain in their stories. So many times I had to put the book down and cry with these girls who have carried so much pain for so long. Thank you, Ann Fessler for taking the time to write this book and help women everywhere understand what our sisters endured before Roe vs. Wade. This is not about pro-life or pro-choice; it is about history. A history every girl should know before she makes any decisions about her values on abortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought it, haven't read it yet ... but I know what I will find within its covers.","review":"As a birthmother, the never ending pain perhaps will be there always. The Agency person told me that what I was doing was far better than my raising my child, \\"after all she will have a Mother and Father\\". She left with the signed papers telling me to go on vacation for a week and when I come back, I will feel much better.I have never felt much better. No woman who gave her child away because of Society's badge of shame, will ever find complete peace. No matter how many children she may have after this first child of her life.I believe that every woman who is represented in this book and all the millions of others, could have written this book. But I thank Ann Fessler for finally acknowledging the extraordinary gift of a lifetime that was made so many years ago, when Society was blind about love of a mother, each of us who gave the greatest gift of all, her child, her heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girls Who Went Away","review":"I am a birthmother that was at St Mary's in Dorchester Ma in 1969.

I am not sure if I had a different name when I was their. I was their from May - Aug 1969.

It is well written and I must encourage you to read the entire book as the author does a good job of wrapping up the book after all of the interviews and history. What a compelling piece of women's lifes. Although the title includes that this is pre Roe v. Wade please don't think that abortion is the issue here. I think the author included that in the title to shape the time period as abortion was not a choice.I will be thinking about these women as they are portrayed so realistically to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaks my heart and gives me hope","review":"This book is wonderful! I appreciate the empathy for our mothers, the truth about their lives. I have hope that millions of women will read this and never, ever do to their daughters what was done to our mothers. I have hope that educators will teach from it and preachers will preach from it. I am so grateful for Ann Fessler's work. And, thank you to all the mothers who shared their stories.What was done to you -- and to us, your children -- is an abomination, a crime against nature. The day will come when historians will look at your lives and wonder how such vile treatment could possibly have happened and lasted so long. Surely, such treatment of so vulnerable a united pair -- mother and child -- will seem unthinkable in a free society, a free country, in a family. Ann Fessler has provided a very readable history of the times and has addressed many issues related to forced surrender -- all with grace and compassion. I am so moved by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really about Roe v Wade - but good to read","review":"This book is not about Roe v. Wade but is really about the lack of education on how our bodies work, how to handle your own urges and those of your partners, how to prevent pregnancy and the transmission of disease. It was good to read these interviews and to know that many of these women are now healing. Isn't it also appalling that many of the women interviewed had no explanation of what to expect during labor and delivery even when they were in a home for un-wed mothers with 'professionals'. I know that many families still do not talk about 'it' at all. We can have sex education in schools, access to birth control and understanding of how to postpone sex, avoid feeling pressured into sex and to let young people know that there will always be someone to talk to. We, our society, can help prevent unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. I felt that more of the book could have addressed what can be done now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry reading boring but informative","review":"I had to get this book for one of my classes and I didn't really care for this. It's very dry reading although I can not deny the fact that it is very interesting regarding adoption. No one know what goes on in the adoption world, it follows adoption though out the years where it was very taboo. I thought that the chapters read like a textbook running off statistics, and stories but no real substance. I wouldn't read this book again for recreational purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUST READ!","review":"I heard about this book on NPR and it stuck such a cord with me as I had given a daughter up for adoption in 1966. The stories of these women are my story, with slight variations. After 40 years I have a sense of closure that I never had. For anyone who was adopted, or gave a child up for adoption, or who knew someone who \\"went away\\" this book will help understand what the climate towards unmarried mothers was like. Society today is SO different. But there are thousands of us out here and this book tells our story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overstated and inaccurate","review":"An interesting but limited account of mother's from a small geographic region. Assusmes a revisionist/deconstructionalist version of history. The tales range from sad to tragic, but never takes on the issue of individuals personal responsibility and accountability for actions and hence the whine, woe, victim status. Complete with the common anti-male slant. As an adoptee reunited with my mother, we both agree, this is the trite Hollywood version trumped for a Lifetime Channel audience that paints these mothers as helpless controlled victims forced to be dimwitted- not on this side of the Mississippi. My birth mother made a tough choice for her own interests, own's up to that choice and like actual women from the era would have kicked the teeth in of anyone who challenged that decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Make 'em any Worse than This","review":"Very very very very bad.I can only imagine the actors/actresses/crew involved in this uninspired bit of trash must have each thrown up between takes.It's honestly that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Not worth the money.

To deny that would be less than intelligent to put it mildly. However, its humor can't save it from being ultimately pointless and something of a time-waster.When you begin it, it seems very funny and accessible. The jokes about Vinnie and Gepetto, the constant usage of the phrase \\"passing lesbian\\" and the cat jokes are all funny. Truthfully, they never cease to be amusing, as do not the Jewish jokes. This book is amusing.However, what little plot there is soon becomes tiresome. You don't care. And you can't care.

I would give this 0 stars if I could","review":"The movie starts off with a semi-interesting twist. The two main characters, Andrew and Dave, encounter some slight troubles with the law. Andrew gets accused of kissing a pre-teen girl scout and Dave's ex-girlfriend steals over $27,000 from his workplace. The angry parent of the girlscout shows up to their house, as well as the police. Then NOTHING comes and 'NOTHING' hits the wall.Aside from Andrew being annoying as possible throughout the entire movie, the film has taken many good ideas and done absolutely NOTHING with them. You find yourself waiting for something to happen, which is the only reason I continued to watch the movie. Everything they hate disappears and soon they begin to hate eachother, which you see coming the entire time. Poor acting and a weak plot destroy what could have been a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing worth seeing here","review":"Typically,I like these odd movies,but this one was horrible.Its about two losers who cant function well in society,and end up getting their wish to live in a world where none of the things that bother them exist.I thought that this is where the comedy would begin.However,I cant even remember laughing even once.Rather than this being a \\"be careful what you wish for,\\" Twilight zone type movie,the two losers actually seem to enjoy living in a world with nothing and settling disputes by challenging each other in their favorite videogame!Theres no moment where these two suddenly realize that,yes,people and all the aggravating nonsense in life may get to you,but it is considerably better than the alternative,and that maybe ,in some strange way,we do live in the best of all possible worlds.The ending is totally ridiculous and stupid as well.I rarely ever watch a film and regret even renting it.This one ISN\\"T better than nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable!","review":"It's been years since I read this book and yet so many things about it linger in my memory.

After seeing the remake, I decided to read the book to find out which was closest to the book. I was extremely disappointed. The book was slow moving and the scary segments were few and far between. Nell was unrealistically naive, for a woman who supposedly took care of her mother for so long. It was painfully long. I know the book was written in the 50's, but there is no comparison to the black/white film, which far surpasses even the remake with all its special effects!

However, I was disappointed by the ending of the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hill House...whatever walked there, walked alone.","review":"Possibly the single scariest book I've ever read and as an English major and horror fan I've read many. All of Jackson's stories are unsettling, even the innocuous family stories. This one is just terror from page one. And it stays with you for life.

You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying characters","review":"I loved Jackson's \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" but I couldn't get past the first few chapters of this book. I found the characters to be incredibly annoying.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated.

I wanted to like it, be scared, etc.---never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was slow moving and built up to absolutely nothing.","review":"The novel had a good premise. However, it was not the best horror novel I have ever read. It could have been better if we had known for certain whether Nell's deamons were mental or actual. The author never really clarifies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I was so excited to read this book. I love the haunted house genre- movies, books, etc. I was extremely bored throughout this entire book, and hung in there thinking..\\"it must be about to get really good.\\" There are so many good reviews of this book here on Amazon. I'm still scratching my head.Uninteresting characters, unsubtle spooky events (that weren't scary in the slightest). I'm glad it wasn't any longer.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story","review":"I read Hill House as a book club selection. I finished it only because it is courteous to the host. I thought it went on and on and the \\"super natural\\" part was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scary book??","review":"I heard so much hype about how scary this classic book was, that I quickly bought it, looking forward to enjoying a fright. I found this book to be nothing special, the dialogue among the characters was comical and, at times, ridiculous. Any book by Stephen King is superior to this simple novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"This is quite simply the best haunted house tale I have ever read, and I have read many. I have read this book again and again and never tire of it. For me, anything in the genre, be it book or film, is measured by this wonderfully written tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best American writers of this century","review":"Who is better at finding the chill at the edge of \\"normality\\"? Certainly not Stephen King (who is now writing 50 pages worth reading out of 732 in \\"Bag of Bones\\" for example). \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" concerns itself with loneliness, madness and MAYBE the supernatural. Shirley Jackson found evil and menace in the every day: the small New England town, the picnic by the river. If you need rotting corpses popping up out the cellar to disquiet you, by all means try other \\"horror\\" writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtly Disturbing","review":"This classic book revolves around a confused and emotionally vulnerable young woman named Eleanor Vance and her time spent in a Hill House, a mansion possessed with its own terrifying and unrelenting spirit. With no solid place in the world to call her own, Eleanor came to Hill House seeking adventure and a change in her stale, uneventful life. Although the others present experience the events of the haunting, it is Eleanor who receives its full wrath. At the same time, she is strangely attracted to the house and unable to leave, staying on until an irreversible tragedy occurs.This book is a classic haunting story which does not need to rely on gore or clearly visible demons. It is a psychological thriller which readers will find memorable and satisfying. I would call the story disturbing rather than frightening. Nonetheless, it is an excellent piece of classic horror genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"This is the first book I have read in some years now. I am so glad I chose this book to re-launch my reading hobby. I loved it so much that I had to read something else by her, \\"We Have Always Lived In The Castle.\\" Not quite as horrifying but a compelling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book---","review":"If you loved \\"The Haunting\\" movies, or even if you didn't, you'll love this book! It sucks you right in...and it's preety scary, too! Read it, it's really good! SHIRLY JACKSON DELIVERS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a writer","review":"Brilliant, just brilliant. The opening paragraph alone is extraordinary. I am not a fan of the horror genre. This book works on so many levels - quality of writing, psychological depth, humor, vivid descriptions, wry observations of human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated ... was this ever scary?","review":"The classic status and claims of it being the origin of the archetypal American horror story - and my love of scary books - got me to buy this. The first 80% of the book is the cheery 1950s style setup, and the last part is the slightly tongue in cheek, seen from a distance style horror scene. You may have to read a few scenes twice to realise something mildly supernatural was happening that the characters found mildly frightening. At least they got a mild thrill, but this is one big YAWN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunting!","review":"Well, this is considered \\"the\\" haunted house book, but I found it a little lacking, possibly because I've come across copycats of this book before. The plot is simple enough: Dr. Montague invites four guests to a haunted house to study psychic phenomena. The book is mainly told from Eleanor's perspective, and she may or may not be sane, and therein lies the crux of the book. Is what's happening really going on or only in Eleanor's head? There are hints that clue the reader in, but I don't want to spoil anything. The book wasn't very scary but more interesting watching the way Shirley Jackson manipulates the reader. All in all, recommended for horror fans to study where the original haunted house tale came from, though it's been imitated to death since, which may squash some of its appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid, old school haunted house story","review":"This is an excellent old school haunted house tale that builds up slowly. Great character development and very atmospheric, actually gives the reader an intense sense of claustrophobia. Also gets you into the Halloween spirit reading it in October!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading, especially if you saw the original movie.","review":"If you saw the new \\"Haunting\\" movie, you were probably disappointed. Though it started out promising in the first half, the second half fell apart.The book and the original movie are very close in story. I found it very interesting to see what was in the book that was not in the original movie. I was pleased to note some subtle differences between the two.If you have not seen the original movie, go see it! Then read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok","review":"A quick read, not really FANTASTIC, as some people said. It was definetely different from the movie (the 1999 one), and like the movie, the book didn't scare me one bit. It was interesting but not scary. It's real easy to fall asleep after reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Terrifying","review":"A book with class, which is also a classic book.A horror novel for the thinking man? Perhaps.I dont write long reviews - in this forum, anyway - so in a nutshell, i strongly recommend anyone who likes literature, and who enjoys a good scare, that you read this book, and once you have, try not to think about it too much because the more you think about it, the scarier it becomes.LR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, creepy story","review":"This novel (and most of Jackson's stuff,for that matter) is the perfect blend of literary, character-driven fiction and genre fiction. Jackson writes some beautifully realistic and developed characters that they could be real people, and she puts that together with creepy, slowly-building horror. This isn't the overt stuff of modern fiction, but elegant literature about what happens when human minds are forced to consider the hostility of the supernatural or the evil we're all capable of. Jackson isn't shy about making a reader meet her halfway, and she doesn't shy away from asking readers to think about difficult subjects. A very satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This book was first published in 1959 but can definitely hold its own in today's market. The characters leap right off the pages; they are fun, a little tragic, a little silly. I didn't find it to be a nail-biting horror tail. Instead, the story was more of an expedition into psychological suspense with an edge of paranormal horror. The characters pulled the story along, with Hill House at its center."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Exit?","review":"Four seekers have arrived at the rambling old pile known as Hill House; Dr. Montaguo, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of psychic phenomena; Theodora, his lovely and lighthearted assistant; Luke, the adventurous future inheritor of the estate; and Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman with a dark past. As they begin to cope with chilling, even horrifying occurrences beyond their control or understanding, they can't possibly know what lies ahead. For Hill House is gathering its powers - and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.Will the four visitors escape? All of them? Or just one? Is the house really a living thing or is everything just the imagination of the characters? From Dante to E.A.Poe to J.P.Sartre, writers and poets have imagined how it would be below us in \\"Inferno\\". Will Shirley Jackson give the final answer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inconceivably Scary","review":"I read most of this book sitting in an open cafe, with dozens of people around, in the bright sunshine of the day. And the whole time, I was scared out of my wits. I have never read anything more frightening. I hated to go home alone in spite of my big black dog who provides unrelenting protection. So be warned: if you scare easily, or are the nervous type, this book may be to powerful for you; on the other hand, if you are searching for the fright of your life, you have found it in this book.Several people are gathered in old Hill House, chosen for an experiment in ghost-hunting because each has experienced psychic phenomena before. Do these people bring out the ghosts and demons of Hill House? Are these just suggestible people given to delusions? Read closely to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book had me straight as a board","review":"I read it at night time over a couple of days, and after some time it had me checking the door to my bedroom. Or just laying in the bed, listening for sounds. A couple of times it even had me lying in the bed, many of my muscles unknowingly tensed, while reading. I think it did the scaring part quite well, at least for me. I've always had a vivid imagination when it comes to huge, empty places.So why do I only give it four stars? The ending was too abrupt. I would have liked a more gradual approach of Elanor becoming \\"something else\\", at last completely cut off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected a little bit more...","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading this classic story. I purchased it after reading a Stephen King analysis of it and was excited to read it. Overall, I thought it was very good but I expected just a bit more when it came to the build up of terror experienced while in the house. I thought the book started strong but lagged in the middle 2/5ths of the book, coming around at the end with a strong finish. The book hasa strange flow to the narrative given the point of view of the main character and a bit like Clockwork Orange or House of Leaves (though not as complicated) it takes a bit of time to get used to it. Overall, I would recommend reading it, especially as its a relatively short read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"There's too much detail in the small things to get really hooked in... I don't know if I'm goin to finish it"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 people go to a haunted house to spend the summer and......","review":"This book starts of really boring. It talks alot about the people in the book and about one person for almost the entire chapter.Around the 6th chapter it starts getting a little more interesting. At the end of the story something happens that you wouldn't expect to happen. If you like to read books that start out really boring and then hardly get any better then this would be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not-so-classic classic!","review":"This book has very little going for it. It was not exciting, not interesting, and definitly not haunting in any way. I was left wondering if some of the pages of my edition were missing. I felt that the story just plodded along with very little action. The book was like an outline for a really neat story. Maybe the film that is coming out this summer will have a lot of the substance that this one lacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book does not deserve all the accolades it has been given. The author provides a good outline to what could be an excellent story but unfortunately does not deliver the goods. Too many things in the book are left unexplained - and that's just unacceptable (and lazy) - and the ending of the book is a prime example of that. The book is also very light on action to the point that the story becomes a bore to read (I.e. There's nothing that makes you want to turn the page and keep reading). There are no surprises, plot twists or rewards for the reader in this story whatsoever.I don't know what genre this book belongs in but it is certainly not horror (sorry). It probably belongs in the romance section because that seemed to be one of the major themes in the book (that unfortunately the author doesn't deliver on either).If you are looking for a scary read (or even a creepy one)- look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as claimed","review":"I watched the movie \\"The Haunting\\", which is based on this book, and thought it was horrible. Afterwards, I decided to check the book out to see if it was better than the movie. The first part of the book drags on for so long! There aren't even that many scary parts in this book! I reccommend this book only for those who are patient enough to work their way through the dull parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was supposed to, 'scare' me?","review":"You have got to be kidding me. I found myself glancing at how many pages were left, thinking the suspense would get better.Nothing. It was very mediocre. I still haven't found a book to scare me just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't all it was cracked up to be","review":"People kept telling me that it was like 10 time scarier than the movie. Well, that was entirely inaccurate. The movie was much better. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have even bought the book. It wasn't even scary. I was severly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I just finished reading this book and all I can say is its the biggest piece of trash I've ever read. The suspense in it was great but Shirly Jackson could have gave it a better ending. Nell crashed her car into a tree which in my opinion made no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The haunting of Hill House","review":"I did not find this book very scary, I was only mildly amused by this book. If you want a really scary book, I still have not been able to top The Amityville Horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish!!!!","review":"I googled a list of the most scary books ever written, and this book came up as number 1. Much to my joy I managed to get myself a copy. I was bitterly disappointed!!! The only thing that is scary about this book is the fact that people actually like it. NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS!! My daughter has told me more scary stories and she is 4 years old. People are saying that this book is a masterpiece. What a joke. Don't waste your time picking up this book unless you feel like being bored to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite use of language, tone, and atmosphere.","review":"Jackson's masterful use of language makes this book remarkable. Her ability to control the pacing of the narrative, to make it both describe action and reveal the frantic interior life of Eleanor, holds the reader's attention. While it's not an out and out horror novel, with blood drenching the characters at every turn, it provides more than enough chills, and this story's method of frightening is much more disturbing than most, as the house seems to rise to meet its lover. Great stuff. Stephen King claims that this is one of only a handful of examples of truly great horror fiction. Good call by King."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the most frightening thriller of all time.","review":"The Haunting Of Hill House, by master of fear Shirley Jackson, weaves all elements of mystery, psychodrama, and thriller into one haunting question never answered. The atmosphere is thick in all of Ms. Jackson's writing, but Hill House stands above the others because once the thrill ride of a novel comes to its end, the reader is left with a huge knot of not knowing what took place because of outside forces and what happened inside the characters' minds. As with all superior classic pieces of this genre, we have the desire to tuck the book away, maybe wash our hands, and begin watching shadows from the corner of our eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD-NOT TOO SCARY","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started the book, but slowly I got so attached that I was unable to put it down. Definitely a good psycological thriller, and yet it doesn't scare you too much that you can't fall asleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ookily Spookily!","review":"A nice, compact read, with all the traditional ghost story elements we've come to expect. And surprisingly timeless, considering the book was first published in 1959, it could easily be set in any decade of the late 20th century.I liked the sensible female characters, Theodora and Eleanor. They weren't meek and mild, nor where they overtly assertive.A modern horror classic, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even close to being listed anywhere in horror/scary books","review":"I hate to say it but in this case the movie was scarier than the book and I could barely watch the movie with out laughing. I love horror movies and books, so was suprised when this book is so highly recommended. It was a huge let down if your looking for a good haunting story. I know that most people have read shirely jackson in school but this read should actually be read as a small child and then still would not frighten anyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this Book","review":"This book is very over-rated. The characters were underdeveloped and seemed really fake. The scary parts were very dull and the last half of the book was awful. Anyone who believes that this is a true horror classic should read the The Turn of the Screw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous.","review":"The point of a Shirley Jackson story is, \\"Look how _evil_ I can be! Isn't it _fun!\\"_No. Actually, it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I just don't get it.......","review":"I saw the original movie version of this story when I was about 10 years old and still remember that it scared the daylights out of me. I guess I was expecting the book to be as scary but I saw nothing scary or even interesting about this book. It had little substance and was too short to be a good read. Frankly not worth the money I paid for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This book was a waste of time. I expected a ghost story, a scary narrative. This was written as a 1940's british story, something you really have to be in the mood to read, and then, nothing happens! The synopsis stated that this is a subtle, psychological horror story, but it is so subtle, you don't know what is going on. Unless you are really into symbolism and looking for the 'deeper' meaning, save your money for a King or Koontz or Clark book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"It took me a whole week to finish this tiny 256 page book. Being a horror fan, I read all the reviews and figured I couldn't go wrong with this. Boy was I mistaken! 50% into the book and not a thing had happened. Nothing scary at all, just a bunch of background info and boring dialogue. Then after page 200, stuff finally started happening. But by then I was already tired of the book. Even worse, I couldn't stand the Eleanor/Nell character at all. I forced myself to keep reading this book in hopes that she would meet a nasty end.I don't need blood and gore to be entertained, but I do expect a novel that pops up on everyone's fav horror list to at least be scary. I would've finished this thing in a few hours if I cared to. Now I'm glad I didn't devote anymore time to it than I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"These other reviewers must have read somethig else","review":"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. I was hoping for something that would be genuinely disturbing, and this book just put me to sleep. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing thrilling about this thriller.","review":"\\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" is not a horror, mystery, or psychological thriller. It is a complete bore. I could not understand Eleanor at all. One minute she was confident about herself, the next minute self-conscious. She liked Theo and Luke, and then despised them; I don't understand why she felt so close to the house. There were no super natural experiences, aside from thumping on the door. I felt this story was a total waste of time, and petty. The movie \\"The Haunted\\" is very loosely based on this book (same character names, different circumstances, but much more interesting), and I suggest you see it instead. This book is nowhere near a classic. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice & creepy","review":"It starts out slow, but it builds & builds, & by the time the house gets ahold of dear Eleanor, it's too late to go back! I was chilled upon finishing the novel.Don't expect skeletons popping out of closets, and ghosties running rampant from page one- if you do, it will only lead you into dissappointment.Jackson's writing is literary & quite concerned with character development & it has an old-fashioned horror story appeal.The ending makes this short novel, retrospectively, all the more thrilling.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Haunted House Novel Ever","review":"Easily the best haunted house novel ever written. Hill House, with its history of one tragedy after another, is described by Mrs. Jackson as \\"insane\\". Even its angles and corners do not meet right. Its floors are infinitesimally off balance, making a sense of subconscious unease come upon anyone who enters. When a parapsychologist assembles a team to spend a few days in Hill House, no one foresees what is to come. Do not look for boogy men here, the menace is much less obvious than that. This is horror for the sensitive and intelligent reader. PS Unlike Ghost Story, feel free to see the original (not the 1990's remake) of the film version of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't write 'em like that anymore!","review":"This book is probably too tame for the Clive Barker \\"splatter-punk\\" crowd. It relies on subtlety and finesse to make you uneasy first, then scared, then terrified. This is NOT a \\"horror\\" novel, just a damn fine ghost story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant.","review":"Shirley Jackons classic is by far one of the best book i have ever read. She is able to purvey horror not through excessive gore but through mood, atmosphere, and inference. This novel is scary on a psychological level...your imagination runs away with you when you read it. The prose flows like a smooth liquid. When you put the book down you have to take a minute and recooperate. I highly reccommend it for anyone who loves haunted house stories or who has seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"The Haunting of Hill House is an excellent thriller/horror story. It can be enjoyed over and over again and one seems to find out more about Eleanor than first assumed by the second go around. I hope though that the new screen debut is better than the original. The original movie confused and annoyed me as I watched it because the other characters are not really given personalities. Eleanor's thoughts out-weighted every aspect of the movie and was very annoying. So hopefully the movie will focus on Eleanor but at the same time the power of Hill House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Creepy Horror","review":"If your sole experience of Shirley Jackson was in high school, where most of us were forced to read \\"The Lottery,\\" do yourself a favor and go buy this book -- now. She's more subtle than Clive Barker, less archaic and otherworldly than H.P. Lovecraft, but still tells a terrifying tale. Make sure you get the real thing, though, and not the adaptation from the recent movie remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but i like the remake movie better.","review":"I just saw the remake of The Haunting of Hill House and i loved it. The special effets were great and u really got into it. I decided to read the book since i liked the movie so much. There was a good plotline, but the scary parts just weren't suspenseful enough to get u going as much as the movie did. Well my point is it's a good book to read just to compare it to the movies but i don't think i'll be reading it again soon in my spare time."},{"rating":"2","title":"robert of bolingbrook,Il.","review":"I agree with Schuyler Johnson of Florida about the two missing scenes that could have deepen the plot. And for the many readers that projected Eleanor's disturbing psychotic addicting behavior- like the scene of the foursome sitting in the purple parlor and Eleanor \\"feeling a part of something\\" clearly states her lack of normality. I had seen the movie and read the book,and concour that they both are truely classics in their own genre. Shirley Jackson depicts the inner most fears to bring them out as a outward disfunctional rationality. Like every genius, Jackson has to be seen or read time and again to begin to understand her intent. As for the ending of the car crashing into the tree, I felt alittle let down at first. Realizing that this is what Eleanor thought she wanted until reality set in was to find a place of belonging.The house and Eleanor were attracted to each other as a love affair for the psychologically disfunctional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and left me with too many questions...","review":"Perhaps I am the type of reader who likes things spelled out for me. When I finished reading this book, there were too many questions left unanswered. What did Theodora see in the woods that made her scream? It never said (or I missed it). Why did Theodora and Luke act strangely towards Eleanor during their outing to the brook? Why was everyone in the house somewhat cruel and uncaring towards Eleanor, and how was she being foolish? And from chapter 9 on, I was completely lost. The very end was completely absurd. Maybe I just didn't get it. I certainly didn't get SOMETHING. On top of all of that, the book wasn't even remotely scary. Anyone who read this book and can answer some of these questions for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Please email me your responses."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Let Down of Hill House's Haunting","review":"Never in all my love affair with books have I admitted that a movie was better than the book. However, I was terribly disappointed with the Haunting of Hill House. Just when the story began to get interesting, it was all over. All the reviews I read say how Shirley Jackson is a master of her craft. However, I felt like the book was very tame and unimaginative compared to the movie. I realize that movie watchers and book lovers are usually worlds apart, but I was disappointed in the many avenues which could have been explored in this story and were left uninvestigated. Overall, I was left with the impression that I had read a book that was written for pre-teens or early adolescents. What a let down. I still can't believe that I actually prefer the movie version of this story. AAAAUUUUGGGGHHHH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum Hill House","review":"I've been waiting to get this book on Kindle for ages, and now that I've finished it, I'm returning it. **SPOILER ALERT** The story starts off well enough , but the main character, Eleanor, is such a head case with her constant annoying babbling and whining , that by the end of the story, I'm rooting for Hill House to do her in! I do, however, strongly recommend the 1962 Robert Wise film of this book, which took a mediocre story and turned it into one of the scariest films ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The front cover of this book says, \\" Makes your blood chill and your scalp prickle....... Well, I must have read a different book. There was nothing scary about it. For a while I thought I was reading a comedy. The dialogue was simple and silly.

As far as I'm concerned this was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snoozer","review":"This book was silly, boring and childish.

Is there some kind of mass hypnosis going on that accounts for the feelings of horror and pleasure among the readers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies are usually worse, Not in this case....","review":"Obviosly after reading the book, you must realize that the author had no Idea how to write. The climax of the book was nothing compared to modern novelists. Having all discriptions lead up to nothing. It was worthless to read. It discribed every little detail. The detail ended in nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail to Queen Shirley!","review":"Lyrical, poetic....void of blood and gore, but yet, terrifying. Shirley Jackson understood the human psyche the way few people do. She knew what it was like to be on the outside looking in....and through the character of Nell, she let us all know. Such a thin line between the sensible and the absurd....the things that go bump in the night, and the comfort and security the daylight hours bring...the desire to belong and to leave your mark on the this world, and perhaps the next. Shirley Jackson did just that in this superbly crafted thriller. It should be used as a textbook for all would-be writers who wish to excel at their craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting of Hill House book","review":"This was a good book.

It's definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think of this book","review":"THIS book is what Stephen King based his Rose Red TV movie on.I found this book a BIT frightening but more suspenseful. I really liked it and feel it is a book all Sci Fi and Horror loving people should read.IF I find any faults in it at all it is only that the movie was better as the movie had an ending and the book just seemed to close without putting a finishing touch on itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated book imaginable","review":"Like many others, the new release of \\"The Haunting\\" prompted me to buy the book. I found the book to be so boring that I haven't made an effort to see the movie. The book was a complete waste of time. None of the characters are sympathetic, so as a reader, I didn't care what happened to any of them (which was basically nothing). The female characters have such a loose grip on reality to begin with that I didn't find the protagonist's mental breakdown to be surprising or frightening in any way. I recommend reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is truly the biggest waste of time reading a book I have ever spent! I kept waiting for something to happen, that never did. Pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Haunting of Hill House","review":"The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson is brilliant masterpiece. There are superb descriptions of the characters, a lot of suspense, and enough imagery to draw readers into a captivating world. Shirley Jackson writes about four skeptics staying at the legendary Hills Dale House or Hill House. Paranormal activity starts happening, and each of them says it is hoax. If you want to find out more, I suggest you get this book. If you like ghost stories, then you love this book. People who like stories that are mysterious, chilling, and \\"wet your pants\\" scary will adore this book. Dracula, Frankenstein, and Jack the Ripper have all read this book from beyond the grave and have given it four claws up. It is a written thriller for the living, the dead, and anything in between. If you have read this review, then you should get this book. It is to die and be resurrected for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to agree with the reader from San Jose, CA. Where did Jackson come up with that dialogue? I found it to be totally unbelievable. If the characters had been real and honest with each other instead of conjuring up false realities about themselves, and had actually connected in some way, the book would have been far more frightening. The scary scenes in the book were scary, yes, but the poor dialogue and character development hindered my enjoyment of the book as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but definately see the 1963 Movie....","review":"I for one saw the 1963 movie far before I read the book. While its rarely the case, I felt the movie edged the book in terror and character developement. I havn't seen it mentioned, but does anyone else see a similarity between this book (and movie) and Richard Matheson's Legend of Hell House? Its obvious Mr. Matheson heavily copied the style and scenario of this book (and later the movie Legend of Hell House which was decent in its day as well). I will say that if you enjoyed this book, Read Matheson's as he did it much better despite the obvious similarities."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS BEST YET!","review":"I'm a big fan of blues and have always liked Studebaker John's music. To be equally adept at guitar, harp, singing, and writing is no small feat, but he always seems to pull it off. \\"Self Made Man\\" is his best CD to date, full of great tunes. His guitar playing seems to have been raised to a new level here. It is just outstanding. His band just chugs right along with him.My only complaint is I had to special order the disc. His record company should get more of them out there. Buy it, believe me you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She has amazing acoustic stuff","review":"All these were originally released electric, but now she's doing them with just her voice and an acoustic guitar. She sounds real good this way, and it's like hearing these all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Acoustic CD","review":"This EP was originally a Target exlusive. So, it's quite dumb how people are selling this for 200 dollars! That's WAY too much. I have this album, that I got here on amazon for 20 dollars. To who ever's reading this-- don't buy the album for 200 bucks. It's not worth it. The songs are okay, they're just live-- and there isn't a booklet. It's just a piece of thin paper with the picture you see on this page. So, please, don't feel urged to purchase this EP. If you want to hear live songs from Avril, I'm sure you could find them on the internet. There are many good Avril fan sites-- just look there! I'm a HUGE Avril fan, but this EP isn't that amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavigne","review":"Excellent Album! Singing to an acoustic guitar really brings out the best in her voice.

The item came very well packaged and you can tell it is very well made too!It's going to make my life a lot easier and for that...5 stars all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Sarah movie","review":"As the story opens, we see Prince Andrew having fun, fun, fun as a royal playboy while commoner Sarah Ferguson parties it up with her crowd. They meet and fall in love, promising to never change. Once they're married, however, reality sets in; the two have nothing in common and Fergie's low-class cavorting proves to be an insurmountable embarrassment.The two leads look something like Andrew and Sarah, but the rest of the cast look nothing like their famous counterparts. This is a low-budget movie that barely skims the main events - they meet, marry, have kids, separate - but it offers no character development or details \\"behind palace doors.\\" It's mostly about the dour palace staffers who disapproved of Sarah from the start. This is an unsympathetic story that makes her out to be a loud-mouthed floozie. Who knows what she really was or is? Cheaply-made and forgettable exploitation flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A film that deserves to be redone","review":"This movie is based on the breakdown of Andrew and Sarah's marriagei would have like to have seen more about the friend ship between the princess and the Duchess. The most irriatating thing about this film was that it had a palace insider narrating the the film.The costumes were aweful and the charatcer they had for Dianawas laughable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omagh","review":"I remember hearing about this bombing, but was more interested in the peace process that was going forward at the time. Everyone knew that this bomb that killed dozens of people was done by a bunch of yahoo spinoffs from the IRA who didn't want the war to end. What I didn't know is what happened afterwards, and who knew the bomb was going to be planted in Omagh. I found that very interesting, and so will you if you watch this movie. VERY GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"WOW\\"","review":"An \\"awesome\\" depiction of a very difficult event, it left me just saying \\"WOW\\" when the film ended. Good things can come from tragedy when decent people put aside their prejudices, and work together for a common goal, and this film depicts this concept beautifully. The acting was great, but have to highlight Brenda Fricker's performance -- one scene that defines the essence of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Realistic","review":"Omagh is a remarkable film that so realistically portrays the events surrounding the Omagh bombing that you can forget these people are actors. The tension that builds up to the actual attack is gripping and the reactions of the family members of the victims may be the most haunting images in the movie. As those who survived begin to ask tough questions of the authorities and form a group seeking justice against the Real IRA who committed the attack, Gerard McSorley gives the most credible and understated performance imaginable as the grieved father of a murdered son.I have rarely seen a movie that captures a tragic historical episode with as much realism and class. A truly great film with some incredibly talented acting and directing. As a record of the suffering caused by an act of terrorism it has no equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps Keep Kitty's Teeth Clean!","review":"I brush my cat's teeth every day using this set. I never had to use the finger brush, my cat just got used to the brush pretty quickly.

Very disappointed in the deceptive label. What's the point of doing this to customers only to lose their repeat business upon discovery? Apparently they're more interested in first time buyers who dont read reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLA, what more to say?","review":"for the most part CLA is CLA. I have read, CLA can come from many different places, from sunflower seeds or milk, etc. I also read some CLA is more effective than others but I find it hard to believe the source of CLA really matters. I just look for the most CLA per serving, and have seen good results. I like this brand because they have ALOT of CLA pills per bottle, as I take 3-5 a day, so I want it to last a while. because there are 180 per bottle, and the bottle is relatively cheap for that ammount compared to other brands is why I went with these. This is my second bottle of this brand, and I have no complaints. I have tried other brands, but those bottles disapear faster than harry houdini. This is good CLA, just make sure you take the 3000-4000mg a day needed to see results and try to spread it out across 2-3 servings a day, not all at once, and you should be in good shape :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate them.","review":"I have never had problems with any supplements except for this one. They are positively horrible. From the minute I swallow them (with a full glass of water!) they \\"burp back\\" over and over and over again.

WAY too heavy to try to ship back.. so i am going to try and use some black paint to cover up the ugly mess.... Also, some weird marks on it..

Very sturdy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading Credit","review":"I found it very misleading to have the main credit of this season to be Barbara Anderson,who according to internet movie database only appeared during 1972 in 7 episodes.Surely Peter Graves or Leonard Nimoy should be given top credits for the 4th season?. This has been long awaited by Nimoy fans and contains some really great episodes ..highly recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Impossible Season 4","review":"I was a fan of Mission Impossible when it originally aired.The Season four set is great, with Leonard Nimoy from \\"StarTrek\\" taking the place of the departing Martin Landau as themagician and master of disguise.

I see why the other brands are popular. I only used it off and on for a year. The blade is still sharp EXCEPT in the one space needed to cut the wire. When you look closely it has a small chip so it wont cut wires anymore. I know two other people with the same tool, both of their springs broke rendering their tool unusable. I also found out it's hard to buy replacement blades. The type of blade this tool uses isn't sold at your local stores. An online replacement plus shipping was half the cost of the tool. It is comfortable to hold and use, and the blades hold well on the back, but overall it's definitely not for long term or professional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique version of Schubert's Sonata","review":"I loved this recording of Schubert's ghostly Sonata in A-minor by Kissin. I've personally seen Kissin play this Schubert sonata in concert. It was a fantastic performance then, and it is spectacularly perserved here in this CD. In the late Haydn sonata, Kissin's pianistic virtuosity is showcased in the final movement of this great sonata. This is one of the best Kissin recordings for Sony Classical to date. If you like Schubert, then get this CD today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster!","review":"This product is terrible, honestly, don't waste your money buying this item. After a month it doesn't work properly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaslight is a Hit!","review":"I bought Bastard Life or Clarity out of curiosity. But, I bought Gaslight because I am now a Tofog fan. This album is much more polished than the last one.The band is definitely a group of accomplished musicians and serious about what they do. There is much more mature subject matter here. I would surely recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaslight","review":"Wow what a tremendous amount of energy and talent on the one album. I am a huge TOFOG fan and am really happy with this album. There is a couple of songs that really stop me in my tracks.....Nowhere, Eternity & Wendy. Russell & the guys really have some songwriting talent. Keep it up guys. I highly recommend a listen to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaslight Burns Up the Place","review":"I ordered this from an Aussie store a good while back. I originally heard about TOFOG in 2000 over Napster. I heard two tunes and was hooked. The Gaslight Album like all their music is original, captivating, and bloody excellent music. Each tune is different, and tells its own story. Rock, Country, Folk, Rap it depends which track you listen to what their sound is. Excellent Guitar too. Wish they had a bonus track of the guys just jamming too. The strongest songs for me are Circus, Nowhere, David and Wendy. They get my blood flowing, my heart pounding and awakes the soul.Its music as it should be (With a beer).PURE nonconformist Originalality. :-) A hidden treasure.Can't wait for the opportunity to see the guys live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it","review":"Okay, I origanally started listening to TOFOG after I saw Crowe in The Insider. But, I have been more than satisfied listening to their music. In many ways, I respect the band members more than Russell because of their dedication and willingness to work with him and his crazy schedule. The beat of this new album is the best yet. The combination of guitar, drums, and especially the trumpet make a great sound! I really enjoy running to this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"\\"Facing Athens\\" has the feel of sour grapes: much to do with the author's experiences and interpretations and little to do with the modern city. Certainly no major metropolis is without its share of problems, but the thoughtful reader requires something beyond anecdotal evidence in support of a pre-determined agenda. I, for one, got the impression that the book was an angry \\"letter\\" to the author's estranged father. All well and good for a diary, but not for a book that purports to be an expose of a major European city. It is telling that not one footnote or authoritative source may found in its pages. For those among us seeking poetry or lyrical writing, I recommend Pablo Neruda for the former (five stars) and Nikos Kazantzakis for the latter (five stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Greek tragedy in writing...","review":"As someone who visits Athens regularly and sees the problems the city faces, I was shocked at how little the author did to try and understand why the city is as it is and found it amusing that the authour was happy to criticise but never attaempted to give a better way of doing things. I was even more amazed that it pointed to none of the city's virtues. It seems as if the sorry authour had determined what he was going to write on the flight over and then went actively looking for it while there. As some of the other reviewers rightly said, it seems like a bitter man's attempt at getting back at his father or fighting his inner demons. A truly awful attempt at journalistic writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Facing My Family History","review":"I am in complete agreement with the negative reviews here. This book could be about ANY large urban area. This author doesn't need a trip to his place of birth. He needs years of therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"Outsiders\\" Inside Look at Athens","review":"While it might seem that the book could be a bit dated in light of the 8+ years that have passed since the 2004 Olympics, this book speaks volumes about the Athens of today with it sprawling landscape, political corruption, and undercurrent of racism toward the rapid inflict illegal immigrants. But being one who calls Athens \\"home\\", the author speaks with a sensitivity that no mere travel writer can replicate. He is not harsh in his criticism, only honest -as one might be with one's own family. Insightful & a quick, enjoyable & thought-provoking read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointing","review":"If the prospective reader of this book is looking for an Athens city guide ahead of the Olympic games, he or she will be disappointed. This book is of such a personal nature that it should have been classified as either a memoir, or as a psychological profile of the author. As one who has visited Athens, I recognize some of its flaws, but see none of its virtues in this book. The negativity of the author is simply overwhelming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A critical look at modern-day Athens","review":"Perhaps better named Confronting Athens, this is the author's highly personal exploration of his native city 20 years after his emigration to the US. The book is charged with subdued emotions which find their outlet in a critical look at the many less-than-rosy aspects of Greece's capitol city: corruption, unchecked development, pollution, discrimination... all of which are interspersed with short remembrances from the author's modest childhood. If you want a glossy description of Athens' amazing historical legacy and tourist destinations, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Important","review":"To dismiss this powerful and beautifully written book as too critical or negative is to avert one's eyes from children sleeping on the ground, patients at the mercy of corrupt doctors, and immigrants facing exploitation and discrimination. If readers care about human suffering, or if they simply love Greece, they can't but appreciate the moving story that Sarrinikolaou tells. If we dismiss such stories because they're too troubling to us, or because such problems also exist elsewhere, we dismiss the city itself, failing to look at it carefully and to engage it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Mind, Open Heart","review":"In prose that is as graceful as it is powerful, this book tells a gripping story of Athens. Anyone who is in touch with Greek culture -- new developments in art, literature, and film -- will find familiar themes: The shock from the new immigrants, the polarization of the city into affluent suburbs and a decaying center, and the struggle of so many people to make a living. But in this book, the stuff of everyday life is narrated with a rare eloquence and sensitivity. I loved this book because it enriched my understanding of a city I treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Long Last! The Singles!","review":"Ella recorded a lot of singles during her Verve years and many ofthem were never even on LP so this compilation is most welcome.Her first recordings for the label were singles with Buddy Bregmanconducting.

These singles are swingin.' No they are obviosly not on the same level as her Songbooks or concept albums, but they are very good for being attempt at commercial hits, though there are few standards, Ella was in prime voice here, and the orchestra's taht back her up are the top names.

Gary Patterson - nothing more.","review":"I would never waste my own money on such mindless blather. I received it is as a gift from a well meaning friend who knows I am a Beatles officianado and thoutht I might enjoy it. First, it is just a useless rehash of an urban-legend / supposed conspiracy that's long since been accepted to be total rubish. So, who cares? I suppose there may be some who still do but I am certainly not among them. Secondly, it is fraught with inaccuracies - many of which are detailed in other reviews on this site. The logic throughout the book follows the original disinformational logic used during the initial \\"revelations\\". ie: A cat has 4 legs and a tail. A horse has 4 legs and a tail. Therefore, a cat is a horse. DUH! A recommended read only for the most addicted Beatle historians or those who have absolutely no life and all the time in the world to live it. I can only justtify my own time spent reading as Taking One for the Team. Please learn from my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHODDY, POORLY RESEARCHED, INCOMPLETE","review":"This book is shallow in its research, without even bothering to dig up the real story by conducting hours of interviews with the people involved in the \\"Paul-Is-Dead\\" rumor. Even the \\"quiz\\" at the top of this page is rife with errors---the title of the book, THE WALRUS WAS PAUL, refers specifically to the song \\"Glass Onion\\" (of which it is a key line), not \\"I Am the Walrus\\".

It may be of some use to cold war history buffs but it will put off the average reader. Craven's main theme is how great, resourceful, brillant Craven is - especially when compared to everyone else in the Navy and the government. He settles every old score he ever had in his career. All of what he states in this book may be true. But it will leave you with a sour taste in you mouth and make you pity is poor wife and co-workers. Dr. Craven would have been much better advised to have employed a ghostwriter to redo his original script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat interesting, but dull.","review":"I bought the book after reading \\"Blind Man's Bluff\\". In the reviews, I perceived the book to be a sequel with even a little more detail. I was disappointed.Granted, I'm more action oriented than people oriented, but this seemed to be a book about the people \\"behind the scene\\". If you were involved, I'm sure it would be fascinating to discover the personalities and decision process behind the cold war submarine activity. I was looking for more detail on the activity. What the author told me was what he could not tell me and his political agenda. Unfortunately, that was not what I had hoped for.While interesting, I found the \\"Silent War\\" to be a slow read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Silent War ... The Story of J.P. Craven","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. Made it almost through Chapter 2 and decided I was done. This book is more about J.P. Craven than it is about the Cold War and the courageous and commendable service that was provided by the Navy's Silent Service. If you want to know about how Craven saved the world, this is the book for you otherwise it is a great disappointment. Recommend reading (or re-reading) Blind Man's Bluff before opening this autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave Cold Warrior","review":"A very interesting read. Craven comes across as both a Patriot, and at the same time, someone committed to the cause of Peace through Strength. It is fortunate that people like Craven, who understand and believe in MAD, prevailed over the Edward Teller's of the world. We can only hope that this book, and the victory in the Cold War, are considered when deciding whether or not to build a wasteful, worthless SDI system.I also found quite interesting, the revelations about Sealab and the \\"Red September\\". This is new, and quite interesting, information."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This is a dreadful book. Besides being a dull read the author seems to be on a big ego trip and spends more time telling us how important he is than explaining interesting events and technical matters. Over and over again, I wanted to learn more about incidents and capabilities that the author mentions. Instead, we get a steady stream of pathetic excuses about not being able to reveal national security matters and partial explanations about things which could have made the book a much more interesting one. It's all about Craven, so if you like books which are about events and details go pick up Blind Man's Bluff instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better stuff out there...","review":"OK, so it's a biography, not a history book or novel. However, that's not an excuse for shameless self-congratulation. The \\"good stuff\\" in this book is due to the subject material itself, not how its presented. There are better works on this subject. And to top it all off, the numerous grammatical errors point to the less than professional nature of this book. I expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO BLUFF - GOOD STUFF","review":"Having been directly involved in the same world as John Craven, I must say this was an excellent summary of the Special Projects activities in the 50's,60's and 70's. I actually learned some \\"new\\" information and found the \\"rogue\\" sub portion to be more than a little scarey. I also read Sontag's book and Craven certainly provides a much more FACTUAL picture, being an insider in the greater submarine community. Sontag had to snatch snippets of facts as they were revealed to her and the NYT staff and consequently, much of that work was highly subjective. Craven did a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the hell is that picture of?","review":"I've had this album for years and every time I see it I wonder what I am looking at?

Martin's series, for example--contain scenes and plot twists that are so unexpected and clever that the author's talent and imagination amaze the reader. The first book in this series--The Bone Doll's Twin--was full of promise, especially regarding the stresses and potential conflicts to a woman who learns (but does not easily accept) that she is temporarily living inside the skin of a man. Unfortunately, the second volume just has nothing interesting or surprizing to offer. All the main characters think, act, and do precisely what you'd expect (except for Korin, the one character on whom the reader cannot get a solid fix). It's as if the author, although she writes well enough, does not have the skill to develop the interesting plot potentials she created. Maybe a co-author would be helpful for volume three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing as usual","review":"Flewelling's work has been a personal favorite since I discoved The Bone Doll's Twin last year.

I loved every moment. A very, very good book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I have to admit that, while I had a hard time getting into The Bone Doll's Twin, I continued with the series and have quite enjoyed this second volume. The world is more fleshed out and the characters well developed. The book is well detailed and the events written in a way that allows readers to follow certain complex aspects of the series without becoming confused.I must remind fellow readers that the Tamir series is *not* the Nightrunner series and that while there are certain characters who are mentioned in the NR books which come into play in the Tamir Trilogy, the books themselves should not be compared to the NR series. The new series is beautifully written and deserves a reader's full attention, not to be compared with the Seregil/Alec series.Enjoy the books for themselves. They make an interesting historical back drop to the events in the NR series, but are great in their own right, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"Flewelling is always outstanding, but this book especially shines--it is perhaps her finest yet. As a continuation of The Bone Doll's Twin, Hidden Warrior deepens the themes of gender and identity which make this trilogy especially poignant. Flewelling's expert characterizations always make for a rich read, and this book also serves as the genesis for certain events in her Nightrunner series. Highly recommended, as is all the work by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this trilogy","review":"I loved the Nightrunner books by Flewelling and I wanted to like this new trilogy as well but after reading Bone Doll's Twin and Hidden Warrior I've got to come to the conclusion that you just can't like all of an author's work.While Flewelling still brings her signature style and storytelling ability to these books, compared to the Nightrunner characters I find the characters in the Tamir trilogy unoriginal and stereotypical. The plot seems to be loosing it's center and rambling and it just doesn't hold my attention the way the Nightrunner books did.I really hope that Flewelling will finish up this trilogy and go back to the characters she drew me into her world with in the first place. Somebody let me know when the Nightrunners are back."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRRING","review":"I didn't read the first book in the series and after the first chapter of Hidden Warrior felt I didn't need to.The book just went on and on and on and on and on as if she knew she didn't have enough material to do a trilogy but had agreed to so she dragged in everything she could think of and then some. Every fantasy cliche one could think of is in the book. Her one original idea--the basic premise of a girl living in a boy's body--after a while didn't ring true.I have read and liked Lynn Flewelling for years. Was sorely disappointed in this book. What a waste of talent.

This album has a couple of really strong cuts, especially tracks one and three, but most of the other tunes have a sameness to them.

For some reason, it makes me think of Jack Johnson's music, but that description is not quite accurate. I'd say the album is good, but I am not sure how to categorize it. Country? Alternative?

I feel bad doing it, but in this case feel I must. I am a nurse and taking blood pressures is a part of my everday life. I bought this with the idea that I would make it a little easier on my patients, without them having to feel that tight grip around their arm. Well, there is a reason for that tight grip,you get an accurate reading that way. I had all the best intentions in buying this product. But it's readings are just plain inaccurate. If you suffer from hypertension(high blood pressure) this product could be dangerous, as it may not be truelly letting you know that your blood pressure has elevated. It runs way below what a true blood pressure runs. Omron makes great products, I would recommend one of their arm cuff blood pressure machines, you will get a much more accurate reading.

Easy to use, too-not like many others. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but inaccurate","review":"I purchased this recently. Last week I took it to my doctor's office to compare with the readings that the doctor and nurse obtained with a traditional cuff. We did four or five comparisons, and the wrist BP monitor was not even in the same ballpark. It wasn't consistently high or low, just erratic.My doctor recommends an arm cuff over any wrist monitor, not just this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"The convenience counts!","review":"I've read the reviews that question this product's accuracy, and I don't have any scientific data to argue one way or the other, but to me it seems pretty accurate and consistent with the numbers I get with the arm cuff-rubber tube-hand pump-solenoid wire models. The big difference is convenience; this one doesn't require all that equipment to deal with, and it stores away in a plastic case about a fifth the size of my previous monitor. Because it's so compact, convenient, and easy to use, it stays out on my desk and, therefore, gets used a lot more often. In medical terms, that's got to count for something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly innacurate","review":"This unit is convenient and easy to use.

I will send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Inaccurate","review":"I am a nurse and thought these would be easier to use. Well, it is easy to use but the readings are way off. I would never recommend this model. I also agree with the other poster an upper arm is the best way to take a BP. This is nothing to fool around with. This unit reads very low.

I've never had a juicer before that couldn't handle one glass of carrot juice before it needs to be cleaned.

I am still glad I bought this CD! \\"Lusty\\" and \\"Zero\\" are both great songs, and so is the rest of the album, This cd is full of compelling vocals and great beats. Lamb seems to get compared to everyone from \\"Olive\\" to \\"Baxter\\" to \\"Spicehouse\\" to \\"Hooverphonic\\". I think Lamb are totally unique and have no connection to Anyone but themselves. Overall this album is a great mix of drum n bass with a bit of jazz, some trip hop and a beautiful voice. A great addition to any modern music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"There are two songs on this album, which you'll be able to listen to, even after some weeks have passed and you played it every day: - Lusty (of course) and - GoreckiThe other songs are poor, because you just can't listen to this very weak beat, even though the lyrics sung with a really beautiful voice will make you listen to the tracks in the first days.If you have enough money and you are willing to buy a whole album because of one or two good tracks, I recommend \\"Lamb\\", but, as for \\"poor\\" students like myself, I wouldn't (especially the CD-version, vinyl rules)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!!!","review":"Having bought this album with no previous knowledge of the band I was surprised to find how good it was and it is now one of my favourites even though I have owned it for only a few weeks.Best tracks are Lusty, Cotton Wool and Gorecki.

Pretty powerful stuff, albeit minimalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phat beats all over the place.","review":"Fantastic drum programming, great vocals. Good introduction into the world of Drum and Bass. Offers up proof of just what the gerne is capable of. Sophisticated and sexy. The final track is outstanding. The entire CD qualifies as a classic. The vocals are moody and suggestive. Backdrop them over an at times frantic drum machine with a trippy synth and you've got the gist of the formula here. It bloody well works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and strangly different.. recommended.","review":"i was first introduced to lamb by a tvdoc, i was so impressed i bought fear of force(their second album) and was hooked from then on. it's now been 2 months after i bought their debut, and this is yet so much better, even more than i dared have hoped for. checkout \\"zero\\": this would be the most beautiful song i ever heard. just some guitars and strings and lou's fragile voice. quite beautiful. worth alone buying the album for and yet there are tracks like \\"gorecki\\" and \\"god bless\\" that make it a classic.. this a very powerful album indeed. get this if you like strongly songbased elektronic music (like bjork perhaps), but also if you your into listening to something you won't hear anywhere else (but from your very own cdplayer ;)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has it's moments, but is missing the magic.","review":"There are lots of good things about this disc: nice groves, hipster vocals reminiscent of Bjork, cool sounds, some deep bass. Despite all it has going for it, at the end of the day Lamb just doesn't deliver the goods. The sound ideas and solid execution need some sizzle to seal the deal. It just isn't there. In this genre, I'll stick with Portishead and Bjork. (Really rates 2.5 stars, but I'm forced to choose between 2 and 3.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjork fan?

Ouch! Impulse buying strikes out again. There is nothing on this CD to set it apart from anything. It is a mediocre blend of many popular styles without bowing to any. The best word I have is- MUNDANE. Absoutely safe and devoid of talent or adventure. ... It turns out that the song I had heard was a remix."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't good","review":"This music isn't good. I'm not saying that beacuse it's strange; I dig stuff a lot stranger. I'm not saying it because I don't like the genre; I like Portishead and Goldfrapp. I'm just saying it because this music has nothing too it. There are good moments, but the songs here lack direction. Some genres can get away with that. This one can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are /so/ overrated.","review":"Lou is an OK singer, for a pop music group, I suppose, but her voice is nowhere even close to the standard that the hype makes out. Sheesh, guys, the way people fawn over Lamb, you'd think that she was the next Yvonne Kenny or something.I reckon if it wasn't for their track \\"Gorecki\\", then these guys would never have ever been noticed, and rightly so, IMNSHO.

This CD features a much more modern edge, but her voice is still enchanting as ever. Most of the songs have a slow pace, which I think allows her voice to soar beautifully through the heartfelt lyrics (most of which she wrote herself). She seems to have fallen away a bit from her traditional ballads, but the resulting sound and feel have not altered. If you have enjoyed Karan Casey's previous solo albums, I strongly encourage you to add this to your collection. If this will be your first then I assure you that you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing the Sun by Karen Casey","review":"This album had quite a different mood from the rest of her albums.

I had nightmares for over a year and my parents actually complained to the library about its cataloging in the chilsren's section once they reviewed the book. The 1 star rating does not relate to the book's content but to its publisher's classification as children's literature. It is a horror novel, plain and simple.

It reminds me of the songs on his older CDs that I'd always skip like \\"What an Idiot He Is\\" and \\"Whiz Kids,\\" but even those have more charm than this. In my opinion, the only songs worth hearing on this album are \\"To America We Go\\" and \\"This is My Father,\\" and neither or them are anything to write home about.This album isn't necessarily bad, it just lacks virtually all of the redeeming qualities that were in his other experimental/fusion endeavors.

From fast, rocking instrumentals (on the former CD) to songs where any instruments take a back seat to singing (on the latter). The first song on the CD starts off well, but then Ashley (?) starts singing...it's not that his voice is particularly bad, but the vocal tune just doesn't seem to go with the music the instruments are playing. As for the rest of the songs...well, I guess he did say he wanted to make a pop album. The vocals are the main focus -- vocals aren't what drew me to Ashley MacIsaac's music, and with this CD as an example, they won't keep me listening, either, unfortunately.

We all know he can play the fiddle but you wouldn't know it from most of this album. Seems like he is just trying to prove he can play fast. Everything sounds the same. No variety. No inspiration.

So far, all have been performed and recorded well, except this one which was recorded with a too-close perspective and insufficient acoustic environment - particularly the soloists who might as well not even be in the same acoustic space as the orchestra and chorus. The otherwise fine performance is marred by a recording that strives for clarity over ambiance.Please do not be put off by my comments about the technical quality, this is a very good performance, and Symphony No. 1 is a good introduction to Vaughn Williams for those not familiar with his work.Update:I found I enjoyed this recording more every time I played it.

I talked to Linksys and they said that I was pretty much on my own if I have no warranty and that they couldn't fix it if the warranty expired. There goes my money!... People.. don't waste your money on anything over $... I think I'm gonna purchase a cheap hub and link up that way rather than spend anymore money waiting for the warranty to expire before the thing goes out again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Important Tracks","review":"I bought this CD for one song.

The two soundtracks are great but there's a lot of chaff mixed in (The RZA's Ode to O'Ren???) The intro music in the movie when Uma hacks off Sophie's arm in the Inn of BLue Leaves is also missing.But overall the album is good and it's impressive the Tarantino was able to do so well with so many newly-scored songs (\\"Battle without honor or humanity\\" is excellent) along with his usual cadre of old and underappreciated pieces from radio and movies (Zamophir!? How the hell did he make Zamphir, Master of the Pan Flute, fit so damn nicely into the movie and soundtrack?).Well worth a purchase, along with Vol. 2.Peter Ward"},{"rating":"2","title":"A simplified review","review":"The soundtracks of the Kill Bill series succeed in what Tarantino attempted to accomplish: A mix of the Samurai Epic and the Spaghetti Western.The wide variety of sound brought forth on this platter will at the very least put a grin on your face. Its definitely a special mixture that ranges from the hyper get-in-your-head anthems of the 5's, 6's, 7's and 8's to the Karate Kid style pan flute of Zamfir. As everyone is entitled to a favorite, mine is the opening theme sung by Nancy Sinatra. Its a hauting, somber tune that I find myself singing out of the clear blue.A definite for lovers of Tarantino's unique mix of the senses.

Russell Thorndyke's story is as fresh on second reading now as it was then. Unfortuately, the slovenly copy editing exhibited by this Wildside Mystery Classics edition detracts from the excellence of the story.

(Which was complete, unlike, evidently, some of the paper versions reviewed here.) It is darker than the Disney version, and Syn is often quite violent here. That's fine, and I'm not surprised that Disney cleaned up the character a bit. But the prose is rather weak, and instead of exploring the smuggling, the author often went off on several unimportant tangents and curious subplots.I made the mistake of reading reviews before I had finished the novel. No thanks to reviewer Thomas Moody for giving away the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure Novel","review":"My first read from Thorndyke and it was good time spent. If you saw the movie offering from Disney you feel right at home in the \\"marsh\\" reading this book. If you didn't then you will want to see the movie after reading the book. My only disppointment was the ending and maybe that was Thorndyke's intent because when you hit the last page there were a lot of unanswered questions and incomplete activities by the characters. Therefore based on my own conclusions I have ordered another book on Dr. Syn to see if there is a connection. I sure hope so because I want to find out how it ends, if ever.

IN retrospect, we could have dispensed with the Blue Guide, and soloed with the Rough Guide. Rough Guide's Highland volume provided us with a basic reality check early on: we would not be able to see as much as we wanted, and would have to make trade offs. Rough Guide made those trade offs far easier. In each geographically based section, they provided a list of the area's key points to hit. (Blue Guide has a hierarchy also, but it's not nearly so easy to tap into.) And while some of Rough Guide's advice on accommodations and restaurants may go out of date, it was nice to have that information (Blue Guide chooses not to cover these aspects).We knew little or nothing about the Highlands a few weeks ago... Rough Guide helped us have a very good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to get there?","review":"This book was thorough, but strangely unhelpful. Many regions/towns are listed, but with no depth. Each entry tells geography, and interesting things to see, but no idea of how to get there, where to stay. The main advice for each town: call the travel office. There are no recommendations for the \\"must see\\" vs. not that interesting. If I had a teleporter and knew I wanted to see Loch Ness, this would be useful book. Otherwise, it is not helpful for planning a trip to the Highlands. And I can't imagine taking it with me when I go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent period novel","review":"I enjoy the St. Germain novles not just for the vampire element, which is actually quite small, or the romance, which is there but understated. The one thing that draws me again and again to this series is the level of historical detail and color that Yarbro brings to the table. Roman Dusk is no exception.Yarbro brings the declining phase of the Roman Empire to life in this book, showing how waste and bureaucratic excess has drained the blood of the Empire more than anything St. Germain would ever do. It is fascinating how St. Germain is actually the most human subject in the book, and the living are the true vampires. This novel is a great read for those who enjoy history and would like to vicariously feel what life in Rome would have been like as it started its slow decline into chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner for Yarbro","review":"Like the many fans of St. Germain, I await the latest installment in the history of his long un-life with anticipation. Roman Dusk is no disappointment. The author seems particularly at home in ancient Rome and the story is well paced and fascinating.One new element in this chapter of St. Germain's story is the glossary that clarifies certain terms and city names used in the book. It's an excellent addition. Reading some earlier novels I puzzled over some of the terms used, though my enjoyment was little diminished.Now the wait begins for the next story of St. Germain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best historial fiction","review":"I bought this book because I love historical fiction and love to read about ancient Rome. This was just not a good read. The conversations the characters have with each other take five to six paragraphs to get to the point (one even went on for two pages before the one character asked the question he had to ask). There are several letters, pretty much one every chapter, which gets alittle annoying as they are from different people but all have the same tone. No one does correspondence better than Colleen McCullough; when she writes for Pompey you can practically hear him talking. I'm not much into the vampire thing, but I thought this would be interesting because the main character has been un-dead for I believe two thousand years, and finding him in Roman times seemed like it would be entertaining. But the author never tells about him \\"feeding\\", and other vampire-like things.

While the 2002 series doesn't differ too much from its predecessors, Publisher includes, what I think to be, a very important feature. Stability. There is not a sole on this earth that can deny the reliablity and stability of XP. Whether we talk about Windows XP, Office XP, or Microsoft ANYTHING 2002; I dare you to try to make if crash. Good luck. For those of you in corporations, ask your employees what the most irritating part of their day is. You'll undoubtedly get the response, \\"When my tools crash.\\" While Microsoft might have changed minor settings in Publisher to make it slightly annoying for the few, you can't go wrong with the increased reliablity of the product.

If you are a casual listener, don't buy this album - buy Cry instead. Fireflies is rather soft and mushy. It's like a bunch of Mommy songs. I'm sure Faith loves it since she's at that point in her life but it didn't appeal to me at all. The songs don't grab you. It's still a country/pop sound which I like but I was disappointed overall (especially since Cry and Breathe were so much better and stronger). The best song on Fireflies is \\"Dearly Beloved\\" which is a funny, twangy song ala Brad Paisley but the rest of the songs are forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Sorry just not very good for me.

Retreads of everything she's done before, except worse","review":"From yet another duet with Tim about how in love they are, to attempts to re-countrify herself back to Wild Ones, this album is a stinker.I resisted when she moved towards pop, however, each of her more poppy albums, had at least one or two songs that were innovative, if nothing else - \\"Cry,\\" \\"Breathe.\\"This album has no standouts, for me. Already listed back on amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart for Faith to pick Lori McKenna","review":"By far the best songs on this albumn are the ones written by Lori McKenna.

I might just listen to Ms. McKenna's albums Bittertown and Pieces of Me from now on - she has amazing grit and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!","review":"It is finally here!

I have been a fan for a long time, and Faith seems to be on an every other cd is amazing. I just love \\"Like We Never Loved Before\\" which she sings with hubby Tim. (I am a tim fan too) I think that this album is very country - almost feels a little bit of the Yea-Haw country that we are seeing now. I am a little sad with the brown hair hippie look, it just seems like she is trying to be something doesn't need to be. But, it is a great album. You will be happy you bought it!What concerned me ... why did she lower the price so much? Some of her older albums still cost more. Just seemed weird to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fireflies","review":"I have to admit that I am pretty disappointed in this CD. I waited for three years and multiple delays. When I saw Faith in Vegas in August 2004 she said the CD would be out Fall of 2004. Anyway, I could not believe the first track Sunshine &Summertime it was just fluff along with Fireflies, We've got nothing to prove and the Lucky One. These should have never made it on the CD, Faith is so much better then this lame material. I also felt there was not even one song that really struck me like in her previous Cd's, like Breathe, This Kiss and most of Cry. This CD is a very poor attempt at getting on country radio and this hurts me to say as I really like Faith Hill but save your money, Fireflies is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross-over diva?","review":"Maybe I'm a little crazy but her songs just aren't like they used to be. I think her new hit single, what really bugs me is that Mississippi Girl is about her and she grew up in Mississippi and yet she films the video in CA! I have every other CD of hers but after listening to this one I will not buy, I think she is a sell out and I am deeply disappointed with this latest album."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no! not again!!","review":"Just more typical Faith Hill pseudo country/pop/rock??? Who knows what this stuff is...if somebody has an idea, fill me in. I hate it!!! Mississippi girl makes me sick to my stomach...the self gratifying lyrics and the poor vocals both. Stop buying this stuff and making folks with no talent filthy rich. We need both her and Shania off the radio (or on a new genre of radio for music nobody can identify with)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"Can you get any more pretentious than Faith Hill? A few years ago, she was all over the pop trend in country music... hell, she could pretty much be considered a bonafied pop diva. Now, thanks to Nashville's current trends, she's decided to go back to being a \\"good ol' country girl.\\" I'm not buying it at all. It's obvious that she's just looking for what'll cash in the most money. Music doesn't matter to her (nor does it matter to her talentless and equally hypocritical husband)... just the money and fame. It's sick that people can get away with tearing out the heart and soul of true country music.If you want to hear a real, innovative new COUNTRY album by one of the genre's biggest stars... buy Dwight Yoakam's \\"Blame the Vain\\" instead. At least he's never sold his soul for big bucks (and, anyway, he's three times as talented as anyone who's popular now.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Screams, \\"Country Audience, Please Take Me Back\\"","review":"Faith Hill has a great voice, that we can not deny. However, your preference at just how she uses her voice is a matter of opinion, OBVIOUSLY! I prefer the main stream Faith, OBVIOUSLY! On her last effort, \\"Cry\\" her talent is spotlighted where as this new CD \\"Fireflies\\" screams of a country girl who's asking to be forgiven from a country audience that scorned her (and her husband) for the cross-over steps she made that made Faith a sex symbol and household name. This entire CD is pure country. Whiny, cheesy, simple-minded and light-hearted which is exactly what most country music prides itself on. The best song on this CD is the last one, \\"Paris\\", which is a beautiful ballad that presents Faith as she should truly be. She has an amazing voice, beauty and presence . . . why waste it on this music. Most of your reviews read \\"Faith's back!\\", well if this is what she's putting out there from here on out, you can have her back. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning to Her Roots? HAHA!","review":"I found the claim that this album is Faith Hill's way of returning to her country roots laughable. She's not country by a long shot (but, honestly... who in Nashville is?). Commercial country's trends are beginning to gravitate more towards country than pop (even still, almost all popular country music nowdays sucks), so she's just following the trends. No surprise there. What's sad is that no matter what, I'm sure this CD will probably go at least platinum because crap sells and real music doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful CD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Being a die hard Faith Hill fan I am extremly dissappointed in this cd. Except for Faith and Tim's duet I think all the rest of the songs on the album, well.............suck. I have listened to this cd over and over and the more I hear it the worse it gets. This would be one of the first time's I would like a refund.Shane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, amazing cd (mcgrawfanov)","review":"Wow, Faith's new cd is just awesome. I haven't taken it out of my player since I bought it August 2nd. Faith has grown so much in her talent and it totally shows in this album. She has picked extremely talented songwriters that seem to cater especially to her voice. I would recommend this album to anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend?","review":"Returning from her unsuccessful pop album Cry, Faith returns to her country roots with Fireflies. What a disappointment. I waited 3 years for this album and all I get are slow and sappy ballads. Sunshine and Summertime, Mississippi Girl, and Dearly Beloved serve as a strong start to the album. They are fun, upbeat, and have a catch rhythm. After that, the album progresses slowly. Besides The Lucky One, all of the songs are slow and drawn out. The only thing good about these songs are that they display Faith's powerful and pliable voice. Like We Never Loved At All is the only song with meaning and emotion. Owning all of her albums, I would have to say this is her worst effort. I recommend this album for die-hard Faith fans. If you're not, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There's not one original theme or memorable tune on this whole album.

To wait 3 years to put this out is a disgrace.It is full of one paced dull ballads which if you want to be put to sleep is fine.Take my advice and save you cash"},{"rating":"2","title":"a song lovers recommendation","review":"First of all let me say I thought Faith's previous CD \\"Cry\\" was a masterpiece. One of the best CD's of all-time of any genre. The songs were great and full of variety, her singing was never more soulful and emotional, and the production by Dann Huff and Byron Gallimore was never better.\\"Fireflies\\" has a lot of variety, something that I look for in music artist. The collection is also more acoustic and countrier than \\"Cry\\" Stand-out songs for me are, the sad and soulful \\"Like We Never Loved At All\\" w/Tim McGraw on supporting vocals. \\"You Stay With Me\\" and the pop driven \\"The Lucky One\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone has their own taste, but I LOVED it!","review":"Well, I read all the reviews on here and I was a little nervous about this album, but when I listened to it, I thought it was great! I liked it better than any of Faith's other records. I also agree with other writer to asked why Faith shouldn't change her style. A person has to develop over time or they would feel stuck in a rut. My props go to Faith and to her new album. I recommend it to those who have a more open mind to what creating music is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith is Back!","review":"If you love Faith Hill you will like this cd. With fun upbeat tunes like \\"Mississippi Girl\\" and \\"sunshine and summertime\\" and also ballads like \\"ain't gonna take it anymore\\" and \\"Like we never loved at all\\" this cd has a little bit of everything. Faith sounds a little more country on this album than she did on her last and its a welcome return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith does it again, did you expect less? from faithsgal in the i-squad","review":"For those of you who were critizing Faith after Cry, first off, that was just crazy! On the topic of Fireflies, she's gotten some great friends in her corner. Tim, Brett and Brad Warren, Lori McKenna, Big and Rich. They all either lent their voices and/or wrote some spectacular music. This album is not only great, but also has it's funny points.

It tell the story of everyday life.csrg137"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Decent Hits, But An Overall Disappointment","review":"Critics applaud Faith for singing country songs on this release, rather than screaming Adult-Contemporary pop tunes of the past two albums. I agree that Faith is headed in the right direction, but the material here is weak. She had two years to come up with better songs than these. \\"Mississippi Girl\\" is catchy, and the obligatory duet with her husband is destined to be overplayed on the radio, but the rest of the album has very few uptempo tunes, which I think are Faith's strenghs. I'm glad I only paid $9.99 for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith WHO????????","review":"Again Faith is in an Identity Crisis.....Faith if you are gonna claim you are a country artist....BE A COUNRTY ARTIST!!!!!!I sure am Glad that John Rich (Big & Rich) has begun to revive your country roots where you'll owe ALL of your \\"comeback\\" success in writting Mississippi Girl for your first release as a \\"Come back Country Artist\\".

There are some I didnt really care for, like Dearly Beloved and We've Got Nothing But Love To Prove, because they're a little too country for me, but they're still not bad. My fave songs have got to be Like We Never Loved At All w/Tim McGraw and I Want You, which I think could be the next Breathe. All in all, this is an excellent album and a must have. Some other standouts are You Stay With Me, Fireflies, Wish For You, and I could go on and on. There is not a bad song on here. faith1118"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for one song...","review":"...track 11, \\"We've Got Nothing But Love to Prove\\". It's a poor attempt at a \\"we love America\\"-type song. Terrible chorus!Other than that, this is a great CD. Skip track 11 and you've got a winner! My favorite songs are \\"Mississippi Girl\\", and \\"Like We Never Loved at All\\" (not a duet with hubby Tim McGraw, but he does sing on this song).Buy this CD, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith and Tim can not be stopped!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!Thank you for another fabulous piece of musical art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Mississippi Girl is back","review":"Fireflies is one of Faith's best albums. I really love every song on this album. Dearly Beloved is so funny and in most cases is really true. Sunshine and Summertime is a really fun song. Tims background vocals on the album are so awesome.

It truely is a wonderful cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old really fast","review":"The verdict is finally out on this album. It's been swallowed, and the aftertaste is not very good. I agree with most that the album starts off strong, and the first three songs are cute, but cute is not going to make me listen to this album for years to come, like all of her previous albums. I recently read a review in the Washington Post that said that Shania tries too hard, and that Faith does it just right. I couldn't disagree more. Coming out and trying to be a Mississippi girl after all she's been through is a joke, and nobody is going to buy that. Bottom line, wait for the video. Whoops, there is no video! The radio will suffice. Or, do what I do, and subscribe to Rhapsody music. Cheers. P.S. If you didn't find my review helpful, you can suck my big one.

I like the country songs and the \\"pop\\" crossover music that she has done in the past. \\"Fireflies\\" is really bad. \\"Mississipi Girl\\" is the only decent song and that isn't even that great. I kept on waiting for a song to jump out at me, but the song choice is just bad. Bad lyrics, monotone melodies. I gave this CD away. She shouldn't have released this.I will still stand by her when her next CD comes out, but I wouldn't rush out to buy \\"Fireflies.\\"Check out the import \\"greatest hits\\" cd instead and her earlier country CD's to keep you tied over until the next one comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"This is the best Faith HIll CD I have ever heard.

Larsen","review":"Dr. Christopher Roy's \\"Masks of Leaves and Wood: The Bwa People of the Village of Boni, Burkina Faso\\" offers beautiful footage of both mask performances and of villagers' participation in these ceremonies. Roy's voice-over narration provides information about the making and meaning of the masks, about village life and social structures, and about masking rituals and religious beliefs. As a principal scholar in the art of Burkina Faso, the information is both fascinating and credible. Also included are the voices of the participating Africans, providing an Afrocentric point of view. Though the camera is somewhat shaky for the first third of the film, Roy is transparent about production of it, thus accounting for the lack of tripod. The movie is conveniently divided into three sections, making the showing of all, or portions of the film conducive to an academic setting. Scenes of both the family owned plank masks and the ephemeral leaf masks are intriguingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"only heats a 15 gal tank, not a good price","review":"I orderd this tank heater for my rv's holding tank.

It's flawless in it's execution but its like those popular Fantasy Books that never ends you like reading them in the beginning but in book 15 of 37 you start becoming a bit bored of the swords and sorcery and the same goes for the guitar solos and synthesizer soundwalls and the quasi poetry.I'm from sweden and I'm rather proud of what our little country creates in form of popular music, but this is just to much!Sorry boys Steve hacket did this 25 years ago, and better at that without digital guitar processors I'm sorry to say.Per-ke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Listen","review":"I have been a little reluctant to buy Flower Kings CDs.

So I put it to the side for a week.....I picked up the disc again and listened to it again. Somehow it began sounding much better. The music began to come together and started to make sense. Another listen and it was really becoming quite good!. I now consider this one of their best discs. Repeated listens definately required to appreciate all the complexities going on in this disc.While fans of Stardust We Are and Space Revolver my find this much more complex, it is an outstanding disc if you allow yourself the time to get to know the music.

It uses a structured approach to the different aspects of writing (writing about places, situations, people, etc.) and includes many thought-provoking exercises at the end of each section. The book also includes many excerpts of autobiographical writings from well-known male and female authors, including Annie Dillard and George Orwell.

As the title aptly hints, the twenty short stories range from horrific to twisted comedy, and everything encompassed therein. The nods to classic horror writers are subtley imbedded within the stories (except for \\"Crouch End\\", where the LoveCraft Cthulu mythos is treated to a starkly terrifying modernization).The inner workings stories such as \\"Dolan's Cadillac\\" and \\"The House of Maple Street\\" carry a Ray Bradbury 1960's pulp air to them, while stories like \\"Rainy Season\\" and \\"Suffer the Little Children\\" will just leave you afraid to turn out the light.The two crown gem stories found in here, \\"The Moving Finger\\" and \\"The 10'o'clock People\\", are worth the price of the book alone.Reader's beware, the tongue in the cheek experienced during reading will be replaced by the monster in the closet as soon as the lights go out. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightscapes & Dreammares","review":"Nearly done with this collection of tales, and it's very good. Particularly the Chattery False Toy Teeth--toy teeth that \\"come alive.\\" The Cadillac, a modern day Cask of Amantillado. Even a Sherlock Holmes whodunit. Stephen King is in top form in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"hit or miss, mostly the latter","review":"I'm not a huge huge King fan. I really loved the Stand as a child and was looking for brain candy for a vacation when I dug this up.The big issue is I don't think King really wrote these aiming to publish them. They read more like self-inflicted writing experiments. I know many novelists will whip out a short story or two just to clear their head. That's what this seems like. Many of the stories are clearly more experimental: let's write a Sherlock Holmes story, let's be even more excessively HP Lovecraft-y, Ohwouldn'tthisideabecrazy.I'm not knocking it, but I didn't find *any* of the stories exceptionally entertaining, and many of them I skipped past without finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Short Stories","review":"I enjoyed all the stories in the book, except one so I cannot give the book 5 stars. I found My Pretty Pony to be difficult to \\"get into\\". My favorite was Dolan's Cadillac, great suspense short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story for everyone in this one.....","review":"If you like to read and don't have time for a lenthy novel, this is the one for you. It has a collection of many different types of storys and they are all fairly short in lenth. If you like Stephen King you'll love this one, I am a big fan and this has to be one of my favorite because of the variety of storys. If you're looking for a book to take to bed make it this one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"great collection!","review":"I love his short stories, each so unique. The only thing I do not like is sometimes, depending on the story - I want more! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry bunch of stories","review":"NIGHT SHIFT was a great read, SKELETON CREW was acceptable, but this collection of short stories is awful! The only exception is Umney's Last Case which is a wonderful story, rather unlike anything else I've ever read. As for the other stories; it's raining frogs? A vampire who urinates blood? Come on!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I've always loved short stories, particularly horror fiction, so as you can imagine how much I looked forward to reading Stephen King's 'Nightmares and Dreamscapes'. The only reservation I had was that I had already read much of the book in other anthologies - and in no case had I been overly impressed - but surely there would be something new to make the book worth buying? Boy was I disappointed! Most of the stories (e.g. Popsy, My Little Pony) are so weak that I doubt they would have been published at all without the Stephen King name. My guess is that they were rejects he had been hanging on to for years, until he could use them as filler when he was short of original ideas. There is NOTHING here that comes near the standard set by 'Skeleton Crew' or 'Night Shift' or even 'Four Past Midnight'. Nightmares indeed ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe he actually got this published","review":"After I read this book I found it hard to believe that Stephen King, the once master of suspense, actually wrote it. It lacked depth, imagination, and creativity, and left no impression on the memory. What was his point? If King could go back and erase just one of his works I'm sure this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"I am a fan of King's work but aside from the first story, Doran's Cadillac, I was disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone. To be fair, I will try to start where I abandoned this book one more time. Stick to Different Seasons if you want a collection of King's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few good stories","review":"This book is a great collection of short stories from the creepy man himself. My favorite was the one about the finger coming out of a sink in New York. I wouldn't recomend this whole book, but a few of the stories are well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening and Mystical. You'll love it.","review":"Jam packed with stories that will drive you into maniacal laughter, and make you leave the lights on at night. Rollercoaster of Terror and macabre hilarity, this is pure King. Although one or two stories detract from the overall, it still deserves all five stars. Especially look out for the story \\"Crouch End\\", it'll turn you white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven King is great!","review":"Several hours of good, relaxing escape. Would it be possible to get more like this? For example: at least once a month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King at his best","review":"This collection of stories from King spans several genres most notable of which are the vampire stories (Popsy, The Night Flier), human-eating frogs (sort of gives a new twist to the term \\"raining cats and dogs\\"), a hand in the drain which had me looking at the drain in my shower room, a city of famous dead musicians and his own foray into sportswriting in \\"Head Down\\" where he describes the exploits of his son's Little League Team in Bangor Maine (I think he's more than qualified to cover his favorite Red Sox).What makes King's writing particularly effective is that he tells tales of common people(like you and me) experiencing extraordinary things. When you put this book down, you can't help but wonder if the same thing will happen to you. I also have the sense that these stories were written for the sheer joy of writing regardless if it makes the author a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good King Anthology","review":"Everyone has read a few King books and seen a few of his movies. Nobody who reads his work at this point can say that they were surprised that his skill doesn't match his popularity, or complain that he's a middlebrow writer with a great sense of fantasy but little lasting literary value. No, he doesn't show us anything new, or teach us anything profound, or look at anything in a new and insightful way. What he does is turn out hundreds of pages of horror stories every year. That's not a bad thing. He's a busy writer who keeps his fans happy. He turns out a pretty good horror story, and this anthology of short stories from across his long career is a nice one to have on the bedside table. Enjoy it for what it is, and you'll have a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though its no Night Shift or Skeleton Crew still great.","review":"I liked Nightmares and Dreamscapes though there are a few clunkers, its definitely a must have for King Completists. \\"Suffer the Little Children\\" has to be my favorite King short story ever. This Bradburyish tale is so cool. I also loved \\"Dolon's Cadillac\\" its kind of like \\"Bag of Bones\\". \\"The End of the Whole Mess\\" was really clever and original. The \\"Ten O'Clock People\\" is also a highlight. I didn't like every tale but there are enough great ones to justify adding this to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"This was not as good as Night Shift Or Skeleton Crue' but I liked 'Dolans caddilac' The End of the Whole Mess' 'Chattery Teeth' and 'The Moving Finger'. Almost all the rest was mediocre. Head Down was a waste of paper and shouldnt have been included here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway through & not even half-scared","review":"I had every intention of finishing this 800+ page short story collection, but by the time I was halfway through, I hadn't been frightened once and was worn out from getting my hopes up and then having them dashed. I will stick to King's novels from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"King is my favorite author and this book is great, but...","review":"This book is too damn long!

Heck, I'm not even finished yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing out loud","review":"William F. Buckley pulled precisely the right excerpts from his large store of material to give a vivid picture his extraordinary life, full of verve and that irrepressible twinkle in his eye. I have laughed, smiled, chuckled, or groaned at least once with every page. This is truly a delightful, entertaining, and brilliantly written account. It's an unusual way to \\"write\\" an autobiography, but then who would expect less than the unique from Bill Buckley?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The making of a conservative icon","review":"Read this book and unearth The Real Buckley: athlete, family man, world traveler, peerless intellectual, a religious soul with an inquisitive, skeptical mind-- and an insatiable appetite for adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime,... just sublime","review":"To steal a wonderful line from his inimitable book/life, Mr. Buckley has seen the \\"rise and fall of empires\\" and left us a rapturous and numinous account of it all; a near mythical saga of the many exotic ports of call through which he sailed on his many political, recreational and literary journeys, and of the numerous fellowships with the stellar lights among us he knew as friends. These divine moments that he experienced down through the years that the rest of us, his distant admirers, only dimly gleaned, are now unveiled in all their splendor to reveal a glory of a life beyond all reckoning. Our only rue, after turning the last page, is the profound sadness that comes from knowing there now remains left for him, and vast society of friends, only his twilight years. All the more urgency for reading this last book to take final company with a great spirit and a great man, as he pens perhaps his greatest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about an honest review","review":"I already purchased this book and was curious before starting it what the overall evaluation of this book was. It's obvious that some people (publisher perhaps?) has taken it upon themselves to stack 5 star ratings rather than provide honest reviews. Come on, 11/11 positive feedbacks for a 3 line review??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise -- terrible execution","review":"The whole idea of miracles, saints, and how to \\"prove\\" such things, is fascinating. Unfortunately, in the hands of the author, the scenario becomes a cartoonish exercise with stereotypical and poorly drawn characters. Some of the scenes actually made me cringe, they were so crudely written and unbelievable. The dialogue is clumsy and at times downright laughable; I wondered where the editor was when the manuscript was being prepared. I stuck with it because I thought the premise was a good one, but it was a total waste of time. I can only hope that in the proposed movie version that they hire a scriptwriter who knows how to write dialogue and create a plot that works. Mr. Vetere certainly doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful colors","review":"The colors in the peacock are fantastic. Suggestion: practice and practice the uncovering technique before you start on the picture itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding reference work for writing systems","review":"This beautiful book is no less than thoroughly spectacular, and the premier reference source for the subject of writing systems. This is THE book that I wished for as a college student 25 years ago, since writing systems is one of the subjects I've had a lifelong fascination with.I cannot recommend highly enough to anybody curious about this book to get it. I still remember the day it arrived in the mail back in 1998. If I had the choice of keeping only five books in my library, this would be one of them.You don't have to think twice about getting this book. I guarantee that this book will not disappoint you, and you will use it for years to come. As one of the other comments said, I don't know how a future publication could possibly out-do this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is what it says it is but...","review":"...it's missing many language script tables that I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong, this book is amazing and filled useful information and language tables - just not all of them. I was hoping for some representation (optimally in an alphabet table format) of the usage of the Arabic-based script for Hausa, Swahili, the Central Asian languages, and some complete detail of which languages have (ever) incorporated an Arabic-based script, when they did, when it was withdrawn or changed (if applicable), comparative texts with the modern scripts, etc. In conclusion, a treasury of information (a lot of which might be quite difficult to track down on your own and would be very time-consuming), marred only by my high expectations.

SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 5 may not be a great film. It may not even be a good film for that matter. But it is at least better than the previous sequels by comparison. It actually centers around the holiday for starters, but it is also very mean-spirited and unique. The problem, as always with these films, is that the interesting premise is quickly destroyed by the drab acting and storyline. Who are we to side with here? The neglectful mother and her mute child? The obsessive Santa stalker? The crazed toymaker? Or maybe the guy who can't seem to keep the boom mic out of the shot? Thankfully, the film packs enough mild gore and Mickey Rooney 'splotation to keep things moving, if only at a crawl.

Personally, I like to be able to play the songs as much like they sound on the album as possible, so I was happy with this book overall. I know she never arranges every song on the album for accompaniment. A few always have the melody built in to it. The songs that are arranged to sound like the album version are Amber Waves, A Sorta Fairytale, Wednesday, Strange, Carbon, Sweet Sangria, Your Cloud, Pancake, New York, Mrs. Jesus, Scarlet's Walk, Virginia and Gold Dust.Then Crazy, Vegas, Taxi Ride, and Paradise all have the built in melody and obviously Wampum Prayer is just the vocal line. All in all the arrangements are very good but I was slightly disappointed with how simple Fairytale was, even though it's arranged to sound pretty much just like the album.

As most of you probably know, Mike Valentine worked for cincinnati microwave (escort) back in the 80s. He apparently took all his secrets with him when he left, because since then the Escort/Passport/Solo detectors have gone downhill.I thought I'd try the new 8500, since I had heard it was a brand new beast. Well I was only able to try it for 3 weeks before it failed to turn on correctly (emitting strange beeps and the LCD going crazy). It did point out some true radar sources many times (like any cheap detector would do), but it also false alarmed most of the time it was on....It's just nothing compared to the Valentine One.If you are willing to sepnd the money on this detector, just drop another $100 or so and get a V1. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I have had several other brands of radar detectors ranging from $50 to $150. None can even compare. Of course none were the brand escort either. I do not know if this quality is standard among their product line but this radar detector is awesome. It has an auto feature that automatically senses where you are at while you are driving. It minimizes false alarms and its range is unbelievable. Around corners, long straight-aways, hills, you name it, it does it. The only thing it lacks is a voice alert which I like but is not needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"hasnt failed me once","review":"This is my first amazon review.

Sure, you can spend an extra $100 to get the Valentine One and the directional arrows. However, if the thing goes off are you first going to look at the arrows or are you going to slow down?

I used it to update my website that is hosted by Yahoo. I had to load the FrontPage extensions to the server then convert my current pages to FrontPage. This made me go through the process of reformatting nearly everything. The simple on-line tools that yahoo provides did a better job and quicker than this software. I suppose if you really are an office expert and want the look and feel of the office interface then you might like it. Otherwise I think you can do better elsewhere. This software takes the cookie cutter approach to building a web presence. Microsoft was offering a 30 day CD trial but have stopped that. I wonder why they don't want you to try it out any more before you buy it? Why indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This software does not work","review":"Quite simply this software does not work, and I've been using other versions of FrontPage since it first came out--check out the Microsoft web site--they have loads of 'fixes' for this software.

The pages only look right in Internet Explorer unless you do some major tweaking in notepad.

They are very very bland, unimaginative themes. Microsoft needs to add some good artists to the staff and listen to them. I am going to sell Frontpage and will use Homestead.com instead, which is slower and has a lot fewer features, but the Website Themes and Templates to choose from are much much more attractive. Homestead is also easier to learn. Frontpage is a lot better in one respect though, you can insert an entire Word document, tables, plots, graphics and all, very quickly (one click) and it all looked good except the photos. So if you are adding a great deal of Microsoft Office non-text material to your site, Frontpage speeds things up a lot there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy DreamWeaver instead","review":"This software has absolutely NO support. The so-called manual that comes with it is limited and extremely difficult to understand. If you are going to buy FrontPage 2002, buy a book with it, you will be glad you did. I do not recommend this software, DreamWeaver is much better. Too many gliches in FrontPage 2002, and many web hosting companies have not installed FrontPage 2002 extensions, because of the bugs in that software. This causes problems with certain web files, either they are incomplete or non-existent.I am dissapointed in Microsoft for producing FP 2002, I expected a more suitable and proficient product. DreamWeaver costs more, but in the long run, it is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"Frontpage is notorious for changing standard HTML into a \\"special\\" version that does not work with other editors and does not conform with international standards of HTML (any version).

When it was almost completed, we had a need to switch to the Macromedia development environment, but the project had some embedded coding that was Microsoft/Frontpage specific.

Also, the environment is not as intuitive as I was led to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off learning HTML","review":"This software is very cumbersome to work with. The whole point to using this type of software is to make the layouts go faster. When going from normal mode to preview mode or when saving the page to actually use, much of the WYSIWYG is not WYSIWYG! I found that I had to edit the pages in Notepad to get the page layout to look right. I tried to use Frontpage's HTML editor but when I'd save the changes I made, Frontpage would change them back to what they were.

Have a look at the html after you have imported a word document! Each import takes about 20 minutes to clean up.FP 2002 is most definately a step backwards, if you are using FP 2000, don't upgrade, stick to what you have got and in your spare time learn dreamweaver.The greatest irritation, its inability to cope with publishing big sites, has still not been fixed.Sorry - I have had enough.."},{"rating":"1","title":"More feature creep and locking","review":"While one must admire Microsoft's constant addition of functionality to already-satisfactory programs, this is a bit of an extreme. FP2002 is fairly easy to use, but seems a little buggy in terms of the \\"finished\\" page staying as saved. Importing chunks of data from various Office programs is easy enough, but not really any more facile than with other web editors.More serious, for some users, may be incompatibility with other authoring programs. If you just wanted Word or Excel to write docs/spreadsheets and print them at home, great. But if you'd like your web files to be portable to other programs, this one isn't so good - lost of unnecessary code and other incompatibilities. I recommend DreamWeaver for most people; if you stay in this game, you'll eventually wind up there anyway. Start with a better program, save time and money in the not-too-long run, and ensure that your files can be ported to another program and platform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious product","review":"I purchased FrontPage to create our company webpage.

If you need more detail you have to go out and purchase another book. I didn't like this. I looked into the book from which the booklet was culled and it read like an astrophysics text: Too much information, wholly irrelevant to my goal. Not user-friendly at all.

I love that the author encourages you to break out your own Bible and keep looking for more references on the topic.

I can't think of Bible verses for various things my children do so I appreciate having something in a condensed form for reference. Kara uses topics we all face as parents: anger, giving, cursing, kindness, etc and gives several verses that talk about that particular behavior. She then gives ideas for discussion and activities (for both parent and child) to instill God's words in their lives. This is appropriate for all ages from toddler - teenager.

As my kids have gotten older, they will say, \\"Mom, what does the book say about (fill in the blank)?\\"This book works in wonderful conjunction with the Bible as it leads the reader to ask questions about where passages originateand what the circumstances were.I highly recommend this book, whatever the age of your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for Christian parents!","review":"I have been using this book for almost 10 years now to refer to biblical scripture. I have found it to be an excellent resource for teachable moments when it helps to have a scripture back-up to explain what God says about a topic. We all have to pick our battles, especially as our kids get older. This has eliminated many battles because my kids understand the power in hearing it from God's word.

Kathy Mattea stands out from her comtemporaries with her distinctive style and immediately recognizable voice. The disappointment does not come from this talented artist but rather from the remaining material which I found to be boring, monotone and very difficult to negotiate. This album suffers from the same ailments that afflicts much of today's material which is passed off as music, namely, the lack of melodies which have the listener singing the tune before the first hearing is completed and the ever present \\"cookie-cutter\\" formula which appears to create a multitude of material, with different titles, from one very poor melody line.

Given the author wrote for FHM and is a model this accounts for the very readable 'magazine' style of the book. My biggest complaint was that is seems very out of date. I bought this in 2004 and most of the material and stories come from around the early 90's (most of it has changed now), although there are some small appendixes that give reference to 2000+. Give book's strength is the hard facts of how, where, and girls stories this seems out of date. The book's 3rd reprint was in 1997.

From their first album, \\"Between Something and Nothing\\", to their subsequent albums, they have grown and matured as musicians and songwriters. It was not what I expected from The Ocean Blue but that is what blows me away with each new recording of theirs.

The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound). And what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun? Just because Steve Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether. So, anyway, what does this album offer instead? Harder sounding guitar, angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you've had the CD for a couple weeks. Exceptions: \\"Whenever You're Around\\", and \\"Slide\\" are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat-Man is tongue in cheek (and savory, to bite)","review":"This second volume of the Eat-Man series isn't quite as good as the first, but our heavy-metal hero Bolt Crank still fights for the oppressed, the weak, the exploited, and the occasional lovely maiden. The art and story line are often pitched at an adolescent male audience (as is most action-oriented manga), yet it's always saved by the author's sense of humor and irony, and the silent charm of Bolt. My only real kvetch is the cover, which is done by an American comic artist and reflects all the faults of American comic books: ultra-serious, steel-jawed, literal and oh-so-lacking in self-knowingness. (Seen the Cartoon Network promo in which the Super Friends turn a trip to a movie snack bar into a super crisis?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no such thing as coincidence.","review":"Reading Terri's novel was difficult - it was difficult to put down. A haunting story of love and the connecting threads that transcend time, I was amazed at the intuitive way in which Terri DuLong tied past and present lives together. From a \\"chance\\" meeting between a man and woman in front of a place with a history of cruelty and inhumanity, to the realization that there was no \\"chance\\" or coincidence in their meeting. The skillful manner in which Terri unravels past lives and binds them together with the present makes \\"Lost Souls\\" a terrific read.I've always felt that everything happens for a reason and that there is no such thing as coincidence. Terri DuLong's novel, though a work of fiction, proves that what I've always known about coincidence is correct. Fiction - GOOD fiction - is, after all, based on fact.If Terri's future works are anything like \\"Lost Souls,\\" I'll be the first one on line to get a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read","review":"I bought this book from an Amazon used book seller. I have been for several years an interested reader of anything that has to do with the Danvers Insane Asylum. Sorry, folks, this has nothing to do with Danvers. This has everything to do with a man and woman who meet at Danvers during a photo shoot of the photographer protganist, the man, who meets the woman, who happens to be a psychiatric nurse. Big deal.If you are an alcoholic, you will love this book. In almost all scenes of the so called \\"love birds\\" they have glasses of wine in their hands. They constantly ask each other in each scene, \\"would you like a glass of wine?\\" In every scene in this book, they are either drinking wine or toasting wine to each other. It's like, wine is the center of this book!A total waste of time reading this book. Danvers Insane Asylum deserves more than this total tripe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Story","review":"I'm an avid reader, but this book was a disappointment.

I found very little of merit in this hodgepodge. In fact, it's a cheap conglomeration of other books that have been done on the same subject. Not much original here at all. I suggest reading Ron Nyswaner's autobiography if you want something with a glimmer of quality and authenticity."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the prettiest video...","review":"Overall this will be a dissapointing purchase for the Axl Rose fan, technically very poor sound quality, and the Bonus features are unopenable, so one cannot view them.

This was a terrible disappointment. Really deserved NO stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap hack video","review":"This starts out by saying that none of this has been authorized by Axl (of course) and that no Guns N Roses music is used in it. The music is cheesy as is the entire video. It's almost painful to sit through. It mostly consists of interviews with Hollywood has-beens including one guy that is labeled \\"scenester\\". Definitely don't buy this unless you're a super hard-core collector or fan that just insists on having everything. A couple of shots of Axl that I hadn't seen, but probably not worth the dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firm ...NOT!","review":"I was expecting firm pillows when I ordered these. They are so far from firm that its unbelievable. I should have returned these as soon as I received them, I don't know why I didn't.

If firm is what you want, DON'T order these as you will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not firm, very loud, not very comfy.","review":"When these arrived they were pancake flat, and while I shook and poofed and fluffed they never really filled out. When you lay on them your head just sinks to the bottom like in most cheap feather pillows. Ok so I thought now that I've opened the package and these things are mine I'll at least be able to use them as scrunch pillows and wad them up to make something somewhat supportive, but the feathers in the pillow make a loud crunching sound whenever bunching and shaping.

I certainly wouldn't buy these again if I had the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Smell","review":"These pillows are really flat, but that is not why I returned them.

There they lay, these two SUPER FLAT, thin, inexpensive looking \\"pillows\\"... Ok, so we tried fluffing them up. We wanted to give them a chance... They were just as flat, no matter what we did, and thin as you can imagine. The quality was average, but they were just too flat and thin. We felt that a down filled pillow should have some weight, some substance. We would have been embarrassed to give these as gifts. And we certainly would not use or enjoy them ourselves. I returned them immediately and went to a local retail store where I could feel the pillows. Hard to buy pillows online was our lesson. However, if you want a flat, thin down pillow, then perhaps you might rate them higher and enjoy them moreso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two years later and they're still my favorite.","review":"I was looking for a med/firm pillow that would hold its shape and not flatten.

I felt as if I knew Krystina Morant, the young slave woman who was a spy for the Continental Army. I could almost hear her as she played her violin and entertained the British soldiers. Her keen powers of observation made her the perfect spy. Her vital role in providing badly needed information to the Continental Army officers demonstrated the unique role often played by non-combatants in the war.

There didn't seem to be a point to the toy--there were a *few* things she could \\"explore\\", like pulling the ribbons and having music play, or sliding a button and having the ABC song play, but other than that, it seemed pointless.

But, she has displayed little more than a passing interest in it and quite frankly it seems boring as far as toys go. The other two salient parent points are that 1)the \\"sounds/songs\\" it makes are not pleasing,( compared to the learn and grove table which sounds nice), but rather sounds like an annoying video game ( I think I'll get my fill of those sounds when she older, why subject myself to it now?) and 2) as mentioned in other reviews the balls just roll away, so you ( the parent) have to go search under the sofa for them...like I need more work to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Santa brought this toy for my son (11 mths).

He really does explore and discover something new all the time. The toy has held up really well...and I bought it used - and everything is great.

To clear up a few misunderstandings, number one: This is not a bootleg. This DVD is an import from Brazil. In Brazil, they have different copyright laws and the packaging is the sole responsibility of the manufacturer (which I don't believe is Wanner Bros. or MCA). If you're a well seasoned Prince fan, then I'm sure you've seen countless promotional posters for concerts in years such as 1995, with 1985 pictures on them. This is very common outside of the United States. As far as owning this DVD as a \\"Must Have,\\" buy it at your own risk; but don't blame Amazon.

I don't know what the man did with this record and the film but he hit the target everytime. From \\"Housequake\\" to \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" every song performed live became an experience and made me a Prince fan in the process. This film is least talked about and the folks at Universal or WB should consider releasing this on DVD. Prince's \\"Sign O' The Times\\" is a hidden gem in Prince's illustrious career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sign O' the Times-the DVD","review":"Let me start off by saying that I gave this disk 2 stars because it is Prince. beyond that, i highly recommend that you pass this one up.After waiting since early February, I finally got it today(April 10th). I expected problems when all the packaging was in spanish with a different cover picture. i put it into my player, and that's where the real dissapointment came in. The picture is awful. The sound is awful. the so-called dolby digital sound came mostly from my center channel speaker. I had to actually walk over to my other speakers to see if anything at all was coming out of them(very little). The quality of the sound is also awful(muffled). I pulled out my old VHS copy that i was hoping to retire, and it is far superior even after 15 or mor years of heavy use. Do not buy this disk unless you are just looking for disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"subpar import from brazil","review":"I wont spend too much time on a review of this dvd version.

I'll just watch my vhs version until Warner wakes up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - this is NOT the genuine article","review":"I excitedly ordered this from the UK because I have longed for this to come out on DVD for years. Frankly, you'd be far better off ordering the existing VHS edition from the US, which i already have. This DVD was not recorded in the US (I think Brazil) and whoever has committed it to DVD has basically just lifted the VHS tape onto a disc. The sound and visual quality is therefore even poorer than the VHS edition and to say I am very disappointed is an extreme understatement. I will be sending my copy back tomorrow and I can't believe that an organisation of such usual high quality as Amazon is stocking this without explanatory notes. When is someone finally going to recognise that this film deserves proper re-mastering treatment and re-release? It is, after all, Prince's finest hour and the best live performance film I have ever seen. Very upset indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"IGNORE THOSE WHO GAVE THIS LOW RATINGS!","review":"I thought it was absolutely amazing!

This DVD is decent quality but it seems as if it was ripped from VHS. A few skips... but the Subtitles were done by an individual that is obviously not a Prince fan. The words are so way off base on many instances. The quality of the DVD does give it a \\"Concert Feel\\" though. Most of this was shot in Paisley Park <or so I have heard> but the fact the quality is not exaclty DVD kind of gives it an \\"authentic\\" feel. But the subtitles are sooo far off base on many instances. I know this because I know every word 2 every Prince song,, B sides and all. But being that u can not get this released by WB yet,,, it is good. Die hard fans go 4 it,, novices that like him during Purple Rain years u may be let down. But Die-harders,, go 4 it.

O'Har's story spans decades - indeed, centuries - and he has managed to create vivid, dialogue-driven characters in all time periods. This, I don't have to tell the avid reader, is no small feat. His narrative creates both fear and contemplation; in fact, just for kicks, he invented his own language (which made me think of Russell Hoban). At different times while reading, I was also reminded of Salinger, Fitzgerald, Harper Lee, and... surprisingly... Henry Adams. In all respects, the novel is a triumph, and potential consumers - and critics - are doing themselves a tremendous disservice if they don't carve out some time for themselves, pick up Psychic Fair, and give it a well-deserved read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of historical and paranormal.","review":"This was a really great read!A fascinating mixture of genres.Trust me, this is nothing like what you're expecting.

The very definition of laid-back music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"Okie\\" instead","review":"First off let's dispense with the packaging. The writing is inane, the photos look like a bad tv ad from the 90s. (an abandoned gas station, all rust and tumbleweed, Cale posed as ever-so-\\"americana\\" scruff. Please.) Cale IS a terrific musician, and an essential listen, but you'll be better served by \\"Okie\\" or any of his albums. This anthology misses Cale's genius entirely, choosing an endless series of same tempo shuffles. A listen to Okie reveals a very varied set of songs that flow easily and present an entire world of textures and rythmns. Cale is a studio wizard, related more to Brian Eno than to the lesser talents (like Clapton) who imitate his innovations. He arranges his recordings very carefully, as engineers are wont to do, and it is all about the sequencing and layering of sounds and meaning. Taken out of context, Cale's songs can seem slight and repetitious. So skip this ill-advised collection and buy any of the albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"If you're a fan of the Blue Dogs, you already know that they are a very good band. That is, up until the release of Halos & Good Buys. With this release, they will now become a great band and this is the record that's going to make great things happen for this band.My prediction is that this record will be picked up by a major label very soon. There's not a bad song on the entire CD. As a matter of fact, every song on here is outstanding. If you're a fan of rock, country, folk, etc, you won't be disappointed with this effot.

The voices are okay, i'd have to admit that, but they've changed the character personalities, and to boot it all up, they've also changed how a few of the episodes go. The episodes are shown OUT OF ORDER!Still, I'd have to say that if you're just starting out, this is recommended (considering that you may or may not understand Japanese^_^) , but remember, this is not the same Cardcaptor Sakura that is it supposed to be...Cherry Fields--My own Cardcaptors site.

That aside, CCS is quite possibly the best anime in years. The animation is livey and vibrant while the story itself is cute and simplistic.

As she went on-line to learn more about the series, she saw that there were some edits and was dying to see the real series. As I sat down to watch with her, I became a little intrigued as well.Sakura is a cute series without going overboard. I expected something along the lines of \\"Sailor Moon\\" and was pleasantly surprised to find a good storyline, with refreshing and funny characters. The only part that was a little frustrating was the art itself, being a little on the basic side compared to some of the other series that I've seen. Other than that, this is a great series, and is a must for any child who enjoys Cardcaptor.P.S. - Don't let the purists drive you away from the American series, both are enjoyable in their own respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the same series?","review":"I will admit that I liked the WB CARDCAPTORS and was a bit bummed that they seem to have stopped showing the new episodes.

Here Sakura is represented as the cutest little kid! This is original uncut version, so there many differences from WB show. The oppening and closing songs are really cool!! The DVD also includes the english oppening. Episodes on this DVD were skipped by the \\"Card Captors\\" TV show, so they will be brand new to anyone who is used to watching Card Captors.

It is not violent, scary, a thriller or dark. It is a light, silly and charming series. I never did like Sailor Moo, for the artwork in Sailor Moon is terrible and it is more repetive, but Card Captors, though is collecting cards, has a good story and beautiful animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acustico","review":"Titas are the best known (and beloved) group of Brasil.

This movie slacks off on everything so much that the scene where he supposedly kills a thousand guys I think he probably kills five. And he struggls against the woosy prince of Philistia. The movie doesn't even show him taking the gate of gaza; but it sure does show the prostitutes in his life. I said the movie slacks off on everything maybe I shouldn't have said that. It doesn't seem to slack off much on his sex. For crying out loud this is supposed to be Christian. Oh and also it definitely isn't biblical the story is so messed up the only real similarity between it and the Bible is the names. Oh and I'm sorry, but this move doesn't need the part on Samson's circumcision either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Weakest of the Bible Collection","review":"I was gravely disappointed with Samson & Delilah. I found the story lagging (one tape would have sufficed) with many biblical inaccuracies including odd characters of no biblical origin. Additionally, I thought Dennis Hopper was horribly miscast. His dry way of speaking seemed too distracting.Although Eric Thal protrays a pensive Samson, the war between Samson's lust and his passion for God was not at all believable. His period of serving as a judge seemed more like a trist. Admittedly, I enjoyed Elizabeth Hurley as Delilah (I think this is some of her best work anywhere). In my opinion, you'd do best to pass on this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie..sent me 1 copy too many.","review":"The movie sucked..long boring..tv movie and I got (and paid for )1 copy too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"I am a big fan of the Bible Series, Moses, Jacob and David are great movies, a little inaccurate at times but nothing mayor, however Samson and Delilah it's very inaccurate, for instance it completely forgot the part in which Samson offers honey to his parents (to show disobedience) or when Samson asks permission to his parents to marry a Philistian woman. This movie in relation to all others doesn't contain a message but rather its an attempt to make a biblical story a commercial one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good ministry","review":"I bought this movie as an alternate for the things we usually watch, and all I can say is, I am very embarassed that I am not able to watch it with my children, or let them watch it by themselves. Way too much sex, and explicit at that. If you have to buy Samson and Delilah, buy the one with Victor Mature and Heddy Lamarr. Good, clean, educational. And the whole family can watch.

Not very good or very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of many","review":"I would definately say that this is the best CD that I have that contains works from more than one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals.

In 1982, he became the only composer in history to have 3 musicals running simultaniously on Broadway and London's West End (the shows were Cats, The Phantom of the Opera, and Starlight Express). Even though I have never seen one of Webber's shows, I have been blessed by his beautiful music. Even though much of his great work is left off of this CD (the only reason it lost a star), much great work is included.

This book opened my eyes to thoughts and ideas that had never occured to me, I felt ignorant and ashamed at myself, but glad I've realized where I am lacking. It's a beautiful book written by a curious author who is wonderfully honest about the hard changes he's endured emotionally and physically as he adapts to his blindness. The people he chose to interview excited, angered, enthralled and inspired me. There's so much left to do in the disability community to raise awareness and if it doesn't start with those of us who are living with the disability, it should.

Then if you know where to click, you can eventually find the same series of dialog boxes that were in Word 2000.If you created a document in Word 2000, don't expect it to look the same in Word XP. In Microsoft's infinite wisdom, the fonts that are provided with XP are different than Word 2000. XP has some new fonts, but deleted some of the old fonts. It can become frustrating.Unfortunately, MS Office has become the defacto standard with no challengers in sight. So, stick with MS Office 2000. As a general rule, avoid MS products that have revisions as letters, such as \\"ME\\" or \\"XP.\\" Stick to updates that are named after the numbered year (e.g. 98 or 2000) ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overpriced","review":"MS Office has certainly become the sort of standard for office suite software, but, it is just too darn expensive!

There's plenty of Woodian nonacting and mind-numbing dialogue, with a \\"twist\\" ending that generates more laughter than shock. Bela Lugosi somehow managed to avoid this turkey, but veterans Lyle Talbot and Herbert Rawlinson were not so lucky.

Furthermore, under the guise of a product activation(which must be activated in order to use the full version, otherwise you get the full version for a little bit before it reverts back to a demo), Microsoft limits the amount of computers you can install it on. I was only able to install it on two computers before it would not allow me to activate the product any longer, stating the product was already activated on another machine and to contact customer service. Overall, I would have to say that this product is grossly overpriced, and anyone looking for an office suite that is comparable, but much cheaper should check into Sun's Star Office(It works with Microsoft documents so it's worth it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful awful!!!","review":"Office kept freezing my computer.

If you have the original release, then that is really all you need. I was under the impression that the 8 bonus tracks were part of this concert?? If they are, the crowd noise has been edited away so it takes away the flavor of the \\"concert\\" sound and causes one to question their legitimacy. Those 8 bonus tracks also lack the energy of the show at hand? The last track on disc 2 is an obnoxious and goofy, different version of Johnny Q which I have heard somewhere else before and so is not part of the show.

All with the same cute blonde. That's it.What you don't get is anything the title promises. There's one whipping scene, but it shows nothing, nada, except for a mom and perverted son getting mentally excited outside in the hall listening to the sound effects.

Rabbits have very specialized gi tracts that have more similarities to a horse than say a hamster or gerbil. The most important element of a rabbit's diet is unlimited hay, preferablly timothy for older bunnies. This is also vital to a bunny's health since, unlike cats, they are unable to cough up any furballs that may form from hair swallowed during grooming. The hay helps to push the hair and other obstructions along the gi tract. Pellets shouldn't be the bun's only source of hay and should never have seeds or corn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste!!!!!!","review":"I bought this for my 1 yr 3 m Mini Rex, Thumper, and my 1 yr 3 m Netherland Dwarf, Princess.

The book contradicts one of McGraw's most frequent assertions (that you \\"can't change other people,\\" you can only change the way YOU relate to them), and it's hard not to draw the conclusion that McGraw did this for marketing reasons (i.e. he has made a strategic decision to go after the women who *haven't* been able to change themselves, and now would like to try to take a crack at changing their partners). Plus, the subtitle was clearly designed to cast as wide a net as possible, so the book would attract not only women seeking relationships, but women in relationships that leave something to be desired (and let's face it, that's about 90% of all women).

These are normally my very favorite low carb bar, hands down...not only are they filling, but they taste great too.The last order I received however, and this was still in May, was a complete MESS. The wrappers looked fairly normal but after opening the wrapper you could see that the chocolate coating had previously melted and hardened again so it was completely stuck to the inside of the wrapper. To make matters worse, as soon as each bar was opened the chocolate flaked off the wrapper and went EVERYwhere. (Can't even imagine how it must be to order them in July or August!)

These things are really good quality. This model is probably the best metronome I have every seen because it has everything I want in a metronome. A Korg brand metronome compared to any other brand is kind of like comparing a Texas Instruments calculator to a Casio or some other off-brand maker....i.e. If you want to invest in something really good then this is the way to go. Korgs are not cheap, but if you take care of them they will last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome tuner metronome","review":"Pros: the tuner has a sensitive mic great for acoustic tuning. well i love the metronome you can adjust tempo and beat great for practicing your strummingCons: the mic didn't mute when plugging in a electric guitar which can be frustrating if tuning in a noisy room"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product at an excellent price","review":"I am a professional musician (bassist) and teacher and have purchased several of these (like to have more than one at a time for use in student ensembles). I especially like the tuner part, which \\"reads\\" the extra-low pitches of the double bass very accurately. Notes as low as 40 hz seem to flummox many other tuners. The metronome function is great too. The price (around $25 from Amazon) is more than reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money","review":"I was excited when I bought the Korg TM-40 over two years ago, only to receive something of poor sound quality. It has many options to choose from from both the tuner and the metronome side, which I loved. But with the violin, the sound over powers the sound of the metronome.

Metronome is a beep though","review":"I'm new to guitar and have been told to get a metronome that clicks and not one with a beep. So far, it is not annoying me like was suggested.

The left side has the tuner buttons and the right side has its own controls for the metronome so it's very simple to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This tuner metronome has great quality for a wonderful price! I especially like the fact that you can use the tuner and metronome simultaneously as well as separately. The tuner is great, but I haven't used it in a noisy environment yet, and it is quite sensitive. The metronome has a good sound, but it's not as loud as I expected it to be. I play the flute, and I can hear it fairly well over my playing when it is set to the highest volume. The metronome can be set to move by normal metronome increments (108, 112, 116, 120...132, etc.) or by single steps. It also has great subdividing options. I love the tap in button which you can use to get the tempo from something you are listening to by tapping the button to the tempo as you hear it. Overall, the display screen is great, and the small size is really nice. It fits nicely even on a wire folding stand, but it has its own stand that works great for setting it on a table as well. It's just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I just purchased this tuner metronome. It works great I play both trumpet and french horn, I worried I wouldn't be able to hear the metronome, nut that is not the case it works fine.

It's a great item for the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tuner, picks up very low notes, even at lower dynamics.","review":"I am a professional tuba player, and have difficulty finding tuners that will tune my pedal register (lowest notes for a tubist). This tuner tunes all the way down to my pedal F (major 3rd below lowest \\"A\\" on piano). It has far exceeded my expectations.Its also handy having the metronome, which incidentally does not affect the tuner's ability to listen. Usually when you have both going, the tuner will \\"bump\\" for every beep of the metronome, this but metronome does not affect the tuner at all.This metronome/tuner is very handy for long tones throughout the entire range of my instrument. An added bonus is the feature that allows you to tap a beat, and it tells you how fast your tempo is. I have only seen this feature on very expensive metronomes, such as Dr. Beat.You can't beat the price either."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"If you are familiar with these, you will like this one. it works well 90% of the time .

Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tuner for Guitar","review":"I recently ordered this product from Amazon to tune a Les Paul standard. I'm impressed with the ease, accuracy, and precision of this tuner. The tuner will tune to the 1/10 Hz level for those of you who are interested getting your instrument tuned as accurately as possible. For electric guitar players, tuning the intonation is a must and a tuner such as this is perfect to maintain the proper tone (or change it accurately).This tuner has several inputs that allow you to play an electric instrument directly into it, or you can use the speaker (as I did) which seamed to work fine. The Korg TM-40 will consistently indicate if your instrument is either flat or sharp on a given note. Overall highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Purchased this tuner, and I can honestly say it is worthless. I play mandolin, and I've tried positioning this tuner near the mandolin, further back, numerous positions, tried tuning with and without a pick. This tuner will seem like it's about to grab the note,,then suddenly it seems to forget what it's doing. Especially when tuning the A or E strings on the mandolin, it just can't decide which note to indicate it is. On the E string, it will show E, then jump to A, or D, sometimes won't even show E at all......this tuner is worthless. I had a professional piano tuner try it, same thing. He said the device is basically worthless...my mandolin instructor concurrs.....don't waste time or money on this overpriced piece of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Interface","review":"Very good value.Pros: Compact and solid. Very nice, easy to use, full featured interface.Cons: Even in a quiet setting, tuner reading can be squirrelly; use a clip on mike for great results.

We are using it both with guitar and piano. Works well for both. Good value for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product for the price","review":"This is a nice product for the price and I definitely recommend it. It works well for tuning my classical guitar. I don't have problems with unstable display of the note being tuned as some have reported. The metronome does what it should. Some reviewers report insufficient volume for loud environments (e.g., drums) - the unit has an 1.8\\" (3.5 mm) output jack so you can input it into a receiver or wear a pair of earbuds with it. As noted, the character size on the display is fairly small, but readable. The unit is just the right size for me - not too big or too small. It sits easily on my music stand.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it would be better with larger display characters and if it included a backlit display. I also kind of wish it also came in black rather than silver, but that's really petty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korg TM-40","review":"This is a great product. It helps a lot with my practice time.

Esta combinacion de afinador con metronomo, el afinador es cromatico, podemos afinar nuestra guitarra, medio tono abajo o arriba. Tiene una opcion de afinar por sonido, es decir se oye un pitido con la nota musical que necesitas oir. El metronomo tiene muchas variaciones de tiempo, como de velocidad.Lo unico que me incomoda un poco, pero no es tan importante, solo es comodidad, es el hecho de que no tiene conector para voltaje, es decir, tranformador para conectar a la pared y no tiene la opcion. funciona con pilas AAA, aunque pues la duracion de las pilas es mucha, a menos que estes afinando cada 5 minutos.Definitivamente una compra de la que no me arrepiento, un buen precio, por un buen producto y muchas funciones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk","review":"After reviewing so many positive reviews from Amazon, I purchased Korg TM 40. Initially, it worked very well. I threw all original packings coming with this product. To my surprise, it stops responding to E pitch from my violin string after 10 days. For G, D, A, pitchs, it responds inaccurately. For G, it goes from F, F#, D, and stop at G. For A, it goes from G, F, E, and so on. Now I cannot return it to Amason because I do not have the original packing box. On the other hand, on the manual or Korg website, there is no phone number for you to call for help. It is a real piece of junk for this product and the service from korg. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metronome doesn't work. It's only a tuner.","review":"I ordered this product on this website after seeing all the good reviews about it. It has been used as a tuner for the past two months with no problems till today when the violin teacher wants to teach my boy how to use it as a metronome---------it just shuts itself down completely every time she pushes the \\"start\\" button. After going through the whole user's manuel and package box, I don't see any warranty or contact information anywhere in the U. S. besides one phone number for Japan. I should have bought it here locally so that I can get replacement more easily. Now I can only hope the merchant I bought this tuner/metronome from will take care of me.

Well, they also combine some pretty nice metronome features on this one for those tempo challenged folks like myself. In fact I have been using the metronome pretty heavily in my practice sessions of late. LOVE IT (well, OK, sometimes I hate it, the way it points out my flaws) This is my second one that I have owned--not that the other one gave me problems. I had it for years before I LOST it. When it came time to find another, it was a no brainer. I even looked just to see what is currently on the market, and hands down you can't beat the price or the features of this little jewel. If I find the other one (one can hope), I will keep both, to cover the several different instruments I play. You won't go wrong with this fine Korg product!

The lights make it so easy to tune. I like that you can get near to the pitch and see if you are sharp or flat.However, I need to hold the other strings down while I tune so I do not get harmonics. I might need a mic if I had to tune my violin in a crowded place.It is convenient that it has a metronome too. And it fits right on the music stand.I have used it for a month and can't think of anything wrong with it.I was a purist and used to use just a tuning fork. This product has convinced me to move into the 21st century!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full-featured but too quiet","review":"This all-in-one device has most of the features you would need. The tuner works as well as any of the cheap-o Korg tuners out there, at least when used with a clarinet. The problem is, the two AA batteries don't put out enough juice to allow you to hear the metronome while playing a wind instrument. Maybe if you played the lute or viol or something you'd be okay. I recommend looking for metronomes that have at least a 9v battery as they tend to put out enough sound to be usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic slip-on doesn't disappoint","review":"The price I purchased this pair of slip-on's was too good to pass on ($45), even though I really didn't need another pair of black loafers for business wear.

This time the lyrics get a little darker and cynical at parts, although the songs remain poppy, acessible, and, unfortunately, a bit forgettable. This is easy listening, which isn\`t too bad but it\`s not that exciting either and becomes a somewhat repetitive album. This meld of pop, lounge and kitsch is mildly entertaining but ìsn\`t enough to make a solid record. Still, there are some good songs here, like the pretty \\"The Great Divide\\" or the catchy \\"Been It\\", even if the rest ends up sounding the same. Cute and listenable, but that\`s it.

That's a very good thing! In other words, the songs are all great. Track #2, \\"Been It,\\" had an amazing guitar riff that sounds incredible.

My biggest beef with this movie is that it offers a very narrow range of characters to relate to: You have the good looking political type, the in-between jock and nice guy type and the whiner sissy baby type, it was this last type that really alienated me as a viewer. I really wanted the whiner to fly up into space where there is no air and just suffocate there so we could see what happens to the other two guys but it was not to be.

It is quite frankly gut wrenching and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness.

While CHRONICLE's furious climax is overwrought, it provides a satisfactory resolution. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan are obviously in their twenties, but fare well in their character's interactions. Michael Kelly overdoes his abusive father role, but seems appropriate for the film's overall tone.I enjoyed CHRONICLE's fantasy world, but like the clouds the boys fly through, it's ultimately lightweight fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?

The film is quite reminiscent of The Craft only with a male cast. In other words a group of teenage friends who are bonded by their sudden introduction to the supernatural.Dane DeHaan stars with a mopey vulnerability that's quite authentic, but unfortunately the film drives that single emotional note to the extreme. His character becomes implausible, difficult to sympathize with, and down right annoying. Generally I found especially the final act of this film (Spoiler: Andrew's major breakdown to a super villain) to be a huge failure, simply because it relied too heavily on multiple implausibilities.The film probably would have worked better if it stuck to its more basic human elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"If you think this is a good movie forget about it, this movie stinks.

Then Matt and his friend Steve stumble on a strange hole. They talk Andrew into filming as they explore the hole, cave and what it contains. What is in the cave can't be explained, yet gives them strange powers and brings out their dark side.Most of the movie is filmed from Andrew's viewpoint--literally--as though he is filming the movie himself. As a result the story is raw and gritty. This filming style is not my taste and I found it rather boring. However, it is a pretty good illustration of the pent up anger kids can have if they face verbal and/or physical abuse at home and/or school.

The details that are not provided by the director are what is typically filled in by the viewer's brain, allowing them to lose themselves in the movie. The story took time to progress anywhere, the whole time leaving the poor viewer to only fixate on why the camera was on the ground, out of focus, or the constant topic of dialogue.While an interesting viewpoint, the artifice for introducing the camera was apparent. In addition, the omnipresence of the camera in any individuals life was baffling.

What BLP started Oren Peli cashed in on with the Paranormal Activity movies. Now in a sea of found footage Chronicle comes out of left field. Its the story of a somewhat loner in high school whose life is forever changed when him and his friends find supernatural abilities.

The \\"found footage\\" camera work is infuriating - jerking constantly, like Blair Witch and Cloverfield - and the ending fizzles unconvincingly.

There was zero explanation of where their powers came from or a better explanation of why their noses kept bleeding.

And I love using them at night without disturbing my eyes, or anyone elses. The Xenon bulb isn't impressively bright. I say that because it does drain the battery at an impressive speed!

I liked the fact that it took pretty decent pictures.I did NOT like the fact that the refresh rate between pics (especially with the flash on) took anywhere from 6-12 seconds!!!! That's just ridiculous!I was CONSTANTLY missing out on really good shots and annoying friends and family members as I asked them to hold on while I waited for it to refresh.... UGH!I'm switching to a Canon, either the 790IS which I heard has a SUPER fast refresh rate, or the 890IS, which also has a fast refresh rate.Do yourself a favor and avoid this camera unless you like taking one picture every 30 seconds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am surprised I have not thrown this camera away yet!","review":"I purchased this camera right before we had our first child. Needless to say, I would have rather donated the money to charity! The flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that I can live with. The 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, I can not. Now I have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. Needless to say I think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"I took it back - the flash recharge time is the worst I've seen","review":"I'll make this short and sweet for you. This camera has a lot of features and settings, but the flash recharge time takes about 5-10 seconds. To put it another way, right after you take a picture, the camera shuts down (screen goes black) for up to 10 seconds! This makes the camera useless when you are trying to catch sports action or silliness. You are going to get one good picture (if the horrible shutter lag doesn't make you miss it) and thats it. If you are looking for a camera to take pictures of your kids or other candid shots, this is not the camera for you.I went with the Canon SD450 instead, it's ready to take another picture in less than 1 second. I am VERY happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon Coolpix 5600 - Lots of Options, Limited Battery Life","review":"I was attracted to the Nikon Coolpix 5600 by its price, extensive preset shooting modes, and compact size. It was put to the test on a one week vacation trip. The shooting modes were great - museum, sunset, night landscape, etc. And the size was handy. But there were two shortfalls. In one week, I went through two sets of batteries, taking a total of only 200 pictures. The second problem was the long time required to recharge before taking the next shot. It was a little annoying in daylight and painfully slow if I used the flash. Despite these two issues, it is an all around good camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it","review":"Bought it with the Viking 128 SD card offer for $235. The only other I was considering was the Canon A95. But the Nikon offer was good, and the pics are great! For a beginner like me, the Nikon is SO easy to work with, from changing the different scene modes to uploading pics(I use Picasa and not Nikon's software).Video quality is good, not excellent, but who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pictures of the kids...","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this camera, I was upgrading my curent HP Photosmart camera and wanted something with more options. I bought it today and got it home excited to take some pictures of my 10 month old. Well...every setting you have it on in the house shows the \\"blurry\\" caution. To take a picture you have to find the perfect touch on the button, if you don't hit it the right way it only focuses the picture rather than taking the picture. By the time you press the button again to take a picture your target (or mine being a 10 month old crawler) has already moved. This camera is definately not a point and camera. Also, it takes a long time for the flash to reset and the image to download and you can't take another picture until it is loaded. It is going back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow flash recovery","review":"I bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable. The problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds. During this time the camera's view finder goes black and you cannot use it. Because the camera is so slow, we have missed many important pictures of our children; consequently, we found that for any important family events, this is not the camera we use. I own Nikon 35mm SLR cameras and I am shocked that Nikon would sell this unusable product. If it is your life your recording, I recommend that you buy a different camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BAD FOR INDOOR USE","review":"I bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. When you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the price","review":"Doesn't get any better for the price. 5 Megapixel camera with automatic everything. Point let the camera do the work and shoot. These quality cameras usually run in the $2-300 range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure how to use it","review":"The camera seems okay, except there isn't a manual to tell me how to use it. I have no idea what to do really, so I am using my old camera and doing the best I can with it until I can get a manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"low-end\\" camera","review":"The camera is extremely easy to use, and does a great job with either pictures or video. When we first \\"went digital\\", this was the camera we chose, and were thrilled with it (5 MP was the \\"standard\\" then). When that camera was accidentally dropped on the lens and broke, I looked at the \\"new\\" offerings (more megapixels, more features), but decided nothing could beat our good old reliable Coolpix 5600 for the price, so bought another one just like our original on Amazon.com. We still love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars... Not worth it!","review":"IF your hand is steady and your subjects are willing to stay still for the series of flashes that go off before the final flash that takes the pictures, you do get a decent picture. However, if you are interested in taking spontaneous shots versus posed, this is NOT the camera for you. The camera shuts off for about 10 seconds in between taking shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"We have had this camera since 2005. It has been a great little camera for our family. Lots of nifty settings, video. This camera is also sturdy. It has been neglected on so many family vacations, left in 100+ heat for hours, dropped numerous times, chewed on, and it still works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for beginners","review":"This is my first digital camera, and I love it! It's really intuitive and user-friendly, it takes great pictures, it's relatively compact, looks good, is a great price, and has tons of features.The flash recharge *is* slow, but it's only a few seconds and I don't mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for.","review":"This is kind of a crappy little camera. It has a lot of MP, sure, but more than I really need. The flash refresh rate is slower than you can imagine - it's a pain even just for casual picture-taking. I read about this in the reviews but thought it would be alright, so let me warn you: it really is very, very slow. The zoom is pathetic, and the close-up function is just not as versatile as I wanted. It takes a nice picture but just doesn't perform as well as I would like. It will be a real problem when I travel again and want close-up pictures while sightseeing. If you travel at all, I wouldn't recommend this camera. Get something with a slightly lower MP count, a better zoom, and a faster refresh rate. Since it was a Christmas present, I'm not sure I will be able to exchange it for something else, but I'm going to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of function in a small package","review":"This camera was everything I needed. I wasn't looking for professional quality, but just wanted to take and send pictures to stay in touch with family. There are many different automatic picture modes, and a printed 8X11 looked really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"Last year, I purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my Nikon 2100. I am extremely upset over this purchase I have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. The Nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside. The indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. However, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. I tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. The outdoor video works well on this camera too. I am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. This was definitely my final Nikon purchase ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another camera","review":"This isn't a bad camera, but it does not make very nice pictures. It's small and fine for a kid or someone who doesn't take their photos seriously, but my previous digital cameras have created much better quality pictures than this does. It is not very user-friendly unless you're in perfect daylight. using indoors or in darker lighting situations it is difficult. It has a lot of different lighting options, like party mode, and fireworks and skiing and action and so forth, but they just don't seem to work well. The action one gives a very grainy picture, whiel the party modes give a red underexposed picture. I miss my Minolta Dimage! I used my girlfriend's Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixel and LOVED it. I thinkit's comparably priced, only a little bit more, but totally worth the extra $."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon all the way....","review":"Since many years , nikon has been manufacturing outstanding cameras(digital and analog), for the masses , and this camera continues the tradation.It is a strict point and shoot camera , requiring minimal adjustment , and is only meant for the average user and not a professional photographer.Pros - Good picture quality, High quality lens and sensor.Small form factor with easy to understand buttons , good battery life..cons - 14.5 mb of internal memory is not enough and you have to purchase a new memory card(128 or 256mb).Flash recycle time is too much.(takes about 7 -8 sec to reload).overall , a good camera for the average user , but definetly not an option for professionals.Under 200$ , it is an excellent buy and offers one of the best perfomances in its price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worh buying","review":"I bought this camera a year ago at circuit city and can not stand using it. The flash recovery time takes forever and it does not matter if you change the battery settings. It takes a ton of blurred pics which is very fustrating because you have to constanlty retake photos. All of the extra settings on the camera such as fireworks, indoor/party, beach, etc...do nothing to enhance the quality of pics taken in those light conditions. The camera works better when no flash is required and you can keep your hand as steady as possible and continue to hold the camera steady after the pic is taken. Please do not waste your money on this digital camera. There are many others to choose from that will take high quality photos with less headaches. I gave it two stars because I have managed to get some good photos out of the camera, but it has not been worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very slow","review":"This camera is great for picture quality but there are some big negatives. The biggest problem is the slow flash recharge--6 seconds! By then, if you're taking pictures of kids, they're long gone. Also, you have to wait for the LCD to be ready to take the next picture. You can turn the LCD off to save battery, but you have to go through 3 or 4 menu steps to do it, so it's not practical to switch off between using the LCD and not using it. Finally, on some the fixed focus modes (landscape), which cuts down on shutter lag since the camera is not hunting for the autofocus, you can't use a flash. Bottom line is that this is NOT a good camera if you take indoor pictures of anyone in motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I purchased this camera & the battery charger & 2 sets of rechargable batteries & a memory card a few months ago. I have had no problems. It takes great pictures & with the memory card it does great on those long picture taking events. I do highly recomend 2 sets of batteries, as the 2nd set has saved me many times while taking pictures. I enlarge a lot of them. There are a lot of features to use and I have not yet used all of them. I mainly use the close-ups, still pictures, action pictures, movies, portrait & different scene & sunset settings. So far all have been great. I have found that on the close-ups with the zoom it is a little hard for me to hold the camera by hand still enough, so I do some enlarging on the computer. A tripod would help the steadiness a great deal. I have been quite satisfied & so have people that have seen my photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it, too slow.","review":"I will make this quick. Great camera features, all that u will ever need. Whats the good of having good features if its too slow and u miss the shot's, yes u will miss several shots in a row as the battery weakens. The battery door is weak as well, will break off.Keep walking, Nikon has much better cameras then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"Probably would buy other camera if I could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. It is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. You have to learn how to be very steady with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty is short-lived","review":"The black inlay in the pattern falls off, even without frequent use. We only use these on special occasions and all the black inlay is coming apart. If you must have these, don't allow them to sit in water or put them in the dishwasher. Wash by hand and dry quickly, but even that probably won't help much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Beware: Black Inlay Peels","review":"My wife and I registered for these as part of our wedding registry. We liked the whimsy look of the spyro design.Within 6 mos of use, the black inlay began showing up in our cereal and on our dinner plates. It was falling out piece by piece. Lennox was very helpful in returning the faulty ones and replacing them. But by the end of another 3 months, all but two pieces had been replaced.Eventually we just selected another pattern and Lennox again was very helpful. If you search these out on other websites you'll see this is an ongoing issue. Lennox is a good and fair company though - doesn't turn me off to their other products."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely useful, practical and well-written book on JMS","review":"I found this book extremely useful. It is practical, well-written and provides the necessary ancillary information required to understand the topics. The author builds up nicely from messaging, to JMS basics, advanced JMS topics, IBM JMS offerings, hands-on scenarios(which bring it all together, especially for people who learn by doing), and deployment. In addition, throughout the book, the author provides implementation considerations, recommendations and best practices, which will be of great value to designers and developers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to WIW","review":"After hearing \\"When I Woke\\" and the even better first CD \\"Cruel Sun\\" (why isn't it for sale through Amazon?), I couldn't wait to hear \\"Remember\\". As the CD played, I kept waiting for the band to kick it into hyperdrive like they did on Ecstasy, Drum Trip and Martyr. Well, I'm sorry to say that I'm still waiting. Even Scattered (which also appears on the \\"Cruel Sun\\" CD) pales greatly when compared to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"wowie zowie","review":"i \\"borrowed\\" this cd from a friend and made it a point to never get around to returning it. rusted root is an amazing band, and their great use of multiple drums, voices, and other insturments is just incredible. this album is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not RR's best but still excellent","review":"A bit of a withdrawl from their past albums, however still a very good disk. \\"Remember\\" has a more Gaelic influence reminiscent of older Jetro Tull and departs a bit from the Phishy sound. This album will not be as popular with the college scene as their past albums but it is still Rusted Root and it is still excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Print - Not like Preview","review":"First of all this rating is for the quality of the book only, not the recipes. The book that was sent to me is missing all of the pictures that were shown in the preview - in fact there isn't a single illustration or picture in the entire book. In my opinion, they were one of the reasons to purchase the book. Secondly, the printing on this edition is VERY poor. Most pages are printed crooked and off center. It is a very poorly printed book.Even if the recipes are outstanding, I would not purchase the book. In fact mine will be heading back to amazon shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"low price, great deal","review":"I ordered Nero Wolfe cookbook and it arrived within a week.

Not bad for a second reference though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative BUT - Not Enough for the Exam","review":"This book has some information but not enough to prepare you to take the exam. The preparation questions are nothing close to the real exam questions, could have offered better Scenarios and how this might be used in real life Mid - to Large Organizations. Sybex is a closer match offering Exam Questions, Flash Cards (for PC & Palm), and WINSIM - a great tool if you are not fortunate enough to run a lab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good AD Book","review":"Well like the rest of you I needed this book for the exam. It is very well put together and they have done a great job on the majority of the book. The Examples in the Real World Projects area could use some better explanations. I did like the fact that they repeated the installation instructions at the end of the chapter.All in all it may not be enough for the test, but exam prep books arent really for that anyways!

I recommend this exquisite Exam Prep \\"Windows 2000 Directory Services Design\\" to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still in DRAFT!","review":"As I read this book I felt like an editor. Questions in the back did not always have the correct answer. Sometimes the answers were swapped with other questions and others the answer did not match the text. (ex. page 612 #17 & #18) Other errors in the book include the author telling you that FSMO's stands for \\"fixed standard master operators\\" and in the next section defining FSMO as \\"flexible Single-Master Operation\\". (pages 392 & 393). Which is it? Not the issues you need while learning advance topics like Windows 2000 AD.Also, the book is labeled as \\"exam prep\\". Why then does the author included completed sections that are not on the exam? An exam prep book is meant to cover the exam.I currently hold eight different IT certifications and never have seen a worse \\"study guide\\". And with the book being somewhat of a \\"draft\\", I would not trust the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Blues","review":"An absolutly brilliant selection of exclusive performances for the BBC documentary of the same title.

Many of the performers on this recording are long gone and today it is hard to find performances by them.

It's got all the ingredients in a good lesson: principles, supporting ideas, and germane examples to demonstrate the applicaion of the ideas.This book breaks down the studying process into clear steps. Which makes it easy to follow. As usual, Skip uses alot of cool quotes to express his ideas. I personally like these quotes very much.

I wish the child stars father hadn't been such a \\"stage Mom\\" that actually ruined his kids career and life in many ways. Which is why he didn't do the 3rd movie.

Much to the disappointment of many potential buyers, the answer to both questions is an emphatic YES! I love these films -- even number 4, which was widely panned -- but enough is enough. My recommendation would be this: if you have \\"The Caper Collection\\" don't buy this, there is nothing new here. If you don't own any of the movies, either \\"The Caper Collection\\" or this one will do, if you want all four movies.

What can I say about it? Let me just put it from a perspective of a newbie into Blues and Southern Rock. This band is unbelievable. The soul they pour into each track is just impossible to describe. Two tracks, as a reference: \\"It's not my cross to bear\\" and \\"Midnight Rider\\" are so touching that every time I hear tham I am transported. Though lacking some of those 15-20 minute long solos (grab the live \\"Fillmore...\\" album for some of that), this combo album reminds of the best British Blues of the sixties (Yardbirds, Cream, Clapton, Beck, Page)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Virtuosity","review":"Freddy Gardner plays the type of music you can memorize and play for auditions.

Also I had a problem with the lense, the cover didn't close all the way when I turned it off, but I'm pretty sure that's because I've dropped it like 3 times...oh pavement.Overall, it's still a very excellent camera, even more so now that it's not $250!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Problems","review":"I have had this camera for less than 1 year and now it won't work anymore and comes up with the message \\"Battery Exhausted\\" even when brand new batteries are installed.

Sure, the camera FUNCTIONS. It takes the pictures and all.But I must say, the shutter speed is exceptionally slow and almost every picture i take the camera suggests that the picture is blurred, and indeed it is. Blurred pictures means less quality. Also in dark rooms, if I try to use flash, the flash takes really long to react, and then the picture turns out really grainy.

I chose the Nikon brand because Nikon used to be a premium brand of film cameras and I already own a 35mm Nikonos. After a few hundred photos the lens extension motor on this camera failed rendering the camera completely useless. Both Nikon and the camera store where I bought the camera gave me repair estimates of $100. No thanks! I've already been burned once. Searches on the internet reveal that failure of this particular motor is a very common problem with the 4600 model. Obviously I wish I'd known that before I wasted my $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Battery- DEFECT!?!!","review":"I am not the only one.

Is there any remedy? I didn't purchase a warranty. Even if I had it would have expired. It seems that this problem occurs after a certain amount of usage. I would recommend against this camera, if not for the delay in pictures, then for the fact that after 6 months it is useless. What a waste of money. NO MORE NIKON for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much better cameras than this for same price","review":"I should have read the online reviews before buying this camera. The flash lag time is really a problem and I also found that the range of the flash wasn't great enough.

All was great until I took a picture with the flash,and it took FOREVER (when taking pictures of children,anything over 2 second's is forever) for it to recharge!! The old Nikon was not like this,and I just dont know why they made it like this. The screen was also grainy looking. I ended up taking it back 3 day's later and buying a Kodak that is wonderful! Nikon REALLY need's to reconfigure this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good $115 camera","review":"If you are looking for a good, small digital camera for a decent price that has great photo quality this is it. Sure it lags a bit between flash photos, but most cheaper digitals do. People complain about blurry photos without a flash? Yeah cause it needs to keep the shutter open way longer. So, like any other camera in this situation- if you move it will blur. I find that it does the flashless stuff well otherwise. Not really and issue. Not many issues with this camera in my book. Just a decent camera. Oh yeah and cool macro mode too.Good camera to bang around with for a few years while the technology continues to become cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems everywhere","review":"The camera works fine until you realize that the batteries are down and you change them and still never starts again.

I thought the camera was a goner but eventually I was able to fix it myself. About 6 months after that I wasn't as lucky. I got the dreaded error message. The screen of death hasn't disappeared since, no mater how many times I try to troubleshoot the camera.When the camera was in working condition, it was pretty decent. The pictures are pretty good. Not remarkable, but sufficient for a novice. The video is very poor quality - grainy and remember there is no sound, so a lot of the tings that you want to videotape are going to be useless taped with this camera.If I was certain that my camera's death was one instance out of many, I'd even go as far as to recommend this camera to others, but from what I had read over the Internet, this is a common problem for Nikon 4600. Do yourself a favor and buy another camera, if you want it to last to its two-year anniversary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera quit working 1 week past warranty","review":"I bought the Coolpix 4600 camera for my daughter for Christmas.

Taking pictures with flash is a big joke, u miss your best moments waiting for the flash to be ready again, it takes forever trying to get the camera to focus in most modes. Was at my little girls graduation and got so frustrated trying to get it to focus to take a pic of her receiving her certificate. I almost smashed it. Very bad production by Nikon.

The Battery life is 2-3 uses when using the flash which is just nuts, you need to keep a 12 pack of AA's handy if you shoot with this camera. I've also on three occasions taken a large number of photographs only to find they were not there when I went to offload them from the memory card. The camera would act like it was taking the shot, even to the point where it would warn of blurry shots and then the photos were just nowhere to be found. look elsewhere for a better camera"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble.","review":"1.

I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click.

My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is \\"impossible\\" for that kind of \\"accident\\" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) \\"I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault.\\" Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"A lot of people are talking about issues with the delay after you take a pic. with flash, but it really only bothers me if i'm in a big rush.

I never get blurry pictures except when i'm not using flash. The pictures usually come out great! The red-eye remover works pretty good on this camera, but the night visions and stuff dont really work, but if its dark you just use flash. I love this camera!

I also have a problem with the quality of the photos; a lot of them are slightly blurry and I have to use my photo editing software to sharpen them. Everyone once in a while, the camera seems to decide that it's had enough and just stops.

I was very dissapointed in the speed of the pictures. Besides the picture actually taking several seconds to focus and decide when it's ready to take the picture, it actually shuts down for 10 or so seconds to re-charge the flash.

Tocohl Susumo (our Hellspark protagonist) is wonderful as the only good cultural interpreter in a mass of surveyors from vastly different worlds, Maggy, her computer is a delightful mix of rapid thinking and small-child personality, and her aliens (the Sprookje) are truly alien without being unbelievable or trite.

I thought it wouldn't work \\"out loud,\\" but after 30 minutes of reading this aloud to my ladyfolks, she kept me reading for hours. We love Tocohol & Maggy and expect that they could show up anywhere, any time. And the murder-mystery colliding with first-contact story during an AI story, featuring an emsemble cast... AND, the story is out of an imagination I might claim didn't exist, but then who wrote Mirabile?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Lover...but NOT this one!!","review":"I only hope my son grows to like this video. I could not believe how BORING it is. I am now questioning if the reviews I read off of this site are real or not. I was expecting something upbeat and fun...like a Hap Palmer Baby Songs Video. This is not it. The music is not at all cathcy and it is somewhat low background music. The kids don't say a word. You just watch kid after kid get dressed with average music playing in the background. I say spend your money on something else...your kid will get dressed eventually...I did and my mom didn't have a video for me. I need to add that I did call the phone number on the back of the box and one of the mom's who made this video was willing to refund my money if my son does not grow to like the video. She was extremely nice and stood behind her product. So, I'm keeping it for now and maybe he will like it someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with glasses","review":"These binoculars work great with or without eyeglasses on.

Ryan, Kristy, and a character introduced in the previous novel go to Moscow in the hopes of finding the necessary equipment to fix the gate.

Compared to their earlier released and especially their 1997 release this is not nearly as good. The sound is more towards the generic rock sound with bland lyrics. No lyrics have been included in the booklet but a list of whom plays what. The photographs are quite nice. 2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it","review":"Yet again, I get my hopes up for the return of the Spiritualized that I once loved.

His argument is based on rigorous logic.

Then as time went on I found myself humming it and I'd have to hear it again and again. It's definitely not your run of the mill poppy music stuff that's out right now, I think it's ahead of its time. The lyrics are my favorite part, I would describe them as simplistically complex and most likely misinterpreted by the listener.

I was looking for something different and new to try, and I found Deante Dance. I am very happy with the results. After just a few weeks, I see my body getting toned and my clothes are feeling looser. That is really keeping up my motivation. What I really enjoy about Deante is that it is different from the basic exercise videos. You feel like you are dancing, while using your muscles and burning off calories. The dance instructor Karen teaches the moves and she is very easy to understand. I was dancing after the first try. The music is great and the beat keeps me moving. I have been using these DVDs almost every morning and now it is my routine. I recommend these DVDs highly to anyone that wants to get a good work out while they are dancing.

I was very dissapointed in the John Cougar version of \\"are you sure Hank done it this away\\" and I love John Cougar. Cougar adds a lot of flavor to his music but this was not his calling. Travis Tritt hit the nail on the head with his version, but lets face it Travis is a good ole'boy which Waylon was from the start. I was also dissapointed in Jessie Colter's version of \\"Storms never last\\" she of all people should know how to make a tribute to his music, after all they wrote and did that song together originally. I was very suprised that Kid Rock and Kenney Chesney did such a great verison. Bottom Line, this is not the heart and Soul of Waylon's music, but it was a nice attempt to remember one of the last great OUTLAWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible at best","review":"You have got to be kidding me. Waylon is all about Texas country. The only people that are singing on this album is a bunch of Nashvile high-rollers. Mellencamp singing Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way? is pathetic.Where's Cory Morrow and Pat Greens version of the song? It is by far the best remake of the song. If you would like to hear a good version of the sound get Full Exposure by Cory Morrow. My second reason this is a terrible remake of a song is Kenny Chesney's remake of Luckenback Texas. That song is one of the greatest texas country songs of all times. Why on earth is he singing it? No one but Willie should beable to sing that song. All Kenny did was butcher a true great song. He just needs that keep singing about how his tractor's sexy! This is a overall horrible album that I wouldn't even waste my computer's memory on moreless spend [money] for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great tribute","review":"I was excited to get this CD- what a disappointment! Travis Tritt's \\"Lonesome, On'ry, and Mean\\" is good, as is Dwight Yoakum's \\"Stop The World and Let Me Off\\"- James Hetfield's version of \\"Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out Of Hand\\" is interesting in the way he varies the tempo- the rest is poor! We already have several versions of Jessi singing \\"Storms Never Last\\"- why not pick a surprising song to sing? Alison Krauss' whispering version of \\"You Asked Me To\\" is weak- it just crawls along. Kenny Chesney's and Kid Rock's \\"Luckenbach\\" has too much chat- just sing the song, OK? Anyway, there's no point in buying this CD- you already have Waylon singing the definitive versions and these add nothing to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waylon would not like this CD","review":"Obviously some of the would-be record guru's got together and decided who should record what on this album. I'm sure as anti-Nashville establishment as Waylon was, he would not approve. Most of the so-called artists on this album couldn't carry Waylon's picks let alone his guitar case. Brooks & Dunn singing Waylon, give me a break. They don't belong here. Save your money on this disc and buy they other one \\"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\\". Much better bang for your buck and the price of CD's these days, that's important."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I've Always Been Crazy\\" Tribute To Waylon","review":"Either 1 of these so-called Tributes would have Waylon rollin' over in his Grave.

Katz gets it wrong! Pakistani intelligence arrested Ramzi Yousef in Pakistan due to a Pakistani informer ( a new terrorist recruit) decided to cash in on the reward. THE FBI, THE CIA, AND THE DSS HAD LITTLE TO DO with his capture! Ramzi was wanted worldwide for everything from trying to assasinate pakistani leaders to the WTC bombing and after his arrest Pakistani intel turned Ramzi over to the DDS and they flew him back to the U.S. for prosecution.This book contains lots of unattributable interviews and sources, no index, no bibliography and the back cover reveals nothing about the author's credentials. It is unlikely that U.S. or Pakistani intelligence granted any interviews with this author and retired officials would not reveal any info. due to the current nature of the subject matter today. So the contents of the book can't be trusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic True Account of America's Global Heroes","review":"This is the first book to truly talk of the efforts of DSS, the State Department's little known yet all-important law enforcement entity. While other books about America's war against terrorism have focused on the shortcomings of the CIA and FBI in stopping al-Qaeda in its tracks, this book focuses on America's first true victory in this bloody struggle--the capture of World Trade Center bombing mastermind Ramzi Yousef--and how the handwriting for attacks such as 9/11 had been on the wall for years.Other accounts might pick and steal from this book's true stories of the federal agents who serve this nation in some of the most distant global outposts in the world, but Katz's amazing book remains an original and an American classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book about DSS","review":"The Diplomatic Security Service is most probably one of the newest federal law enforcement agencies in the United States.So almost nobody know nothing about it.But Mr. Katz do know these guys. Almost an insider look.In a way the book is a companion to the documentary Badges without borders. Explain in great detail their work fighting terrorism and have a brief explanation about their role protecting U.S: diplomats all around the world and foreign ambassadors and representatives in U.S. soil. These are the guys behind Secretary of State Colin Powell.The book is well written and in no way is boring. Pay the money without doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"What makes this book so unique is the fact that it was a work in progress long before 9-11. It appears as if the author had been writing the story of the one federal law enforcement agency to take al-Qaeda seriously for years before the horrific attacks of September 11. The book is not a finger-pointing I told you so look at 9-11, but rather a beautifully-constructed profile of the Diplomatic Security Service and its global war against terrorists. The DSS are heroes--and it is about time people learned about what they did. I hope that the author is working on a sequel. I'll bet, after reading this book, that DSS, will be in the forefront of bringing bin Laden and his lieutenants to justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendent","review":"The music is so eerily beautiful it will make the hair stand up all over your body--particularly track 2. The vocalist is amazing. Not recommended for listening in the car just because it's pretty quiet and you won't be able to hear it over the ambient sounds of driving. Instead, listen in a quiet place while relaxing. Tracks 5 & 6 are more lively and louder to bring you back to Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entrancing","review":"This CD was \\"instrumental\\" (pardon the pun) in my learning to play the didjeridu. My friend and I would sit down and play along and the trancing effects only got more powerful. The beats are incredible the sound is amazing and it's a spiritual journey as well.

I found the tone regarding men offensive to the degree of which the author lost credibility in my mind. I understand from the reviews that the first third of the book is that way. I have no problem with an author trying to teach and have fun at some expense of men, but I could not get past the stereotyping - and don't expect your man to share the same experience from the book. Perhaps I will give the later chapters a try and ignore the errors noted in these valuable reviews. But I give it one-star for wrecking what could have been a helpful dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"It went into the trash","review":"I read this as a layperson and came to the conclusion that it was a skewed collection of misinformation meant only to cushion between its pages the promotion of specific drugs.

Not this one--it went straight into the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the research","review":"There is no evidence that women speak roughly 3 times as many words per day as the author asserts. In fact, existing research indicates a rough equality, or even that men speak a little MORE than women. Nor is there any support for her assertion that men think of sex every 52 seconds. These beliefs are part of the popular mythology, but they don't appear to be supported scientifically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question Accuracy","review":"Anyone thinking of purchasing this book should listen to the Jan. 3, 2007, NPR Fresh Air program with Terry Gross. Geoffrey Nunberg credibly refutes some of Dr. Brizendine's claims. For example, she states that women talk more than men, using 20,000 words a day while men use only 7,000.

It's more of a gossip piece backed by limited and inaccurately applied clinical experience. Otherwise the author basis her theory on biases and backwards analysis of social situations. Not at all scientifically based."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not read this","review":"This is the single most poorly researched book I have ever read. It is rife with logical fallacies, glaring omissions, vapid thought, and meaningless anecdotes. Unless you are a misogyny apologist, you really have no reason to read this book. I would go into more detail, but I believe other reviewers have sufficiently critiqued the book for its failings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book everyone should read","review":"This is an amazing book that all men and women should read!!! Its fascinating how different we actually are physically and how that has an effect on our reactions, emotions and perceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"File in Fiction, not Science.","review":"The problem with this book is that Brizendine actively misrepresents research and uses numbers that are basically made-up. Her \\"science\\" doesn't stand up to scrutiny.For instance, on differences between male and female speech patterns she claims that women speak three times more words than men in a day, and speak almost twice as fast. In fact, no reliable studies had been done when the book came out. Prompted by the book, somebody actually bothered to measure, and it turned out that men and women speak about the same number of words, and men speak (very slightly) faster. You can get details about the studies from the excellent blog LanguageLog, which reports on real linguistic science. Google for the post titled \\"Gabby guys: the effect size\\".In sum: This book should be filed in the Fiction section, not the Science section."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS","review":"Actually, this book has negative value: Not only can I not give it to anyone, for fear of perpetuating the notions therein; but I can't throw it away without wasting a couple pounds of paper.At first astonished by the amazing differences she cites between male and female brains, I started to track down her references. They were ancient, vague, and wholly unconvincing. Lesson learned: If it sounds unbelievable, it probably is unbelievable.What a shame, when there is so much fascinating research on the real differences between male and female brain function. The truth would have been much more interesting than this misleading wad of pop-psychology. And much less destructive to the causes of science literacy and the understanding of human behavior.Brizendine has done readers, and her fellow educators, a stunning disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"This is a wonderfully informative book and a must read for anyone seeking a full understanding of human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable, READABLE Summary of Recent Research","review":"I am recommending this to all my friends. I am buying it for my adult sons.I thought, because of its readability, that this was some pop psychology book. Instead it has excellent research tools. There are copious notes (given without numerical text citation, rather listed by page number in the end). There is an extensive bibliography. I think it has the best of both worlds: readable and interesting style, documentation that allows us to verify the infomation.I think it is a must read for men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just WOW","review":"I picked up this book after perusing the reviews and was definately not disappointed.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Other critical reviews have done a good job in rebutting a lot of what is in the book, so I will not go into a lot of detail. But as a male reader, I found much of the book to be biased, unscientific, and nonobjective. The author seems to have written a book to \\"preach to the choir\\" -- a book written for women so they can feel good about their way of thinking and their emotions, and feel superior to the poor men with their less advanced brains, apparently good for nothing but sex and aggression, according to the book. I am a scientist, although not in the medical profession, and I found much of the author's reasoning unconvincing, relying mostly on anecdotes, with only rather hand-wavy arguments to draw questionable conclusions from observations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book full of inaccuracies and jumping into irrational conlcusions","review":"I had to buy this book for a Counseling class and it was disappointing. In a world where Dr. Phil is a psychology guru, I'm not impressed that this book was a best seller. Nevertheless, best seller does not mean accurate book. It just makes a good work at captivating the general public. However, it fills people with misinformation and beliefs, not facts.The moment I started reading I was pretty sceptical. Being a graduate student in Clinical Psychology pays off! I quickly started observing severe mistakes in the conclusions the author describes based on my background in Neurological Assessment, Psychobiology, Molecular Biology, Social Psychology, and many other Psychology classes. Then I started reading reviews made by Ph.D.'s in the field of Psychology and felt glad that someone else was disproving several claims and pointing out some fallacies and mistakes.Definitely a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part Revealing, Part Depressing","review":"Read as a man, the book basically tells you that, no matter what you believe or what women say about the qualities they are looking in a man, they are hard wired to choose the one with cash, a house in the Hamptons, and clothes from Bergdorf & Goodman. I knew that already. So: squander your money (if you have any) or stay single. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this book!","review":"I loved this book. It really helped me undertand a)what mt preteen is going through, b)why for one week (each month) I'm extremely communicative and for another week I can't string a sentance together. I was really surprised by the negative reviews written here. I've recommended this book to all my girlfriends. I'm thrilled with it. It is difficult to find a brain-book that the non-medical community can understand and enjoy. It's a little dramatized with the narrative, but it has a ton of relevent information. I dog-eared about 50 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched and written","review":"I get it now! This book enlightened me to why girls/women do what they do and feel and think the way they do. Confirms what's going through my mind.

A linguist from UC Berkeley ripped the book, saying the author's various claims, eg women use three times as many words a day as men, that they talk faster...are simply not true. The first claim, for example, was supposedly taken from a book by a self-help guru, who apparently just made it up. The linguist (can't recall name) claims the opposite is true for both these claims; men use more words than women and also speak slightly faster. The author's factoids are easily accepted because they agree with our prejudices. He goes on to dispute Brizendine's claims in other areas as well.If true, this is disturbing. It assumes either ignorance or dishonesty. Either is not something one would expect from someone who portrays herself as an expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"News to me!","review":"What an interesting book.

Nope! This is a lackluster collection of already over-played schmotz and dopey remixes. While my faith in the series remains strong, there's little chance I'll be revising this collection with any regularity. Disc 2 is especially tedious and, oddly, not dance-able. Move on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST CD I EVER HEARD","review":"I bought this CD for my friend, but i tried to listen to it and it's the WORST CD I EVER HEARD. Louie Devito is the worst DJ also and all of his CD's are so poorly produced. Songs are separated at the weirdest places and songs are POORLY blended.

Me and my friends worshipped that CD and couldnt wait till NYC 4 cameout. But as time went on and we really got into dance music... we figured out that Devito just takes the top hits from ANY category and crams them onto a CD. I mean common!... Stacie Orrico!??! Then people who only hear these songs in clubs or on the radio think hes the king because hes got them on his CD. Do yourself a favor and DONT follow CD stores 1-10 top hits concerning Dance, techno, trance and so on.

The battle with Hyperion was great and it was fitting for Magik to go out the way she did. Looking back at this book after reading the whole \\"no time broker, just time breakers\\" stuff, it doesn't really make sense for the bugs to have the heroes fight each other to the death since they could simply have had the time broker appear and tell them that they have completed their last mission and sent them home. If they wanted Hyperion to die they could have scoured the multiverse to find the biggest, baddest fighters to handle him. But forgetting all of that, it was still very enjoyable.

A truly fascinating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the truth!!","review":"This book answers many questions about the life and times of Jimmy Hoffa, and also raises many other questions about the relationship between the Kennedys and the Mafia. All the names ring true. The book casts new light on such things as the JFK murder, the misuse of the Central States Pension Fund, and the feud between Hoffa and Robert Kennedy. Frank Sheeran is quite believable as he spins tale after tale in this well written, fast paced book. Sheeran ties up a lot of loose ends about everything from the Hoffa disappearance to the murder of Joey (Crazy Joe) Gallo in NY's Little Italy. He speaks with the authority of someone who was a participant in these episodes of modern American history. It's a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HELL, I BELIEVE HIM","review":"This book takes you through the union wars of Jimmy Hoffa. It also covers Hoffa's death, as well as Crazy Joe Gallo's death with enough evidence to convince you that Frank Sheeran was atleast in the know, if not the shooter. I'm always skeptical of guys pumping themselves up in these books, but this guy convinced me. Just a fantasic read!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Apologies","review":"Very well written account of a violent life that culminated in an astounding \\"death bed confession,\\" obtained by an apparent expert interviewer, Charles Brandt (the author). Charles Brandt artfully combines concise narration with Sheeran's ongoing, autobiographical accounting of his life. This accounting describes, without apology, Sheeran's involvement in the mafia, teamsters and several noteworthy historical events, not just Hoffa's \\"disappearance.\\" It is apparent that Brandt has a respect, if not a certain affection for his subject, but is able to maintain his objectivity as an investigator/author while penning his narrative portion of this outstanding text. Great read that lives up to its dust jacket accolades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful events","review":"Never really following or understanding this historical event, I chose this book to give me clear information.

He had heard about it from other friends.."},{"rating":"1","title":"too credulous about his source","review":"The notion that statements made near the end of one's life are part of an effort to get into heaven and so are uniquely credible seems a tad convenient and romantic to me. Sheeran could have had other motives for these statements -- he even may have wanted to commit a final bit of mischief by writing himself into famous homicides with which he had nothing to do.Those who are passionately engaged with the subject matter of this book will read it, and will decide for themselves what they believe or don't believe, of course.Personally, I doubt that this is the last word."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of Jimmy Hoffa","review":"Well written and insightful,truly gives you the feel and overall understanding of just exactly what was going on in that time frame be it the Beginnings of Hoffa the man or reasons behind his disappearance.aHistorical master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and Revolting","review":"This is a peculiar book in the fact that at times I found myself riveted by the narrative as well as revolted by almost the very same narrative. Yes, the mystery of Jimmy Hoffa is intriguing, and the tales told in this book certainly paint a picture that is believable enough to possibly put an end to that mystery. But at the same time it's absurd to read this and find yourself fascinated by so much morbid material. Putting an end to someone's life is taken so lightly, that you almost forget that you're reading page after page of disposable humanity. I did find it interesting but was happy to have it done with. You could do worse, for sure. And again, the story here is likely the final chapter in the Hoffa book. But you can also find more uplifting stories to read with your time. If you like Bambi, you won't like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Tale of a Descent Into Corruption","review":"This book sits on the shelf next toRadical Son: A Generational OdysseyandLight's on at Signpostas one of the finest biographies/memoirs I've read. Brandt passes too quickly perhaps over key developments in Sheeran's life, his war experiences shaping what he would later become being an example, but he also peppers the work with vignettes that help capture Sheeran's nature (only an Irish Catholic would stop at a red light in North Philly at 2 in the morning). I would of liked a more in depth examination of the subject (Sheeran's daughters offer powerful testimonies) but what we have is still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Thrilling!

And despite being largely formulaic in approach (..his lead characters all seem to be the same) he succeeds in entertaining the reader. And the same holds true with 'Cat Chaser'.With 'Cat Chaser' we have an ex-military guy in south Florida involved doing hanky-panky with the wife of a former monster from a Carribean country (Dominican Republic) before the Americans kicked him out. The outcome is inevitable but along the way we meet strange characters (the usual Miami oddballs, and a few imports from the Dominican Republic) who do some very strange things. While here are also a good number of funny bits Leonard is no match for the Florida comic crime novel master Carl Hiaasen.Bottom line: a fun if not enthralling Elmore Leonard venture.

Now more than the chocolate chip bars taste sour- the peanut butter and peanut butter and chocolate are the same.I am unwilling to buy from them again- they offered to ship me a replacement sample and never went through with it.

I play golf almost every day and meal times tend to occur during a round. Rather than stop at the turn to get a sandwich, I eat a Clif bar and press on. They are satisfying both flavorwise and from an energy replenishment perspective. They don't melt in the heat and are very convenient to keep in the bag. I first tried Clif bars after an off road bicyclist friend told me about them. The price on Amazon is good (not great) but still much cheaper than buying them at the grocery store. I recommend them to anyone that needs an energy boost in the middle of something that cannot be stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid lasting energy, good taste","review":"These bars give me a very solid, consistent energy throughout the day I've never experienced before, while hiking and biking. The solid energy is amazing, I feel right where I want to be on the energy scale for quite a while. If that alone is not enough to buy them, the taste is between good and great, with a texture somewhat like thick oatmeal and caramel. It also sits in the stomach well when doing intense activity right afterwords. The only improvement might be in the taste going from good to great. It would be hard to beat Klif bars. 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, but could be more varied","review":"Delicious and satisfying, and always fresh. I am pleased with my subscription to this variety pack. That said, I wish there was a bit more variety in this pack. Considering that there are a couple dozen different varieties of Cliff bar, for this pack to have only 3 different bars is disappointing. Plus, chocolate, chocolate plus peanut butter, and peanut butter are more like 2 varieties.

It arrives as unfinished wood, so you're free to match your cabinet by staining, polying or just leaving it natural.I used a red oak stain and a wipe on polyurethane finaish that matched my dry bar cabinetry very well. The end result was a custom look that completely blends in as if original (photos uploaded). I see that it's gone up a bit in price since my purchase, but it's still a great buy and a time saver over hand making one or using metal hangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all hardwood","review":"I thought I was getting an all hardwood rack but only the stem holders are oak, the rest is pine. When you stain it to match surrounding cabinents the contrast is apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 years and still hanging!","review":"Yes, it's been 2 years and this still hangs reliably. Just like other reviewers, I used a strip to block the other end so the glass won't slide through all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"stemware rack","review":"It is of nice quality. It l looks great. It holds the perfect number of stemware. Very happy with purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Unlike the previous rack that i bought and returned, the manufacturer listed specific dimensions so that I could make sure that our over sized wine glasses would fit. Easy to paint to match decor, easy to install, and everything fits as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"wine glass rack","review":"thanks again. this was just what we were looking for and again we couldn't find this in any store .Russell Newland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought this for my 5th wheel RV to hang inside an upper cabinet over my coffee cups. I am now able to hang my acrylic stemware over the cups-utilizing wasted space and keeping the stemware from toppling over when the trailer moves. Product in perfect condition-smooth to the touch with all seams glued tight. Great price, quick delivery. And to think I considered going through the trouble of making one myself!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wine rack for the price","review":"After reading the reviews, I made sure I put a backstop to one side of the wine rack (I used a glue gun and glued corks along the back edge so the wine glasses wouldn't go flying out the back end). The rack is sturdy, well designed and simple, easy to install. And the fact that it is stainable is great so you could match it to your cabinet trim. Definitely a recommended buy!Also, the wine rack showed up way ahead of the estimated delivery date, even with the standard shipping option selected."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Stemware Rack","review":"This rack may be slightly overpriced, but it does what it was built to do. It's easy to install, it's sturdily built, it cannot dammage your glasses on its own, and it holds 18 glasses well. Honestly, what more is there to say?Short of building a rack on your own, this is the best option for your under-the-cabinet-storing-of-stemware-in-a-hanging-fashion needs. If you're still reading this and haven't bought it yet, are you just being polite or do you really not want a convenient storage method?If you were just being polite, then thank you. So kind of you to keep on reading this despite my malicious intent in making such a simple review so unnecessarily long. Did I mention you should buy this product yet?
