It was also funny to see that the family had never heard of the Paris Hilton video or when Nicole and Paris saw the only bathroom.

They have no moral integrity! But that's the beauty in this show!Paris and Nicole sometimes don't realize how brainless they are.

Now, with the success of this horrendous TV show, her popularity has soared, and so has her ego. Apparently, she changed her phone number, realizing the mistake she made when the Leding family called her after the show ended--JUST ONCE! Even the littlest Leding, no more than three, realizes how much better life is without Paris and Nicole hounding him. It is sad to think of what America has come to by making such trash a hit. Horrid reality shows like this one stay on the air, but worthwhile series like WONDERFALLS aren't even given a chance to succeed. It is pathetic.

A country that glamorizes their antics of drunken driving and heroine addiction to the point that FOX decided that they simply HAVE to put the media magnatized wh!#es on television. What was the result? Well, practically everybody in this decaying and rotten nation tuned in to see what these pampered alcoholic and drug-addicted celebrities would do in a rundown \\"Clampett\\" filled town.

Whatch them turn the little country city of Altus upsidedown and making new friends by learning the meaning of family tradition.This pack contains the entire first season plus extras like missing videos, funny stories and even a preview of what was about to come like Paris and her sister Nikki packing for the trip.

Here we are, producing the trashiest show our nation can dream up and expect to be hailed as grand heroes. Well, I saw nothing heroic in pulling this little stunt. All it did was make us look like a bunch of arrogant, spoiled, and unruly creatures. Paris and Nicole put a bad name on American youth everywhere. A lot of us are hardworking people who actually have brains, creativity, and such so to speak and then you have these two bimbos making us look like a bunch of nimrods! And it just goes to show that all it takes to be famous these days isn't talent, but money. It's all about the money these days.

My constant thought as I watched the show was \\"If this is the future of America, we're in deep trouble.\\"Ritchie and Hilton manage to make fun of all things not L.A or New York and come across as spoiled brats who simply must get their way no matter what.

The pics and stories are haunting and one needs to read story by story. It's way too much for one sitting. Eugene Richards is a master at this work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely written and very interesting.","review":"I wanted to read this book because I so enjoyed the author's participation in Ken Burns's baseball documentary. It was interesting to learn that she actually wrote the book AFTER that project, because so many people started asking her about her baseball memories. The book tells the story of her own life - family experiences, Catholic upbringing, etc. - interwoven with her love of baseball and esp. the Brooklyn Dodgers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great primer on American history and culture for children","review":"My two sons are both under the age of eight and fanatics for baseball. Because Goodwin weaves baseball through her memoir, her wonderful book has served admirably well as an introduction to recent American history (McCarthyism, Communism, the advent of TV, racism, politics), Catholicism, the comfortable rituals and unexpected problems of family life, and baseball lore. Goodwin shifts a bit between presenting events retrospectively (as an adult) and reconstructions of what she remembered as a child, but no matter -- the boys are revitted. Baseball as a dependable continuum for the unfathomable chaos of history, brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid and simpering.","review":"Having grown up in Rockville Centre myself, I have to wonder what alternate universe Ms. Goodwin is coming from. Her description of her \\"happy\\" childhood certainly bears no similarity to the eerily apathetic and segregated (to this day!) bedroom village I knew. I realize that this will have no bearing on the estimations of readers who did not have the \\"benefit\\" of being reared in the black hole that is Nassau County, but I have to say that the whole book reads like a fairy-tale revisionist fabrication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this orginal work?","review":"My first response after reviewing this book was where did I read this before. In the past two years, I have been reluctant to acquire anything written by this author as she has a reputation for rewriting what others have done before. Fear and trepidation consume me that I will be revisitng other authors' work. The amazing thing is that the author is so brazen that she even tries to repesent she is responsible for anything she writes. When I taught I always impressed upon my composition students that they project their own feelings and ideas. I question whether the author has an idea of her own. Rather than refer to her work any longer and use her books as a model, i embarassed she has exploited the works of others. This book may be presented as a rewite of history but I am more afraid that it is a rewrite of other authors' works. This is dishonest and makes me want to return all her books for a refund from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an enjoyable book to read.","review":"I liked this book very much as I did No Ordinary Time, though I am surprised when I read this author's work that the same charm and humor that she displays in person and on television do not come through in her writing. However, the content of her narrative far transcends this slight criticism. As a lover of baseball her descriptions of her and her father's enthusiasm for the Dodgers were very appealing to me as were her detailing the historical events of the early decades of her life. The description of her families successes as well as travails provoked a great deal of sentiment, but were very genuinely and honestly protrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!","review":"I loved the simple message that this book gave: If At first you don't suceed, try try again. I flew through the pages very quickly, and couldn't put it downMelody"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull account of a dull life.","review":"I was lured into buying this book by the picture of Ebbets Field on the cover and the implied promise of insights into, and memories of,Brooklyn in the fifties. I am just three years younger than the author, and I hoped for some interesting reading about a time and place that defined my childhood but that I was too young to notice at the time. Memoirs must serve at least one of three purposes. They either describe an interesting life, or they offer insights into a time and place, or they are simply well written and stand on literary merit alone. This book fails all three tests. The life is not interesting, the time and place are merely touched upon and poorly understoof, and the writing has no literary merit. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book.

Perhaps this could be a tribute to successful child-rearing as her parents both encouraged this obviously very bright child to be aware of her surroundings, interact with others at a young age. We're also exposed to a time in our country where baseball was king and its fans were rabid loyalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball, families, & faith...","review":"This book touched me on many different levels. I bought it as a baseball fan but learned a lot about New York, the Catholic Church, and the 1950's in addition to baseball.Goodwin's portrayal of early New York suburbanites is very well written and reminded me of my own experience of moving to the suburbs of Washington, D.C. a generation later.Ultimately, I was moved by the way she caringly described each of the relationships in her life during that time, particularly with her father.Goodwin could work for MLB, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, and the Catholic church and improve each of those entities public image. Her book made me nostalgic about things I have never experienced, if that is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas 2000 and read it almost as non-stop as I could. I'm not a baseball fan, but this was one of the most moving and well written stories I have ever read. Ms. Goodwin writes about an admittedly idyllic and innocent childhood but with such honesty and clarity of recollection that it does not come across as \\"Leave it to Beaver.\\" I am ordinarily only captivated by Tom Clancy or John Grisham and was a little let down when I first unwrapped this gift, however after completing my first reading, I know that this book will be a cherished possession that I will continue to pull off the shelf for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read for anyone who grew up in the 50's.","review":"You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate this excellent story of growing up in the 1950's. Goodwin captures the aroma of that time: A child laying on her front lawn, waiting for her father to come home from the train, communicating with her best friend next door via a string on a pulley, going to the beach and deciding who is the best center fielder in New York, and watching your childhood friends move away as the neighborhood changs. I've been there, as I'm sure many of my early baby boomers have. I still carry the book in my briefcase even after I've finished it. I don't want to put my past down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up in the Fifties","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin captures the essence of the post WWII era, when many New York City families were finally able to move from the city and have their own homes in the suburbs. As I was one of those families, we also brought our love for baseball. If you came from the Bronx, you remained a Yankee fan and if you came from Brookln, as Doris did, you loved the Dodgers. This book was sweet and poignant especially for me. And that is because I spent part of my childhood in the same town that she did...Rockville Centre, NY.. I graduated the same High School , South Side, that she did ...just a few years ahead of her. We shared some of the same teachers and memories. It brought me back to time 50 years ago when we faced some different and yet some of the same problems that we face today. This was a story told with tenderness and love and I loved all of it.Steve Bank , SouthSide '54"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"More than just a story about baseball - a story about growing up in the fifties. Families, friends and neighborhoods. A very nostalgic look back into time. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait Til Next Year","review":"Excellent book! I am a Doris Kearns Goodwin fan and this gave me insight not only into her childhood, the Dodgers, the history of the time, but also into what made her the amazing historian she is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of College","review":"As a college drop out I am not what many people might consider well read. While school was never my strong suit, and studying was an event that rarely ever happened, I did manage to read a few great books along the way. My first and best semester of college I read Wait 'til Next Year. While I am not a fan of sports and am not competitive at all, this book was beautifully written and takes the reader on a tour through the author's life, all in the language of baseball. Using the sport as a way to framework the personal story was a wise choice as it gives great metaphors and context to the tale. I suppose I also have good memories tied into the novel as well, considering that I did really well grade-wise that semester and I remember really enjoying this book when I read it at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly delightful!","review":"Memoir of Doris Kearns' younger years, as an avid Brooklyn Dodgers fan. Although baseball was her obsession, the story is about much more than baseball - it's about life in the 50's, childhood spent outside or at the corner soda shop, the importance the community had at that time, and the troubles and changes that adolescence brings.Great memoir, and incredibly well written and told. I thought the book was excellent, even though I glossed over the baseball parts of it! Read this for my library book group, I never would've picked this one up on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Never Discontinue This Product","review":"When it became difficult to find this product in our local grocery stores, I panicked until I found it on Amazon. This has a MUCH better flavor than any other canned chickens I've tried. For years it has been a major staple in my kitchen & desk drawer. For a quick, guilt-free snack, it's tasty just smashed up in its own broth. Mixed with some relish & either mayo or ranch dressing, it makes a delicious salad to eat alone, in a sandwich, or on crackers. My elderly/feeble parents loved it microwaved with various tuna helper flavors as an easy main dish. This is great in all of my favorite cooked chicken recipes, & it's always in the pantry, ready to use on short notice, but keeping just fine (unlike refrigerated alternatives) until it's needed. When I can't incorporate the broth into whatever I'm making, I usually drink it, because it's too flavorful to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless to me...","review":"I bought this to ship to me in Afghanistan, since it would be easier than asking my wife to go to the grocery store and then to the post office.

Well..............I don't think so, he sounds like any other singer, but nothing like the original soundtrack. I just saw \\"Fiddler On The Roof\\", starring John Preece as Tevye, in Birmingham, AL. at the BJCC, and I'm saying John is much, much better than Herschel (sorry Herschel). John Preece was so good, he received 3 or 4 or more standing ovations....Too bad, John doesn't have a CD, but none sound as good as the original.......that is the case in most everthing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern Japanese Classic","review":"This classic is a moving portrait of a Japanese childhood. The main character, Kasuko, (the young Yashushi Inoue) is skilfully drawn and sympathetic. The book focusses on his confusions growing up in a complicated family atmosphere and his feelings towards various female members of that family, notably his adopted grandmother, with whom he lives, his absent mother and his aunt (whom he sees as an older sister). The book is readable, beautifully written and well-translated. The only shortcoming is that this is a translation only of Volume One. Volume Two appears not to have been translated at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are teeny tiny!","review":"On the one hand, I paid $3.50 for them, and they do what they are supposed to do: Cover bowls.On the other hand, these are so small that the only bowls they're covering are cereal bowls, and I didn't really need them for that.

Only KING DIAMOND can pull off the falsetto-sound (and even he only sounds good sometimes)...Just get their other two albums: \\"Darkness Visible\\" and \\"Sacred Oath\\". Now those two albums are solid metal... While Rob Thorne is still singing, he's matured a ton and really toned down the 'wailing'.

It has an edge that can't be found in the mainstream, either then or today. In all, the CD is a keeper. I keep going back to it when the status quo just won't do.

Apparently these reviews are spot on - works great before it fails, but this is basically a lousy product. I have owned many memory cards and never had a failure before this one.

On the second day of the trip I noticed that several of my picture files were \\"unreadable\\" on the camera. The next day I lost several more.

Nothing. I opted for the Frustration-Free Packaging to do my bit to Support Green.

This time removing and replacing the card and camera battery revived the card, but it failed again at 9.4G and stayed dead. Again though I could retrieve the photos using a card reader.The card did compare well to a Sandisk 4G Class 6 SDHC card on speed testing - both took 42 shots in 40s on a Canon Powershot G11.Back to Sandisk.

If I could get back the video somehow I would give this 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Card which Failed Me","review":"Loved it for 3 months, fast, cheap, perfect. Then it lost 200 images, luckily not critical. I suspected a problem. Then I went on vacation, had to come home for something else, and uploaded the pictures. Out of maybe 300, it transfered 10 or so and then everything just dissappeared. No images on Disk. Not happy. Luckiliy it wasn't a wedding or something.I have a Nikon D80, and it works great with my other cards. The Transcend is tagged for destruction unless I can return it or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed on 3rd use","review":"I would not recommend this card for any use where you can't afford to lose data. The card although quite speedy, failed on reading out images and movies on it's third use. The card now shows only 11 GB and the only way I was able to get some of my images back was with a data recovery software which read the low level blocks. I suspect one of the banks on the flash failed taking about a quarter of my images with it.My experience does not seem to be unique. Unfortunately, I didn't read the other reviews before I placed my order. I have an 8GB Transcend SDHC which has worked flawlessly for over a year, so I thought I could extrapolate form that experience :-(Hopefully, I'll be able to get my money back. Even if Transcend replaces it, I doubt that I would ever use it out of fear of losing valuable pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went bad after 1 year","review":"Had this card for about a year, and it worked well until 2 days ago. I had it in my Nikon D5000 and got the error, \\"Unable to Format Card. Card May Be Defective.\\" Luckily I found a utility online to recover the pictures I had and I was able to re-format the card. It worked for another day and now I'm getting the error again.I tried cleaning the contacts w/ a cotton swab, and even tried inserting the card while locked & unlocked - didn't make a difference. Hopefully, theSanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-016G-P31, Retail Packaging) - NEW 30MB/s versionI just bought will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working within 3 days","review":"This item stopped working within 3 days. I sent it back, but Beach Camera could not guarantee my money back. I got some San Disk Extreme 3 8GB cards instead. I would not bother with this, though the price is right, according to the reviews, it has about a 20% chance of failure, and nonrecovery of photos. The SanDisk cards come with a lifetime warrenty and recovery software. Just spend a little extra and get the good cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 5 months","review":"This card worked perfectly in my T1i, but sadly after 5 months it failed completely with no warning. The camera just failed to recognise it just after having taken some photos - it wasn't removed from camera or anything. It had probably only had 10 fill/empty cycles in that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Fast, reliable, and priced right. Hard to go wrong. I've been using Sandisk products and have been happy with them, thought I'd give these a try, and am glad I did. Watch out Sandisk, you've got competition.A great value for the digital photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge storage - as described","review":"I've had 2 Sandisk 4g cards, and was ready for the upgrade. This card doubles the storage size at a reasonable price, and has proved to be bulletproof. Huge storage, and easy on the battery life. Holds 1600 pics from a 10mp camera, or up to 65 minutes video. Kind of slow uploading to the laptop, but gets it done. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcend SD Card 8 GB Review","review":"This item works just fine for me. Being a class C data card, you'll find it works the quickest at transferring your video, music or picture files onto your computer. 8 GB is a very workable size of memory even for video files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great product","review":"Great performing SD card at the best price I could find. I'd recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two years later it still works","review":"I bought this two years ago on Amazon to accompany my Canon HF100 that I ordered at the same time. I was concerned that Transcend was not a common brand, but after all this time it works well, and I shoot a lot of video. At this price a Kingston is only class 4, and a lot of newer camcorders, which I plan to buy, require class 6. I'd buy another Transcend without question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I bought this card with my Nikon D90.

Not much to report on. I works which is what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great in My DMC-ZS3","review":"Got this specifically for use in my Panasonic DMC-ZS3 which records HD in AVCHD-Lite format, which requires a memory card with fast speed and high capacity. I was worried about trying the Transcend brand after reading a lot of horror stories here, but gave it a shot because of the great price.To be safe, after any day of taking photos and recording video, I immediately move all the data onto my PC and reformat the card. I've been using the card for a few months now and have never experienced any issues with it. I find it so reliable that I just ordered and received my second card.My bottom line is if you need a fast SDHC card for recording high def video and want to spend as little as possible, definitely consider giving this product a try. However, if you just need a card for snapping casual photos and maybe even recording some standard def video, there's no reason you shouldn't get a more reliable, less expensive SD card."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad packaging","review":"This item read that it is in a retail package.

The card would allow the camera to take pictures and would save them to be viewed via the camera's preview function, but I could not download any of the pictures to a computer or printer. I couldn't even recover the files using some high end data recovery software.

I bought this Transcend memory card but there is no way I can save the pictures from my computer to this transcend SDHc card. This is complete waste of money for me as I have no other product I can use this card for. I also do not have a memory card reader.

This particular card had a complete loss of data & formatting several times in my Canon XSi, which was of course very frustrating because I lost all my pictures. Fortunately it failed early in the shoot and I switched to a much higher-quality PNY SDHC card, which has always been reliable, but had I been shooting with live subjects it would have been quite embarassing. My only option, unfortunately, is to return the card under warranty to Transcend for a replacement. The problem there is that I don't really want a replacement, but that's what I get for buying a cheap card. I'll have to use it somewhere non-critical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labeled Class 6? Better check.","review":"I purchased this card because I needed the record speed found in Class 6 cards.

I also purchased a second one to use with Time Machine. The big but is that after four months of minimal use they both just stopped working. I was unable to access them with my Mac or with file recovery software or even reformat them.

This has never been a problem with my Sandisk Ultra class 4.

But the continuous sequential write speed is basically the only one that matters for use in a DSLR, and for this purpose, Sandisk does better than Transcend. Also, there's no reason not to buy Class 10, which are not much more expensive (if at all) for cards up to about 8GB.I'm using this card in my Canon Rebel XS (the EOS 1000D), which doesn't have very high FPS, and doesn't do video. If you have basically any higher-end DSLR, stick to Sandisk Class 10. I haven't tested it, but I would guess that the \\"burst\\" modes of even some high end compact cameras (which can hit 10 FPS for short bursts) might stress this card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a waste of money","review":"I bought this card to take on my 15-day Yucatan vacation.

I took the card out of my computer and re-inserted to fix the problem and when I opened the file, all of our photos were gone!

I ended up buying a SanDisk 8gb to replace it, and I've had no problems with it. I'll never buy another Transcend card again. They aren't reliable.

I contacted 'marketplace' seller CTCStore, and they told me to return the card, at my expense and they would evaluate it. Then it occurred to me to try to use a camera to re-format the card. This appeared to work, so I tried one more time to get my computer to accept the card. This time there was no problem.So I wonder was the new card unformatted or did it contain some garbage piece of software?Why would a memory card be delivered in an unformatted condition?Why was this not mentioned in the limited documentation with the SD card?Should a new memory card be delivered in a condition that will crash my computer?BEWARE of Transcend SD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and roomy","review":"works well with a 10 MP camera (PowerShot G7) - fits about 900 highest quality JPEGs.

It turns out, the packaging was the only part that was frustration free. When I opened the package, i was surprised to discover two cards, as I'd only ordered one. I soon found out why. After a while, the card would just stop working. My camera would display a message like memory card error. Sometimes, turning the camera off and on would fix the problem, sometimes not. The only way to fix the error was to completely re-format the card. That means erasing all your photos currently on the card, which I don't like to do. The same thing happened with the other card. I tried these cards on two different cameras. Why did I get two cards? Was it because they knew the cards were somewhat defective? Pure accident?

When I first got the camera I purchased some cards from Walmart that were a class 4, when using the continuous shooting mode the class 4 could only handle about 5-6 shots before my camera had to wait for the card to catch up. Today I put in this Class 6 Transcend card and it shot non stop for over 30 pics (I didn't want to keep going).

Amazon took and acknowledged my order, but the order never came and no advisement of any problems via e-mail. When I went on line to track my order it said there was no order? Bottom line my credit card had neen renewed and it had a new expiration date, so when that didn't match with my card on file Amazon just deleted my order. I had to call CS and they were no help at all. I had to go back to Amozon on-line, update my expiration date and place a new order.

I complied with the instructions and mailed the memory back to them with the RMA number and address on the outside. About 14 days later I received it back from the post office saying it had been refused by the recipient. The envelope was cut on the short end cleanly, presumably by some sort of a letter opening device.

I selected \\"No\\" and pushed the o.k. button. Unfortunately, this did not get rid of the screen. I had to turn the camera off and on once, twice, or three times to get rid of the screen. It also happened sometimes during a shooting session. At first I thought that I had a defective camera. After using the card for a couple of days and still having the same problem I decided to try the other card. Using this second card solved the problem and it hasn't happened again after several days of using it.

Would have given 5 stars otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely qualifies as class 6","review":"I purchased this card because I take a number of speed shots and, while my camera can hold them in memory for a period of time until they are written to disk, I periodically fill that memory as well. As a result I wanted to get a fast card compatible with my camera. The specs for class 4 memory cards go up to 15MB per second, while the ones for 6 cards go up to 20MBps. The packaging claims 16MBps meaning that this only barely gets into the class 6 range. This would be more than adequate for most things, but when I am taking pictures of my daughter's rugby team in sport mode, I want them to be written to the card as fast as possible, I know that the card speed is just one of a number of things that go into the actual write speed, but this is the one that I can easily change. Like I said, for most things, this card would be perfectly acceptable and the price is pretty good. It just wasn't what I wanted/needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I have bought several of these 8Gb and 16Gb cards in the last 2 years and althgough they are fast and highly compatible, I already lost half of the 16Gb batch (3 actually). They simply died in the middle of a transfer operation, never to recover. I know that flash memory cards are usually not the best media when it comes to reliability, but one of these failed me in less than a week. Never got any problems with the 8Gb versions (I have 4 of those). My advise: use them only as transfer media (go for the class 10 instead, it is well worth the few extra bucks) and never, never for backup purposes. And don't dispose of the original files until you have them safely stored on a reliable media."},{"rating":"2","title":"camera card","review":"great service, price and delivery - cant judge the last two just yet but feel confident they will be exceptional as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for product","review":"My only complaint is that my computer and printer does not read the scan disc when I insert it directly into the devices.

However the program was a recovery program, it still didn't fix my card. It did have a format tool, which turned out only opened Vista's built-in formatting program, nothing i haven't seen before. When I told them it didn't solve my problem they stopped responding.I asked if I could mail them my card for repair/replacement.

It worked great and I used it on numerous photo-shoots and long periods of shooting video. While on a paid photo and video shoot my camera stopped shooting in the middle of an interview and the card became unreadable. The card died on me and I lost all of the data on it.

The D90 has a small internal memory that can hold a few pictures at a time. On my old card, I always have had problems waiting to catch up to writing to the card. Not with this one, I never saw the queue go below 6 pictures I could take. I am very pleased with it, and I would suggest purchase for anyone. And get the frustration free version!

The camera showed an error that the card couldn't be used, so I pulled it out and put it directly into my PC's card reader only to see another error message that the card was invalid and needed formatting. I eventually got my vacation pics off of it, but I don't think I'm taking any more chances on this card again. Luckily, it was cheap enough to just toss.

And then when ppl take pics on those resolutions with their point-and-shoot camera, which undoubtedly has terrible optics, the quality is about as good as if they had taken a 2048X1536 picture on a 3.1 megapixel camera from 2001.

ALL the good scenes are devastatingly edited, apparantly with a chain saw, leaving us with an incoherent, mindless mess that makes late-nite Skinemax flix look like Stanley Kubrick's catalog. This would be a wretched film even with the good parts left alone, and at the price point asked for on Amazon (or anywhere else), it's akin to outright robbery or a cavity search.

It is not as fancy as some of the other models on the market, but after trying three other brands I like this one the best. You plug it in, fill it with water (spoon included), and put in the bottle until it's warm. The spoon makes it easy to add the right amount of water (especially in the middle of the night -- you don't have to measure out milliliters like some of the other warmers!) It's also quiet, unlike some of the other brands that have loud beeping sounds. This is the only warmer I found that is good for glass or plastic bottles (although the holder is relatively narrow and will not hold a wide bottle. It is not designed for disposable bottles, either.) The only downside is that it you have to remember to unplug it and pour out the old water each time you use it.

That was the best thing. It is also easy to use. The bad thing is the bottle is either way to cold or burning hot. There is a very small window of time when the bottle is perfect temp. So, you have to stand there and test the bottle temp several times or else it gets too hot. It is not convienent when your baby is screaming and you have to hold her and keep testing the bottle on you arm. I am looking for a new bottle warmer. Cheap, but not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"This bottle warmer does not heat more than a 4 ounce bottle.

When another winter arrived, the Biornaire heater was put to use again, but this time the unit did not perform as well. The heater shut itself off after 10 minutes; I followed the reset instruction but the heater was on for less than five minutes and shut itself off again. I called the customer service to report the problem because the unit was used for only 4 months. They offer me a replacement unit which is a HS3800-U, at my own shipping cost. The lesson here is to purchase a warranty with your bionaire products.

I was looking for something that easily picked up dried leaves around the garage and driveway (relatively even surfaces with a moderate gradient). It does a great job for a domestic sweeper at a fantastic price point. I looked into commercial-grade sweepers like the Haaga 255 and they cost more than 10 times the SpinSweep Pro. A comparable unit from Karcher didn't get very good reviews so I passed on that.This Hoover sweeper is not available in Australia so I'm taking a bit of a risk with parts and warranty but the very affordable price justified the purchase. It appears to be well-designed and solidly built so I'm hoping it would last a good few years at the very least.

This sweeper does well for particles with some mass to it: rocks, leaves, pop cans, paper, anything but fine dust. Lacking a back brush, fine particles are merely dropped and you will see a dust trail forming along the path you walk. A back brush would make the unit larger, but it would eliminate the dust trails left by this sweeper.This sweeper is noise except on smooth ground surfaces.

We moved from that building and lost our sweeper, and had to order a new one. So we found one on Amazon.com at a CHEAPER PRICE, and are thrilled to be able to maintain our new property the way we did the former property!

(1) the nubs out front designed to protect things are completely in the way preventing one from sweeping close enough.

This gave the filter almost one full week of good use again. The drying out then happened again, so I repeated the wash/scrub.

Could it be that you need to manage your stress and then think about losing weight?Further, the diet she advises for apple types is high in grains and fruit, which many people don't do well on. I'm an apple type, and I do best on lots of vegetables, less grains and fruit.I would recommend The Metabolic Typing Diet instead.

This has nothing to do with the quality of the film(s) and Amazon needs to discount these reviews. Just stop it, people.The films are light and TV worthy, not the greatest transfer in the world but for the price it works. I also like the tin box and the inclusion of the Jack the Ripper doc and the short story of one of Conan Doyle's best stories. That is a nice extra. Lee is commanding as always and seeing him on screen in an iconic role is nice, I also like the fact this is Holmes at the end of his career, set in 1910 and we can see him later on in life. That is very rare for the character and fits in with Lee's age well, though he looks a bit too long in the tooth, just a bit.Overall very much worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rubbish but a nice tin!","review":"I bought this for $8.99 at Ross Dress for Less, and did watch both movies.

For instance, he imagines Tarsus and says this sun rise was the same sun rise Paul saw when he was child. Stuff like that. And he goes on the speculate on what Paul could be thinking. Don't we all like to do that from time to time? I'm not a religious person, I'm a beliver yet a humanist. But I like to dig into the first years of Christianity just for fun and curiosity.

Merton, a Trappist monk, discusses Catholic spirituality in a deeply powerful way, and completely avoids the use of theological jargon. But even though he avoids jargon, he still conveys powerful theological ideas: theological seminary ideas like the Incarnation of Christ, justification, and priesthood ordinations all become living realities in his writings. It's easy to read but by no means light reading. He had a unique gift.Though written from a Catholic perspective, this book is for ordinary Christians of all faiths. It discusses not just the life of prayer, but also the active life. He talks about how Christians can genuinely make their work and their political participation part of their sacred sphere. We'll surely be reading his work for another century; and we'll need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christianity and the Active Life in the Twentieth Century","review":"Thomas Merton never ceases to amaze in his ability to express, in concrete, down-to-earth terms, how to incorporate a robust Roman Catholic spirituality in an active, contemporary life. Although he was writing as a monk, Merton's call to personal holiness in the active, non-monastic life is incisive, convincing and completely on point. Merton explains in clear terms how one can, and indeed must, maintain deep, active concern for the events that surround us, and be an active participant in these events, in order to cultivate and fully develop our individual capacity for personal holiness. A tremendous work, highly recommendable for anyone seeking guidance regarding how a passionate spirituality can be integrated into an active and busy life."},{"rating":"1","title":"no website videos","review":"Got the book, but the promised website with videos is 'under construction' I'm giving low stars because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"head in the armpit","review":"If you are not flat chested, don't buy this.

Slow, weary music has never sounded so mature and wise in this pure selection of quality songs. With \\"Katy Song\\" melting slowly into your heart, and \\"Mistress\\" sawing its way through, each and every one of the songs on this CD is, by its own, worth the expense of getting this album.

The fuzz/reverb saturated guitar ala 'slowdive', the deep, echo'd voice ala 'Nick Drake', and the chorusy rhythms of the likes of 'Ride' all add up to make one helluva record. This is the kind of release that inspires so many other great bands but never really gets the notoriety it deserves.

Instead it is a bloated, oversized coffee table book printed on glossy paper that will probably end up on the remainder table. The plates are decent enough except that they cover only a small part of the huge pages. The maps probably have detail in them somewhere but they too have such small print that one needs a magnifying glass to read them.

Simple Suppers reads like an updated version of Cooks at Home- the recipes are straightforward and easy to prepare, but original in the combinations of flavors and textures. Green Bean and White Bean Gratin contains green beans, pureed white beans and whole white beans layered with cheese and breadcrumbs for a filling winter meal. Navajo Stew combines roasted sweet potatoes with black beans and a quick blender tomato-chipotle sauce. Tortilla Melts are quick sandwiches of roasted mushrooms with pesto, tomatoes, and cheese. I made all of these in the past week and my husband and I both liked them a lot- good, unfussy food.My only quibble is that it would be nice if nutritional information had been included. Many of the recipes are decidedly not light as written, but could be lightened fairly easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, simple and delicious","review":"I originally checked this cook book out of the public library and then I re-checked it out again and when they wouldn't let me have it the third time I figured it was time to just buy it.

This cookbook offers all that!This is a great cookbook for both the seasoned cook and the beginner. The recipes are interesting but very easy and quick to prepare. I also like the suggestion box at the bottom of each recipe that tells you what to serve with the recipe so that you aren't just serving random dishes together. Very user friendly and lot of fun to cook with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook!","review":"The Moosewood Restaurant books are awesome and this one is no exception. Great, simple recipies.

It became a huge family favorite from the library, until I finally bought it for her 4th birthday.

The pictures are fun and if you read it using the right voices I'm sure your children will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening and filled with sadism","review":"I thought this book was totally mean-spirited and filled with sadism that would certainly scare any child. In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book.

This book was deeply disturbing for both myself and more importantly, for my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! My daughter memorized it in the first week!

This is probably lot related but I sent them back and looked for a similar item. Some reviews mention the problem too.I like to affix full-face glossy inkjet printed labels to my DVDs, won't work in these Memorex cases. And I don't like the size (6\\" X 7\\"). The cases do have a place to slide a label in both front and rear but didn't appeal to me.

Pay attention boy!","review":"With all due respect to their other albums (not to mention Foghorn Leghorn), this album - the last featuring both Caldwell brothers - was their peak. It continued to show their growth and overall talent as they delivered more blues, gospel, and even jazz overtones, yet retained the classic country rock sound which is of course their backbone. From Doug Gray's soaring vocals (oh if he only still had those chops) to T Caldwell's screaming guitar to.....well you get the idea.If you like MTB and don't get wrapped up in the \\"but there aren't any hits on it\\" idiocy - ie you have a clue about music and really appreciate this band - GET THIS NOW. In fact, I like that there were no hits off of it, because I don't have to worry about them getting beat to death by the \\"classic rock\\" stations. Every song is good, and many of them great.

I like things that zig and zag in unexpected but pleasant ways. I'm not a purist. I think that mixing contrasting elements lends interest and excitement.I'm not a big jazz fan, but I'm finding that if you give jazz a good groove, I like it.All this is background for my opinion that this is an outstanding collection. Each piece stands on it's own, contrasts nicely with the other entries without any (to me) jarring discordancies, and internally, nicely contrasts the sophistication of jazz compositional elements with more contemporary rhythmic and production influences in varying degrees; some tracks the jazz influence predominates, on others the hip-hop or techno influences come to the fore.I agree with another reviewer that the Amp Fiddler track sounds like \\"Stevie Wonder on a ... drug trip\\", but to be honest, it's the kind of zig or zag that I think makes this CD very entertaining and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots and lots of make believe","review":"In this movie everybody is acting.

She has terrible allergies and is always congested in the morning. Since we started using the fan in her room every night, no more stuffy noses and coughing in the morning. Plus, the noise of the fan keeps her sleeping longer! It is the perfect size and we often move it into other rooms during the day to freshen them up. We will probably purchase another in the spring for our allergies. The only down side is replacing two filters, but an investment worthwhile and cheaper than cough medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good basic purifier","review":"Mine just broke after a couple years of use, probably from a power surge, but until then it kept the room my dogs are crated in clean. It saves a lot of time to not have to dust as often, and the noise was reasonable for the amount of air it moves. For getting a lot of dust out of the air quickly the tower design is excellent but it is not the best choice for allergies. There is air and dust leakage around the filters that is not present on even slightly more expensive models.

Put it this way, I have birds, dogs, and children that make a mess, but with this QEUIT device(with 3 speeds) purifying my rooms I feel that it is such a relief to come home from a hard day of work and feeling the clean air (it cleared my sinus ever since I used it). Not to mention the cool breeze that comes out of it, is a plus when I'm playing poker with my buddies, it works as a a/c haha.

I left it on in my bedroom all day every day for about a month, and I sometimes wake up feeling less congested, but mostly I feel the same, so I can't tell if it's some sort of placebo thing.

This CD is one of his very best. The collaboration bedwteen Green, Young and Jones is super. On the opnener \\"Talkin about JC\\" (John Coltrane of course)Young sets the groove, and then Green starts to groove, for every 12 bar chorus he digs deeper into the groove. I am also very fond of \\"Luny Tune\\". It gives a kick when Green takes off right after the lead, his guitar is singing, and his playing is flawless and totally relaxed. I always felt that Jones and Green goes very well together, and that is something that Jones confirms in the biography about Green, which is by the way highly recommended to all \\"Green fans\\".(REDISCOVERING THE FORGOTTEN GENIUS OF JAZZ GUITAR, by Sharony Andrews Green, MIller Freeman Books)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't it suppose to work?","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.

I assumed this would be the case in ordering another Motorola headset for my new phone. Sadly, it is not. The charger adapter plug is not a micro-USB, and only works for the headset.This is also similar to other Motorola headsets that don't have an ear plug built into the receiver, so it sits outside the ear, instead of in the ear.

I'm trying each of the supplied ear hooks to see which is the most comfortable.

It draws its stylistic inspiration from Latin American writers, most importantly Gabriel Garcia Marques, but is not as successful. It relies too much on an alien imagination, and too little on the true culture, history and mythology of Latin America. The result, especially with its graphically violent portrayal of the sufferings of the Coca lords' victims, is almost voyeuristic. It's certainly gratuitous in places.

But then, after my second or third use, I noticed holes forming near the inner knuckle areas of the gloves. It wasn't long before the holes were big enough to fit my fingers through.

I developed carpel tunnel syndrone in 1996. My right hand would get numb and prevent me from sleeping at night. I also experienced some pain and discomfort during the day. I wore a brace on my right hand with minimal results. After buying this book, I started taking it with me to work. I merely did some of the stretches for three days in a row and suddenly, I was 80% improved. No longer does my hand get numb at night. From time to time, I do some of the neck stretches and they seem to keep the problem under control. My dramatic improvement seemed to me to be a miracle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book replaced anti-inflammatories and gave me my life back.","review":"Carpal Tunnel and related stress injuries struck me in mid-August and left me practically helpless for nearly 3 months. After 3 days of doing the stretching exercises in Butler's book, I was back to doing simple activities and completely off the high dosages of anti-inflammatories recommended by my doctor. I cannot recommend this book too highly. The exercises are super simple and can be done throughout the day whenever you have a moment - in front of the TV, while laying in bed, in the car at a stoplight. The exercises deal with the entire upper body, including arms and wrists. You can choose those appropriate to you and your activities. If you are not sure, Butler has a list of which exercises apply to certain lines of work. An excellent - and inexpensive - book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused more pain","review":"The good: The exercises are categorized and easy to understand. The exercises probably are effective for most people.The bad: Following the exercises precisely for three weeks, I felt much more numbness and weakness. For some, these stretches may actually exacerbate the problem.Beware, and begin slowly. If you are one who finds benefit, then gradually increase the number of stretches and the time you spend stretching. If, however, your symptons increase, slow down or stop.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a must have","review":"Having worked as the in-house masseur for the Well and other Whole Earth computer geeks for 4 years, I have searched for something on RSI's.

The passive use of the comprehensive exercises by me can be almost as helpful as the active use by the workers themselves. This book should be had by everyone who is experiecing the symptoms of RSI.

Physical therapy and such can only take a person so far; much easier to take control of your own pain and learn to care for yourself in the long run.

One author is a scientist and the other is a theologist. It is a bizarre output that is, in literary terms, may be described as a very well-written book.

These Darwinist proselytizers who remain in the \\"dark ages\\" of science...faithfully believing theories that date back 150 years ago...are no threat to any who are truly interested in reading the arguments, data, and proof in this book.

The book then becomes a rambling mess inspired by religion more than science and fails to convince the reader of the idea that habitability and measurability are related in the universe.Unfortunately the Notes are nearly as long as the book. Rather than just contain references they contain a substantial portion of the material forcing the reader to flip back and forth several times per page.There are more than the usual number of errors in the writing as well as the material.

My only \\"critical\\" comment would be this: the authors systematically build a scientific foundation of contingency. Since Jay Richards has a strong background in philosophy, I would have enjoyed an approach to the subject based upon Aristotle and his development of the argument of contingency.

The issue itself has eternal consequences & is therefore inherently interesting.I was impressed that these fellows are capable philosophers of science & did well in their presentation of their argument as well as responding to criticisms. My main challenge for the intelligent design camp is to focus it's excellent critical examination skills upon the assumptions that undergird mainstream dating methods for the earth & cosmos.

My 10+ year Panasonic never had this problem.If you want to get some to late for a long time, stay away from this.

However, we all know that the nonstick coating does a ton of damage once in our bodies - so when the nonstick start to peel off - you need to replace it right away. In our experience, that means every 6 months. That's jut not acceptable, in 18 months we will have spent the same amount as would we have bought a new cooker again!

The writing style was never any better than pedestrian. You needed a full history of Wolf's Dragoons (which I don't have access to) to make sense of a lot of the story.

Though this is sentimental and flexible reading when I compare with his earlier tragic/epic accounts. Ofcourse one can see many points of Giulini's fixed approaching and his 'high level'. Powerfull and also very good recorded(with SWR-Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra,in 1996,live,digital).If you have Giulini's other recordings and if you are lover of this work you must buy this one too.

The actual dimensions are 44\\"x22\\"x15\\" ( I measured it very carefully).The end table dimensions are correctly listed.The weight is given at 150 pounds, yet I was able to lift the entire package a bit off the ground and get it inside in one piece. The price of 5.61 has a shipping cost of 142.00 on top of that, which may be a bit exorbitant as I don't really think it weighs in at 150 pounds, otherwise I would not have been able to lift it.The set is much darker than shown in the picture. Assembly is very easy. Well packed. Appearance is slightly on the cheap looking side, but OK enough. Construction is good, veneer on top of solid oak, and when set up the tables have a solid feel. Each table is light weight and can easily be lifted."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 piece table set","review":"The tables' pictured appeared to have a parquet top with varying types of wood. In reality they were one solid piece of oak laminate & look cheap. The pictured tables would have gone well with my existing furniture. These don't. I would send them back, but I would have to pay the postage both ways. That would exceed the price of the tables. Plus, the hardware to put them together was out of its package & spread all over in the packaging. Do not buy these tables unless you love cheap hotel furniture.

I played 3-4 games in them and could barely walk for days after each game. Running around on these feels like running with a flat piece of wood strapped to your foot. They are WAY to narrow as well. The Predators and the F50's are FAR superior to this boot even though I've had both break within 6 months of purchasing; I would easily purchase again over the Copa's. I know these are supposed to be a throw back, something that is tried and true, but for me, the 1970's technology in the foot support is horrendous.I played in them 3-4 times, and then gave them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"lo maximo","review":"lo mejor de lo mejor en zapatos de futbol a nivel mundial desde mucho tiempo atras y a superado el tiempo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but one problem","review":"These are truly the best boots in the history of the game.

And no, being from Australia, I am not concerned about our native animal being used for sporting goods. Their overpopulation were slated to be culled and we even eat their meat!But back to the boots, they will give you incredible amounts of touch and control. The only problem I have with them are that they are more suited to people with narrow to normal feet. I have wide feet and although the leather has stretched to accommodate my feet well, the outer sole has not. If only Adidas would release a pair for wider feet, these boots would be getting 5 starts. And you should make sure they fit snugly to your feet, almost tight, because the leather will stretch a little.If only companies would produce boots of this quality, instead of releasing plastic garbage..."},{"rating":"2","title":"best shoe on the market","review":"the reason why the Copa Mundial has been on the market for 25+ years is that it is the best soccer shoe available.The leather stays in fantastic shape, even when you can't find the time to mink-oil it. The shoe withstands all-weather conditions. I've played in snow, blistering heat in the desert, rainstorms, mud, everything. These shoes recover nicely and have given me plenty of mileage.My first pair gave out on me after four or five full seasons playing year-round. The stitching around the sole of the shoe gave out on me. My next pair of Copas picked right up where the others left off-- no blisters on my feet or ankles.

They are lightweight and the quality of the leather is excellent. The touch on the ball was quite good. If I had posted a review a couple of weeks after buying the Copas, I would have been raving about them.However, after three months of playing in them 3-5 times a week for an hour or two a day, they simply aren't holding up like other, less costly shoes I have owned.The cleats are wearing out quite quickly and one of the inside seems is coming apart.Comparing these shoes to my cheaper Adidas models shows some serious lack in durability.I love the shoes, but I can't afford to replace them as much as they would need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copa's are great","review":"My son wears these boots straight out of the box!

I was disappointed when I received them to see that the quality of the craftsmanship has greatly changed, in addition to the materials being used. The cleats seemed flimsy and light, particularly when I compared them to my old ones. Unfortunately, I sent them back. However, it's worth noting that I recently purchased another pair of Adidas \\"Predator\\" cleats (for just $50) and they seem to be of much higher quality.

These do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boots but a little narrow","review":"These are probably the second best boots I've owned (out of @3 dozen). I generally don't like Adidas boots but I saw a lot of good reviews for the Adidas Copa Mundial.First, yes they are very confortable and fit really nice with ONE exception. I think they are too narrow. Not as narrow as Puma boots, but too narrow for my comfort. I did develop a little blister on each foot but that was becasue I did not give the shoes enough \\"break-in\\" time which you should always do. (PS I finally broke these in faster by wearing them in luke warm water for 20 minutes and then letting them dry on my feet. worked great)Second, the sole cushioning could be a little better. I don't know if the cushioning on this boot is too hard or if it felt hard because of the narrowness of the boot. Either way, it could be worse.Overall, I really like this boot.

Notwithstanding what others have said, my view is that the cleat runs SLIGHTLY small, so you may need to add half a size to what you normally take.I referee rather than play, so admittedly do not subject tham to the same abuse as others might, but my first pair lasted several years, and to be honest, I am replacing them only because the leather became somewhat stiff - my fault for not treating them every so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adidas Copas","review":"I have been playing soccer for about 20 years now.

And while I found the entire book interesting and a page turner, I especially liked the section on race relations or \\"Black & White\\" and \\"White Privilege\\" as they were respectively entitled. I think it's sad that in this day and time, we still have a race problem.

In the flesh, Dale is portrayed as a resolute and courageous ironman; in the spiritual, he's portrayed as a giant. Inspiring, in that regard. I presume that Richardson's knowledge of some of the actions/thoughts etc. of the indigenous peoples are from hearsay and speculation (I don't know this to be true), and the writing style certainly seemed to be more sentimental in those portions of the book. Even so, this is worth the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lords of the Earth","review":"This book is a true story of missionaries in Papua New Guinea who worked with Stone Age primitive tribes.

The footage is ancient (from the 60's I think) and amateurish (much was shot by a shaking hand or by holding a camera out a window while riding in a car). Also the information presented was severely outdated and irrelevant. I don't understand how the release date come have been listed as 2006. In my opinion it should be listed as 1966.

These cookies are not even remotely close to what I remember them being and at first thought maybe it was just my old memories competing, but my husband tried them too and said the same thing! They're smaller, a bit thicker, harder/crunchier and not nearly as buttery and smooth as they used to be. I don't know what the hell happened or why the formula has changed (someone in an earlier review mentioned high fructose corn syrup) but it's really disappointing and a shame that a Chicago classic has been reduced to mediocrity.

Anyway, at this point the book became predictable and somewhat sappy. And the worst part is that I think Albom used the Footprints in the Sand poem as the format for his book.

I enjoyed the style of writing and how the book was put together because it flashed back to Eddie's past birthdays and also, the chapters were about either the next person he meets in heaven or the next lesson he learns.

It really didn't matter....The book is a delight! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I thought this book was very preachy. I don't think it had any fresh ideas. I am glad I took it out of the library rather thanbuy it. This way I only wasted my time rather than my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gives mediocrity a bad name","review":"Albom's conception of heaven is trite and unoriginal. Other reviewers seem to disagree. Other reviewers also seem to think that \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" is the word of God. If you like books that are humorous (e.g. Catch-22) or profound (e.g. Siddhartha), then reread one of those because you're not going to find any of that here. On the other hand, if you want something sappy and serious, but upbeat, then you've found your bathroom-reading here.This is a fast read but a short book. You're probably paying about a dollar a word here. Albom pulls out all the college student tricks (e.g. small pages, half-blank pages) just to stretch his pamphlet into 198 pages. Still, in his defense, the book shouldn't be any longer. It already starts to wear thin in parts. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming","review":"This book reminds me of \\"Chicken Soup\\" series. They are nice gifts for your grandparents and small children. Since it is very short, you will not loose anything by reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Imagery.","review":"This is not about atheism or New age pop psychology. It is a novel, period. Mr. Albom shows that life is not as short or shallow as we think. The connections between people have more depth than we recognize on the surface. Although this book is cut from a different genre, it reminded me of Charles Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" Eddie, a once wounded WW2 veteran is now 83 years old. He feels that his life has been dank & uninspiring. He dies in a tragic accident saving a little girl. He soon meets 5 souls, some he knows, others not.From childhood to old age they show him his life, revealing a haunting secret behind his anguished question. \\"Why was I here?\\" This was a quick & entertaining slide show of very different characters. It made you want to have the author delve deeper into the five souls so you could feel their experiences as much as we felt Eddie's. Nonetheless, it was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Albom at this best","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a moving and beautiful book.Perfect for this time of year."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Heaven!!!","review":"This book is about an old man named Eddie. Eddie works at an amusement park call Ruby Pier. Eddie dies. He goes to heaven. when he gets to heaven he has more questions than answers. to help him, Eddie meets five people. The people help Eddie uderstand his life. The ending is absolutely wonderful! i really like the ending of the book. it wrapped up the book very well. You never see it coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite popular mushy over hyped","review":"Seventeen hundred plus people have rated this book for an average of four stars. Not much else to say. I found this book to be overly sentimental, mush with no real lesson to learn about life. An old guy dies; he was disappointed that he had not done more with his life, but he comes to see it was OK after all. It's a wonderful life, Jimmy Stewart, etc. Read it if you must, but there is a lot of better ideas about the value of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chance to reflect","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven begins a little unconventionally with the death of the main character, Eddie an 83 year old fairground worker. The book then travels back to follow his life and the connections and interconnections with five people who knowingly, and sometimes unknowingly, shaped those 83 years.The book is short, at around 100 pages it can easily be read in less than a day, and its message is simple. Our lives are lived amidst a web of connections and interconnections, the significance and effects of which are impossible to appreciate at the time.The simplicity of the story serves to invite the reader to reflect and discover insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I would have to say though that \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" had a greater impact on my life than this one did, but nevertheless, it was a great book to read. It would leave the readers rethinking about their own lives. I'd like to point out one correction for this book though. The Filipino word for soldier is \\"Sundalo\\" and not \\"sundalong\\" as stated in the last chapter of this book. Not that it matters much, but just thought I'd point it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad i got a discount","review":"i bought this book because of all the hype that surrounds it.while reading this, i kept on thinking i'll keep reading and maybe it will get better. I kept on reading and then thought, maybe the ending will be great. i finished the book wondering what the heck was all the excitement about? Tuesdays with Morrie was written from the heart. To me this book was written to satisfy the public's thirst for anything written about the \\"other side\\" and to make money from it. I felt nothing for the characters and the story left me feeling nothing but disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deep, Philosophical, moving book","review":"This book was an easy read, but not in a boring childish way, but in an interesting, moving kind. It made me think of life on earth and what it means to truly live and make something of our lives. I've learned so much from this book. It teaches us about forgiveness, understanding, perceptions, love, guilt, and heaven. Every individual lives in their own joyful world in heaven-heaven may be the time in our life on earth that we truly enjoyed. It will be filled with happiness rather than pain. I realize that God will give justice once we die-he makes us realize our mistakes and past like Eddie before letting our soul rest eternally. If you read this book, you may get a different message out of it, but that is the beauty of this book- that we all read it and make our own interpretations of heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick delivery, good read, a little water damage","review":"The book was delivered quickly but had some water damamge, even though it was listed as new. This book was for my son's school project. He read it quickly and loved it. It was suspenseful the whole time and very intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"After reading Five People I still don't know why all the fuss. It is not a well written book. The story relies far too much on sensational events - a POW camp escape, a failed rescue in a stormy sea, a successful rescue at an amusement park tragedy, blah blah blah. The book is at its best when it doesn't rely on such third grade nonsense, i.e the parts that focus in Eddie and his wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for people who don't like literature","review":"I just read, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" Have you read it? If not, you should know it's mistitled, and should be called, \\"The Five People Eddie Meets in Heaven.\\" The only universal elements of this novella are the sappy, sentimental, predictable messages Eddie's five people give him. Eddie is a simple-minded man of meager, crushed ambition, and just to give you a prelude of what you're in for, every significant event in his life just happens to take place on his birthday. Oh, the richness and irony when significant events happen right on a man's birthday! I'm not saying there aren't parts of the book that are moving. But you know what? Oprah is moving too, and her show has more literary value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book, but...","review":"The writing is fine. Good grammar, good sentence construction, and nicely laid out paragraphs. It's not difficult to read, and it's not exactly boring.I guess what I have a problem with is the whole point of the book. It's very \\"Christmas Special.\\" Moreover, it's just been done. A thousand times. There's nothing new here. And there's nothing much to learn from reading this.It might be the kind of gift you give someone you don't know very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright.","review":"This book was a good read. I found it enjoyable and at times quite sad...The author writes quite well.However, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Sometimes I am confused by the books that are bestsellers when there is so much out there that's so much better. This book is nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"The five people you meet in heaven worth 4","review":"The five people you meet in heaven was a very moving and touching story to read. At first I was just reading the book because it was the shortest one to choose form our selection for our English Class. But as I started to read the story I started to get into it. The only part of the book that I didnt like was at the end of every chapter there was a part about Eddie's birthday. This was interesting but I felt that it didnt belong in the story. I think Mitch Albom took the right direction with this story. The colorful setting and lively characters show how this man's live was. Through the good times and the bad he stayed true to character. I would reccomend this book to a lot of people. If you like a short very interesting story with a great storyline, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant","review":"Mitch Albom's book cannot help but to inspire deep thinking. The connectiveness we should feel throughout humanity is lacking in our modern busy world. Albom reminds us through this work how we are connected knowingly and unknowingly. This book was a quick read. I caught myself only perusing the first life and had to reread. The great thing about his work is that it could be enjoyed on a surface level and delved into it slower for more self reflection. I was definitely glad that I picked it from my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book--very inspirational!","review":"I am so glad I decided to read this book. I was really feeling torn as to whether I wanted to start a book that was known be slightly controversial, because I have a hard time \\"ditching\\" a book midway. However, this was a quick-read that proved to be more inspirational than entertaining. It was, however, exciting to attempt to predict who Eddie's \\"next person\\" in Heaven was. (Not so predictable, it turned out!) I will mention that while I am a Christian woman, you do not need to be a Christian to relate to this book. It simply describes the \\"pre-heaven\\" state that Eddie goes to directly after his death where he meets 5 different people that explain to him how their lives were connected and explain different aspects of his life that he didn't understand before. It really is interesting and really makes you think. There are more than a few phrases and paragraphs from the book that I think will stay with me forever :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"If you are looking for a book you wont want to put down then Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven is the perfect book for you. I read this book for an assignment in school and found myself unable to stop reading it. The vivid details and real-life connections made throughout the story made it come to life. I found myself relating many of the things in the book to my life and to many of my close friend's and family member's lives.I thoroughly enjoyed this story of love, loss and friendship. By page count, this story is short however, the number of deep thoughts and heart grasping events in the book made it anything but short. I would suggest this book to anyone enjoys realistic fiction with a dreamy twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Thought provoking","review":"So much to think about you can devour it in a setting and then reread and read again. People do impact each others lives under many circumstances. Powerful to think that no matter what you do or even who you are you can touch others, make a impact. Days later and I find myself pondering on the five people I will meet in heaven. Perhaps the greatest message is be aware of people who come and go in your life and make a difference every day"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story except for minor detail","review":"I am a husband who is truly in love with my wife. I am also a Soldier and a mechanic so I was able to relate . It was truly a great book except for one minor minor issue: Even the very first cordless drill was not noisy and certainly not anything you had to raise your voice over. I enjoyed reading this book but the mechanic in me had to say something even if nobody else hears me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read!","review":"Special and heart-warming story that brings the reader to understanding with himself.

I am so glad I finally took the time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone has a purpose...","review":"I'm a firm believer in the fact that everyone has a purpose on this earth. No matter what your history, background, gender, class or whatever else may be, you were placed on this planet for a reason, even if you don't think you've figured it out.This book does a great job of showing one man's life's purpose. Even though the earth he lived on seemed empty and didn't support him, he had a purpose and his life was seen through giant lenses in heaven. Great read for those looking for philosophical quotations and the author's insight on life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"'Five People You Meet in Heaven' is a disappointing book. The title itself suggests some interesting ideas about heaven. But the idea is a simple one; that could be covered by the first person the hero meets in Heaven. Making it five people is just a way to make a short story long. As an online short story it would live up to its expectations. As a long story, hard-cover book, it does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I loved Tuesdays with Morrie, but was horribly disappointed in Five People You Meet In Heaven.

And the first few pages do get you interested. BUT I read it with my mouth open wondering why anyone would praise this book.

The concept interesting and the author had a nice literary style. This book lacked depth and emotional pull. My book club unanimously agreed that this book was \\"okay\\" and was missing something to make it truly spectacular. Not a bad read, but I would not read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book for Everyone","review":"\\"This is a story about a man named Eddie and it begins at the end, with Eddie dieing in the sun.\\" This is an important but unique quote from The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom. This quote starts Eddie's adventure through the five levels and lessons in heaven.Eddie works at Ruby Pier Amusement Park and is 83 years old. He is lonely and unsocial, but children seem drawn to him. At this time in Eddie's life he feels like his life did not mean anything. He dies trying to save a little girl and as he travels through heaven he discovers that he, like everyone else in the world that had a purpose. He also gains more respect for others as well as himself in this book.After reading this book, it became my new favorite. It has a very surprising and emotional ending. This book is wonderful for anyone who likes spiritual or fictional books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impresses again","review":"Mitch Albom is a great writer and this book I feel is better than \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\". That might seem like a stretch, but with the small stories about how people are affected by everything in life, it puts things into perspective to think things through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"One of the absolute finest stories I have ever read and loved. Mitch is my favorite author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read","review":"I would love it if life after death were like that. I believe that what we go through many incarnations and learn things each time. This could be one way of reviewing what you've learned. This book is not about reincarnation though, I don't want you to get confused. When Ed dies, he meets 5 people in heaven that touched his life in someway. Some he hasn't even met. But his life and their life were altered in some way. It's a great read if you are interested in life after death, or how life is interconnected. It is fiction but it does carry with it a lesson about interconnectedness. We are all connected in some way.Even if you are not interested in these things, if you like reading about other's lives, it's a great book for that too. This book is definitely highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Happens for a Reason","review":"I love -- LOVE -- this book. There are hundred of reviews, so I'll be brief: An old man dies saving a little girl. In the afterlife, five people -- some he knows, some complete strangers -- take turns explaining how events in his life have impacted the lives of others. Much to his surprise, the lives of others have had an equally profound impact on his own life. The reader learns that at the core of this cynical, resentful old man is a lonely individual who longs for the woman he loves, and the acceptance of an absent father. This book is rich in its character development and deeply profound in its underlying message, which is simply this: We are here to do what we are here to do. Grown men will cry. I sure did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bit what I expected","review":"As the story goes back and forth from heaven to earth, you keep on wondering where its going, when it finally gets to the point (all 5 times) its almost like there is no point at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Didactic Christian Tale Well Told","review":"This book was well written, but not necessarily well told. It's not a story but a morality tale, and a christian morality tale at that. I read it for a book club and would not choose to read it otherwise. But if you like self-help parables, you may like this book. It's an interesting concept and is generally well-written; and I can't slight the author, who executes his concept nicely. But it's not really a new concept--that in a christian heaven you'll meet people from your past who will set the record straight for you and allow you to forgive your sins. This is age-old stuff. It's a short, quick read. Unfortunately, that's all it was for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I am a fan of Mitch Albom and this book doesn't disappoint, it is a quick read but you will find yourself picking it up time and time again.A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Everyone Raving About?","review":"People keep recommending this book, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why! If you've seen \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (and who hasn't), you pretty much get the drift here. Sappy, dopey, and for me, unenlightening. Completely forgettable. If I'm being generous, perhaps I would say the book is \\"cute\\", maybe suitable for people in the hospital recovering from surgery, for whom the left-over anesthesia in the body makes concentration on works that are though-provoking difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"Not a good book. Guess that says it all. I hate when a book receives this much press, and turns out to be so bad. Was it well written at least? Not really. Was it funny or thought provoking? No. Was it a tear jerker? No. Do I feel my life is enriched because of reading this book? No. Was it at least mindless entertainment? Not even. Quick read? Yes, it was that.Meaning of life? No. Something to think about? No. I picked this book up as a free selection from a book club, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. Want inspiration? Hope? Faith? A meaning to life? Perhaps the Christian Bible, or some other Holy scriptures will suit you better. I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost In Space","review":"Watching an old episode of Lost in Space would be more entertaining than this book. The countdown to the death scene is really stupid and poorly written. This is newspaper quality writing--not book writing.

Please, can I return this piece of trash?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks but no thanks...","review":"Reading this book was a big disappointment.Why does Mitch think everyone needs to hear about his bizarre ideas about a Godless heaven?

If this is what the \\"average\\" reader finds intellectually stimulating, God help us all.

I get what he was attempting to impart, that everyone in our lives has some meaning. But I was puzzled, but most always finish a book and did. I then read the reviews and wonder how people raved about the book...not sure it is worth reading again to try and \\"get it.\\" I gave Tuesdays with Morrie to everyone for Christmas...not this book. Sorry, it was too off the wall. I like to enjoy the journey, this was just a puzzle I was hoping had a great finish. Hopefully, Albom's next book will be a more touching...this wasn't for me.

I enjoy reading books but I have found this one in question.I could not understand how editors rated this book as they did. I have read more interesting plots that were well composed to determine this was not one fitting in the category. I have determined that it is not what and how you write that gets your book selling, it is your journalistic credentials and who you know.On a scale from 1-10. I would give this book a four.

At one point, Eddie asks, \\"How much longer is this going to go on?\\" And I felt exactly the same way. Albom asks us to swallow a lot of malarkey in this book. A Blue Man who changes color before Eddie's eyes? People flying around and disappearing in great whooshes of air and color? I did find the chapter about Eddie meeting his abusive father who can't hear or see him interesting, but it was too much like Jimmy Stewart in \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". Well, it's a stinky book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the five people you meet in heaven","review":"This Book was a rivetingly, great story for those of us who believe that when we die, our lives and the good we do, don't just stop there. thanks you so much for this moving tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book has a nice beginning,but it gets nowhere,really.The writing is so sappy,and it gets way too cliche.It is actually a dull version of The Christmas Carol.The characters are one dimensional,and I don't really feel for Eddie.Okay we know he had a hard time at war,but why keep mulling over it?And his relationship with Mag was so unrealistic and trite.I am only 14 and I don't understand how adults could love this book.Let's face it,Mitch Albom's writing is amateur."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 People You Meet in the Afterlife","review":"The book describes what it is like to die and meet people inthe afterlife through the character of Eddie. The charactermeets with an untimely death by accident and awakens to findan associate of 75 years earlier. Another story depictsa mountainous and snowy field with elderly people eating piein a diner. Yet, another story shows his wife, Mary with handsextended in heaven to welcome him home.The book provides a preview into life after death. As such,it helps us accept both life and death dispassionately bypersonalizing the after death experience. The stories arerealistic and the audience develops an empathy for thecharacters portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five People","review":"An interesting book as it causes one to think about how are lives are inter-related with people we don't know or barely know, who may have great impacts on our lives. Also, let's one imagine the difficulties, unknown to us, in someone's life who is very close to us and how those difficulties shaped their personality and their actions.For the Christian, the book is not theologically correct, but still interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"I read this book as a class assignment not too long ago and I decided that I had to read all of it before everyone else was done. The writing style was easy to read and it made me want to read more. Throughout the book, the main character goes to heaven and meets the 5 people that made a difference in his life and the people's lives who were effected by him. I never would have guessed some of the people that he met. This book has a deep meaning to it and has some wonderful lessons intertwind with a great read. I reccomend this to anyone who wants a fast good book. I know it talks about heaven, but it really isn't pushing the idea of heaven on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Save your money! I can't believe the same person that wrote the wonderful book \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" wrote this book. It's boring, unimaginative, uninspiring, and for such a short book, seemed to take forever to read. So disappointing! Tuesdays With Morrie was exactly the opposite, a terrific read. I think Mr. Album pumped this book out hurriedly and it's selling on his name. He can do so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is Heaven, I'm not going.","review":"I thought I would read this before purchasing Mitch Albom's more recent Time Keeper just to have some exposure to the author's writing. In a way, I'm glad I did. I have not read a more depressing story since Old Yeller, and that was a substantial number of books ago. While I get the comparison's to It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol (and no, the book does not have anything to do with Christmas), this is a sad story about a sad man who lived a sad life. The fact that the people he meets in Heaven can help explain why, does not make it any less sad. I think I'll skip Time Keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental and Thought Provoking","review":"I was a little put off by the brevity of this book and give it 4 stars for that reason.

Great book if only for that very reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie, the man who has made me think of my Heaven","review":"Dear Potential Reader,Eddie will touch your life in many ways. It will make you look back and wonder who's life you have touched; and make you consider who has really touched your life. It will make you wonder who your 5 people are; and if anyone is still waiting for you to complete their Heaven. As a nurse, I really wonder about the lives I may have touched and not even know it. From the little girl's hand at Children's Hospital, to the 95 year old on Hospice......God I hope I have made a difference. May you be able to complete your Heaven one day...may it be a beach in S.C., or a small town in the U.P. or just a moment shared in 10th grade on Outer Drive.....I hope your Heaven is all that it can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre","review":"This book first caught my eye while I was browsing Amazon online. Many people on the site talked about how this book was life-altering and that it showed the real meaning of what life is all about. Sadly, the book was very mediocre to me. The moral of the book (I won't ruin it for anyone) was very cliche - something we've all heard a million times. The book didn't have enough sustenance to keep me very entertained and the storyline got tedious after a while.If someone is truly looking for the real purpose of life, I would not recommend this book as an appropriate read. Save your money and get another book that will be more worthy of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"With the media hype surrounding this book and its placement on bestseller lists I expected a powerful read. This is not what I got. The book is contrived at best and sappy at its worst. Although the premise itself is genius I found that the story did not live up to its potential. There were moments while reading that I expected the next page to be more engaging but this never happened. Poor Eddie spent his first moments in heaven full of angst and confusion trying to determine why certain people greeted him. The fifth person to greet Eddie was probably a tear jerking event for some readers, but I felt cheated. The ending was lame. I agree with several other reviewers that the best thing about this book was its quick readability. For those that have not read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", do not let this book be a guide for you. Tuesdays is a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS THE CHEESE","review":"This book was so predictable and cheesy. As a reviewer aptly mentioned above, it was SO written to be a movie of the week.If you are looking for a moving book or a book that makes you think about life, don't pick this one up, you'd be better off reading Chicken Soup for the Heart (kidding), but honestly, don't expect much. I think this book was probably written in a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing","review":"I cannot understand the good critics I have read about this book. I don't like to leave books unfinished, but when I had reached the second person that Eddie meets in heaven, I could not read one more word... I find this book terribly boring, easy and unrefined, bad literature, that doesn't know how to transmit feelings. Moreover it is supposed to be a lesson of morality, but it is such an empty morality. Does not inspire me at all. I definitely do not recommend this book to people who like real, good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it is slightly better than \\"Tuesdays With Morrie.\\" And this leads to an obvious question: If I disliked \\"Morrie\\" so much, why on earth would I bother reading another book by Albom? The answer is simple: a friend told me this book made sense and contained great truths. But it didn't.The book is disjointed, scattered, self-consciously arty. It is very little more than a series of platitudes and banalities; it reveals secrets that have been known for centuries. There's really no point in going into the plot or characters or atmosphere after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read so far","review":"The five people you meet in heaven is a outstanding book that talks about a guy who travels through heaven and along the way he meet five people that have effected his life in one way or another or they have done something to effect his life for the future. I would have to say that i enjoyed this book and would recomended it to any one i know i talks about what life could be like in the after life and how one person can change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know It's a Huge Bestseller, but. . . .","review":". . . I just wish it weren't so superficial. \\"Five People\\" is well-written and you're hooked early on by wanting to know the outcome of the situation in which Eddie dies. And there's a neat twist to the war story. But I balked at the message--yes, we all have a chance to make a difference, but there are people who live hard and sad lives, like Eddie, and to make it all \\"OK\\" by this vision of heaven left me cold. Isn't it all more complicated than this? I think my Mom would like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It didn't just open my eyes... it opened my heart & mind","review":"Amazing. This book is incredibly well-written and well-thought out. I finished it in a 4 hour sitting, as I just could not put it down. Being a 20 year old female, who has often questioned life since my mother died 12 years ago, this put a lot of things in perspective. It showed me the importance of living, that I DO matter and that I DO effect others on a day to day basis. I learned that forgiving is okae, people die for a reason, that the most simple task may have a huge outcome, etc. etc. I suggest anyone who has ever questioned their existance, to read this book. It'll give you a new insight on this thing we like to call life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Albom book","review":"I have heard so much of Tuesdays with Morrie and went to buy it, but it wasn't in stock. I bought Five People instead and was a little disappointed. It was well written though. I really like Albom's writing style, but by the end of the book I felt sad for Eddie. I felt like he learned his life lessons when his life was over. Maybe that is the point Albom was trying to make...Learn in life; not in death. I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read and thought provoking","review":"This story had its twists and turns. Some of it was fairly boring but the idea of meeting different people for different REASONS (the REASON, not the person, being the main idea) was thought provoking.I finished this in one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quick Yet Painful Read","review":"I had heard about the subject matter of the book and the premise intrigued me. It was such a creative idea that you meet five people in heaven that tell you about your life and why things happened as they did. Maybe my expectations were too high but I did not enjoy the book. The book jumped around a lot from past to present. Many of the scenarios presented in the past were uninformative and not necessary to the plot or character development. The focus was mostly on the main character, Eddie, and his actual life and not his afterlife. The sections on his afterlife were brief and very disappointing. I was expecting some profound words about life and life's lessons but the author's take on the meaning of Eddie's life was a disappointment. I finished reading the book only out of curiosity as to why others found the book interesting, and in hopes that it would get better. I would not recommend this book for it did not captivate me nor cause me to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Albom does it again. If you have read his former books you will want to buy this one. I could not put it down and felt I was better for reading it. His writing is the best by far. I hope this author writes another book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Thoughtful","review":"A quick and insightful book that will make you stop and take stock. Certainly not as emotionally provocative as Tuesday's with Morrie, but if taken in a greater context, has life lessons for any one of us. A kind and peaceful message. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I thought I was purchasing a brand new version of this book. When it arrived the front cover had black smudge marks on it. The back cover had black marker on it as well. Very disappointed, especially as this was to be a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"An excellent read with the style that only Mitch Albom seems to possess anymore. He leads you through the singularity of the main character and divulges various scenarios that develop through out this character's life and the effect that numerous other characters have on him both in life and in death. Other information is provided to the reader that help to explain the main character's reaction to the various scenarios and how it effects the lessons that he learns. But, it all ties together as the reader reaches the conclusion. No loose ends! SMS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"Excellent story. Well written, not predictable and an ending that brings the book to an appropriate close. I'll be looking at other books by Mitch Albom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting concept for a book...","review":"Only about halfway through the book and it has changed the way I think about how the actions we take and the things we do affect those around us, much of the time without us even thinking about it, or realizing it. Each decision we make is like a pebble thrown into a still pond, the ripples spread out and affect everything around us.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was thought provoking and one of those tear-jerker, feel good kind of books. It wasn't as strong as Tuesdays with Morrie, but it was still interesting. If you let it, it makes you think about your own life purpose...and how every action has a reaction...how each person affects others, without even meaning to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing book, both prolific, part melodramatic...but extrememly well written. In the last few days I have read several awesomely written books. This one, Nightmares Echo and Secret Life of Bees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental, yet intriguing","review":"I liked this book because although lacking significant depth it is light, original and intriguing read. The story itself is touching and it reminds me of a few similar books. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational! :-)","review":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is so engaging you will learn an abundance in life mottos to live by. I understood Eddie's life and why things happened the way they did. This book struck me and actually gave me hope in life's regard and I think it will leave you with a revised persepective on life as well. This is the type of book that everyone should read and will certainly enjoy! It's a fast read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong On Perspective","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom will touch the introspective side in your soul. Mitch Albom writes of Eddie, a maintenace man who feels that he has lived an ordinary life. When an accident takes his life one day, he is visited by five people whom he was connected. Whereas Eddie did not see their profound effect from his point of view, each of these souls certainly were shaped by Eddie.The story of the Blue Man really opened up how one action can cause a chain reaction of emotions. The tale of Eddie's father shows how toughness on the outside can hide the gentle kind soul on the inside. Also greater insight is given to the war is hell statement in two of the other lessons. And we can not forget about the feelings of true love and how it effects us when someone is here and later gone.One can certainly gain good perspective on life's lessons by reading The Five People You Meet In Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, very engaging","review":"I got this on CD and really enjoyed it. The story was told in a very interesting way that kept you wanting more. I was so anxious to get to the end, and then disappointed it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching & thought provoking.","review":"My daughter gave me \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" for Christmas, knowing how much I enjoyed \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" I began reading the book today, during my 6 hour chemo treatment...& finished it when I returned home. There are times when we all wonder if our lives have touched people, and if we made a diiference at all... even those of us who appear not to have accomplished much. I am saddened that Eddie didn't realize these things while he was alive. Perhaps it teaches us to live life to our fullest and shouldn't leave our lives with unfunished business. I gave each of my children \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" to read. They enjoyed it and shared it with their freinds. I will give each of them a copy of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\" I have no doubt it will affect their lives in a possitive way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"The editorial reviews made it out like this book had profound meaning and a lesson to be taught. That is a profound misconception. This book basically says that the only reason people survive is because death missed you and killed someone else. What kind of message is that. The ending was a little charming, but that was about it. Also it was way to short. I read the entire book cover to cover in only a few hours. I have to say I was expecting much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dejavu","review":"A touching, heart-felt adventure into the transition between this life and the next for a wonderful, caring soul. Simple enough to be read in one short sitting. Captivating enough to be read over and over again. Thought provoking yet gentle storytelling. Treat yourself to an afternoon adventure. Your \\"heart\\" will never be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its er, ok...at best","review":"I read the book over a few days after reading the hype about it.It was a pleasant read - but I found it very hollow. There wasnt much substance to it and, after each person visits Eddie and leaves, you feel like there are more questions than answers.The book didnt do much for me and had no lasting impact..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sense of Continuity","review":"The author of \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" draws together the jigsaw puzzle pieces in our lives, showing how other people's lives have not only influenced but have determined the course of our own lives. Some of those people, we knew. Some were persons we will meet for the first time. Each one did something that changed the course of your life. An interesting concept! There are undoubtedly a great many more than five persons like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read in a While","review":"This is the best book that I've read in a while. I was afraid it would be a very spiritual book because of the title, but it really focused on the story and not so much on religion. The author really developed the characters well, and I felt like the ending was a surprise, although other people that I discussed the book with were did not find it as surprising as I did. This is a good story for an afternoon read. It only took me about 2 hours to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I am not in agreement with the other reviews posted here. I think this book is a dud. Wish I hadn't wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"all fluff","review":"This book does not have any substance. If you are looking for a light read, you might be satisfied. But if you want any truth, anything real, anything that makes you think, you should look elsewhere. My daughter had to read this book for school - what a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique and Pointless","review":"This book is not this reader's genre of book, but it was recommended to me and left within my reach. The first few pages and I admit I was hooked. It is almost a single sitting book. The style was very interesting and it being a short book, it moves right along towards the ending. Except the ending appears, the book is over, and you are left scratching your head saying what was the point of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story you can live without.","review":"I am fond of imaginative stories and I must say I was intrigued by the coverslip summary of what to expect. The book is an easy and fast read but although it starts out interesting and suprising in terms of who the main character meets in Heaven - it leaves you utterly dissapointed. The characters are stereotyped as in bad TV series, and there are scences that are unconvincing to say the least. What really annoyed me when reading this book was, that one major part of what Eddie found in Heaven was about war - as if everyone should have participated in one so as to have something to find in Heaven that will give meaning to it - as there is no meaning to war. My advice, spend your time with something else - what about inventing a story yourself - I am sure you will come up with something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding","review":"Author Mitch Albom must have phoned this one in. So disappointing. The concept is excellent and I expected great reflection and life lessons. Instead I got sap, sap and more sap. Read Tuesdays with Morrie and hope for better in Albom's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Perhaps the worst book I've read all year. It would have come off better as a B rated movie of the week.It is obvious the success this simply written story has enjoyed has come from riding the coattails of other well written books that have appealed to our sense of spirituality.There is nothing apealing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FAIRY TALE","review":"What a disappointment! I can't believe I fell for the hype on this juvenile offering by Mitch Albom. Nothing in this booklives up to advance praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the people you'll meet in heaven is a hack","review":"This is a hacked out piece of garbage, completely unoriginal, poorly written, monumentally boring and insulting to readers in a manipulative, almost devious way. It's also a major disappointment to someone who LOVED Tuesdays With Morrie. Mitch Albom can do so much better... right?If this manuscript was submitted to a writing teacher, it would get sent back, marked up with lots of red ink and comments in the margins that would go something like this: HUH??? WHAT??? PATHETIC WRITING! WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO FOOL WITH THIS TRIPE???If one of the people we all get to meet in heaven is a hack writer, don't be surprised if his name is Mitch Albom.I hope one of the people I'll get to meet in heaven will be a gullible book buyer who will pay full cover price for this sad little volume of cliches!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like One of Those Inspirational E-mails Your Mom Forwards To You","review":"Five People You Meet In Heaven is a tale of life and death; and about the five people the main character meets in Heaven.The writing is horrible. The format is strange. The writer often has the skill of a high school teenager writing a paper for his English class.I have to give credit to his vivid imagination, but in the end, you don't really care about what you just read. The title is a bit misleading. It's not five people you meet in Heaven, it should have been \\"Five People Eddie Meets In Heaven\\" since apparently, each person has their own unique five that they meet.Anyway, the tone and the skill of this book is on level with those nice inspirational emails your mom forwards you. Except, those are short, sweet, and to the point, while this book useless and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even for 10 People!!!","review":"I had read a small excerpt of this book somewhere and I made it my mission to find it and read it. I found it in a new Borders store and it was 40% off also.Maybe because I had hyped myself up so much to read this book that I found it to be a complete flop for me. It would almost seem that the author would be on to something and just as he is ready to dive in, he holds back and moves to another character.It was a cute book that did not have an inch of depth. I can really see how this could have been a real winner of a book if the characters were fleshed out with some details. It needed to have several sub plots to make it over the hump.It made a nice Christmas stocking stuffer. I would have been better off sitting through \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\" once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This book is flat out awful. Don't waste your money.

I would put this in the to 3 worst books tht I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of heaven","review":"I hated this book, as did everyone in my book club. Not uplifting at all or inspirational. The only reason I give it one star is that it is a very quick read. I was really hoping for more and was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this one out with the trash!","review":"I was so disappointed with this book! I expected something intriguing & poignant...Something, that even if it was not well-written, it was at least going to be meaningful. Well, at page 70 I was still waiting & by page 140 I just wanted to throw the book in the trash & move on to something WORTH READING!Every \\"Person in Heaven\\" is so self-important & yet, there is nothing to their messages. It even started to feel like I was being condescended to, because who doesn't already know that decisions one person makes directly & indirectly affect many other people?? Only the dopey, boring main character, that's who!I'd be afraid to give this book to anyone I know for fear they'd feel I've insulted their intelligence.If you absolutley must see what this book is all about, get it from your local library - And if you just want to get the message it's claiming to contain, then watch \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" for the 500th time. That would be far more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Read!

If you are looking for something that you must think about don't even buy into the hype of this book. The 5 People is riddled with cliches and predictability. I myself am into books that make me think and are unexpected. However this book did not even come close to my expectations. If you are simple minded you will love this book but if you are searching for something more like a book an author had to research and actually spend more than a week on avoid this read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Five People You Meet in Heaven","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I read it in a couple of hours. Albom presents a \\"heaven\\" without a God and without joy. I found it trite and depressing. As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life. That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth. If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing","review":"Well, this is not Tuesday's With Morrie. That book was really good and based on a real person. Here we have a fable that is poorly written and rather flat. I did not feel inspired at all. This is really a reworking of It's A Wonderful Life, so the idea behind the book is not original. What gets me is the publisher's attempt to market this book as a sequel. The book looks like Tuesday with Morrie in size, shape and color, which makes me think that one really should never judge a book by its cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I don't care what religion/ lackthereof you are this book is heart warming.

The plot line was completely predictable and lost my interest immediately....but I finished it anyway. I regret wasting the time. Read The Celestine Prophecy instead. It is an oldie but a goodie that makes you think and leaves you with a new outlook on life, which is what this book poorly attempts to do....and fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While it was a relatively interesting read, it was nothing I would've purchased on my own.It had a very disappointing ending, possibly because I was expecting heaven to be about truth, and the main character is lied to by one of the people he meets there.

I guess it does have some appeal if you are looking for a fuzzy feel-good read on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but if you are looking for depth, do look elsewhere. The organization of the story, going back and forth between the main protagonist's experiences in \\"heaven\\" and episodic flashbacks to his life before death would make for an interesting read, had the \\"lessons\\" that are - apparently - to be learnt in heaven not already been trodden out by other new-agey novels of questionable value or daytime shows on Lifetime. Derivative and tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful","review":"Bad writing and worse thinking. Sentimental, insipid, insulting, cliched. So the point of heaven is to make you feel good about yourself? Like, that's the important thing, that Eddie have strong self-esteem? What about God? What about the soul? What about other people? Nope, this is a book where Eddie dies and goes to heaven for a New Age pep talk. Could appeal only to people who think that how they FEEL is the most important thing in the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Whip","review":"An interesting idea although not very well presented. This book is more like the second or third draft of a possibly good book, both in substance and style. I was disappointed because I felt that it could have been so much better.

I just finished it in less than 2 days and I must say, I have no idea what all the fuss was about. I was unimpressed, bored, not at all moved, and I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know.

I really liked the \\"One more Day\\" book, so I was excited to read this, but it was pretty much a let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Feel-Good Read","review":"If you're looking for a quick feel-good book, this is it. Without a doubt, this book will keep you entertained. If you try to compare it against typical Christian theology, you will be disappointed. It is not theologically sound that way. Example - the main character swears in Heaven a few times. I'm pretty sure that would not happen. But, none the less, the book is compelling and entertaining. At times it is touching, as well.The main character is Eddie. He is in his 80's, it is his birthday, and, of course, he dies. Eddie doesn't feel like his life was worth anything. He doesn't feel like he accomplished anything or used his full potential. He meets five people in Heaven that show him otherwise.Good weekend read. Actually, at just under 200 pages, it is a one day read. Read it as entertainment and not a book about what Heaven will really be like. Enjoy it, I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, terrible writing","review":"I don't know if it what is called the \\"sophomore jinx\\" in the publishing industry is the problem here, or if Albom is a \\"one hit wonder\\", but this book is truly awful.

So much for truth in advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back !!!!","review":"Hopeless...Bunch of balony.After reading this book I realized that because of Morie's wisdom, \\"Tuesdays with morie\\" became a classic.

After reading more than 50%, I am stopping. I had not read any reviews prior to downloading....this book was offered as a special, and since it is so very well known and supposedly beloved, what could go wrong? I am greatly relieved to discover a number of low ratings, one 4-page written much better than I could hope to produce. Let me just say that I found the book empty and somewhat vain but for the life of me (no pun intended) I cannot articulate why. I strongly feared that if I continued reading, I might never find the peace to go to sleep tonight, so very depressing it seemed. Please, God, don't let this be heaven. Aren't the trials on this earth quite enough?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven","review":"What a wonderful perspective on Heaven!

Both books were gifts to me, and I found them void of originality, thought or anything remotely approaching profundity.Saffire's \\"First Dissident\\" is a great book in which he extracts original thought provoking concepts from a profound subject.Albom's uncle must be his publisher! In his books, he takes a profound subject and extracts old tired concepts with all the thought of a vain empty headed teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pul eeze","review":"I'm convinced...readers don't know a good book anymore. Talk about over-rated. Geez--then a boring moving on top of this? It was OK...I just don't see what all the hoopla was about.Readers--stop giving 5 stars to EVERY book you pick up. There's something called discernment. Get some the next time you're at the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"the five people you meet in heaven","review":"The best book!!! My whole family has read this book!!! It really make you sit back and think, I love this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy and Interesting, With Sexiest Person...","review":"Fluffy little piece, that didn't make it stink. prose a la The Alchemist, simple considerations about how life fits together, etc. Here is where it stinks...I didn't look at the author's name when I began the book.......and at the 3rd person he met in heaven, I KNEW it was a male author. I can't spoil it by saying any more than the author has no problem with violence towards women [a few moments of it] for the sake of saving a drunk. The author himself states in the first person [again not a spoiler] that every story can be viewed from two sides. If the Third Person met's story is viewed from the other side it stinks. It takes a totally average book and casts a sexist shadow over it...one I was not looking for so it was glaring. Don't bother with this one unless you HAVE to read it.....has a cute and tidy ending, if you want this kind of reading I would recommend The Alchemist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuesdays was better...","review":"For the record, i NEVER recommended this crappy book nor did i place it on my wish list. I do wish that i never wasted my time reading The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I will give Mitch Albom credit for his idea to write Tuesdays. The idea was so great that Mitch Albom's non-existant writing talent did not bother me. However, the fact that he is a mediocre writer was illuminated when i read this book. Finally, i think he is cocky and untalented sports announcer (in MI)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"I always finish what I start. With that said, I TRIED to make myself finish this book but it was so poorly written that I refused to torchure myself further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe all the hype!","review":"This was truly the absolute, most disappointing book I've ever read. I was looking for an interesting read, and browsed through Amazon's Top Sellers list, and this book came well recommended. IT WAS AN UTTER WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.In the first few pages, the main character dies. The remainder of the book is an incredibly boring reminiscence of the man's life as he encounters a series of 5 people affected from his life in \\"heaven\\". The only reason I even continued to read this nostalgic, 2nd-grade-reading-level book was because I hoped for an ending that would give the 2 hours I wasted some meaning. All I got was an ending that, at least, put me out of my misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let dead ones to read this crap","review":"It is a cute and soothing fantasy that will tell you how simple is to understand our made up heaven.

Hate to be this negative but what a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book","review":"I picked this book because of the author, who had also written Tuesdays with Morrie. Tuesdays with Morrie, that was recommend to me,it was a great book so i wanted to see if this book was just as good.This book is about an old man named Eddie, who works at a carnaval. The carnaval is the only thing he has left because everyone one else in his life has passed away. This book unlike most others, the main character dies in the first chapter due to a tragic insident. He was trying to save a little girl form a cart falling from a ferris wheel. Once he dies he is taken to Heaven where he has five people waiting for him who will talk to him and tell him their stories and how he effected thiewr lives and their deaths. With each person he learns more and more about himself.I recommend this book. I liked it alot, and it made me think more about life. I dont think it was as good as Tuesdays with Morrie but it was still good. I think everyone should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"When I bought this book, I was expecting one of those heart wrenching inspirational books, but I was very disapointed. This book is written as though it's for jouveniles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I was wary of the book at the outset due to the fact that heaven-views rarely line up with the only authority on heaven. I felt that Albom's take was more like a drawn-out Twilight Zone episode. I kept expecting Rod Serling to appear and explain this story. If you want a better clue as to what heaven may be like, try John Eldredge's \\"Waking the Dead.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Chicken Soup Feel Good Drivel for Simpletons","review":"This, like Tuesday with Morrie, is a lame book. The author is not a good writer, so he instead appeals to the most basic, non-intellectual emotions of his less than cerebral diehard fans by employing hackneyed, formulaic story lines. Really, his books are horrible. I read both of his bestsellers because they got such good reviews, but both times, I was severly disappointed. Reading an Albom book is like watching an After School Special or reading a Chicken Soup for the Soul book--he attempts to affect your emotions by using the most direct (non-creative), simple (non-intellectual) story lines, rather than being a truly creative author by making you react emotionally without having to shove the simpleton feel-good drivel down your throat. The onely good thing I can say about Albom's books--they're very short."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it astonishes","review":"This novel is so bad, so over-hyped, so literally poor in its storyline, research, grammar, and literary value, I am just left astonished that anyone can write anything in its defense. For gosh sake, people, don't be taken in by this awful and crude drivel. I am just left shaking my head at the people who continue to buy this awful little nasty book."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding?","review":"Yes, this book brought me to tears....tears of pain. It is simply among the worst, most cliched, most sophomoric pieces of writing I've ever read. Albom is terrific on The Sports Reporters but he should leave fiction to the professionals. I suffered through the entire thing, hoping, waiting in vain, for some spark, some sign that this book deserves a spot on the bestseller list. Instead, it simply proved the theory that one bestseller is all you need to insure a spot on that list forever, regardless of the crap you publish. It's so bad, it will make you angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Mr. Albom!","review":"My Mom passed away a few months ago - so the title of this book caught my attention (and curiosity) right away. The book is an easy, entertaining read...as well as a comfort to anyone who has lost a loved one. I laughed and cried and found myself hoping that Mr. Albom has the inside scoop on what really happens when we reach the end of our lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"snapshot of Heaven","review":"I was unsure if I would enjoy reading someone else's point of view on such a personal subject, but I was delightfully amazed and enlightened. Mitch Albom painted a tasteful picture of Heaven, and the possibilities were realistic. He offered hope and a positive outlook on the subject of death. He also spun a nice tale of whom you meet and why. His point of view was refreshing. I was caught up in this \\"easy to read, and finish quickly\\" book. I have chosen to give this book to a few friends who are not intimidated by the thought of Heaven, and religion. I think it makes for a lovely gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Guide to Heaven","review":"A soft read, with much imagination.But, if you want more than that, I would suggest picking up a book or two about people who have been there; i.e. 'Near-Death Experiences' such as Tiffany Snow (\\"Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life\\"), or the numerous research documents available through IANDS (International Association of Near-Death Studies). Imagination is fine - but this is the information age - getting a group synopsis of heaven through unrelated people with NDEs can get you a better window, without having to stretch it too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After having read Tuesday with Morrie a few years ago and having liked that book ALOT, this one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news for the people who like this book.","review":"Heaven is not all about YOU. Heaven is all about GOD. There is no God in this book; Heaven is merely a place where one goes to get one's ego stroked, to be reassured that you are important and meaningful and necessary. God doesn't care whether you were \\"important\\" in an earthly sense.The primary reason why people enjoy this novel is because they like to think that Heaven is a place where all of their good deeds will continually be exalted by people who have no other purpose than to make them feel good about themselves. Who even cares where God is? The self is the new God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in","review":"If you look at the cover of this little book, you'll note it mentions Tuesdays with Morrie. Albom has written some admirable things. His latest endeavor isn't one of them. Cashing in on the Tuesdays fame along with media hype may allow Albom to reap the benefits for many years to come. Sad scenario for an author who has the ability but no imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewww","review":"I really really didnt like this book. i wasnt at all impressed. it was just sort of boring. i think it's a really cool idea but the book was just very terrible. i read it because i talked to someone who said it was so good they \\"just couldnt put it down\\".... i was really almost laughing because the book was so cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"In the words of the late classicist and scholar Moses Hadas, \\"This book fills a much-needed gap.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Five People You Meet in Heavan","review":"I did not want to put this book down.

If you want an easy read that makes you search your soul, this is a great book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing :o(","review":"I am stunned that this book remains on the best seller list, as I considered it fair at best! I kept waiting for this book to get more interesting, which was all but a couple of hours since this book is incredibly short, but it just never got any better. The book is not horrible, but it seems to missing something. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you find this book for a quarter at a yard sale & you have nothing better to read, go for it! Just my opinion...obviously a lot of people love this book, I just can't figure out WHY????"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this book. This was on the NY Times best-seller list, and I read about 20 reviews from amazon.com before purchasing. I had heard great reviews about this book and Tuesdays with Morrie. I am a girl who enjoys a great heart-warming and touching book. However, I found myself literally rolling my eyes while reading this book! It was incredibly corny and what would be called a typical \\"chick's book\\". I suppose the only reason that Tuesdays with Morrie was a lot better was because it's supposed to be a true story. Although this is based on a true character, the storyline is a bit far-fetched. Sorry, but this is a no-go for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty darn depressing!","review":"I finished this short easy read quickly. I immediately went on to something a bit more uplifting as I found this book VERY depressing.Yes, each of the 5 people he meets explain their impact on his life or vice versa but the impact was always negative.It seemed to be a book about a guy that hated his life (except for his wife), hated his job but never did anything about it. Something really awful happens on each of his birthdays (his father's death, his wife's car accident, etc.)Then when he gets to heaven he finds out from his 5 people that he caused a man's heart attack, was responsible for a 5 year old burning to death, etc.I don't care for this much negativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, stereotypical and boring.","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews here. I was shocked by what turned out to be a really bad read. One dimensional with uninspired and stereotypical themes. I actually was wondering whether the author was a high school student who had a family member in the publishing industry. (I've actually gotten more insight on life from a single paragraph poem... even a single page greeting card.)The main idea of the book is that a simple man dies, goes to heaven and meets the five life-altering people who help explain to him his horrible, crippled existence with an abusive father and help it \\"make sense\\" and relieve his suffering.Well if I were Eddie (the main character) and my life was as long and sufferable as his and the \\"insights\\" given to me by the five \\"guides in heaven\\" were what was offered in this book, I'd ask for the management and demand a refund.I give the same advice for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must miss","review":"I found Albom\\"s writing graceless and tiresome. His short, declarative sentences make for very choppy reading. The repetition gives the narrative a sing-song feeling. In reading it, I suffered through 12 of Eddie's birthdays and seven countdowns to his death. The author's so-called profound statements (i.e. ...\\"because sons will adore their fathers through even the worst behavior\\".) are false and annoying to read.I find nothing to commend in this book. If I hadn't had to read it for a book club, I never would have bought it, much less finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me cry","review":"I found out about this book from the New York times book reccomendations. I knew absolutely nothing about the author or the book before reading it. I started to read the book in the store to debate on buying it. I read until page 36 and decided it would come home with me. I brought it home and couldn't put it down, I finished it in one night.It is a well written story about a man named Eddie and his life, before and after death. It deals with his time in war, in family situations and with Love. Eddie deals with being mundane his whole life, always wanting more for himself and feeling trapped. When he gets to heaven, he five people he encounters help him work out his frustrations with life and put it in very simple terms that anyone can understand.I found this book to be captivating and almost having a pulse of its own, it was more than a book it was a reading companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Five People You Meet In Heaven","review":"This was an amazing book. It told the story of heaven and how people see it. In the author's point of view heaven is a great place where people find out their point on this earth. You find out people that you have hurt and even killed. It gives you a reason to look forward to life and it tells you that if you mess up there might be a reason for that mistake and that it is not all that bad.Eddie is the main character, he is a kind, loving, and caring person. He loves kids and really cares about the people that he works with. He works at Ruby Pier as the head of maintenance. His wife Ruby is a older woman that the pier is names after. She shows Eddie around heaven.Eddie dies helping people out at the pier he would never give up helping people he would eventually give his life by doing what he loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book","review":"I could not put this book down. I had waited patiently to read it, but when I finally received it, it took me about two hours to read it.Eddie is a somewhat bitter, tired man, who at the start of the book, doesn't realize he just has an hour left to live. The book takes you through the details of the last hour of his life, and then introduces you a new idea of Heaven. In the Heaven that Eddie goes to, he meets 5 people who either touched his life or he touched theirs. The characters are delightful, down to earth, and very believable.This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sip. Don't gulp","review":"Not many pages. Easy reading font Double spaced. One could read this book waiting for a bus. Gulp it down. BUT DON\\"T! This is what us Southern folk call a \\"sippin' book\\". You'll read a few pages, put the book down, ponder... Its like slowly eating Swiss creme--filled chocolate by a mountain stream compared to chowing on a Hershey in the car.I won't spoil the plot. Its a very simple plot but has a few twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"A well written little story about heaven. Not your standard heaven. The five people help Eddie understand his life and its interconnectedness. If you like Mitch Albom's other books you'll like this one. Its only short so its worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 people you meet in heaven","review":"In the beginning it was a little hard to follow and get my attention, but once the history behind the characters evolved, it became much, much more exciting. My teacher had read a little chapter or two at the start of class and most of the students couldn't wait til the next day. I would watch the movie after it, because it helps you understand more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving story","review":"This is a very moving story. Readers from every walk of life should enjoy. Life is fleeting, but we touch more of our surroundings than we realize."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Must Read!","review":"I just bought this book yesterday and if I didn't have a young child I would have kept reading it until I couldn't read no more. It is so hard to put down. What a way of looking at what comes after death. Remarkable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A brilliant idea ruined by an inept author","review":"The idea this book based upon is truly brilliant, but sadly, this book is a waste of time and money. The writing is dry and uninspired. It feels as though children's book author decided to venture into adult themes. If you have read any of the books about POW camps (Nick Rowe's \\"Five Years to Freedom\\" is outstanding), you will be put off by the preposterous fantasy Mr. Albom concocted for this book.I truly wish I could say I enjoyed this book, because the central idea is so intriguing. Unfortunately, this book fails to deliver and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is creative, but way too cheesy to be engaging","review":"I had high expectations for this book, given that Tuesdays with Morrie was as moving as it was. The author tries sell another book to the same audience, but ends up presenting a soap-opera/cartoon of a novel as a way to engage the same subject. There is clearly a need in this day and age for writing on the meaning of life, but this was not well done at all, and it was not worth plowing through the melodrama (as someone mentioned above) to get to the several, sentence-long, semi-compelling aphorisms. I actually couldnt finish reading the book it because it was so annoyingly overdone. It seemed way too artificial to present anything real on the meaning of life. Youre better off picking up a film by woody allen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no!","review":"I flipped to the back of the book and was disturbed to find the five people that I'm going to meet in heaven:Shari LewisJoseph Stalin's brother-in-lawDick SargentDick YorkMr. Hooper from Sesame StreetNo offense, but I guess I'm a bit underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I found this book unreadable. It never overcomes it's preachy, silly tone and premise. Wait for it to come to your local library, and then avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste Of Time","review":"Tuesday's with Morrie I loved, but this book really should not have been published because it was a waste of time. As a reader, I regret the time I wasted. There is nothing here that is inspirational. The story is silly, but the horrible writing was the real turn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly shallow, banal, and silly","review":"I bought this book with a great deal of anticipation. From the first page, I started to get a bad feeling about it. It is a book meant to capitalize on \\"Morrie\\" but it's so boring and shallow. I can't imagine how anybody would like it. It kind of turned my stomach, really, as I read on. I just had this sense of Mr. Albom thinking \\"I can really fool them if I write this.\\" Sad, very sad. Don't waste your money. I read a lot of books. This one went in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Book","review":"While I am a fan of Mitch Albom, this book lacked originality and excitement. Albom simply relates the story of a man who meets five people in heaven that directly and indirectly affected the course of his life while on earth.There is suppossed to be a \\"lesson\\" each of the five people are teaching, but the lessons are preachy and forced. It appeared Albom came up with the lessons first, then forced an unbelieveable story around each one.The point of view in the book shifts around as if it is on a pogo stick. This is very distracting.The book is predictable. One can figure out who the five people are after a few pages of the book, so the element of surprise is missing.Much of the dialogue is trite and stiff. Real people do not converse like the characters in the book.Finally, the book is overpriced. Even if it was good, it is still pricy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as earthshaking as some make it sound..but good","review":"This is a very good book but is far from the tear-jerking, soul-wrenching, eye-opening book that others say it is. If you have a modicum of self-awareness this book shouldn't hold anything that will cause you to re-evaluate your life. With that said, this is a well written if simple book by the same author of Tuesdays With Morrie. The flow of the story is well paced and keeps you interested. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others who are looking for a quick insightful read. However, don't look for psychotherapy between the covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have read in a long time!","review":"I couldn't put this book down until I was finished. I loved it.I think it was much better than \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\".It really makes you realize how we all are connected. I passed it on to a friend and they loved it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait to die!","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!What a wonderful intepretation of life after death - I can't wait to meet the 5 people who have, or still are shaping my life.A super quick read, I read this one in 2 hours flat. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a brilliantly crafted novel which takes the reader on a journey through the highs and lows of one man's life - and the interconnecting links between 'strangers'. Teaching us that \\"...there are no strangers, only people we have yet to meet\\".A tear jerker towards the end, this novel is so well written I am excited to read more from this author. Definitely add this to your 'to read' list, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Eddie Found When He Met the 5 People in Heaven","review":"As I read Mitch Albom's books, I have come to notice that he seems eager to describe the difference between life in reality and in heaven. And The Five People You Meet in Heaven is no exception; Mitch seemed to show both Eddie's birthdays he had spent and his life after death caused by the accident in his amusement park. At first, Eddie was confused to see the 5 people in heaven, wondering why he was there. Then they let him know what he didn't realize before he died. The 5 people seemed to yearn for happier times than when they had lived. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure how this story ended right now, but I believe Eddie would feel happier eventually in heaven than before his death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\"","review":"I enjoyed this read so very much. I recommend this book to everyone. There are many messages to be taken away from reading about Eddie's life. Things are seldom the way they appear and this rings true thru this entire story page by page. I finished it in 2 sittings. Didn't want to put it down. And...I didn't cry my heart out like I did with \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting perspective","review":"An interesting take on what awaits us after death makes its claim. Great book about how the simple things are what really makes a life important. Shows the life of a simple man and how he positively (unbeknown to him) impacted the lives and people around him. The ending is the best part, ultimate forgiveness heals all wounds. Great book for anyone who has a little hope or needs a little hope that this life and what comes after are more than what we think."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never forget this book.....","review":"I first read this book a couple of years ago but started reading it again last Fall to a friend with terminal cancer. Because of the geographical distance between us, I began reading the book to him over the telephone. Although sometimes we could only get through one or two chapters a week, he would often call me and ask me to read to him. The book was a much better source of reassurance to him than I could ever have been that his life had far more meaning and purpose than he realized. The reinforcement that everything happens for a reason, that there is no such thing as coincidence, that we are all a part of each others' lives, and that love is eternal, was all a great comfort to him. I finished reading the book to him at his bedside less than 48 hours before he died. Although he could not respond verbally, I know he heard the message and was comforted, as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Storytelling!","review":"In reading Mitch Albom's \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" I found myself engaged, empassioned, and fixated on the characters emotions in much the same way I had been when reading his Freshman effort, \\"Tuesday's with Morrie.\\" Albom writes with a unique style that offers the reader intensely personal links and insights not often found in modern fiction. \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is an inspiring read, and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"~NICE GIFT BOOK~","review":"Touching story of Eddie whose life has been centered around an amusement park. While trying to save a little girl from harm, Eddie dies and goes to heaven where he meets five important people who he knew or didn't know in his life but who were an important part.Nice book for a quiet afternoon ~ gives inspiration that a person's life is important, no matter how mundane it is. There were several endearing passages throughout the book which make the reader sit up and ponder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype!","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It got such rave reviews, I thought itwas going to blow my mind. To me, it was just \\"ok.\\" I would not recommend it to a friend, and I wouldn't read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a sweet book, filled with innocence and realisation.","review":"I loved this book for the story it told and one that I guess we all need to be reminded of,that everyone is linked in one way or another, even those you may never have known or met. Everyone has their part to play, even if it's just a cameo role - all is valid.The book is written in a straightforward, free-flowing style. There are no pretentions to literary grandeur or fancy writing styles. It doesn't need them. The sweetness (that some label as saccharine) is quite touching and poignant. In a word - special.I have no doubt that this lovely little work will touch many in a positive and warm way. A book that you have a real affection for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Warm and Wonderful Read","review":"So you will not walk away from this book with the true meaning of life. Did you really expect to? It is a work of fiction, written in a simple but pleasant style, with wonderful warmth and heartfelt moments. You can finish this book in an afternoon very easily. A small price to pay for the enjoyment it provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating and Enlightening Tale","review":"Mitch Albom's novel is one of the greatest novels I have ever read - for the simple reason that it was not AT ALL what I expected. From reading reviews, summaries, and the title, I expected a spiritual, perhaps preachy, but still interesting book. What I got instead was one of the best symbolic and literal combination tale on the meaning of life.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is full of exciting surprises on each page. It combines the page-turning thrill of an action novel with the simplicty and beauty of a poem. You may not agree with Albom's viewpoints, and maybe you'll even think he is being preachy. But it is well worth the risk.Albom presents five main lessons (and there are many more in there) that every human I have ever met could certainly stand to learn. Had I known what I would get out of this novel, I would have paid three times the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, thoughtful book","review":"I found this book to be a quick, lovely read about the meaning of life and what each person's heaven might be. It goes far beyond the theme of \\"a one-size-fits-all\\" type of heaven as we all expect (or hope!) to experience. It rallies around the theme that we are all interconnected and that we influence the lives of people around us more than we realize.I read this book in a day and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not one that I call a \\"keeper\\", (ie., a book that stays part of my permanent library) but it is one that I'm giving as a gift to many of my friends and family because it has a message that is just too special not to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This book was a big disappointment and cannot even hold a flame to Tuesday's with Morrie.

The fact that they're bound like oversized greeting cards, I think, is symbolic of the excessive sentimentality in his stories. This book, his first novel, is no exception.The reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because the premise is experimental and interesting. But, Albom's sugary prose and (ugh!) dialogue nearly sent my pancreas into shock. The way the book starts, with a potentially gripping rescue of a little girl, could have sounded more fresh than it did. And the dialogue between Eddie and his wife was very over-the-top.Bottom line, if you liked \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", then you might like this book. But I didn't, so I don't. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our job is to help others on Earth and in Heaven.","review":"A dead man's search for how his life made a difference. This book can be very inspiring and forces us to think about what is to come. Like all good parables, this book teaches a lesson in an interesting and captivating way, but after I put it down I don't have much of an urge to learn more. I have been told the point and that is all you get. Further thought is not necessary. I am not trying to discourage this book or that of Tuesday's With Morrie. They are both great reads and important lessons that make wonderful gifts for families and friends, but don't expect to get that feeling that you should reread this book to get further insight.

I keep waiting for this to get better, but it isn't. I have 100 pages to go, but am not impressed - it is just so Bridges and Cheese. I am glad I didn't buy it. There is such a plethora of good and sustaining literature out there, I just don't understand how books like this get on the best seller list other than it is short and I guess the majority of people don't get introspective about their lives so therefore need books like this and the Cheese book to show them what is right in front of their faces. It bothers me when I have wasted my valuable reading time on a book like this.One point for the dedication. The best part of the book is the dedication to his uncle. My suggestion is to pick up the book in the store, and read the dedication standing there, and look at the picture in the back, but don't buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick simple read could even be adapted for kids","review":"This book is creative and simple.

As a follow up to \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", this was a big let down. The idea of 5 people in heaven waiting for each of us is somewhat interesting, but disapppointing in the telling.

I had read Albom's other book, Tuesdays, and was caught. Reading this book makes you realize that there is hope for the hereafter and that we can be a light in people's lives without even knowing it. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, bittersweet story","review":"I highly recommend \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" to anyone interested in imaginative, emotional, and inspirational stories. Although some parts of the book border on the melodramatic, Mitch Albom is generally successful at creating a memorable story about an ordinary man who, despite his \\"common\\" life, leaves an indelible mark on the world he was a part of and the many lives he unknowingly touched. A truly lovely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh....","review":"I thought the first couple of chapters were good in developing a story about an interesting character, but halfway through the book, it got a little cheesy and formulaic. At this point it seemed like every person Eddie met in heaven was someone he wound up accidentally killing and that this was some way to acknowledge it and get rid of his guilt.I liked Albom's books about Morrie much better. I think he writes well with a lot of meaning when the story is about someone or something in real life rather than something he made up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think...","review":"Today is Eddie's birthday... This line has caused me to reflect on several of my birthdays and to realize that with each passing year they become less and less of an event.Eddie is a maintenance man at an amusement park who thought his life had no meaning and that he made no impact on anybody. Five people appear to Eddie immediately after his death and prove him wrong.After reading this book, I began to wonder what five people I would meet in Heaven (or wherever I end up). Perhaps a co-worker I don't really care for, perhaps a best friend from years past, or the person I accidentally cut off in traffic this morning.This book has caused me to re-examine my daily interactions with people and to wonder how those interations have impacted both of us. Have I made a difference in anybody's life without even knowing it? Do the people who made a difference in my life know they did?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tender and inspiring story....","review":"This is an amazing story. I came across it by chance while browsing the books on Amazon, and got hooked when I read some of the sample pages. I am very happy I bought this book. It's quick reading, I read it in about three hours. But for such a short book, it's very meaningful. The author illustrates the important lessons of life in a very subtle way. You don't realize the beauty of what he is writing about until the very end, when it all comes together to show that every life has a meaning, even though we don't always understand that meaning. I recommend this book very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, thinking that it would be profound and full of wisdom. What I found was a short book with five extremely vague lessons that were forgotten by the next page. The concept of the story was an excellent one but it was simplistic and did not adequately cover the life lessons. On finishing the book I was left feeling disappointed at the sheer lack of depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me too...","review":"I have to agree with almost everything in the last review - if this is heaven, I'll stay here. I was very disappointed with this book. I didn't finish it feeling uplifted but rather blah. The only reason I can think of for the books' popularity is the success of the authors' first book. Go rent the movie \\"Always\\" instead - that will get you crying and soaring at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Idea Of Heaven","review":"If I based my rating only on this being an interesting and well-written story, I would give it a five. However, the scenerio presented in this book contradicts my concept of heaven in that I believe there will be no anger, fear or pain in heaven. The main character, Eddie seemed to experience all of these. The author does present some compelling thoughts. It may well be that we will at some point understand the influence our life has had on others as well as the impact of another life on our own. At any rate I agree that this easy-to-read book could provide an inspiration to anyone who reads it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a warning for Christians...","review":"For Christians hoping that Mitch Albom's version of heaven will at least slightly resemble the heaven that the Bible tells us to hope for, don't get your hopes up. This book is a clever idea of what heaven would be if it were entirely \\"self-focused\\". AKA, don't worry, God won't get in our way of fun once we're up there. It's all about us. After much enjoying, Tuesdays with Morrie, I was very dissapointed. But, I am a biased Christian who looks foward to the heaven described in the Bible, not in a novella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow melodrama","review":"I found almost nothing about this book convincing: the characters were largely stereotypical and the author's lessons seemed calculated to appeal to a mass audience, rather than based on any honest, life-earned wisdom. Phrases like, \\"Every life has one true-love snapshot\\" may strike us as sweet, but they are neither wise nor true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Albom should stick to sports writing","review":"After the disappointing read of \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" [which I found self centered, the book had very little to do with Morrie, but everything about the author], I was willing to give him a second chance, when I heard about \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". After all, what a wonderful topic! Unfortunately Mr. Albomtook this great idea and turned it into a disaster. Instead of a positive experience, it was filled with negativity and darkness. I'm sorry folks, but Mr. Albom should stick to his sports writing.Obviously his spiritual side needs nurturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really, really, wanted to like this book, but...","review":"As much as I loved Tuesdays With Morrie, I can not bring myself to love this story. I think Mitch Albom had the right idea. I think the message is noble and true. But instead of being uplifting and intelligent the whole book seemed naive and awkward. Not much rang true in the plotting and the material just was not up to standard. i think the plot made for a very good short story. Something that people can enjoy and appreciate, but the novella form is way too long for what Albom had in mind.I felt like this was a pretty shallow exploration of mortality, ethics, spiritual maturity and the basic lessons of life. Maybe I was expecting way too much, but it seems to me that Mitch missed Morrie more than he knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The book was just ok. I was longing for a \\"hard to put down\\" book, but this certainly was not it. I kept going through it thinking that the next chapter or the next person he meets will be better, maybe have a good lesson to teach, say something that will really make you think. But it never really happened. The parts that were the best were when he spoke of his wife and the true love that they had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of heaven","review":"I had hoped this book would tell of how ordinary people make a difference to others in positive ways that they may never know about until they die. So I was surprised to see that the majority of the book is NOT positive - it seems like Eddie has had just as much (or more) negative influence as positive on the majority of the five people he meets. I also found it odd that he could experience so much physical discomfort in heaven. While I agree with the idea of a life review once you reach the Other Side, I sure hope it is nothing like this ! Eddie is a sympathetic character, and the author is a good writer, but overall, this book did not inspire me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Five People Pou Meet In Heaven","review":"This is an amazing book. It is easy to read and it makes you think about your own life. Mitch Alom is a very creative writer and he takes you to the very place and time that he is writing about.

It makes me think about if I was in Eddie's shoes who I would run into if I went to heaven.

It had all the subtlety and nuance of an afterschool special.I mean, what a great premise: a grizzled, injured war vet with a guilty conscience and a dead-end life gets a chance to re-examine his earthly existance with the aid of five heavenly guides. Wow. Unfortunately I thought the book simply failed to deliver a good story.I found it way too sweet and pat and I really could not feel like I got to know the main character at all. Every situation was cliche, and every ending was just so pat. I kept waiting for the grand insight that would make it all worthwhile, but it never came.Instead, made-for-TV quality expositions on heaven and the meaning of life. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\"","review":"\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was a wonderful book. Even the TV version was enjoyable (Jack Lemmon - how could you go wrong)! This book is different; this fable is not believable and draws some strange conclusions (especially in regards to the father) to come to the predictable ending. For me, this book was a major disappointment. The reviews on Amazon are not indicative of how I believe most will feel upon completion of this book.My sister, who anxiously wanted to read this book after some talk show endorsement, was sadly disappointed as well. She has not read \\"Tuesdays\\" and is not eager to do so after reading this book. That is too bad.I suggest going to the store and trying to read a few chapters before buying it. I kept saying that is has to get better than this. Unfortunately it did not. My suggestion is to read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" instead and pretend that this book does not exist. The idea of the book was a good one, but the execution of this idea is another story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victor","review":"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that I enjoyed reading very very much.

Eddie saves a girl from being crushed but in the process he dies. He is met in heaven one by one by five people who tell how eddie affected or was effected in their life. The book overflows with emotional chapters and twists that perplex the reader to read forward and explains many things that happen earlier on in the book.

You may not know who you touch for a very long time, as Eddie finds out in this story.No, it is not the greatest book I have ever read, however, it is a nice escape from this real world full of such terrible things.

He had quite an act to follow and was not successful at it. I got the impression that he was trying to write \\"It's a wonderful Life\\" with different characters. I cannot believe people are saying that it was a tear jerker. I thought the ending was very hokey and I left with the feeling that his life was the way he pictured it, worthless. I kept thinking there would be some great revelation. There was none. The whole book was a disappointment. The best thing about it was it was over quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really not the best...","review":"I was excited to read this book b/c it's been given so much praise, but I was so disappointed. It's a semi-sweet book which, from start to finish, was superficial. Superficial is fine if a book is entertaining as it goes on, but this was just sort of a dull story in my opinion.

Mitch has brought a great deal of joy to many peoples lives over the age of 70. From his radio show, columns in the Detroit Free Press, to Tuesday's with Morrie Mitch one word can sum up Mitch...Arrogance. Whether it is the controversy involving his dealings with the University of Michigan's basketball team, or a stern lecture about what is right on his horrible radio show, Mitch knows it all. Just ask him he will tell it like it is. This book is no exception. Mitch's style of writing is similar to something you would expect from a first time author. Very basic and lacking in creativity. Do yourself a favor avoid Mitch at all costs. Those that come contact with his radio show, columns or books usually become incensed with rage. That is unless you are a putz like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious, shallow, cheesy","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. It is too obvious, doesn't add any real lesson.

Just maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Reasons Not to Read This Book","review":"The title of Mitch Albom's new book sounds interesting enough and could be developed into a great story; but I couldn't find it here. The author skirmishes into the lives and histories of five people whom 'Maintenance Man Eddie' may or may not have known; but doesn't do anything to improve the main character'sunderstanding of his pitiful and worthless life.

Unfortunately, I found the movie to be far better than the book, which is something I normally never ever say. But, the way Mitch Albom writes really bothered me.

It was too boring to proceed to the end.Since the book is so short it should be read quickly, unfortunately it so boring that you have to labor on each page just to get to the end.Bad, Bad, BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes Part II...","review":"I thought \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was sanctimonious drivel but this preachy, sappy, appallingly badly-written rubbish beggars belief. How on earth do writers like Albom get their worthless stuff published when so many better writers struggle for years?

Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Albom does it again","review":"No wonder Albom didn't want his own newspaper to run the review of this book.

It really made me consider death differently; that she was okay...in a better place. Later, I offered it to a friend who'd also lost a parent, and she felt the same way. It really helped her through the entire ordeal.I can't thank Albom enough for that. I've been a fan of his since his early sports writing days. I've read all his books thus far. Considering what I'd just said, you can only imagine how much I enjoyed: For One More Day. My mom died of a massive heart attack, so I never got a chance to say good-bye, let alone make amends.

(I actually saw the Made for TV version first and then read the book.) Albom has a way of telling a story very well in relatively few words. Perhaps this comes from his years of writing sports articles for the printed news media.The story of Eddie's life and the people whose lives he touched, and who profoundly touched his, was interesting enough, but it is the end of the story that makes this story great. It is not until then that the genius of this work becomes evident. It is then that the reader reflects on all that came before and gains a true appreciation of the story Albom tells.

But to have each person explain to you why specific events took place in your life, things that the charater had been bitter over. The talks with each person opens his eyes and he is a better man due to his confrontations. It really makes one wonder if that is the way it is in heaven and wouldn't be amazing if it were. To have someone explain events that you never understood yet that took place in your life. Highly recommend. One of the best books I have read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quaint vision","review":"Mitch Albom has created a uniquely quaint and compelling story in the Five People You Meet in Heaven. The story is light and touching at the same time. Never did I feel bogged down in the story, nor did Albom ever become to heavy handed in telling us how we were supposed to feel.Although the story included sections almost cliche, and some transitions were seemingly a little rough, I found the read to be refreshing and uplifting. I was impressed that Albom never pushed us to come to any sort of conclusion, nor became overtly preachy. He just showed us an honest man, Eddie and his honest emotions as he enters heaven and begins meeting people who have touched his life in someway, sometimes in ways that he never knew about until he met them for the first time there in heaven.For a good light read, I recommend The Five People You Meet in Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant modern day classic","review":"Mitch Albom writes what I feel to be one of the best works of fiction I have read in quite some time. The book follows Eddie in his journey through the afterlife after a sudden tragic accident. He encounters five people that made an impact on his life and each one offers a lesson. I painted quite a picture in my head with this book and was even moved to tears at a few parts. The thing I really liked though was that it wasn't just a sappy story about life and love but offered lots of philosophy on life and what lies beyond. It really is an amazing book that left me thinking long after I put it down which was one thing I did not do from page 1 to 196. I recomend this book because I believe everyone can take something positive from this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and thoughtful book","review":"I picked up this book at the library this week because I recongized the author and it looked like a short read. This was such a wonderful little book. It was very insightful and emotional.

I cannot deny that I liked and enjoyed reading this book, but I also admit that it was very much similar with the \\"Tuesday with Morie\\" (Mannerism?). But it was unique that the author unfolds the story back from the present to the past.

We are destined to do certain things, meet certain people, and experience certain challenges, from the day we are born. This book is a classical example of this notion at its best.Mitch Albom has a gift - the gift of putting in writing, the most basic, yet most crucial, lessons of life which each of us will experience to one degree or another.

However, I found the book hard to follow, not well written, and did not provide and form of a reality check for me.

I thought this was one of the most touching stories I've ever read. The idea is that when you die your life is explained to you by 5 people, some you know and some you may have never met. Albom's novel shows us that we are all connected and everything we do has an impact..maybe not on our own lives but those of others. Many parts of this book were sad and depressing, especially when you read about the main characters guilt over things that happened in Vietnam and the loss of his wife. But as the 5 people in heaven reveal their stories the main character finds the answeres to all the big \\"whys\\" in his life. It was like having resolution to everything you didnt understand that happened in your life.

All other members of the club considered it a waste of their time also. None of the 5 people gave any reason for the subject's existence as was the premise of the book. There was nothing in the book that made me feel better informed of anything at all. I like to be able to finish a book and feel I have been at least a little enlightened about something but there was nothing here.

I've had many thoughts on what heaven can be, but never crossed the thought that I would have to reach heaven to fill myself with more regrets and guilts than those I left this life with. I have the conviction that we must try to become the best out of ourselves in this life, that we truly should be committed to this; but to reach heaven to meet people I never met in this life and be filled with remorse and guilt exceeds all my expectations.Having read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", which is definitely an inspiration of love and a 'must read' to everyone, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a most discouraging one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a terrible read","review":"I read \\"Tuesdays\\" and loved it, as many reviewers here.

I get what the author wanted to write about.HOWEVER, the writing style just plain annoyed me. I didn't think it was necessary to repeat the same style over and over for five times with Eddie's birthday and the lesson chapters. These could have been all put together to make it a smoother reading.I watched the movie and the movie was EXCELLENT. There was none of the extra annoying repetitious of Eddie's Birthday chapters nor separate lesson chapters. It flowed really nicely (even though, it's pretty long).I would suggest that you watch the movie since it covers the entire book in a much smoother way. Also, for some reasons, reading the book was more depressing.

If I read a book that bores me after the first few chapters, I put it aside, maybe to try again sometime. If not, I give it away. Every book doesn't have to be life-changing, but if it can make me think, laugh, cry, inform me or fill an otherwise boring evening, it's done it's job for me. This book does that.

The reviews that this book is preachy are accurate as well. Think Celestine Prophecy. I thought that this would be a nice light interesting read with some substance.

False, there is no substance to this book and your time is worth more than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching & Inspiring","review":"I seldom read novels except Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code due to the phenomenal hype, but the title of this book had been interesting me for a while and kept me thinking who are those five people we are going to meet in heaven. So I decided to find out. The book is relatively short under 200 pages. It begins the story with the last day of an old man named Eddie, who will meet five people after his death in heaven to learn different lessons on the meaning of life. The beginning is a bit slow. It takes around thirty pages to set up Eddie's death. Honestly, as a reader, I couldn't wait to see the first person Eddie met in heaven and why. Despite that, the story goes very smooth and quite touching. Indeed, the author's perspective on fairness, sacrifice, memory, and love, inspires me a lot to re-think the meanings and values of life. I'm wondering who are the five people waiting for me when my time comes.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 20-Feb-2005)"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"i loved this book! it was a quick, easy read, offering a perception of heaven i have never imagined.by the end of the book, i was crying as the loose ends in the life of the main character tied together to create a beuatiful tapestry.this book is sweet and heart-felt, and offers peace and reassurance to anyone who has ever doubted their importance or self-worth.as far as the individuals who left negative reviews: yes, albom created a heaven where people are told they may have been responsible for the death of others, but it is a minute detail in the meaning of the bigger picture. by focusing on this point, your missing the moral of the novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving experience","review":"This short, simple book was one of the most moving pieces I have ever read.

I enjoyed it enough that I went through it really quickly, but I came out of it kind of unsatisfied, like having a meal without the main course- something was just missing. I went looking for the whatever it was, and found absolutely nothing when I reread the book.Albom has some good descriptive language, and an original plot if you don't think about the cliched \\"This is your life\\"-type ideas. (Yes, that was sarcasm.) I really liked the book, and I think you will too, if you are considering buying it, but don't look to be totally fufilled at the end of this book. You'll find a small corner empty where there should be something.Overall, this book got four stars from me on merit of language alone. While Albom does have a tendency to lapse into cliches, I enjoyed the descriptions greatly.The verdict: buy this book, and read it when you've got time to contemplate things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm not spiritual","review":"This book is a nice little book, I guess .

I expected that it would have some sort of a \\"happy\\" ending (quotes are because he did die, after all). Yep.Well - I guess there was one unexpected aspect of it.

BUT, I truly disliked this book!! I felt the 'point' was so poorly executed. The stories that unfolded were so sad and unnecessarily tragic that I was distanced and disturbed instead of connected and heart-warmed. The hero's life might have not been a waste, technically, but if he was too unhappy to realize the beauty in it, then the story is a tragedy in my opinion.

Its a feel good book and the character does not go through everything to be good enough for heaven, he goes through everything so he can see the truth in every major event in his life and seek closure from it, so he can realize that sometimes not knowing the whole truth of an event can make us feel anger, hurt, loss, and hate because it is what made sense at the time and he learned and grew as a person knowing the full account of each event.

I walked away from this book knowing that are lives are intertwined with other people, like the Blue Man and Ruby, who are far outside our immediate circles. This book made me appreciate everything I have in my life.There are some unforgettable quotes in here:[p 78]: \\"'Strangers,' the Blue Man said, 'are just family you have yet to come to know.'\\"[p 167]: \\"All parents damage their children.

The jist of the book is that heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by five pivotal people in your life. The author flashes back and forth between the past, present, and hereafter too quickly for the story to be imbued with any meaningfulness--it was pretty banal from beginning to end. Halfway through I just wanted to put the book down and not take it up again, but I forced myself to finish only b/c it is a short book.

The premise of the story doesn't work from the beginning--an 83 year old man with a bum leg doesn't work at an amusement part checking the rides! The structure of the book is a formula throughout--man dies, goes to heaven, sees different colors, and a new person appears with lame advice and a really lame piece of philosophy. To say I was disappointed is an understatement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. It's so poorly written, I couldn't help wondering what the publisher was thinking. Made to appear as another \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", Albom sinks into a 5th grade writting style with a Christmas Carol theme. It's preachy, phony, sappy and tries to appeal to the emotions of the Oprah crowd. A dreadful money grab and not even worth the deep discounts offered here. Avoid this book as it piles up on the floors of your local Kmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking novel","review":"Eddie is a 82-year old man with a limp from an old knee injury that he got during the war. He works as the Chief Maintenance at Ruby Pier, when one day he dies in a tragic accident. He is transported to afterlife, where he meets with five people that determined the course of his life, even though he sees some of them only for the first time. Slowly but surely he starts to understand why his life went the way it went as he forgives and is forgiven the acts that caused him pain and that made other people suffer.The idea that heaven consists of five people explaining your life, but also that things go the way they go because lifes are interconnected, even when it is not blatantly obvious, is thought provoking, even though some people may consider it to be somewhat new age. The book is well-written, a wonderful read for a long Satuday evening by the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"this idea was new in the 80's","review":"the good news is, it's an easy read. if you've done little or no spiritual work, this book will be a revelation and uplifting. if you're a bit beyond that, it's trite and not that interesting, sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"As much as I wanted to like this book, I couldn't bring myself to.

They're much more worth the money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"Hallmark greeting card sentiments litter this book, posing as philosophical profundities. Why would anyone want to believe that heaven exists as some kind of therapeutic analysis meant to explain your earthly existence. What is the point? You're dead already!

I sure hope I don't end up there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped too much - disappointing","review":"I was hoping this book was as good as \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", guess I bought into the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh.","review":"Huh. Interesting but... not all there. I must say I was intriuged by this book's plot. It could have gone a long way, but Albom did not take it to its full potential. Its rather tired morals and clichéd dialogue put a weight on the otherwise airy pace, scenes of near-rape and death bed repentance seem out of place in the book's almost whimsical narration. Airplane reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for light reading","review":"I was given this book as a gift and felt obliged to read it. I believe if I am honest in my review I would have to say that the best thing about the book is the fact that it is a very quick read. If you are looking for deep reading, this is not it.I have read the author's other book, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found it to be a fairly good book, but 'Five People' does not measure up to the bar set by the author's other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five People Who Bore You In Heaven","review":"Reading the NY Bestsellers List can sometimes lead you to books that sound interesting but turn out to be a complete waste of time. The idea was an interesting one; you die, you meet five people who teach you wonderful insights on your life that you overlooked while you were on earth. However, that would work much better had the main character led a corrupt life in the corporate world or had actually overlooked something in his life (which would have been cliche but much more believable). This was not the case in this book. Eddie seemed to be a man who had some ghosts in his past but overall was a very loved man and a led a very quiet life. This made the lessons he learned almost seem redundant. To top it off, the writing was very poor. It wasn't much of a page turner and at many points, it was very predictable and bland. If you really want to learn some life lessons that enlighten you, pick up his other book, \\"Tuesdays With Morrie.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"i got this book as a gift, and i couldnt put it down! i still read this today, and i buy it as gifts!! i buy all of mitch albom's novels, theyre great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most extraordinary book I've read in a year or two","review":"An excellent novel that makes you think of the repercussions of the actions, even the most miniscule, that you take every day.

With its appetizer-sized chapters, I thought this would be a great \\"tween\\" book as I ventured from one long novel to the next. What a disappointment. This book was not only depressing, which I gathered from the reviews I had read prior to purchase, but it lacked any sort of resolution or true connectivity. The story was jumbled, and the veiled attempt to tie it all in failed miserably. Moreover, much of the supposed resolution our protagonist finds is hardly believable. Tuesdays With Morrie is one of the best books I've read, but, after this, I doubt I'll ever spend a penny on any of Mitch Albom's books again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"In a world were we are often in a rush, and worry more about ourselves, than what we may be doing for others, and how our lives our linked to everyone around us.

It teaches each of us a valuable lesson that we never know who's live we may alter each day."},{"rating":"1","title":"At times moving, but ...","review":"The first person he met is questionable. Didn't really see the point. The last person he met ... the author was definitely trying to make it come together, but IT TOTATALLY DOES NOT WORK; IT WAS FORCED, AND SO 'FAKE'. If Eddie (the protagonist) is traveling through 5 different pockets of heaven, where each soul creates what they want to share with Eddie, then why doesn't the Asian girl speak better English? She's old enough to speak well. Why does she have to speak in broken English? She is in heaven now. Anything is possible in heaven, even good communication. Overall, the book is a quick read. I finished it in 2 hours. It does make you think and value your days on earth. Of course, don't think too hard about the book and the author's choices or else you'll start seeing holes; big holes which may put a damper on that sense of feeling good after a sweet paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"I really loved and enjoyed this book.

Don't people read novels for entertainment? If a book holds you enthralled until the end and makes you wish you had the idea first and could have written it; in my mind it deserves the highest rating. I don't think this book could have been better. It made me wonder who I might meet in heaven should heaven be like the author's idea of it. If you are a literature snob don't read it. If you like entertaining and wonderful books you should read it and I know you will be happy you did.I listened to the unabridged audio cassette version of this book.

It was really good. I liked the whole set-up. Eddie has to meet with five people who were connected in his life in order to move on. The five people he meets are all interesting - people who were very important in his life to people he hardly met or only slightly knew. I think that is how we all go through life - having people who mean a lot and also affecting people we don't even know that we did.It all culminates with the last person he meets. I don't want to give the ending away, but the last person he meets actually shows him how important he was even though he never thought he was anyone important.I have read his next book, \\"For One More Day,\\" but it was not as good as this one. I am looking forward to reading his new book, \\"Have a Little Faith,\\" but will have to wait until summer vacation.

This book inspired me in the sense that I really do NOT want to be like that man so let me do the very best I can, if I don't like a job, I will change as soon as possible, opposite of the point the book wants to make. The book makes the point that the man hated his job but stayed anyway blessed a lot of kids or people, but hated his life!

He describes what he thinks the horse and the wagon will look like with the stuff on it. Then he puts more to make it like no other. He did this because his dad said to look and see what you can see but he turns stuff into something amazing like turning minnows into whales. The illustrator carefully chose when to add color and when to not.

This is definitely NOT the case. It is more like 2lbs per foot dense. A queen size 4\\" topper is 80\\" x 60\\" x 4\\", thus it is 19,200 Cubic inches. To convert that into feet, divide that figure by 1,728 (12x12x12) = 11.11111 Cubic feet of foam. SO, at 5.5 lbs per cubic feet, this topper should way over 60 pounds. But, shipped, with box and cover, this weighs in at a scant 24 pounds!For someone looking for a low density memory foam topper, this may be the one. But, for those of us that think the 5.5 used in the advertisement of this topper refers to the density of the foam, they will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ WARRANTY BEFORE BUYING","review":"Wish I had read warranty before buying this memory foam mattress.

The strength of the book is the excellent style and grammar in the writing. I don't rate a book on style and grammar alone. The content basically lacks existential meaning.However the author does stab at how one can get others to submit to being controlled. For example, the controller claiming they have supernatural power like reading the other persons mind, getting the submissive to identify with a type of thinking that says, \\"if that is true then this must be true\\" when the two have little or no correlation, and the age old control technique of \\"give up self\\" to gain super powers.

It was so good that I even showed the book to some friends who also share the same enthusiasm about the series. Since then, I have read all of the Drizzit books (even the ones without him). I've found that only the first 7 (and the Entreri book) are fantastic. The rest much like this one are 50% garbage. I dont like Catterbrie, despite the fact that she has all of the great weapons she stinks. She is extremely annoying and I hope they kill her off. I also find her relationship with Drizzit ludicrous. Wulfgar was only cool when he was a bad ... barbarian instead of a loser with emotional problems, he should have stayed in the abyss. Regis was funny, now he's just annoying. Drizzit should go back to being a loner, its what he good at.

That's how I pictured Drizzt. Spoiler alert: That scene was not in the book - 1 star. I've read just about all Salvatore's dark elf series and I'm a fan, but I found the book wanting. The entire book appeared to be nothing but several short stories about characters I don't really care about, other than Drizzt's core group. At the end it comes together, but it seemed forced. The jumping around to the various other groups was jarring and didn't add anything to the story. I feel that the author missed a golden opportunity to make this a mystery. Why are the orcs rampaging, why are the giants helping them, are the drow involved? I was expecting a lot more from the story and the author. But hey...the cover was cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call it 9/11 in Faerun","review":"It was evident from the start, with all the talk of death in Drizzt's musings between sections that Salvatore was dwelling upon and drawing from the terrorist attacks in the US last year. It became more apparent as the story reached its climax and the decription of mutilated bodies, loss of friends and ultimately the collapse of a wizard tower that 9/11 was exactly what Salvatore was using as his inpiration for this novel.I didn't dislike the book, it though I wonder why all the these characters have such a hard time coming to terms with their own feelings. Drizzt speaks about living in the present yet he is too frightened to even speak his thoughts to the woman he loves. Build a bridge; get over it. Either kill her or let them get married.I believe that Salvatore is trying to breath life into Drizzt the same way the death of Chewbacca reanimated Han Solo. Lets hope it works, though unless a certain mortally wounded character ends up dying, this probably won't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"This book is without a doubt the most refreshing change of pace in the Dark Elf books yet! It's absolutely filled with Salvatore's trademark battle scenes and Dwarven humor, as well as a nice touch of tension. You'll quickly discover the obvious truth to this trilogy: It's going to be full of dark surprises and more action than Drizzt can handle(never that).Buy it, read it, love it! This book is worth every penny... and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Beginning to a New Series","review":"Salvatore has lost it.RAS used to be one of the most enthralling authors in the Fantasy genre. Now he's stale, rehashes old plots, has no substance to his characters, and nobody can die.It's really quite tragic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed it. A little different than some of his other books but in a way that I personally loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again a great one","review":"This book is great. I recommend any and all fantasy lovers to get this book and read it. Everytime he releases another book in this series I buy it, and he has never let me down... This one lives up to the oters with action and rich characters. In the continuing saga Drizzt and the companions get a deep look inside and with breathtaking action scenes this one will never let you down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring garbage","review":"After reading all the previous Drizzt novels his work on the Hunter's Blades Trilogy is almost unbearable to read, in fact I could not bring myself to finish reading the final book in the series, it just seemed like the same old stuff repeated over and over and over and over again. The \\"plot\\" just seemed to get worse and worse..... very disappointed in his work in this series, oh well gives me time to explore other works such as Dragon Age: The Calling, which was surprisingly a pretty good read. No more R.A.S. books for me as his work has seemingly degraded into complete garbage....though I will say I did enjoy his earlier work. A pity that his work on these terrific characters has become awful in my opinion. Agree or disagree, it just my opinion and everyone is free to their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Prose","review":"RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To The Old Days","review":"The latest edition of the Icewind Dale series represents a return to the good old days of the original trilogy. A grand quest for yet another Dwarven stronghold, and hordes of monsters to slay. It's very satisfying to see the whole gang back together again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slice of Salvatore Heaven.","review":"There is so little one can say about this book without ruining it. Just know that Drizzt and the gang are back into the orc bashing bussiness (and for a whole series too!) and this time they aren't coming out with a few bumps and bruises. Drizzt is not immortal, neither is his friends. This books shows how easily that is applied. Wonderful as it is though, I have a beef with it. It is CALLED The Thousand Orcs. But no one actually FIGHTS the thousand orcs. A lot of them, yes, but not a thousand. (and giants don't count). Regardless of the somewhat fudged title, it's still a good book. If you get the chance, check out the advertisements for the book. The one with the numbered outlines of the orcs on the cover picture of the book is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many promising things to come!","review":"This book was a good book standing on its own. The Drizzt saga has had twists and turns, and if you've read them all as I have, you are familiar with some of the \\"filler\\" books such as Spine of the World, where nothing really happens except story filler. This book is not a filler book , but does set things up for the next two or more books. Parts of it are very reminicent of the Battle of Helms Deep from the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and the cover art is misleading, but overall, the book was worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing read!!","review":"Wow! THis is an amazing read and I recomend it highly. Bands of Orcs come out of the Spine, rampage, and invade.

Wulfgar and his friends have a new set of challenges on their journey back to Mithril Hall.New alliances are playing out and the dwarven lands are in danger. The orc forces seem to have organized and its up to Drizzt and Co. to set things right. I must say I was happy to see a couple of my favorite dwarves back in action. Salvatore did a great job with this one. I think the battles and sword play should not be missed. Do yourself a favor and give this one a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"My only issue with these damn books is when will the author get Drizzt and Cattie together other than with the hand holding and hugs. Grr! I read this book in four hours and loved every word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a work of art","review":"From beginning to end this book had me hooked. Now this is the first R.A. Salvatore book ive read that pertains to Drizzt. This is an amazing book. R.A. Salvatore is truly the master of battle. He can paint a vivid picture in your mind. Its a great buy and I encourage any one to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is yet to come...","review":"Salvatore is killing us! This book is a wonderful lead to so many different roads of possibilities. As with any trilogy you have to expect the author to set up the scene and this book does just that. If you have no experience with the characters or story lines do not start with this one. You have to understand the depth of each character to understand the enormity of the situation in their eyes. Drizzt- his worst fear, he's alone. Cattie Brie- her adoptive father out of action, facing the reality of mortality. Bruenor- ?? Anticipate the possibilities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was cleverly written. The adventure and action juts keep coming.

There is a lot of action so I would recommend it to a person that likes action books. This book is fiction and I like how the story is about some dwarfs. The enemy is orcs and ice giants who I like to read about. If you like to read about mythical creatures that kill stuff then I recommend it. I think this is about four stars to me because when I read it I got kind of side tracked and not as interested in it. Nikilwig is a pretty interesting character that is heading to Mithral hall. On the way there they encounter lots of monsters then get into lots of fights which I like to read about. This is my review of The Thousand orcs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to unprepare","review":"What I mean is this. The books on Drizzt and company are starting to pile up, numberically I mean. You would expect that after writing so many books surrounding one set of characters that the quality of the series would decrease and become uninteresting. I was sorrowfully preparing for this. HOWEVER, The Thousand Orcs was like a blast of fresh air in my face. A fantastic story that continues to build even through the end of the book, coupled with even further character development (perhaps the greatest thing about the Drizzt books is that the characters themselves grow, change, and adapt to the chaotic world) does well to ease your craving for an excellent fantasy read, while opening a huge hole in your stomach that can only be filled with a big bite from the next book, The Lone Drow. I can't wait, cuz I'm starving."},{"rating":"2","title":"for pete's sake people...","review":"do you have nothing better to do than sit around and write flame reviews as if your opinion should set the course of Salvatore's idea?GO OUTSIDE. Go. That's that big place, on the other side of the door, where all that noise and sunshine comes from.that is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!! Horrible Book","review":"This book was Salvatore at his worst. Do not buy it. It was really boring until the end and then all Drizzt does is fight a few frost giants. After this Drizzt goes into a berserk rage that lasts for another whole book because he thought that Bruenor died. This attempt to build up tension turns Drizzt into a bloodthirsty instinctive monster for another whole book. All he thinks about is kill orcs, kill orcs, kill orcs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thousand Orcs","review":"You will either love Salvatore's works or you will be luke warm regarding them.

I am trying to read this one slowly so I can move right into the sequel without having to wait too long. Drizzt is back in action and kicking some a$$ the way we've all come to love him. The other characters help keep the story interesting and we see a number of characters from other RA tales come into the mix. I always find it intriguing when different stories tie into each other. For example, the Bouldershoulder brothers play a big part in the Cleric Quintet. Amazing quality and a book that will wet your whistle for a while (if you can put it down:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Grippy Glove","review":"This is a great glove fits perfectly and comfortably with very good grip to the point that i it was ready to give me a callous on a part of my palm, might try to combate it with some baby powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect contact gloves.","review":"Fingers sized perfectly, nice snug fit.

Whether or not it was during the Spanish Civil War or not, I don't recall. What I remember most is his acidulous critique of the blundering All-American dolt who thinks he is the only one who can sort it out...He remembered great Paul Robeson, who will always be remembered( -I take it that many correspondents already take me as black.) Robeson was a great follower in battle, a great propagandist, and therefore a great warrior.Lee railed , in his inimical Gloucestershire, about 'The Big Cowboy' who thought he could lead these tender men to battle. He was kind, to the point of sheer tenderness, about Hemingway as a supporter of the people's great struggle, but he always saw him as impossibly arrogant, (I think), as a forerunner of today's all too cowboyish thickhead, who could I be thinking of?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerhouse","review":"The book is an extraordinary narration of a chapter in the appalling Spanish Civil War. Hemingway bestowed a stern stare to an almost missing chapter of the American history and its involvement in the international brigades. Hemingway collates in a subtle and almost ironic fashion all the emotions of human nature: bravery, love, wrath, fear. The book induces the reader to become a mute witness of this sensational drama illustrated deliciously by the author. Easy to read and quite difficult to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do","review":"Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads. The characters are plain spoken; almost Shakespearean at times; with powerful, philosophical paragraphs sprayed in. His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work; and is not ignored here. Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue; although irritating, he gets away with it.Set in the mid 1930's, and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans, Italians, and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain. He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town. Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl, whom he can never have.Some may object to the ending, but I found it fitting; \\"I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do\\"Wish you wellScott"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Whom The Bells Toll","review":"Good read. The main characters in the book are almost alive. Robert, Maria and Pilar keep the dialog alive but in some cases the details are too extensive.

Hemmingway is a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway Knows what He's Talking About","review":"As a 15-year-old high school student, being reccomended to read one of the longest books for summer reading wasn't all too appealing to me. Now that I have read the book, I'm glad that I chose to read For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is a great book if you want to get the perspective of a foreigner in another country fighting a war. Being very interested in history myself, learning about the Spanish Civil War was quite intriguing. Hemingway was very good in expressing his feelings about the war in the country which he once lived. Although the middle of the book can, at times, be quite a drag, the rest of the book was very enjoyable. The war/action scenes in the story were very well written by Hemingway. After reading this book, I look forward to reading more Hemingway novels in the future. If you want to read a war story, I fully reccomend reading For Whom the Bell Tolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's what's not said","review":"Great ending...left to the imagination of the reader. Hemmingway does that a lot in this book. Lays down a scene, but does not complete it. Lets the reader imagine how it plays out.Very accessible book. Puts the reader into the scenes with excellent, very detailed descriptions. And the characters are human...not perfect...not overdone.Quick summary: An American spanish teacher from Montana is engaged to contribute to the Spanish civil war effort by bombing a bridge. He recruits a randy band of freedom fighters who are hiding out in a cave to assist. In the four days leading up to the bombing, he makes friends, makes enemies, falls in love, and eventually gets the job done, even though in the end he's not sure how he's contributing to the cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tolls for anyone who has to read this boring book","review":"I just can't get with Hemingway, and I have trudged through five or six of his allegedly best works.

There is nothing unexpected in the prose nor storyline, just a typical page-turner or \\"best seller\\" -- and that is *not* a compliment!

This is a perfect example of dull writing. His \\"personal property\\" was bull fighting and the Spanish Civil war...give me a break. If this thing tells you anything about the civil war you are too dumb to be counted. Hemingway is ok, but come on, hardly the \\"Great Writer of the 20th century\\" that he wants us to believe.

I labored through the extremely cumbersome and boring narratives hoping that eventually it would pay off, unfortunately it never did. I know it's fiction and everything but the way Hemmingway has Pilar describe past events for pages and pages is very unrealistic. The book finally gets good about 34 Chapters into it whith the raid on El Sordo's band which is the highlight of the book. Maria is annoying. The narrative is confusing. If you are looking for a classic I recommend skipping this book. I plan on reading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" next. Hopefully Hemmingway will redeem himself in that book. I honestly do not see why people consider this a classic.

The power and beauty of this story truly lays in the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"To whom it may concern","review":"What can I say? He is so scant of description but so full of story.

But Bell is quite a disappointment. The 1930s-era characters seem to be speaking an off-putting and unwieldy gringo Shakespeare (\\"Thou hast crossed the arroyo, Ingles\\"). Moreover, the revolving themes of duty and honor and the instrument of war / administration vs. the individuals who carry out the specific deeds don't seem to develop. Rather, the reader is subject to endless conversations with rather boring people, then Robert Jordan muses in an unenlightening manner upon the conversations he's had. About 1/3 of the way through the book I was thinking \\"just blow the damn bridge up, make love to Maria, and go home.\\" Having skimmed the Cliffs Notes, apparently it takes a few hundred more pages for that to happen; pages I am unwilling to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Hemingway I'm upset","review":"I love Hemingway, but this book bored me to tears.

You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist.

He joins a guerilla-group which is given the mission to blow up a bridge to obstruct the fascists' offensive. Although he has a bad feeling about the whole situation he persists.I found the character pilar the most interesting, fulfilling a key role of telling the background story (her experience in the war sofar) as well as being the one who keeps the whole group together (her insights give the American, Robert Jordan, some information about Pablo, the member of the group who can't be trusted).Although it has bothered a lot of people (read the other reviews), for me the translated Spanish words and little sentences really added something to the atmosphere of the book as well as to a better depiction of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, enthralling, heartbreaking","review":"No book has had as powerful an effect on me as this one. I have never read as effective a treatment of loyalty; love; fear; courage. When I reached the last page, after Jordan's injury forces him to leave his love Maria to carry on and he must await his death from the pursuing Fascists, he lies in the pine-scented forest (I can still smell it), lining up his rifle on the leader of the soldiers, the pine-needles pricking through his shirt as he lay, he waited for the officer to enter the sunlit area ... when I read this I wept. A tremendous, heartstopping novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly wonderful book","review":"This is one of Hemmingway's best. It is about war, love, and the endless fight for the opportunity to be human. It has a heartwarming love story that is beautiful without degenerating into a sappy Danielle Steele novel. Perhaps the main thrust of the book can be summed up in one of is most famous lines: \\"The world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it.\\" For those who grow weary of 20th century novels that are driven by stream-of-consciousness and herky-jerky narrative, they will find Hemmingway's straightforward, lucid yet eloquent prose quite refreshing.

The writing is superb. I think I especially enjoyed the parts of the book where the characters are describing their thoughts in tremendous detail, particularly how they feel about having to die at that time in that place. It's extremely dramatic in its depth. The ending is tragic and brought tears to my eyes, even though I already knew what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal truth","review":"This is a story about how simultaneously precious and arbitrary life can be at the same time. Hemingway tells us through his work that ultimately, our brief moment in the sun is nothing more than a chance to do something special and worthwhile, and it is up to us to seize the moment or let it pass. For Whom the Bell Tolls reads far better than The Sun Also Rises, and even though the settings are completely different, I think the same themes about hard-edged valor come through in both. Feminist attempts to emasculate Hemingway (as in other reviews here) seem rather cynical and pointless to me. I enjoyed this book very much. Hemingway has some profound things to say about life. You may not find the bitter message politically correct, but the truth has a way of being enlightening even if unpopular."},{"rating":"2","title":"While not the best Hemingway...","review":"...this book aims to please those readers of Spanish novels with American themes. Give this a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish American war","review":"The political passions that drove Spain to the brink and over the brink of national insanity have almost been forgotten now, but Hemingway's great novel of those times remains. Both fascism and communism have been consigned to the ash heap of history, but we still get here some sense of how the people of that nation were clawing at each other for barely understood reasons. Hemingway's handling of his material is almost beyond praise; it's a genuinely great novel, and a full workout of his trademark and massively influential prose style. The only flaw is the character of Maria and the instantaneous love affair the author cooks up between this refugee and the American interloper Robert Jordan. Amidst the dramatic and desperate events of the story it just doesn't ring true. I would rate this Hemingway's second best novel, after \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful novel...","review":"Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel. His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war. The story is powerful. His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems. The dialogue is stilted. The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable. Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English. His use of Spanish in this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students. It's truly a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Whom The bell Tolls","review":"I thought that this book was very good. Ernest Hemingway was very clear and you were able to even picture how it was in the war. I would recomend this book to everyone. It was sad and funny, and that is a good combination. I think that it had a very good ending and it was very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a dusty jacket in the corner hall. . .","review":"this book reminds me again what is real.

It's this novel A Farewell to Arms, and The Old Man and the Sea that, for me, are the real crown jewels of Hemingway's output. Even if you're just interested in the historical aspect of the The Spanish Civil War, you'll get much out of this work. There isn't much more I can add that hasn't already been said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really tedious","review":"It took me far too long to struggle my way through this novel. Hemingway's attempts to capture the flavor of Spanish syntax make the narrative sound artificial and, at times, ludicrous. Furthermore he often had characters engage in lengthy exchanges which would resolve into nothing, leaving the reader to wonder what profound point he missed. When, in fact, there really was no point at all.Overly long and arduous. Something to be foisted upon unhappy high-schoolers. Hemingway's just not the sort whose style appeals to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Obscenity In The Milk Of....Aw, Muck It.","review":"The plot, characters, etc. have all been discussed ad infinitum around here.

I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow. I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work. It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth waiting for!","review":"Many years ago, I read Van Lustbader's Dai-san trilogy and thought...this guy should stick to thrillers. He has a knack. But then his thrillers became stale and formulaic. He has re-invented himself as a writer with the Pearl series, of which, this is the third installment.Kundala rivals Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia. It is a land of the usual fantasy novel with high-tech thrown in. It's a well-done blend. Characters are well-developed and the dialogue is, at times, highly entertaining....way beyond the usual. These characters have senses of humour, bad days and good ones.Given the ending, it's likely we will see more of this world and I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, The Founders...","review":"In an age where too many voters are \\"pre-enlightenment\\", this is a great read to reminder us where we came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Federalist Papers","review":"I read The Federalist Papers both in High School and College.

Then as she started to become mobile, it was a little less fun - for me anyway! I got this tub when she was about 4 months old and I haven't looked back (she's now 14 months). It's SO much easier to wash her hair since she has something soft to lean back on. I'm also a bit paranoid about germs and it makes me feel more comfortable that she's in a tub that only she uses (vs. the whole family). It's wonderful to take on trips (especially to hotels...yuk), but just remember to bring a hand pump. Also, we're having a water shortage now in GA and this uses so much less water than filling the whole bathtub. Can't say enough about this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great concept","review":"The Snug-Tub is great because you don't have to fill up the bath tub. My 7 month old loves it. The only concern I have is that she is very active in the tub and the bottom is quite slippery. I must have my hand on her at all times. So what we do now is I place the bath seat in the Snug Tub and let her play. When she is all done I take the seat out and rinse her off in the Snug Tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Since it's a blow up tub, all the sides are soft so baby wont bonk her head. There is a drain hole at one end for easy draining, and a suction cup underneath so you can hang it up when not in use. It is also good if you are going on a trip and are not sure if there will be a tub to give baby a bath in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of three","review":"I have bought alot of baby tubs.

You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay.I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me.

The inflatable sides and bottom give a lot of cushioning, and keep my kiddo from banging his head on the tub. He's now almost 2 and still won't take a bath without this tub. He likes to splash around in it, and it uses so much less water than filling the big tub. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it's not that durable. We're on our third one now - the first got a leak in the seam, the second got a rip in the valve -- but we've been using them since my son was about 8 months old, and the price is good, so all in all I'm still a big fan of this tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and practical","review":"I really like this snug-tub for many several reasons. First, it has a suction cap for saftey and you can attached it to either the wall or the floor of your bath tub. Secondly, with its air filled sides, even if your baby accidently bumbs her head, it will not caused any pain. The sides are also very comfortable and pillow-like and she can rests her head there (looking up) while I wash her hair. That actually makes washing hair much easier and prevents soap from entering into her eyes. Thirldly, unlike a bath seat, you do not have to fill your entire bath tub with water and that really saves a lot! The only thing I add onto it is a non-slip rubber mat to its floor. This is much better then having a bath seat because it is much harder to wash your baby's creases with all the bars in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Tub!","review":"I like the idea behind this tub--the size, the inflatable sides and bottom to cushion baby, the suction cup to attach it to the adult tub and the generous drain are all good features. However, the bottom is so slippery that after one try, I was afraid to use it again! Even though I never take my eyes, nor hands for that matter, off of my son while in the tub, he still slipped all over in this one. You are supposed to be able to lay them back to wash their hair, but he just slipped right down into the bottom of the tub. Unless you find a way to make it slip-proof, even for babies that sit up well, I would not recommend this product!Our Snug Tub seems to have a slow leak which is also annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks air","review":"The drain in the bottom of the tub wasn't made correctly and the tub leaked air the first time we used it.We ended up purchasing a different tub at a baby store, and had much better luck.

Easy to clean out and I love the hang up feature so that it can dry out. The only down side is emptying the water.

This seems a little ridiculous since I'd rather not fill it using a cup. Our bathtubs is a regular size (at least I thought). My child also seemed to slide a lot when I would lean her back to wash her hair, she would slide down into the tub.We decided to send this one back. The biggest drawback was the fact that I could not fill this tub easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect concept, just plan on buying a vinyl sealer","review":"In using this product for approx. a year, I have to had to use vinyl sealer for a couple of leaks around the seams.

It lets my daughter play in the tub without me having to hang on to her. Before we got this, she was likely to slip and seemed to feel unsecure in the big tub. Now she plays and seems comfortable.

The fact that it is inflatable is so nice, because one time she teetered over a little and did not get hurt because of the nice, soft sides!

As George Lucas has said, Thomson doesn't know much about the movie business.

For example, Thomson dismisses George Brent because he considers him overweight but spends a lot of time fawning over Johnny Carson. (Johnny Carson?) Like his book about Nevada, Thomson's book about movie people seems to be an exercise in showing everyone how culturally superior David Thomson is. So, Nevada is a \\"blank,\\" and American filmmakers barely adequate, unless they're the artsy type? Well, behind the words, David Thomson is also a blank, barely worth notice.

It took a time or two using it to learn how it handles. The variable speed drive makes it go with almost no effort. Hills are a little more effort. The only problem I have found so far with this mower is when using it around bushes the wire to the electric start may snag and get pulled loose.

Whats on the cover in his hand. In the movie he walks towards the screen and flicks something and it makes a small explosion. Is it a cigarette or is it a heroine-related hallucinations.

While the writing style is nice, and the idea of having one's children taken away is indeed emotional, I found that in this book all conflicts wrapped up nicely, neatly, and FAR too easily and quickly at the end. So quickly and easily, in fact, that there may as well have been no conflict at all, and what's worse, the author starts setting up the easy resolution pretty early on. I kept reading thinking there would be a twist at the end, but nope--if you read this book and after about the first third, you start to think--it can't really be that easy, can it?--well, yes, it can.If you're looking for a light read with unneccesary romantic side stories for the lesser characters, this is a great choice.

I think her books are very aspirational, showing children that they can be more than they are. Ramona, to me, is the embodiment of aspiration, with her creativity, imagination, and talent for self-actualization.

I bought this book for my daughter and found that I enjoyed it just as much as she did as we read it together.The photos capture the essence of the city so well, we enjoyed seeing places we had visited.A great book and I look forward to other books by this author.James HatsisJames1@OconeeAirService.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm tired of dumb...reviews","review":"... \\"The Merry Month of May\\" is a brilliant, perfectly structured novel which was misunderstood when it was first published, and is apparently still misunderstood. Like Jake Barnes in \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" Hartley is a wounded man who finds himself emotionally impotent to help the people he loves most, even when his own godchild's future is in question. He is an observer, in the tradition of Barnes, or Nick Carraway, and to observe is his JOB. His own feelings of guilt and shame come from the very fact that he can't bring himself to act, take sides, or take a stand, even when his friends demand it of him. This is actually, in my estimation, one of the few novels of its time that deals honestly and compassionately with women's true roles in the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the Sixties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly a period piece","review":"The only reason I read this book was because I've just read a book (Saveage Grace) about the Baekwell family who lived in Paris during the 1950's and 1960's, were good friends of James Jones & his wife, and on whom he based the Gallagher family in this novel.The best things I can say about this book is that it's a decent short history of the student uprising in France in 1968 & if you're familiar with Paris at all, it gives an accurate description of the city. Other than that, the book is verbose, its depiction of women woefully sexist and out of date, and gives the reader the cringing feeling one gets when an older person is tring to be \\"with it.\\" This book definitely has not stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a Poet?","review":"I was very surprised that I got through this book. It is not every day that a person will pick up a collection of essays on Classical, Elizabethan and other types of literature, for enjoyments sake. Eliot really outdid himself with his reviews of the literature that he was surrounded by. The definite reads, if you do not want to go through all the essays, are the essays \\"Dante\\", \\"Hamlet and his Problems\\" and \\"A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry\\". \\"Dante\\" is a beuatiful study on both the \\"Divina Comedia\\" and \\"Vita Nouva\\". \\"Hamlet\\" is a putdown on the play that everyone \\"loves\\" so much--with the exception of the writer of this sentence. \\"Dialogue\\" is a well crafted arguement of the essence of the poetic plays and how they fit into modern--it was written in 1922--times. This book is pure genius, although at points rather \\"holier-than-thou.\\" Eliot was a genius and he makes sure to let you know it in his essays."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark and Mysterious Side of a Girl Coming of Age","review":"These interconnected short stories are about the dark and mysterious side of a girl coming of age in a small, rural Canadian community. The mundane quality of puberty is intermeshed with sexual awakening. The girl has cold, unfeeling parents who try to instill the values of puritanism vs. sexual curiosity. The stories also deal with domestic violence and other secrets and shame of home life. The stories are all interesting but some require slow reading to really take them in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Review of Advanced Mathematics","review":"This Dover reprint is a concise and lucid review of the mathematical foundations of classical and modern physics.

My 6-year old sweats a lot and got a bit of a yeast infection around his groin, so I put Desitin on it to help it heal and prevent further moisture. Well, he started screaming! I couldn't get the stuff off of him fast enough. A few months later, I had a yeast infection and decided to test it out on me to see if I got the same reaction - YOWZA! It burned so badly I was nearly frantic trying to get the stuff off. It MAY help prevent a rash, but it is NOT recommended if your child already has a rash that might be yeast-related. I feel like the worst parent on the planet for putting this stuff on my two sons when they were babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Ted Hawkins is wonderful but....","review":"If you're only going to buy one Ted Hawkins CD make sure it's not this one. (Go for \\"Songs From Venice Beach\\" or the \\"Next Hundred Years.\\")This CD is mainly the \\"filler\\" that was cut when the original Venice Beach tapes was reduced from 2 LPs to one CD (Songs From Venice Beach.) The result is that Songs From Venice Beach has most of the best material. However, this CD does have Ted Hawkins singing \\"Dock of the Bay\\" and \\"Chain Gang\\" without which no Ted Hawkins collection is complete.So if you're a Ted Hawkins fan you do need to buy this CD, just don't buy it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Review","review":"Lovely sound.

I've never had a complaint with the original refills. In need of ink on various occasions in the past couple of years I have had to use the Gel Ink. The Gel Ink goes down bold and thick but the tip is not as smooth as the standard refills and the ink is very easily lifted if rain or other liquids come in contact with what you have just written. Another drawback with the amount of ink that gets put down is that a refill may only last a week whereas the original refills would last me months!This complaint may sound a little extreme but one drop onto the shop floor with the tip extended renders the refill useless. This is in stark contrast to the original refills which occasionally I have dropped 2 or 3 times with no adverse effects to the writing ability.Hope this is helpfullShalomMichael"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 packs, each had one working refill","review":"As noted by Flashbizz in his review, the packages all have one refill with a wax covering, and one refill without (and therefore completely dried out).

Where the other cartridges feel scratchy and require significant pressure to write consistently, these cartridges feel very light and smooth. Much more pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gel pens are great, but run out quickly","review":"These gel refills are great. A smooth solid line of ink comes out every time, and it works as well as you'd expect. The down side, with all gel pens, is that they run out of ink much more quickly than regular pens. Keeping that in mind I was still surprised when I had to change the ink after only 3 weeks of daily use.

I purchased these to replace the ink in several hand-turned pens I have.

In fact, the writing tip feels much smoother than the one the pen originally came with. Very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Parker Gel Ink refills","review":"These blue refills are a much lighter blue than the Parker gel refills I purchased at Staples. The first of the two didn't flow well and felt \\"scratchy\\" instead of gliding across the paper like the refills I procured from Staples. The first one was so bad I threw it away the first day. I'll throw the second away as soon as I can get to Staples and buy some \\"good\\" replacements.

It ranges from 12 grit - Ouch! little more than irritating noise - to maybe 60 grit - just enough to tease you into believing there is something special to this band if they can just pull it together for a complete set of tracks (they ARE and HAVE - elsewhere). This may be the worst Madrugada CD available. I can appreciate only maybe 3 1/2 tracks, and one being Majesty, is tiring and forgettable after hearing the transcendant live version from the Tralfamadore session. Buy The Deep End, and Industrial Silence, or if you can stand the cost, the Tralfamadore CD. Don't waste your time or money on this one. If you can't play the CD through without quickly jumping over tracks to save yourself the pain, you aren't missing much."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited photos","review":"Most of the interviews with Ozzy are done over the phone, while you listen to the interview photo's of Ozzy and other band members flash on the screen. That's where the DVD takes a bad turn, because the same photo's flash over and over. I just feel that there should been more behind the scene's photo's or at least different photo's. Also some of the film footage is shot in black and white out of a car window of passing cars and landscape of England that has nothing to do with Ozzy. Most of the contents are well known facts about Ozzy and his life so for the collecting fan this will be a disapointment, but for a new fan it will help them understand a little of Ozzy's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Film Makers Trying to Ride Wave of Ozzy Popularity","review":"The disclaimer at the beginning of this 'documentary' pretty much says it all (paraphrasing): \\"There's not a shred of original Ozzy music played in this film, and it isn't endorsed in any way by the Ozzy Camp\\" (i.e. it sucks). 5 minutes into this film the horrible soundtrack (a $10 drum machine, I think) and the redundant use of still photographs with cheesy \\"effects\\" was almost too much to take. This film is a eclectic bag of snippets, poor quality sound bits and bytes from old Ozzy interviews, and \\"enhanced\\" photos slapped together by some of the least talented people I can imagine. An obvious ploy to ride the wave of Ozzy popularity to their benefit - don't buy this DVD, they don't deserve the revenue. I'd change my review to no stars if I could, and Ozzy should sue these losers for putting his name on this worthless dribble.

I was very disappointed. I've only worn them a few times, and each time they have left my feet aching horribly. The soles, as others have stated, are inexcusably thin. Mine haven't split or broken, but they leave the bottom of my feet hurting because of the lack of support. The entire boot is unstable. They aren't suitable for anything more than a leisurely stroll.

You get more calcium drinking a glass of MILK and that would be much, much cheaper. Do yourself a favor and don't throw away money on this product. You can buy a whole-food calcium vitamin on Amazon called Rainbow Light, which has 50% of your daily needed calcium (500mg) and higher amounts of all other minerals/ingredients (e.g. magnesium) for a lot less money.

But a lot of times, hours later, it starts up again. My twins can sleep through anything, but man, talk about spooky, music boxes just starting up in the middle of the night. I know, I watch too many horror movies.3) The way the part that spins connects to the spinning mechanism, it's possible (and actually pretty likely) that the spinning hook will get a few rotations around before the plush part catches up, which makes the plush part jolt into action and spin a few times really fast.My kids don't have any issue with it, but for the amount of money I paid, I expected something with a bit more quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could a company ever produce this??","review":"We purchased this mobile to go with the matching nursery set. I still can't believe how bad it is. Within a minute the string that attaches the mobile to the device that spins it broke. I decided to use a zip tie to patch it to see if my son even liked it. He did but it has too many design flaws to go with it's poor quality. The tree is just a plush toy with no support, so the limbs sag making the animals hang low. Even with that sagging of the limbs some of the animals get stuck against the holding arm. When that happens you have to give it a nudge to get it spinning again. The mobile is powered by a wind up that lasts about 2 minutes. The music quality is low and after a few days of use the mechanism in the wind up started making constant loud noise.I'm returning this piece of crap before anything else happens. I'm half expecting one of the stuffed animals to suddenly explode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The animals are cute. Assembly is (for the most part, see below) easy, and it attaches well to our crib.The music is loud and the quality is AWFUL. I suspect it might induce nightmares rather than an actual desire to sleep. I don't expect that we'll use it. Ever. Which is too bad, because it means that we'll have to turn the mobile by hand since the two features do not operate independently. However, as another reviewer noted, one of the animals/palm tree arms is too big to fit past the arm assembly as it turns in any case.The pieces all clipped together easily except for the music box; the hook on the arm attachment has insufficient space to allow the music box portion to slide on. We'll need a zip tie or an s-hook to complete assembly.I feel as though this product did not actually go through a thorough QA process - they missed the part where they tried all of the pieces together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well built","review":"I was excited to purchase this mobile for my sons crib.

I was angered when at my sons 3 month mark the mechanism that rotates the stuffed animals and makes the music broke. I am very disappointed by the build quality of the mechanical aspect of this mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!!!","review":"We have the whole Jungle Babies collection, the mobile keeps my sons attention locked in on the cute little animals that match the collection perfectly. The music does last only a couple minuets before needing to be wound again. The music is cute and enjoyable. Great construction and durable have had for 3 years now, currently being used by my second son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fully wound, it only works for 2.5 minutes and is way too loud","review":"We got the Jungle Babies theme for our son's room and generally love all the stuff -- the one thing that lacks is the mobile -- it only lasts 2.5 minutes, and is far too loud for putting a baby to sleep. I wouldn't buy this even for $3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Motivating Book","review":"When I began to read this book I first thought that I would be reading a book similar to a book about the Appalachain Trail or a Wilderness book. Although he writes about some of his expierence walking in the wilderness he mostly writes about the people he meets and the life lessons he learns.I was shocked at the end when he finished the book in New Orleans but he writes that he will continue his walk Westward across America and then write about it.If you are expecting a book about being out in the Wilderness this is not it, but if you want to read about a guys stories about his hike from NY to New Orleans with his best pal as a dog I suggest this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stumbled upon the book, could not put it down!","review":"Absolutely one of the best reads that I've ever encountered. Of course, throughout this book, I continued to hopelessly imagine myself taking this journey along with Peter. Its just a down to earth, true speaking, journey across the eastern US. I wish I could have been there to experience it too. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read - Good Book; Could have been GREAT!!","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and left a very favorable impression on the how each of us can rise above our preconceptions of others. Some very deep and probing subjects were only brushed upon which to some extent allows each of us to fill in the depth based on our experiences. However, I would have loved to hear more of how the hermit in the mountain became so \\"magical\\" for him. Also, at the end, everything races forward at a pace well beyond and out of sync with the beginning of the story. I highly recommend the book and wished that the journey lasted a lot longer so as to more fully explore some of the more magical and cathartic experiences in this person's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly dated but worth reading","review":"This is a very good book that captures a period in American history that is rapidly fading. Not quite as good as \\"Blue Highways\\" by Least Heat Moon, but most definitely very well told and a recommended read. If for no other reason, read this book to reflect on ways of living that Washington careerists are set out to destroy and erase from America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great story of going on a journey to find one's place in life. It's an interesting look into some of the less visited places in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naive, but honest...","review":"I was given this book as a kid by a nice old man at my church. I stopped going to church in my teens and am now agnostic. I have since become very critical of religion and my country (mainly the government and our corporate culture). However I think it's important not to become too cynical. In writing a review of this book I find it necessary to point this out because it is a very simply told, innocent story written by a young man who is not a professional writer or an intellectual. He's just a normal, young guy who walked across America and wrote about it with no secret intentions. As a result you get a very entertaining and heartfelt old fashioned adventure story through America's heartland. If you're looking for anything deeper, then you're reading the wrong book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great condition","review":"I bought this for my husband that was reading the series. It came in great condition. He was suprised and loves the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-read this after many years and still enjoyed it.","review":"Loved walking Peter and Cooper's journey with them, interacting with all the people they met along the way, and the descriptions of places they saw were wonderful. What a great way to experience the Appalachian Trail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book About Travels Hiking Across the US in the 1970s","review":"I found this book at my parents house stashed away somewhere. What a find! It was an original copy from 1979. If you enjoy travel novels (Such as Bill Bryson's a \\"Walk in the Woods\\") you will really enjoy this book. The book took me both across the country and back in time.As someone in his 20s I can identify with the author and the way he felt at the start of his journey. But this book was set in the mid 70s, just under a decade before I was born. It is interesting to hear about all the people he meets along the way, and what America was like in 35 years ago. Jenkins paints a very vivid picture of the places he visits and the people he meets along the way. He also goes on an inner journey of self discovery. From a lost recent college grad disillusioned with the US he gains an appreciation for his country and a better understanding of himself. I really enjoyed it and even ordered a copy for one of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Adventure, well-told, Makes you proud of American ppl","review":"Peter goes on an incredible journey with his best friend, Cooper, and takes us along with well-told chapters, each covering a different section of the hiking trail. He tells of the many Americans he comes across, most of them good-hearted, generous people who offer him unconditional hospitality and love. He doesn't say much of the technicalities of trail life itself, so it is not really a good hikers guide. This is more like a collection of individual stories, each with their own theme and lesson and his own revelations he discovers about himself and the world. What's great is that he discovers himself in the most complete way any human being could that it seemed like it was fate that he needed to take that hike. What a great, story-book ending to true-life non-fiction novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great","review":"Love this book. I've read a library copy 3 or 4 times and wanted my own. It arrived in great condition, and I'll enjoy reading it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great theme, bad writing.","review":"Walking across America is quite an endeavour, to write a book about it another. The theme of the book is very interesting, however the style of writing is very dramatic which is a bit tiresome. Jenkins experiences are either rated as total bliss or complete catastrophe, and unfortunately so are the people he meets. The book bleaches in comparison with Krakauers \\"Into the Wild\\". I did buy the sequel before reading this book and will actually read it because I really like the theme. Hopefully Jenkins has matured on the next section of his walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read a few other reviews where the writing in this book was described as amateur, lacking focus and ham-fisted (what a great word). The premise of this book is so great but the author's poor writing style and lack of meaning is incredibly disappointing. The book feels like a work log of what he did every day and misses so many opportunities to share insight and depth. One of my favorite inconsistencies is when the author shares that he has been a strict vegetarian for the prior 3 years and then only 13 pages later describes how he orders 15 \\"big-man\\" burgers from a fast food drive in. What?!?!I was generous and gave this book a 2 because I really like the idea of seeing the country by walking across it. Unfortunately the title was probably the best part of the book. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Reading this book for a book club, I found it incredibly boring and superficial. Peter spends 3 days on the mountain with Homer and writes nothing of depth about this amazing mountain man. Peter's writing is pedestrian. He talks about wanting to discover America and yet only writes about people when someone else directs him to! Someone told him he had to go see Homer the Mountain Man. This was the first people story after 7 weeks of walking. Homer was a character and shared himself with Peter and yet Peter is insensitive and self-absorbed in his responses to Homer. The next story in the book written about actual people is when someone directs him to spend the night in the police station. There Peter talks to a Vietnam Vet. Peter writes that the Vet's stories would awaken a person from a 6 month coma and then writes NOTHING about those conversations. Wasted opportunities. The concept of the book is a great idea, but the writing is juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish prose","review":"I believe Mr. Jenkins must have been paid by the exclamation point, so liberal is he with their use. While his story should be interesting to the wanderers among us, his telling of it is so hamfisted that I just couldn't bear to continue. Jenkins needs a harsher editor or better yet, a ghost-writer. This book reads like a high-school senior's lengthy \\"personal narrative\\" for a college admissions essay. But perhaps I'm being too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for an 8th grade reading list","review":"I just finished this book and want my money back. I felt like I was expected to write a book report after reading this. If this book is any indication, I won't insult my inteligence by reading any more of his work. He didn't even make it \\"across\\" the US in any meaningful sense of the term. In THIS book that is. For the entire trip west, you have to buy the sequel. Sounds like someone is milking a story...I do envy him his journey. The entire reason I bought this book was to learn about the logistics of undertaking such a long hike, as I plan on walking from the east coast to the west coast someday. Unfortunately he would rather write of his love affair with his \\"forever friend\\" and make up lame similes for every little thing he encounters. I would give an example, but I've already given away the book.In my opinion, check your local library or buy it in a quarter bin at a flea market. Any more time or money invested in this book is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Lazy Weekend Afternoon","review":"Ugh, ugly book. This book, while original, was definitely not a book I'd sit down and read on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't worth my time, and I doubt it will be worth yours.Peter Jenkins, author and protagonist, decides to walk across America for no good reason besides curiosity. He takes an exaggerated super-dog named Cooper with him. He explores all different aspects of society in his quest and eventually finds himself a girl and gets married. Many things in this I find hard to believe. The author believes that Cooper and himself share a level of implied communication of feelings to each other (implying that the animal is sentient). The some of the ridiculous characters encountered represent the crazies of American society. The lack of interesting plot left me gasping for something solid.The only thing and I found that I liked in this book was that the author found God in the end and felt the power of God affect his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book!","review":"A Walk Across America was a wonderful book. The book was full of adventure. Peter Jenkins, the author, hikes from New York to Louisiana with his trusty dog, Cooper. This book allows the reader to take a wild journey. Peter discovers what it is like to be truly hungry, to travel in the mountains, to live in very different cultures, to make new friends, and to learn about religions. This book contains interesting photographs that bring the stories to life. One thing amazing about this book is that it is a true story. Peter Jenkins actually \\"walked across America.\\" After reading this book I felt energized. Knowing I can go anywhere and do anything if I put my mind to it. I would recommend this book to others. You won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best writing, but definitely a story worth reading.","review":"Well, it's been over a year since I read this book, and yet it still constantly echoes in my mind. Essentially, A Walk Across America is a collection of encounters with enlightening individuals, each who shares something about their lives that will stay with you forever. At times I was disappointed with Jenkins' style; his writing skills are not on par with John Irving, for example, but he definitely gets his point across."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk Across America Review","review":"I really enjoyed the book, A Walk Across America. The book reminded me that life is not about the destination; it is about the journey and the sights you see, the things you do, the memories you create and the people you love. This book reminded me that life is the journey, and in the journey you find out who you are and what you stand for. Peter Jenkins is a great author, and this is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Terrific Walk","review":"I can promise you that I haven't read more than one book in the past ten years, but from the moment I picked up \\"A Walk Across America\\" I couldn't set it down. I read it cover to cover in three days and ordered \\"The Walk West\\" and \\"Along the Edge of America\\" immediately. This book is for anyone who loves the outdoors, dogs, adventure or just a heartfelt excellent story. I now plan on reading anything and everything that Peter Jenkins writes. I sent a copy of this book as a gift for my son in Florida. Thank you Peter for sharing with us your wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning","review":"I read this book in 1986 while in the Marine Corps stationed at Pearl Harbor. After geting out of the service I still haven't settled down. I,ve trekked from Florida to Alaska to India and beyond with no sight of settling down and no reason to.Jenkins lit a fire in my conciousness that stirred an unquenchable couriosity. This book should have a disclaimer warning that you may just bag what is expected of you and find your own path.This is a heartfelt account of one mans journey. Be careful!! You just might do it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Altering Book","review":"I received a copy of A Walk Across America as a Christmas gift. Now exactly one month later I have finished not only that book but the sequel, A Walk West. Being a college student I do not have much time to read outside of my assigned readings. However with both of these books I set aside time to read them and most importantly contemplate what Mr. Jenkins was saying. I am 19 and Mr. Jenkins wrote this book over twenty years ago expressing thoughts and concerns that most teen-agers share today. I applaud Mr. Jenkins and thank him for sharing his story. Every child who is unsure about there path in life or is sure needs to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good walkers don't [necessarily] make good writers","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The author is not a strong writer. He tries to compensate for it by being overly dramatic, which only makes some passages border on the absurd, such as worrying about the \\"shark-infested waters\\" while crossing a bridge over an inlet of Lake Ponchartrain!With a personal narrative it's also important for the reader to form a bond with or at least take an interest in the narrator. I found that difficult to do with what the author gave me to work with.Frankly I'm surprised this book sold so well. I agree with another reveiwer that \\"Blue Highways\\" is a much better written book of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"dragonfly","review":"This book was very cheap.My child needed it for class and we got it super fast..I well order from them again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual journey; a humble search rewarded","review":"One of the books that has had a greater impact on me. This is personal testimony of a young man who set out walking across half of America, disillusioned with the world he knew. Along the way he will discover people who will show him a different way to look at life.Written in a simple style, with humility and candidness. A spiritual journey that we have the privilege to witness, and that can be a great benefit for those who sit at home prisoners of their empty selfs. A portrait of rural America, of real people and of real places. Real life always excells fiction. A most highly recommended book, don't lose this opportunity and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Attitude Check\\" review","review":"I found this album online after having already acquired Mike Ridley's \\"One of a kind\\" album elsewhere.

I do agree with most of what was written so I will not be repeating that information. But I do give you a tip; buy, or borrow a book of Paul Gauguin's art, and read this novel watching the paintings. Then you will realize the great descriptions Mr. Llosa gives of the paintings and their meaning. It's Stunning.As for the second person references, it isn't that anoying, although at the end they are a little too common; but somehow they give you a link with Flora and Paul, maybe an empathic link.The characters are very well researched, realistic, with lots of flaws (like everyone) and hopes, past mistakes, glorious victories... but with one common goal - the search for paradise."},{"rating":"1","title":"My purchase","review":"I had a Bad Brains Cd I liked however did not care for this DVD.

Second story is the Mickey Jack and the Beanstock, which I loved as a kid, but it is narrated by a weird guy with puppets.

I wouldn't have minded if it was just an introduction, but Edgar Bergin and the dummies keep making comments throughout the entire cartoon.This was a complaint I always had with the Walt Disney show when it was on. They would take classic cartoons that originally played in theaters re-edit them and show them on TV.

Reading this book was one of the final acts of his long, admirable and often difficult life, and he assured me that this book portrays conditions inside the mines and in the company towns very accurately.

The original \\"Master\\" tape has been lost. In 1996 I recorded a DAT tape for Dick Anthony that contained this Zondervan vinyl album. Mr. Anthony used this DAT for his remaster onto CD. The DAT tape I made was not well done and the quality of this reissue CD reflects the surface noise that is prevalent on vinyl(I never intended the DAT to be used as a master). The song \\"Star and Septer\\" is particularly noisy. The rest of the songs are OK but there is still the occasional \\"tic\\" from the vinyl. I have over 800 Christmas LP's in my personal collection. I would rate this CD/Album number one. The a cappella music that was crated by the 16 Singing Men is some of the finest.Jim Guild"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE For All Babies","review":"This has to be one of the best products on the market! Now that my daughter is pregnant with my first grandchild, I have been doing a lot of shopping and research. My sister-in-law filled this with orange wedges and handed it to her then very fussy 8 month old and I couldn't believe the instant peace. She swears by this product. It can be filled with just about anything. Cold products are great in here for teething babies, and it's a great way to give infants fresh fruit without the risk of choking.

Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?)

I spent 2 hours and there were still places that it was impossible to clean. I don't want to give my daughter a fruit in something that may have bacteria from the previous fruit that was placed in it.... I used it just once and never again. It is impossible to have the baby safe feeder 100% clean with a fruit like a banana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!!","review":"I had seen this product in the store, but had put off buying it thinking it wasn't necessary. Then one day I realized how much my daughter LOVED whole friuts vs. the baby-food puree & it was also the first time she choaked on anything... a piece of peach. A few days later I had the safe feeder & its great to let her sit in her highchair and eat on her own. Nice break for me to do paperwork at the same time too, instead of cutting up small pieces for her!! :) Excellent product. Leahs Mommy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great teether!","review":"I bought the Baby Safe Feeder with the intention of putting ice in it for my teething son. My husband had other ideas. He thought it would be a great way to introduce our 5-month-old to grilled steak. It took some convincing, but the voice of reason finally won. We compromised on watermelon, which our son loved! The ice idea works pretty well, too. The only problems I have with the Feeder are it's hard for my son to hold, and its messy. But, he's five months old, what do you expect?! I reccommend this product, but not for steak!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea!","review":"I tried this based on the recommendation of some moms in my playgroup. Never realized something like this existed! My 7 month old is more difficult than my first two children to take out in public...this helps tremendously when we go to a restaurant. I just get a piece of fruit and it keeps him occupied the whole meal, and I am happy that I am able to give him healthy alternatives! Great, great, great product! (be advised, though, it can take a bit to get baby used to it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was swayed by all the positive reviews of this product. I am sure that it works with *some* babies, but unfortunately my daughter is not one of them. She won't put the mesh part in her mouth at all...she keeps turning it the opposite way and chewing on the handle. While the feeder seems like an innovative idea, I think I'm better off either pureeing foods or just waiting to give her certain foods when she is older and less likely to choke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom","review":"The idea of this product is great and that is why I bought it. It has one major problem. To get it clean again is almost impossible. I used it first with a banana and since I could not get all of the banana out of the mesh I ended up tossing it. It came with an extra mesh and I used an apple in that. It met with the same fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Item","review":"We love this item. Not only does it allow for my son to feed himself all kinds of foods from frozen milk and frozen veggie cubes to graham crackers and teething biscuits, but it keeps him busy since he can 'do it himself' so that hubby and I can enjoy dinner together and not in shifts. Cleaning it has not been a problem at all...even when I left banana in it OVERNIGHT. (I don't recommend doing that...but if you do...it will come clean). I took the advice of another poster who reviewed this product and clean the feeder with hot water, some vinager and denture cleaning tabs. Works beautifully. We've had our feeder now for about 2 months and use it practically everyday and we're still on our first bag. We LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"This is a great invention! You can stick pieces of whatever food you like in and screw the top on and let your baby discover new foods and cut those new teeth at the same time. It can be difficult to clean, but you can always get new bags. It is also a little bulky but my child didn't have any trouble handling it once he found the tasty treats inside. And, as always with feeding a baby, expect it to be a little messy! I loved mine with my first child and am about to pick one up for my second. You should try one, it's such a relief to know your baby can eat safely without getting too large a chunk of something from those first teeth. You see, it is a mesh bag with a fairly fine mesh, so they have to squish the foods into a pulp and basically suck it through the bag to eat it. A great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought this for my 6 month old who is very restless in her highchair. She was very content with this product. The first time I used it with bananas and she loved it. I want to provide healthy food for my baby and this helps me out alot. Not to mention without the worry of a choking hazard. I would have rated this product with 5 stars, but it is a pain in the neck to clean. Food does get stuck in it and takes quite a bit of work to get out. However, I will take the advise of the other comment and buy more bag refills."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so awesome!","review":"I discovered this wonderful invention when my son was about 9 months old! I wish I had found it earlier. We froze carrots, bananas, grapes, and peaches and put them in the feeder. He loved them! The frozen food helped soothe his sore gums and he also loved the taste of the food! I highly recommend this for any parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Little Eaters!","review":"My 6 months old loves food! I don't buy jarred food, I cook frozen or fresh foods and grind it up for her. This item is awesome. I don't have to grind things up. I can just give her the safe feeder and she sucks it right down. She loves being able to do it herself too. Definetly worth the money 100 times over. You'll be glad you have this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter does not like","review":"My daughter hates this for some reason. she is teething, so i thought it would be great. I put cantaloupe in it and she licked it and then threw it on the floor and cried when I put it up to her mouth again. We have tried 3x now and she HATES it. I even tried freezing fruit in it and giving it to her that way. I think she hates the feel of the mesh bag. So I just diced the food up like usual and gave it to her that way, even though its messy and she gags on it sometimes. I was disapponited because I thought this would be so nice and avoid all of that hassle and mess but I guess this just won't work out for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, hard to clean, and hard to use","review":"While I don't share everyone elses enthusiasm about this product, I will say that my 5 month old 'liked' it. I gave two stars instead of one only for that reason. I can't understand how people are able to clean this thing. I scrubbed it, put it in the dishwasher, used a brissle brush, but it took forever to clean. One thing is for sure, if you buy this, don't use the peel on foods as suggested. I had a little more luck cleaning this when I peeled the grapes (which you'll see isn't really that hard, apples and pears. Bananas I'll never use again, they are virtually impossible to get out of the inside mesh area by the ring. Also, when my baby was done, he was soaked from all the juice and sooo sticky. On the positive, he did seem to have fun at first. Up until the food was small and it kept going up to the top where he couldn't put his mouth around it.Good luck to those who buy this, maybe you'll have better luck like the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 8 month old wanted nothing to do with it","review":"My 8 month old loves to eat biscuts and toasts, but sometimes I get a little nervous about the possiblility of chocking on little pieces that he bites off. So I thought this would be perfect. I've tried all different kinds of fruit and he wants nothing to do with it. He doesn't get any fruit from the mesh, just fluid. This doesn't teach him how to eat. Sometimes you need to let them take off a chunk and watch what they do with it. Obviously, you need to use your judgement. Also, I thought the ... price tag was a little hefty for a mesh bag and handle, but figured I'd give it a try. Aside from his not liking it, it is impossible to clean. Most likely a ploy to get you to spend more money on replacement bags. Definately not worth the [money]. I'm sorry I bought it. With all the baby stuff out there on the market, it's hard to know what you should buy. This product shouldn't be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesh Feeder","review":"This feeder is great for babies who start sucking on their toys. It is great with cantelope. Buy two and get some replacement bags also."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little frustrated with this product...","review":"I was SO excited to get this feeder for my 8 month old. I've tried using it several times and he will not put it past his lips! I've tried to 'help' him get started eating from it, but he won't bite! The reason is the mesh bag. He doesn't like the feel of it. He is that way with foods that are not blended smooth enough as well.I would love for him to use it, but I'm not sure what to do! Maybe I will just rely on the food grinder from now on.Great idea though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My son is 8 months we have used this item 3 to 4 times since november.

I will try to add a picture of it ripped.My feeder is ripped and my kid is alive - lucky me I dont have to gamble with my baby life again - and why? to let him suck on a fruit thru a \\"sock\\" that is unsafe.

He just \\"didn't get it\\". He used it as a toy and threw it on the floor every time I offered it to him. I just gave up!

It's good for babies over 6 months but one must understand that the baby might throw it away (sometimes very far away) and then all the food is gone. It's a cheap item and the baby might have fun as mine did. When they get a bit older and holding things for longer, it is very handy to leave the baby busy eating some fruit, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great food item","review":"This feeder is great to let little ones have and make a mess. Don't think they won't get messy. My little one had banana everywhere. She is 9 months and can hold it my herself. However, she does try to eat the bag. She has two teeth that I think could eventually rip the bag if she tries hard enough. But I don't think it is a dangerous feeder. The replacement bags are useful so you can't wash one and put in a fresh one. The screw top is wonderful and it is made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies...","review":"I received this whle I was stilll pregnant I thought it was a joke. To my suprise when my son started solids, I gave him a small piece of peach in this....and he went to town!!!He can eat almost anything from this which he likes since now he can have a taste of whatever mommy and daddy are eating at the time. I feel safe giving him grapes (which I cut in half since the skin is tougher to break in the mesh) and he eats all the pulp out of them and the choking hazard is eliminated! I got the extra 2 nets and when traveling or in a typical day we can use all three and don't worry about washing till the end of the day.My son is now 13 months old and we still use this for the occasional use. It is great for a lot of those fresh fruit days, since he loves to gobble his food down without really trying to chew. I would, and have, reccomend this to every parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so much- I buy it for every newborn I know","review":"This is an AMAZING feeder! I have 15 mo old b/g twins and they have loved it since they were 6 months old. I put everything in it- bananas, avocado, apples, pears, cheese, strawberries, watermelon, ice cubes (great for teething), juice cubes, even MEAT! My children love it. Cleaning it was never a problem, I soak the mesh nets in Oxyclean over night and rinse them thoroughly (then I lick it to see if there is ANY residue of the cleaner), then rinse again. They come out perfectly clean. I make sure that I tell them what I am giving them in the feeder so they can learn the words for banana (for example) and that has worked wonderfully too!

I think that this is a must have for all babies!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused a rash after each use","review":"A neighbor had recommended this product and it sounded great. I bought it along with extra bags and my baby loves it. We have used it several times and have found two major problems with it. It is really a pain to clean but worse than that - my baby breaks out in a rash around his mouth after each use, despite us washing his face immediately after he is done eating. We have determined that he is allergic to the mesh and won't be using it again. What is it made of anyway?? I threw the packaging out and wish I had kept it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to clean","review":"My son loves it.

I am trying to find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more tears","review":"I came across this product with a recommendation from a friend who's twins were having an easy time with teething. My little guy was so unhappy and crying all the time. The bitter biscuits were so messy and even without his first tooth william was able to break them into little chunks. I bought the feeder and used it originaly for his teething. At around 4 months old I was putting melon in it. Although it said to use frozen fruit, I just used fresh and of course fruit juice was everywhere afterward but the crying stopped. The only teething upsets after buying this product were when the tooth actually broke thru, otherwise william was suddenly the happiest kid in town. Melon, strawberrys, oranges, peaches, you name it. and once he was old enough i'd use it at dinner time and give him whatever we were having. Steak and potato....No problem. It made all the difference and saved my sanity to boot. I ran out and bought one for every gal in the family who was having a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I bought this for my son when he was about 6 months old after reading soo many great reviews. I admit, I was very skeptical.. it looked like such a pain to clean! But my son really loves it so it is definately worth the effort it takes to wash. He is teething and I think this is really soothing for those little gums. It is also great for taking along when we eat out as we can always get some fruit from the salad bar, and it keeps him entertained so we can actually eat! The only drawback is the cleaning.. it really does take some effort to get all the food out of it.. especially banana. The feeder has a very thick seam and a ridge around the green part that trap bits of food. I have been using a toothbrush to clean it, but if anyone has some tips to share to make it easier I'd love to hear them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A parent's best friend....Baby's, too!!","review":"We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old. He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke. The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag. We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething. We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries. I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits. Enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it!","review":"I just recently received this item and my son loves it. He tried it with bananas first and was hooked.

At that time, he had just started chewing on teething biscuits and I wanted to give him a little more variety in his diet. I think we used it twice before we decided it was too much work. It is a great idea, but takes forever to clean the food out the the bag and my son was fed up with the amount of work he had to put into getting swallow of food. Maybe if we had tried it when he was just being introduced to fruits and veggies this would have worked, but I've decided it was just a huge waste of money for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives babies an opportunity to try new foods earlier in life","review":"I love this item and we use it almost daily. My daughter's eyes light up when I start filling it, she loves it that much! She has tried many more fresh fruits and vegetables than my other kids did at her age. I even put broccoli in it and she devours it.The only downside is that the net can be difficult to clean when very small food particles are embedded. Sometimes the dishwasher doesn't get it all, so it has to be scrubbed by hand in addition. For that reason, we bought three extra nets. If I haven't had time to clean one, we just grab an extra.Overall, I think this is one of the most useful baby items I've purchased in a while. It beats feeding her nothing but food out of jars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product!!","review":"I don't have to worry about my 7 month old daughter choking on teething biscuits (which often break into tiny pieces) when I put them in the baby safe feeder.

My son stayed quiet while I cooked dinner. However, he's 10 months old, and likes to throw things on the floor. The green top breaks very easily, and my son has just broken the third top. I can't keep buying replacements for it--it's getting too expensive.

I only used it a couple times for foods. At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing. I LOVE this product for when she is teething. I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it doesn't stick to her lips. She gets upset when the ice is gone.

For those of you complaining about cleaning banana...it says right on the instructions that they don't recommend putting banana in it for that exact reason. It's awesome for teething biscuits and apple slices, as well as frozen juice for those really bad teething days.

First he started with cheerios, they will melt in your babies mouth, and yes he did gaga little, but a nurse told me that is normal and part of the process of learnign to eat. When he mastered that I introduced other foods. To make it safe I just cut his food up into tiny pieces (about the size of a cheerio). He only has 4 teeth now at 12 monthes old but he eats what we eat, just cut up (the pieces can be larger now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK!","review":"This product looked GREAT online and I thought it would be the perfect way to allow my young son to feed himself independently some of the time.

Bits of food get trapped in the seams of the mesh bag and near the plastic ring. I scrub using a short-bristle brush as recommended, soak and rinse under hot water repeatedly and still can't get it completely clean. Stains are one thing, but pieces of food will grow bacteria.

If the manufacturer can fix the problem, this would be a must-have product."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby refuses it!","review":"I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething.

I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Baby = Happy Mom","review":"This is one of the best baby products ever! My 9 month old daughter is very high needs and this is the only thing that will keep her occupied for more than 30 minutes.

That is one of the wackiest notions I've ever heard about Godzilla. Still, one wonders if there friendship can last?

This is the first Random House Godzilla novel to feature other monsters. Scott Ciencin writes the Kamarucas (Gimantis) and Kumonga (Spegia) monsters very closely to their movie incarnations. An interesting occurence in the book has Kamaracuras carrying Kumonga as they fly away to escape their battles with Godzilla and the giant scorpion. This is strange because in \\"Son of Godzilla\\", Kumonga tries to paralyze and eat Kamaracuras. Another intriguing point in this book is Godzilla making friends with the giant scorpion. In \\"Godzilla King of the Monsters\\", the book, Godzilla dreams about himself playing with his Godzillasuarus friends. Obviously, he still wishes to play because after a small battle, the two quickly become pals. This book is worth reading because it has a lot of great moments in it when Godzilla fights his monster foes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavorless Funk","review":"I have thousands of funk albums.

The \\"young artists\\" in this album do not have the clearest articulation, so I do not know how much a child can learn from this album, if he/she does not know the songs already.

I had also read the reviews and thought this might be fun for my 2 year old son. First of all the kids all sound like they've had speech lessons from Elmer Fudd. Second, the recording is striving for \`cutesy wutsey' and comes off as quite nauseating. I like the sound of children's voices, so don't get me wrong on this point. Smithsonian series has some great songs with kids singing and it is quite enjoyable. The kids on this cd however, are so self-conciously trying to be cute that it comes off as annoying, especially the old man is snoring song. Be warned. There are much better and fun cds out there choo choo bugaloo and the above mentioned Smithsonians cd series as well as satchmo sings disney etc. avoid this one unless you are a lover of sacharine cutesy wutsey poorly produced garbage. my kid doesn't like it either. he is bored with it. and god knows I don't want him@speaking like these kids. uggggh"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it at all!","review":"I am very disappointed with this CD considering it was recommended by the parents.

It is such a simple concept with amazing results - sheer happiness and enjoyment. My three year old daughter is their biggest fan. We actually listened to this cd so much in the car that it cracked in the cd player. Had to get a new cd player, but the biggest loss was of the cd. Needless to say, we purchased another as soon as we knew it was broken. We love these kids and their songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young toddlers love it","review":"I am purchasing this CD for my 2 year old because I remember how much my 14 year old son enjoyed it as a toddler. The reason children like this CD is that they love hearing other kids sing.

The backs of the puzzles have a color along with the name of the animal that is on the front. This allows us to either put together a 'zebra' or flip one over and put together the colored puzzle with the word on it. Obviously you need to keep these away from the 13-month old, b/c they are not intended for chewing. This toy is best used when brought out under adult supervision to ensure pieces are not rough handled b/c they are made out of cardboard.

No commercial pricks","review":"After hearing Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek's \\"Reflection Eternal\\", I had to find some more material from Hi-Tek. Hi-Teknology is full of amazing, unique, and original production. The album also has some great underground emcees. The short solo productions of Hi-Tek, without the raps, \\"Scratch Rappin\\" and \\"Tony Guitar Watson\\" are just amazing! I guarantee satisfaction. All the cuts are unique and individually amazing. GET THIS ALBUM!! DON'T SLEEP ON IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lo-Tek","review":"Hi-Tek has never been a personal favorite of mine, but I did enjoy his work on Blackstar and with Mos Def. He's just not the type of producer who puts out the bangin' hip hop beats I prefer. Hi-Teknology only proves this further. The majority of the beats featured are weak, dull, soft, whatever you want to call them. Not to say I want everything to be Rasco-esque, but I get bored of those Common-type beats that don't make your head nod even a little bit. I'm starting to get the impression that Hi-Tek is a one trick pony who is saving all of his better beats for future projects. Hi-Teknology comes off as being very incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats are sleep on this Natti producer","review":"I recommend this album for two words \\"Hi\\" and \\"Tek\\"! This cat is as real as it comes. He has an all-star(that's if you on the \\"real\\" hip-hop scene) lineup along with his tight, and signature beats. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the CD wasn't long enough for me. I guess I'm greedy. But on the really real you gotta feel Tek, if not, you'z a hater, dats real. But to really feel him, I mean really, you gotta get Train of Thought, Quality, Black Star, and The Beautiful Struggle.

DA Da DA Da DA! Da! DADa! DA! DA! Hi Tek!","review":"Not since Bootsy Collins and his brother joined James Brown's band in 1970 has Cincinatti's funk had such a high platform. Hi Tek makes a sweet blend of smooth lady vocals, hard bass thumps and sweet old school hornplay thats consistent on every song he produces. Suddenly with underground stunners Mood, the Cormega track, and the Buckshot joint are the heaviest pavement pounders. Get this album and turn the volume to high proportions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-teknological, neurological, unstoppable","review":"Hi tek is one of the best producers/djs out there, and he shows off his skills in his new album by working with a wide variety of artists with different tastes and abilities. It had a slower feel to it, and Hi tek is never one to use a \\"form beat\\" to create the normal rap/pop song. The lyrics are moving, and exactly what you would expect from greats kweli, mos def, and common. If you are looking to download, pick up sun god, get back part II get to steppin, and LTAH which has a feel of something you do not hear often. Overall, Hi tek put out a great album of slower and more experimental beats that show off his production prowess. This is a good cd to add to an underground collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"dissapointed","review":"i was thinkn this new album would be ill, but i was disapointed.

The first part of the book is a defense of the grammatical-historical interpretation of Bible prophecy. Then Pentecost dives right in with a survey of the four major biblical covenants, and a study of Israel in prophecy, the Gentiles in prophecy, and the church in prophecy. He includes a detailed discussion of the timing of the rapture, the events of the seven year tribulation period, and the second coming of Christ, followed by the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ. He then has a helpful section about the eternal state.It must be stated that this is a 600 page heavy duty textbook. It is not like reading a Frank Peretti novel or a Left Behind book. This is for the hard core Bible prophecy student, and it is still THE end times book to get.

I used one chapter which identifies the players in Ezekiel 38 and 39. Eveyone's books just say that Russia will invade Israel. But I remember him call \\"Gomer\\" there Germany. So, I just described Ezekiel 38 based on that book chapter as the nations of the world invading Israel to go to war with Jesus Christ in armageddon-Russia, the Germans and EU and the Arabs. I remember some complicated teachings about God's covneants with Isreal and Abraham. Too much for me. I just used it as sort of a reference book to look some things up in.

Eleven varieties of Ames True Temper, a few off brands, a few store brands. A few had decent handles, but every single one without exception had soft, thin, cheap imported steel (in a few cases \\"tempered in USA\\") guaranteed to bend or break under any strenuous work.Where I come from, the ground is filled with rocks. A shovel takes a beating digging even a modest hole. You have to be able to stand on the foot braces and jump up and down, and scrape and auger and pound. Cheap junk won't cut it.This Bully Tools shovel has as solid construction as I have ever seen in a shovel.

He goes to great lengths to to say that even though he is smaller then O.J. that he \\"wasn't afraid\\". As if O.J. was going to pull out a knife and kill him in a room full of lawyers! The value of this book lies not in the shameless self-promotion of the author but rather in explaining that both the criminal and civil juries in this case may well have come to the correct conclusion, and in explaining how the differences in the system can lead to this conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accept it world, OJ was innocent!","review":"I followed this case very closely and I believe that the verdict was completely fair. No other verdict was possible. OJ was innocent! The notion that many people hold that public opinion polls \\"proved\\" he was guilty is ridiculous. He was either guilty or he wasn't. I have never had a conversation with anyone regarding this case - no matter how sure they were initially of OJ's guilt --who didn't come away with the opinion that there was a lot more to the case than they had previously thought and that perhaps OJ wasn't guilty after all. The fact that OJ is currently imprisoned in Nevada on \\"kidnapping\\" charges makes me lose a great deal of respect for our judicial system."},{"rating":"2","title":"this bpok is excelllent","review":"i read it every night as i believe too in my heA6T THAT OJ IS GUILTY I CHEERED WHEN I SAW THE CIVIL VERG IT READ OUT ON TV AND READING THIS BOOK TELLS ME WHY THEY GOT THEY VERDIT DOES DAN HAVE A E MAIL ADRESS I LOVE TO WRITE TO HIM HE A GOOD WRITER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and incompetent writing","review":"Petrocelli (and/or his ghost writer) have put together a book that is replete with incorrect use of the language in terms of tenses and punctuation marks, and the writing style is without any real sense of flow.

Simpson can produce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Humanity has declined to such a point where they are just useless idiots that stare at shadows in the walls. Apes work on fields to feed the humans. In the mean time our computers bravely explore the galaxy and every now and then they check on humans and they break a few rules. There is also some kind of impossible love affair on this book. This is a completely disjointed, incoherent, depressing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very (poor)","review":"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. It is fairly depressing, first humans are taken over by their own computers and then they become extinct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, if a little tough to identify with at times","review":"When I read this book I immediately thought of Olaf Stapledon's book \\"Last and First Men.\\" Both books are very well written, explore some very interesting ideas, and cover such a wide swathe of time that you really have no individual characters to identify with. They are almost closer to history books than they are to science fiction novels (merely an observation, not a criticism).Having said that, \\"Genesis\\" does maintain some characters throughout the book, and somehow this makes it easier on the reader when Poul Anderson starts to really push and question what it means to be human, both mentally and biologically (if you can make that distinction).This is not a light summer read. It is good solid science fiction that pushes the reader outside of his or her comfort zone and into a world where \\"human\\" is not a clear-cut concept, but is more a question of perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"Poul Anderson ought to be ashamed of himself. He took the worked-to-death theme of sentient machines, presented the same dead-tired ideas in a grandious backdrop - I suppose that was an attempt to make his readers think he said something new - integarated them loosely with some old short stories of his and called it a \\"new\\" book. What little story the book has lurches along until Anderson apparently got tired of writing and quit. It certainly had no ending in the normal sense of a novel. At times, Anderson's prose is almost poetry. It flows beautifully. Unfortunately, when examined for meaning, it's often complete nonsense. Add the fact that the only two characcters in the book are two dimensional strawmen that Anderson made no effort whatsoever to flesh out and what you get is a real stinker. The only interesting aspect is whether Anderson is a cynical old man trading on his reputation to grub some easy money or whether he's really that far over the hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, a Great Book","review":"I can confirm the previous positive reviews of this book. US foreign policy is exposed in detail in this work. These were crucial years (1944-1954) in twentieth century Guatemala, and the US played a decisive and destructive role. After the US intervention, Guatemala experienced a long series of brutal dictatorships backed by the US, which culminated in civil war in the 1970s and 1980s. Any student of Latin America or US foreign policy would greatly benefit by reading Gleijeses's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"Although the novel covers some interesting aspects, it fails to captivate its audience.

It is not for everyone--it's too smart to be, too strange and strangely wise. I bought this book and half expected it to be some pale shadow of Homer and found instead a whole world, hilarious, sad, absurd. Did I mention beautiful?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enigma, poetry, and the odyssey rolled into one.","review":"I've been wanting to read this novel since I read a short story by Ehrenreich in McSweeneys about an odd couple meeting in an aquarium in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Although it's far from my idea of the perfect novel and I can see how it might be construed as pretentious, I think Ehrenreich has a very unique, and poetic voice. I love the way this book and the short story I read seem to teeter somewhere between a surreal nightmare, a daydream, and everyday reality. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for something different and you appreciate the craft of writing, it might be just right for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"I've read a lot of books in the line of city/street type fiction and Dexter has it down cold on the likes of Richard Price and even Pellecanos. It's a very lived in book and a very funny book and every single character is eerily believable. I can't understand why this book doesn't have more reviews.

I guess they can understand the simplistic \\"teenager-in-love\\" noodlings of our Ms. Keys more than the wry, ironic, world-wise songs India offers. Or is it the difference between Alicia's piano-based music (does that make it \\"classy\\" somehow? Besides, she's not THAT great a pianist) and India's guitar-based soul?I defy anyone who loves soul music to listen to this CD and not fall in love with her smoky voice. I melted the first time I heard her. This is a stunning set from a powerful talent, and she will be with us for a very, very long time, I hope. BRAVA, INDIA.ARIE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammy Nominations for THIS?","review":"Short Review: After listening to this CD, I have lost faith in the Grammy Awards.

I am very angry that I spent the last bit of my bday money on it. All the songs are really slow with this annoying drum in the background bum, bum, bum, bum. Then she comes wailing in with her terrible voice. The only thing I liked about it was the song \\"Video\\" and the guitar which is excellent, but sadly hidden under her wailing vocals. It literally put me to sleep the first time I popped it in. I was HIGHLY dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY LISTENED 2 VIDEO","review":"yep, its official I LOVE video. only gd song on da album. i mean, she has gd voice but alicia keys & lauryn hill r WAY betta than her. glad she missed out on the 7 grammies she was up 4 in 2002"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate india. arie","review":"i hate this cd. her voice sounds like stinking bees! thru the whole thing she's all: um aa ummm, it makes me want to puke. i don't see why everyone likes her so much. she is very strange. i'm not trying to be mean, i'm trying to save you from buying this trash. india, do you think i am a fool? well i hope not. anyway, this cd is bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Record!","review":"How refreshing to listen to this record. India sings with a heart and Soul that takes me back to another time.She reminds me of this record that came out years ago called Womanchild by Bemshi but updated for today. India keeps it real and like Jill Scott, Maceo Parker and Rodney Jones, \\"Soul Manifesto\\" cd is keeping the heart and soul in the music! Acoustic Soul is a must buy is you love Soul music. I bet her next record will be even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FRESH AND ENJOYABLE","review":"ACOUSTIC SOUL introduces a new singer with a fresh voice and a fresh prospective. Her voice is rich and clean enough not to need all the musical override and remix that have come to be acceptable in the popular music business. In addition to clear and melodious pipes, India Arie sings the songs that today's woman should hear. The tune, VIDEO, clears says that she doesn't look like the girls in the music video. But more importantly, it says she's happy that she doesn't. The songs show a high level of self-acceptance and self-celebration. Her rendition of BROWN SKIN offers a kind of sensuality that makes you want to play that track over and over. Then she gives gratitude and tribute to the musicians from which she has gathered her style.This CD offers active dance music and tremendous mood music. It's truly well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essence of a Woman","review":"India Arie speaks from the heart of all woman. Video is a message that was needed to be told. Her words are true poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing debut from this neo-soultress","review":"While India.Arie does deliver \\"acoustic soul\\" as the title of the album promises, this cd falls short of delivering the complex and unique sounds of other \\"neo-soul\\" artists such as Jill Scott or Erykah Badu. India.Arie has a sultry and beautiful voice, and it is apparent that she is a strong black woman deeply proud of her spiritual and ancestral roots. However, sometimes her lyrics come across as more preachy than proud. I also thought that her lyrics were trite and over simplified. There is more to songwriting than making sure the words rhyme. The first three tracks after the Intro, \\"Video\\", \\"Promises\\", and \\"Brown Skin\\" are the strongest tracks on the cd. But as I continued to listen, my excitement dwindled. Ms. Arie is a talented young woman, but she needs to work on her songwritting skills, and perhaps find stronger production. I believe her sophomore effort will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another word from Blighty - If you like Jill Scott....","review":"Judging by the Album cover I thought it was going to be along the lines or Ladysmith Black Mam... whoever! I was watching MTV and saw \\"Video\\", totally swayed me, this album is a must, very similar to Jill Scott in terms of, put it on, sit back and enjoy the ease of listening... very calming & soothing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, Bright Future","review":"For weeks, I had been listening to \\"Video\\" on the radio. The song was one that I felt that I could relate to. A couple of weeks ago, I heard an interview with India.Arie on NPR. They played some cuts off her CD and I fell in love. I immediately ran out to get it. I have truly enjoyed the entire CD. The first few tracks remind me of Tracy Chapman. I have played it so that one of my coworkers went out to buy a copy for himself. I look forward to hear what she will give us next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous stuff.","review":"I also listened to the interview with Arie on NPR - thought \\"Video\\" was really refreshing. Having spun through it a number of times now, the song that keeps me hittin' 'replay' is \\"Ready for Love\\" - strong writing, music keeps pulling at you like an undertow, builds to a crash. My favorite lines so far:\\"Lately I've been thinkin' maybe you're not ready for me Maybe you think I need to learn maturity They say watch what you ask for, 'cuz you might receive...\\"The couple of songs where she lists her musical inspirations/ancestors got annoying on multiple plays. But a gorgeous CD, reminds me of Des'ree's first offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the soul","review":"This definitely a \\"must-have\\". If you liked the \\"Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\", you will like \\"Acoustic Soul.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a tremendous step for music","review":"Her music is unique, mellow and smooth. Her songs sound like something heard in upscale coffeehouses catering to educated business folk. Her first single, the highly acclaimed \\"Video,\\" is the epitome of radio candy without being the fluff that happened to be popular in early 2001 when it was released (Britney Spears and the boy bands instantly may come to mind). India Arie is her name and she's about as soulful and introspective as anyone can be. Her music reflects everyday situations and real life. Sure, not all of this CD soars as much as the aforementioned \\"Video,\\" \\"Brown Skin\\" and \\"Promises\\" do, and that's sad because it's doubtful anything else other than that instant first single received airplay; but this talented singer-songwriter's debut Acoustic Soul is still brilliant, soothing as a first sip of coffee and as delightful as taking that first swallow and feeling the warmth down your esophagus."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can feel you India","review":"Ok. I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5 just because I'm not a liberal when it comes to giving out the twinkles. But I must say that this is a pretty good album. India is more than a singer she's also an artist. Unlike many of albums I was able to listen to this album in it's entirety. My favorite songs on this album are Video, Back to the middle, and Nature. I like Video because she seems to be a girl after my own heart. I like Come back to the middle because it focuses on balance (It's as important to have a balanced mind as it is a balanced meal). And last but not least I love Nature because it's great advice for those entering into relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good debut","review":"from a talented young lady. This is one of the best soul albums of the last few years. Her voice is really smoothing and she's a good lyricist. It's a great feel-good record, she seems like such a positive and sweet girl. Everytime I'm feeling down this is one of the best albums to put on to make me will better. \\"Video\\", \\"Strenght, courage and Wisdom\\", and the others always put a smile on my face. Another really well-made song is \\"Ready for love\\". The cd has it highs and lows,but overall it's a made-well album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Cd!","review":"This Cd is awesome.

I drew a pencil picture of India and it was praised by everyone I know.This girl has wonderful vocals, perfectly matched with her soulful R&B songs. My favorites on the album are obviously 'Video', that's my song!, 'Promises' is absolutely fabulous, and of course, 'Brown Skin' is sultry and very beautiful.The only track that's a little...unmusical(?) would be 1., which is an intro describing a list of 'in-remembrance' African American artists. It would be better written than sang, for sometimes it's a bit hard to incorporate names into a song."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"India Arie - She is an awesome songstress. I am impatiently awaiting her next album. Found it very strange that she didnt get aGrammy. She was on Jay Leno two nites ago and she was just simply the best! Sometimes you have great artists and they just never get their due. Not to worry India, just continue to do the great work!Stella"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music, So So album","review":"India's intentions are appreciated but I think that she misses the mark. The music is very good but the lyrics are a little too simple to be profound. A good departure from the current state of R&B which lacks substance and creativity, but not enough to make me play over and over like \\"Mama's Gun\\". All the songs are anti-climactic, and no one stands out above the rest, but India's calming voice makes you listen 'til the end. Sophmore effort will probably be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"India Arie","review":"I saw her perform on a morning show, Regis, I believe, and she was great! She did her signature song, India Arie. Unfortunately, for the CD, this was the best song. I guess I thought from seeing her live that she was in a more \\"universal\\" mode - meaning, strength in herself, being herself (built from heritage, but transpiring it). From one poet to another, I was really excited that she wrote her own songs. That counts for a lot! However, my excitement was followed by big disappointment in that there were no printed words. What's up with sharing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Beautiful","review":"\\"Acoustic Soul\\" is one of my all-time favorite CDs, and I have over two hundred in my collection. It's hardly left my CD player since I bought it. India.Arie has an incredible amount of talent; she is a lovely singer, and has a steady touch on the guitar. Her lyrics are refreshingly honest and introspective; there is nothing of the vapid music dominating radio stations on this album. Every song is solid, with great hooks and lovely melodies. I enjoy singing along to every one (how often can you say that?). I listen to \\"Acoustic Soul\\" during any mood: when I'm feeling thoughtful, it's a quiet accompaniment; when I'm angry or stressed, it's calming; during happy times, it bounces along cheerily with me. I really can't say enough good things about this album. India.Arie is a great addition to the music community; I look forward to her next offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was floored when I heard this CD!","review":"I'm glad that there's something positive, truthful, fresh, and sexy that I can listen too. Erykah's hypnotic anguish has to take a back seat to India's soulfully honest renditions of life and love (of self). The beats are lush and flavorful and the lyrics are right on. If you don't have it then go get it. If you have it then buy one for a friend. We need to promote the positive and refute the negative. I pray that India (and the like) stay around for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"underhyped","review":"by which i mean to say, this album is mindblowing, and you should get it now! the entire album is a such a refreshing change from the same-ol' stale r+b music out there. it's fresh -- it rings with her beautiful guitar playing instead of being laden with samples from countless other songs; it's beautiful -- her voice is one of the most gifted out there today -- rich, deep, and smooth, with such a range (unlike alicia keys' voice, which sounds tinny and shallow in comparison); her lyrics are inspiring, uplifting, joy-inducing; and the grooves, which make me bounce around in my seat when i'm listening to this album at work, are just SO GOOD! (esp. on brown skin. that is my fave, groove-wise). so GET THIS ALBUM! and forget about alicia keys. what an overhyped disappointment she was. i only wish that india.arie played piano; i'm still hoping for an r+b woman piano player to come along and knock my socks off, like fiona apple but a little more soul-tinged."},{"rating":"2","title":"India.Arie is like fresh air","review":"She is a breath of fresh air when the worl;d of R & B needs it most. With all the fake groups like Destiny's child and the other man haters India Arie has made an album that deserves all the acclaim that it has recieved. Her voice is so soulful it makes me shudder to hear it cause it is so good. The songs are all well written and produced. India Arie is here and is not going anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing else to be said.....","review":"Soul touching music.... the sista takes you on a calming thought provoking smooth ride....a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Soul","review":"I really enjoy her music and find myself listening to this CD quite a bit.

Sadly I have to say that the cover of the album stands out, but the music not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul? Where?!","review":"I really looked forward to listening to \\"Acoustic Soul.\\" India has a great voice, and I believe that with some assistance with lyrics, and a new producer, she can be a moderately successful entertainer. But this album was a letdown. I thought that maybe it would grow on me, but \\"Strength, Courage and Wisdom,\\" seemed strained and made me lose patience. \\"Brown Skin\\" is beautiful, and I hope the song gets play, its the one standout on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Dissapointment","review":"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this album...god after reading all the great reviews I wanted to LOVE it. \\"Video\\" is really, really good. \\"Brown Skin\\" is fairly adequate, and \\"Ready for Love\\" is pretty. But the rest of the songs really lack the catchy vibe, and upbeat tempo that I love. If you like slow songs, and guitar playing-which she is excellent at, than try this album, but if you love Lauryn Hill, stay away. The two can't even be compared. They are both so talented, but in totally different ways. \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" will forever be my favorite cd. India.Arie is incredibly talented, but it's just not my thing, and I totally wasn't feeling her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop the Acoustic Guitar \\\\ and learn to play the guitar","review":"There are a few songs I like, but seriously drop the tired ass riff playing guitar...get a better production, her lyrics are descent, a little too much preaching, but OK...I couldn't listen to the whole CD, sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but...","review":"Liked the song I heard on \\"Oprah\\" (Video), but just didn't hear what Stevie heard in the rest of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant surprise","review":"I had heard about India.Arie for awhile, but was not familiar with her music at all.

The hook for me was when she sang \\"Ready For Love\\" as an encore...the album version is just as good. Try to listen to this album without experiencing chills several times. I'm not going to dissect the various songs, as I have only listened to this about 3 times. Read the other reviews and you'll see that this is definitely an artist to explore and watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BOMBDIGGITY!!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is awesome!!!! It is a must have for everyone's CD collection. I like all of the songs on this CD, especially \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Brown Skin\\", \\"NAture\\" and \\"Always In My Head\\". Practically every song has a message which you don't usually find in today's music. When I first heard \\"Video\\" on the radio I loved the song. But I am always hesitant to buy a CD without hearing at least two songs first. This was not the case for Miss India. Arie! I do not regret this purchase, it was so worth the wait.

I hope she releases another CD soon.....before I wear this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Sade!","review":"I caught the Sade concert last night (fantastic show). Opening for that amazing lady was India Arie, a performer I had never even heard of. Thank you, Sade, for turning me on to one of the most heartfelt singer/songwriters I have heard in some time. I bought India's CD at the show and have been listening to it non-stop for 24 hours. Despite my relative naivete, I am blown away by the mix of groove, peace, and emotion the blend of vocals and strings on this CD has. Shades of Jill Scott, Sade, Dionne Farris, Me'Shell Ndegeocello, and even Lauren Hill ring through this sound. I think this lady will be around for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, simply exquisite","review":"Pure satisfaction guaranteed. India Arie is a very talented young lady. Her songs appeal to your soul. It is tasteful and full of meaningful verses. It is my type of music. If you like, Sade, Jill Scott, you will dig India. Brown skin, Video and Promises are my favorite songs. My 5-year old daughter loves the song video and said that she was glad it did not have any bad words. This is music the family can enjoy. It is nice to listen to music that is appealing to everyone who comes in contact with it. My husband said he even liked it!!!! Go buy and help the sister reach the top!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Musical Gem","review":"It's about time that more and more people discover the musical creations of India.Arie. Michael Mann incorporated one of her songs, 'Ready for Love', in his stylish '06 Miami Vice motion picture.By listening to each song you can tell that a lot of work and art went into its creation. India Arie is not just another pretty voice, but instead there's much more to her as the whole CD has a lot of substance and she puts true soul into each song.Her sultry voice soothes while she tells a story. Also the instrumentation is very well arranged with taste and applications in all the right places. This CD is a rare musical gem from an artist who comes across as believable and as someone who loves to do what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is amazing.","review":"I have to agree with everyone else that this is a mind-shattering CD!

Listen to the samples and you will be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADVANCE COPY","review":"This CD is brilliant. I had the glory of having the CD 2 months before it came out.

What a pleasure it is to be carried away by her fresh soulful voice.India Arie - we look forward to your next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD! Just Press Play!","review":"I love this CD, she is a great singer, song writer, and musician! The songs have great lyrics with deep meaning, the beats are all good, and the feel of this CD is one that makes me smile and wanna dance! She's very positive and smooth! I'd highly recommend getting this CD if you like even 1 of her songs! The whole CD is good in my opinion, and that is hard to find today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good girls can win (or at least get nominated)!","review":"I liked almost every song off this album. Arie's stylish and polished debut proved that she will be one of the many that will outlast the Britneys and Pinks. Her voice, a combination of Nina Simone, Tracy Chapman, and Lauryn Hill, melts over you and leaves you feeling oh-so-high. I know it's not the same thing, but I'd put this up there with Erykah Badu's debut album as far as sophistication and songwriting. Try \\"Back to the Middle\\" and \\"Promises.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Alicia Keys!","review":"I think it's outrageous that Alicia Keys managed to win 5 grammy awards, and India Arie won none! Arie's album is much, much much stronger with constant cool laid back vibes!She has a soulful voice, which reminds me of some classic Motown artists. The song's have more depth and strength than Keys', BUY THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Soul of a True Artist","review":"I have to say that I was really disappointed with the turnout of events from the Grammy's. How could talent like Ms. Arie's not be given it's due credit? This is a CD that can be enjoyed from beginning to end and you really feel the spirit of the artist, not like other artists' trying to fit in someone else's mold. India Arie truly changed the way I view musical talent with the soulful stringing of her guitar. \\"Video\\" was given the most credit from the album, but songs like \\"Ready for Love\\" and \\"Back to the Middle\\" are the best songs on the CD. Though Ms. Keys' debut \\"Fallin\\" and \\"A Woman's Worth\\" were very good songs, these didn't beat the acoustic guitar of India. In my book, she is still a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt and Personal","review":"Only after listening to India Arie's second CD, Voyage to India, that I finally realize how good Acoustic Soul is. While very good, Voyage isn't quite up there with Acoustic Soul. Simple, catchy, and honest, there isn't an uncomfortable note nor a corny word in Acoustic Soul. I guarantee that you will listen to this whole CD without skipping one song. Video, Simple, and Part of My Life will have you humming along with their catchy beats, while Back in the Middle, Ready for Love and Beautiful are honest and well, beautiful. But above all, the one song that separates India Arie from the rest is Brown Skin, which is original lyrically and brilliant musically. Acoustic Soul is undoubtedly one of my favorite CDs of all time and my only advice to you is to buy this CD and give it sometime to grow on you. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd! On a whole different level!","review":"This is a great cd.She deserves the same respect as jill scott and eyrkah badu.Brown skin is a beautiful song, and I hope she releashes it as a single.The songs are from a spritual base and for that reason some people may find it boring,(because it's not like that crap that is played on r&b radio.)but boring it is not.A very uplifting and funky cd that should be checked out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One ...","review":"India is truely a breath of fresh air.

Need I say more?","review":"I was compelled to express my gratitude to the music industry and it's critics, for their acknowledgement of this profound ARTIST. India's talent and creativity DESERVE the upmost recognition. Primarily, because she refuses to compromise for the sake of record sales, or a shallow image. \\"Video\\" speaks for itself, and is a reflection of India's personal journey. While listening to the captivating \\"Ready For Love\\", one is brought to to the realization, that a position in the \\"Album of the Year\\" category, is not displaced. Concrete, confident and inspiring, \\"Acoustic Soul\\" is a \\"DIAMOND IN THE RUFF\\" and worth every listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I am into many different genres of music, but I have noticed lately alot of less-than-stellar female vocalists (ex. nelly furtado).

This is a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a breathe of \\"soulful air\\"","review":"Hearing humming and a guitar as an intro is going to catch your attention and seeing \\"Video\\" will glue you to the television. Here we have a \\"sister\\" letting us know its alright to be \\"natural\\". Arie has a true story to tell in each song and each track has its own identity demanding us to listen to and feel it. Arie gives much respect to those who paved the way before her and allows us to relate with many of them through her \\"soulful\\" sound. You won't be able to focus on just the lyrics, whether its the mellow sound of the guitar and vocals or the strong backbeats, Arie is going to grab you somehow. Although i know her cd will encourage \\"all\\" women to think positve, her cd will have great influence on African-american women to teach us to love and repect ourselves and our \\"BROWNSKIN\\". porsha ... a soulful fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Soul Angel","review":"I - IntactN - NotableD - DynamicI - IntactA - AliveA - Amour propreI - IntactR - RelaxingE - EnergizingWhat more can I say."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a god CD","review":"Always searching for just that right song, and you will find it on this CD, full of emotions, that middle of the road whine down and exhale music.

I must say that it is well written but sometimes the author (who himself led the operation) makes superfluous claims about the circumstances existing at that time.

Illogical, arrogant, proselytizing ramblings! I want my time and my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intellectual diversion","review":"I will not dupe you into thinking that B.F. Skinner is a master novelist, and that is the only reason I docked B.F. one star. However there are so many interesting ideas in here that you really need to read it if you would like a book that is enjoyable, but also leaves you with something to think about for months after you've read it. Whether you agree or not, you should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating blueprint for utopian society","review":"If you're interested in psychology and/or sociology at all, you'll enjoy this book. Skinner has some unique insights about communal living. This book will make you think about how society works. Pretty good read, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent institution of modern behavioral engineering","review":"An experminetal community that is on the border of morality and immorality. It questions whether or not behavioral engineering limits or adds to the freedom of the inhabitants of Walden Two. The many theories and problems (and the solutions) of the nature and behavior of humans are used to shape the community."},{"rating":"1","title":"a tragic disappointment","review":"What could have been an extroardinarly clever, engaging text is an inch-thick preaching of the merits of behavioralism, bashing Freudian theory as worthless. As a student of psychology, I have studied many many different fields and theories and though I would not consider myself an exclusive behavioralist, it is apparent that many of the tactics of behavioralism are valid, effective conditioning techniques. This book presents such techniques with repetition and monotony, pointless characters, and no plot. It is an inane textbook, conditioning the reader to unconditionally accept behavioralism as an authority, treating the reader as if he were a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely challenging ideas, but no strong foundation","review":"I read Walden Two as part of a class assignment, studying the effects of secular humanism and other worldviews on this world. The book itself is full of extremely challenging in its ideas. It raises many points that can have a person strong in their faith even take these ideas and ponder them. What if it really could work? Skinner does a good job presenting his ideas, but he has no basis or foundation for which to rest them on. The inconsistancies of his thoughts stand out more than the characters themselves. If Skinner is hailed as an exceptional psychologist, why then can ten high school juniors take every one of his ideas and prove why they can't work? Also, these juniors can take his ideas, match them up with the worldview that applies (Naturalism), and predict where, why, and how his plans will fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behaviorism Give Us A Way To Achieve Humansitic Goals","review":"Everything B.F. Skinner did was to give us an understanding of how to improve the human condition. The science of human behavior has eliminated criiminal behavior, improved education and self confidence, has perpetuated moral behavior, has perpetuated personal responsibility, eliminated obsessive behavior, cured autism, etc... and has given us understanding to solve every human problem. He was named humanist of the year in 1972. Walden Two isn't scary. Walden Two is thrilling. It shows that scientific advancement is not only preferrable to the lottery system we have in place now, it is necessary. Read this book as an anti-dote to the hateful ignorant propaganda spewed endlessly by Brave New World, Ayn Rand, Noam Chomsky, etc... Hopefully you will enjoy learning real possiblities that would allow for a better life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, with boring characters and no plot.","review":"Walden Two is a book that could have been great but suffers from one flaw: it's boring!! The book reads like a lecture with occasional debate. Skinner definately intrigues me with his thoughts on behavioral engineering, and the concept of a utopian society in the midst of present day society is very intriguing. However, there is basically no plot and very little character development in this book and thus it suffers. 1984 doesn't read like a blue print discussing the society instead it's a story about Winston and Julia through which we learn about the society. I wish Walden Two was less of lecture and more of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Worth Reading","review":"If you're a thinking person, read _Walden Two_. When I first picked it up, I expected a boring piece of behaviorist propaganda by a stuffy man in a lab coat. I was wrong. In the end, the book is about where humanity is vs. where we might like to be--and, most importantly, how to get there. Whatever you think of Skinner's answers, his book is worth reading for the questions alone. (Note--the criticism that _WT_ isn't much of a philosophic novel along the lines of _1984_ is correct; it much more reminds me of a Platonic dialogue. Not a bad thing, if you ask me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a wonderful CD by a wonderful new artist. What inspiration.

I loved her sound so much that I checked it out on Amazon & discovered that she was in fact a \\"Christian\\" artist. Normally, I'm not a fan of Christian music, even though I am, in fact a Christian, but most of what I've heard in the past have been groups that hit you over the head with messages and have a very cheap sound to them. But this CD is contrary to what I've been exposed to in the past... it's beautiful, and the message is delivered sweetly and thoughtfully... with respect given to not only God, but her listeners as well. If I were to sum her up, I'd personally describe her as the \\"Christian Jonatha Brooke\\". Not a bad thing at all, considering Jonatha is my favorite female songwriter/singer.

I heard some of the track a week before it was released and every track they had played I liked. This cd is a little old school and a little new school but if you are a Carl Thomas fan you will like it. The first track \\"Let's Talk About It\\" reminds you of a Marvin Gaye sound,\\"She Is featuring LLCoolJ is more of a Stepper's song if you are from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and the list goes on.

Summer rain instantly made me a fan and I've been waiting for some new stuff from him. The wait was well worth it. I'm starting out with the aucoustic guitar and the guitar in \\"My love\\" really caught my attention and has me wanting to cop the chords for that piece so that maybe I can learn to play that. Also, the inspiration in \\"Dreamer\\" is something that speaks to me as my dreams are seeming unattainable right now. It really soothed my soul when I heard that song. The thing that sealed the deal as a good album for me was the sultry sounds of \\"Make it Alright\\". I love the whole vibe and feel of the music on this song.

Like other sophomore efforts, one may expect \\"Let's Talk About It\\" to be \\"Emotional Pt 2\\". Although it's not quite the case, Carl still offers real flavor with music that makes buying CD's worthwhile. The best tracks are: the U2 inspired \\"Let Me Know\\", the old school \\"The Baby Maker\\" and \\"But Me\\". Who can forget Malik Yusef? Well, he reappears with \\"Know It's Alright\\", which should have been a full track in my opinion.

The first single, \\"She Is\\", a tired Surface sample that R.Kelly have already used on his \\"R\\" album, was a flop, and \\"Make It Alright\\" is struggling on the charts as well. Need I say more?

If you're a true believer and want somebody to tell you what you already think, then enjoy. I couldn't get much past the second chapter, when the book rambeled on with baseless accusations and an assortment of silly baseless suggestions. Complete and utter garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper its printed on!","review":"Quite possibly the worst book ever written. Starting with the prologue where Oliver North blames everything but natural disasters on liberals to the main body of the book that reinforces the notion that generals should really stick to military matters and leave issues of a political and diplomatic nature to the politicians. Truly poor selection...I'm glad McInerney is in no position to make the decisions he advocates in the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Starting with the forward by Col. North this book holds your attention. The Generals' book is well written and gives a clear, concise picture of the War on Terror and what our response needs to be in order to be victorious. We need to realize that we are fighting for our civilization and our way of life and we need to stand together to defeat the terrorists. This book is a must read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clear Vision of the Threat We Face","review":"Generals McInerney and Vallely articulate a clear vision of the global terrorism we currently face and present a well-crafted road map for America to defeat the threat. The authors bring decades of military and global security experiences to address a thorny problem - The War on Terror. They address the larger issue of the clash of cultures in a way everyone can understand. The lessons learned from September 11 are slowly fading from the memories of many of our elected officials. We, the people, have to hold their feet to the fire to pass effective legislation that enhances our national security. This author strongly recommends that all concerned Americans read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great truths found in this book rarely found in other books even partially about Saddam Hussein","review":"Like the part about also terrorist Gaddafi (Khadafi) of Libya quitting his nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam Hussein fall to US forces in 2003 and Gaddafi feared he (Gaddafi) may have have been taken down next.

It is a well written, quick read, that makes you proud of our military efforts overseas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but meandering","review":"The subject of Ms. Thomas' book, her decades at the White House, assures that this book will be interesting. I was, however, disappointed at the lack of organization; the book reads like a conversation with a person who keeps remembering things to throw in and that can be inordinately distracting. There are also a number of factual errors in the book, which I would have thought a careful editor would have found and corrected. I have read a great many books written by reporters (Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, David Brinkley, Lesley Stahl, Sam Donaldson, Charles Kuralt) and this was the only time I found myself distracted by the lack of organization of the writing. In the end, I found the book interesting, but not well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight-forward and insightful","review":"As a big fan of Helen Thomas, I could hardly wait for this book to be published. My only regret is that she left so many telling details out. Of course, if she had included all that she had learned while covering eight presidents, the book would have been to heavy to even pick up. I loved this book and it should be required reading in every college communications course in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"What an interesting lady she is..I really enjoyed this book. I am Australian and I found her story fascinating.I can only imagine that for anyone in America, it would be even better. It is good in the sense of reading it and I kept thinking, you think you know someone and then there is a lovely surprise at the end.Boy, she has guts!!! good on her I say."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mr. President?\\"","review":"If you've ever wondered about the woman who for years asked the first question at presidential news conferences and also ended each one, then this memoir will be entertaining. Thomas had a long career and got to know every president since JFK pretty well, or so you'd think from this book which is chock full of interesting anecdotes and opinions. It is a bit repetitious and would have benefited mightily from tighter editing. One wonders if the publisher was a little too reverential to use the red pencil. Somewhere along the line, UPI, her employer, lost a lot of its power and impact, due to business turmoil. Still, Thomas soldiered on. She doesn't say much about UPI in the memoir, probably because she's still working, though for Hearst. If you follow the journalism biz, you'll want to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The front row at the White House has a price.","review":"I was disappointed that Helen Thomas managed to pen no less than 3 times in her book that former deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster had committed \\"suicide.\\" Last October I had dinner with Helen Thomas at the National Press Club and handed her a copy of the addendum that was attached by the court to Ken Starr's report on Foster. The addendum was submitted by Patrick Knowlton the harassed and intimidated witness who is suing FBI agents and others for violating his civil rights. Helen Thomas remarked at the time, \\"this should be reported to the public.\\" To this date not one member of the American press, including Helen Thomas has told the truth about the death of Vincent Foster and Patrick Knowlton's story is noticeably absent from her book.It would appear to sit in the front row at the White House as long as Helen Thomas you have to keep your mouth shut. This what we call award winning journalism? Her book was very disappointing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everthing you didn't want to know about Helen and very little about anything else","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book but was sadly very disappointed. Helen Thomas takes great pains not to rock the boat. She is in a position to make intelligent insider analysises, but she chooses instead to sit on the fence. She seems tickled pink that various presidents noticed her! And her birthday!!!! Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Thomas confirms how the media is stuck on themselves.","review":"On page 139, Ms. Thomas chides former President Johnson for giving the Pop a \\"twelve-inch bust of himself\\" when the Pope gave Johnson \\"a fourteenth-century painting.\\" I was looking for a fourteenth century painting in this book, but all I got was a twelve-inch bust of a self-absorbed (self-described) journalist. The Beltway has consumed another media-type. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a day","review":"I never really enjoyed her work and this did nothing to change my opinion. Just another annoying liberal with a mediocre book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively Reading","review":"This book was a great read! As a long time UPI correspondent on the political stage, Helen Thomas has some stories to tell and she tells them well, in a positive and upbeat way. Yes, there was some 'jumping around' in the book - the events and antedotes Helen Thomas describes aren't written up in strict chronological order - but she can certainly turn an apt phrase and does so often in this book. I thought she portrayed the events and people in her life in a mature, insightful and entertaining way, without petty or grumbling judgements. She's upfront and proud of being a hard-eyed reporter out to get the facts - but notes in her book that quite a few of those individuals who fall under her scrutiny don't hold it against her. After reading this book, you'll know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing string of ancedotes without insights","review":"One would think that after having been a reporter for decades, Ms. Thomas would be able to write. One would be wrong. She apparently doesn't know what the word \\"ironically\\" means, nor the word \\"quipped.\\" She repeats ancedotes several times, even ones that weren't that great to begin with. She quotes presidents and first ladies complaining about the press, without seeming to realize that their arguments are often much stronger than her lame \\"freedom of the press\\" argument. Does the public REALLY need to know about Caroline Kennedy''s dead hamster? Does it REALLY matter what reporter called in a story seconds earlier than a competitor? And do we REALLY need to know about every award she ever won, every compliment she was ever paid? This book might have been much better if Ms. Thomas had retired first, and thought about her life's work with some perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gossipy and self-promoting; devoid of analytic insight","review":"I found this disappointing, having hoped for genuine insight into the role and experience of the press and the White House. Instead it is crammed with random and often pointless anecdotes, in which the author's purpose seems more to assure the reader that her colleagues and those she covered valued her and paid attention to her. She portrays herself as a tough questionner, but this book can only make one wonder how effective a journalist she really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live up to the Corona name","review":"I bought this ratcheting lopper expecting it to perform well given the Corona brand name, but it's a disappointment. The problem is that the ratcheting mechanism frequently does not kick in. I have used other larger ratcheting loppers before and even the cheap ones work better than this mini one. Here is what it does: The lopper makes a bite into a very thick branch and it doesn't have enough leverage to make the cut all the way through. This is perfectly normal for a ratcheting lopper. What is not normal is that when I open the lopper handles again, the ratchet frequently does not advance to the next step. The result is the leverage does not increase as it should and the lopper just gets stuck on a branch that it can't cut through. Sometimes it works, but often it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rip off","review":"What a rip off, there is barely anything in these tiny vitamins! save your money, I can't believe I spent 20$ for nothing.

It seemed like a really good product that provided a natural alternative to offer some relief for my dad's failing eyesight.

I would think that when someone gives Mr. Hawthorne due opportunity they will see the beauty and preciseness of his work. If you have not had the opportunity to read short stories that symbolize so much more than what lay in the contents of each story, I encourage you to delve into Twice Told Tales. Here you will discover a variety of work that taps into so many cavities of your psyche, not to mention discovering the experiences of a man who was obviously driven by man's seemingly natural inclination toward guilt and sin. Yes, there is a darkness and sadness to much of his work, but it is not morose or macabre like Poe. With Hawthorne humanity is in many ways, stripped away and we see, like in the \\"Minister's Black Veil\\", that we all hide behind a veil."},{"rating":"1","title":"This audiocassette is NOT an unabridged version","review":"On the Amazon page the Twice Told Tales audiocassette is called UNABRIDGED in capital letters (twice!), and the review states that Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales in book form contains 39 stories. Unfortunately, the Twice Told Tales audiocassette only includes ten stories on four cassettes. This is clearly NOT an unabridged recording of Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Life","review":"Is the saddest person the one who gets his deepest desire and finds it to be empty? JD craved an audience, and in the end, it cost him two wives. This is a sad book about an empty man who tried to fill his emptiness with drugs, booze, other woman, and about every weird cult that has every come down the bend. His shallowness is surprising. How ironic that a man marketed as such an all American boy was anything but."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"A great book if you want to fully understand the music and songs ofthis great artist.

May he rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Me Home : An Autobiography, John Denver","review":"I got this book for my mother. I could not find it anywhere. My mother likes all of John Denver's songs and when she was in the hospital and sick, she wanted to listen to John Denver. So I got her his autobiography, found it on Amazon. She has thoroughly enjoyed the book. She wanted to know more how he came up with the type songs he sings and his background. Good book for anyone wanting to know about John Denver and his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Keeper!","review":"If you are a fan of John Denver's music, this is the best CD that he ever made! The audio-book is read by John Denver. It is very interesting to hear John talk about how \\"Annie's Song\\" was created while riding on a chairlift; how Bill and Taffy Danoff worked together with John making \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\", and how his long estangement from his Father was finally bridged with flying lessons. John talks about life on the road and the problems that he and Annie could never settle. He doesn't make excuses for his divorce from Annie or the chainsaw incident at his home in Colorado. John Denver just tells it like it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the foundation of modern bullying prevention!","review":"This clear, brief, and practical book is based on extensive research and outlines an intervention to prevent bullying. Dr. Olweus's work has become the standard approach to bullying prevention, reflected in such programs as the University of Colorado \\"Blueprints for Violence Prevention\\" project ... As a counselor and trainer specializing in bullying prevention, I find this book indispensable, and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER","review":"Don't usually read screenplays but I saw the movie so many times (Susan Sarandon is my favorite actress, I like Harvey Keitel too) that I could picture it as I went along. A few scenes were changed in the movie but not many. The dialogue is laugh out loud funny. Darryl, Thelma's husband, is such a jerk, just as portrayed in the film version. Most of the characters are faithful to the screenplay. I love the symbolic ending-two women flying off...and leaving it all behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it what it said it was.","review":"I believe the claims to fit both a side post and top post battery are very misleading and inaccurate. Since I live out in the country, I bought this thinking I could install it without additional parts. As well, the fused link defeats the purpose of a battery disconnect. When I tried to install this on a side post battery there are in sufficient parts to complete the installation. There is no way to connect the cable to the other end of the switch. To use this I had to travel to town (I live 50 miles from town) and get nuts and bolts ($2.20) to get it to work. I you install the fused link, then you still get battery drain from the on-board electronics and within a short week (at least in a GMC pickup) the battery is dead. I do NOT recommend the purchase of this switch for a side post battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pain to install, not designed for normal battery cables","review":"It should be simple, disconnect old cable,put this on, and reattach cable.However, the terminal post for the cable is too small for normal battery cables. No amount of tighting the cable bolt will firm it up for a decent connection.I've tried two different kinds of these to install on two different cars, and both have the same problem.Now, I'm out to find some soft copper sheeting to make up for the difference.The switch itself seems quite solid and simple to use.

No mention on the places to see a show or what to see. Also, I have never had a travel guide that didn't mention ANYTHING about the train station in the city!! This book did not even have one piece of info on the train stations or how to find them, how to travel from other cities to Prague or how to get to other places from Prague. We had planned to go to Vienna from Prague and had no idea where the train station was, how to get to it, or how to find a train schedule. Thankfully our hotel was able to fill us in on this info.

The baby moves with the impact, and with this headrest, the child is separated from the seat, resulting in a higher rate of injuries, including those to the neck and back. It may seem minimal, but it is significant! Aftermarket producers tell you they are safe, and why wouldn't they? They make money on it! a rolled up receiving blanket placed around an infants head, not behind it, is safe. THIS IS NOT. Who are you going to trust? A sales associate making commission on his sales, or a carseat inspector, trained to potentially save lives of a baby. They do not tell you to remove aftermarket products for their benefit. It is for the safety of the precious cargo depending on you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about using them in car seats...","review":"In my childbirth class, the state car seat technician came in and explained to the class how to properly use infant car seats.

The alternative IS to use rolled up towels or diapers AROUND your baby's head or body. NOT BEHIND. The problem with these headrests is that they add material behind the heads and bodies. This added material increases the distance your baby will travel during a crash. This isn't good. Your car seat wasn't tested with extra material. That's why they aren't recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended by safety experts","review":"These types of items that you buy separate from the car seat and add to it are called \\"aftermarket products\\" and are not recommended. Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians state that these products have not been crash tested and may interfer with the way your car seat was designed to function. Anything that comes with a car seat has been crash tested with the seat. Anything you buy to add to the seat has not. Nothing should go behind the baby or around the harness straps of the car seat. A better alternative to protect floppy newborn heads is to take a thin receiving blanket, roll it up and bend it into an upside-down \\"U\\" shape and place it around the baby's head. It is also crucial that your infant seat is reclined at a 45 degree angle so the baby's head does not flop forward and cut off his/her airway.

I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest. Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat. Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury.

Nothing should be behind baby or between the front of baby and the straps. Some carriers and carseats do have supports included with them.

Calling Dobry a \\"pedophile\\" and a \\"homosexual\\" in a book review? A \\"pedophile\\"?? What book was this guy reading? I don't believe that review was serious. Say what you want about Kingdom Come, but to write a review claiming there is pedophilia in it, I have to wonder if that review itself wasn't written by a mobster, or if the reviewer himself just doesn't have some serious issues he has to deal with.

How can someone write about artistic integrity and living the 'Continental Lifestyle' while nonetheless perpetuating CELEBRITY BOXING? Don't be fooled by the pseudo-artistic posturing.

I've always viewed Mary and Joseph in a non-human way I guess...not that I believe they're deities or super-natural or anyway more \\"important\\" then everyone else...but I didn't think of them going through the same struggles of passion and desire and going through the wonders of falling in love, not have any idea of what was to happen.

These covers are extremely durable. I haven't had any problems with the fabric shrinking or fading. I can't believe they still look new.

I don't personally mind that they fit snugly, b/c it creates almost a little sling above the concave changing pad. However, don't expect plush, thick terry cloth - this fabric is more like a cheap, old Holiday Inn towel. If you hold it up to the light, you can see through it. Consequently, it doesn't contain baby messes as the manufacturer claims. Besides, as soon as your baby messes on it (almost every day for my newborn), you have to launder it and put on a new one. I hate saying it, but the most convenient thing for us has been disposable \\"chucks\\", or underpads, purchased at CVS/Walgreens/Eckerd/Etc.

I recommend the Workbook format because it is an active approach to self-understanding and improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook","review":"I can't express how fortunate I am to have finally found material that can guide me forward in a truly connected way. Written from one Highly Sensitive Person to others, each activity has a personal resonance for those who have struggled to value their sensitivity and find their niche in the world. I hope to have all of Dr. Aron's books in my \\"library\\" one day, to read, re-read and share, yet find \\"The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook\\" especially helpful for those looking for a more hands-on experience of writing down a lifetime of trial and error, and transforming it into renewed hope each day and a much greater sense of self-worth and purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this book.","review":"There were some intelligent points, but a lot of the ideas were rather silly. The reading is also boring. Wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really helpful...","review":"I'm a highly sensitive person, and in today's world, it can be a handicap -- whether at the workplace or in relationships. This book, and it's companion, the Highly Sensitive Person -- validates what you're feeling or what you go through in life as a \\"HSP\\" (or, let's be honest - BPD sufferer) -- but it doesn't give you any real, helpful tools to try to overcome your sensitivity.I would be apt to recommend any type of DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) book, or even books like Byron Katie's \\"Loving What Is\\" or \\"I Need Your Love -- Is That True?\\" over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned helplessness repackaged as coping skills","review":"The highly sensitive person, a creature undefined in this text and rooted nowhere in the realms of psychology or sociology, deserves much better than being pandered to and infantilized. Rather than teach coping mechanisms and skills for interpreting interpersonal communication, Aron's advice encourages narcissistic behavior and serves to convince the reader that they are fundamentally different from others in an undefined way, incapable of functioning on a basic social level, and rudderless without her help.The section on relationships, which advocates arguing by dodging valid questions, should be particularly ignored.I never leave negative reviews on this site, but I feel I should warn prospective buyers. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Champion Irrigation Actuator Rebuild Kit","review":"This is a great product that can be used to renew a sluggish irrigation sprinkler valve actuator. At a low cost, a lot of money can be saved. I bought eight and just finished rebuilding one valve actuator. It works beautifully. The one item of concern is that the new diaphragm is simply a flat piece of rubbery material, instead of having a circular bellow for expansion, as the old one did. This means that the diaphragm may want to stretch as the valve opens. How would this affect the life of the diaphragm? I don't know yet. The only other negative feature is that the kit does not include a bleeder valve screw, an item that commonly gets messed up. Just the O-ring for the bleeder is included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Go Away, It's Time To Play.. Guess The Model Number!!!!!!","review":"Hey, here's a concept.

Bodo has been so interested in St. Francis for so many years that his depth of understanding is thought-provoking and often startling. Every chapter has some dimension of Francis, the contemplative life, and the lessons of Francescan living that are informative to me personally and important to me Spiritually. This is a book that I will re-read a number of times to try to absorb as many of the ideas as my mind will permit. I am most thankful to have discovered this gem written about one of the most important mystics of all history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Yet Profound","review":"When I was directed to the Prayer of St. Francis by a friend, I purchased this book to discover more of the spiritual beliefs that this man lived by. Interwoven into the narrative about the historical aspects of the life of St. Francis of Assisi are the spiritual convictions that led this man away from a life of wealth into a life of service and devotion to God. The chapters are brief, yet they are laden with depth, wisdom and selfless spirituality. I particularly found the chapters on prayer to be intensely profound, helpful and also practical. This book is not written as a \\"how to manual\\" on living a God-centered life. What it does is, it sets St. Francis as a role model, an example of living a spiritual life, and it is up to the reader to discover how to follow through with those examples in their own lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This didn't work for us at all. First, I think there's a good chance that the product I received is broken. The plunger sticks and is very hard to move even a little bit. Once I finally got it to move to put the pill in, it didn't pop the pill out when I depressed the plunger. The second problem is that the tip is the wrong size for two out of three different pills my cat has to take. The largest is to big, and the smallest is too small. One pill fit, but as I mentioned before, once I placed it in the tip, I couldn't get the piller to pop it out (the rod was too short to push the pill out). This item was an epic fail for me, and its now in the trash. I suggest trying another style of pet piller (even though they're more expensive, the right one really can help!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missled!!!!!!","review":"I was expecting a Unicel C-7656 Replacement Filter Cartridge (which replaces the Hayward CX500RE).

It is filled with Bible stories that are written according to the way that a young African lad would sound telling the stories in a mixture of his own language combined with the new language he is just learning, English. Read silently, you will discover immediately that it is pleading to be read aloud. Read it to children or adults, or a mixture thereof. When I discovered this unique book I had great success reading it to a large group of men, women, and children. They were entranced, mesmerized as they listened attentively. The applause at the end of my sharing was tremendous! Discover, too, individual stories in this book which were originally published as picture books.

It is full of typos and garbled sentences that were not in the printed version. Amazon should take responsibility and send out a better edited version to those of us who have purchased this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"The first Linda Howard book I read was All The Queen's Men, and since then I have read almost all of her earlier and later work. She writes sensual stories, erotic, passionate, usually great character development. I was disturbed by this book in many ways that I haven't been in reading some of her other work. This hero is abusive, emotionally and physically to the heroine and that I just cannot abide. Many of her characters from other books are certainly flawed, like most real people are, but this I just couldn't take and I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo disappointing","review":"If this was the first Linda Howard book I ever read, I would not have read another. If forced and abusive sex turns you on, this is the book for you. I read it to the end to give it a chance, but was completely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Howard's usual.....","review":"I love Linda Howard. However, this was the first book I have read where her lead man, Jake, fell short. This book reminded me of a Diana Palmer read, which often includes rough and abusive *heros*. I took issue with the physical abuse, which included slapping a pregnant woman and knocking her over, forcing sexual situations and emotional battering that went on throughout the book. I am a big fan of Cry No More and Kiss Me While I Sleep - this book was not of the same type."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more violence please","review":"I am a avid fan of Linda Howard. As an author she has consistently given me many, many hours of reading pleasure. I'm usually the first to line up to grab her next release, and constantly search for any previous books I have missed before finding her. I can't tell you how many times I have re-read her work. However... I was greatly disappointed and disgusted when reading this book. I DO NOT approve of violence directed toward women, even in fiction. I don't understand how a woman can fall in love with a man who demonstrates violence toward her. I certainly DON'T want to read about it. No more please.. I would not like to waste my money in this way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NASTY!","review":"I love Linda Howard normally, but in this case I would recommend that you steer clear of this book, as it might well turn you off her forever. I would have given it less than one star if I could. To cut a long story short, this book contains scenes of rape and domestic violence, which I found deeply offensive and disturbing - especially since these crimes were committed by the so-called hero! At one point the hero seriously contemplates murdering the heroine in order to gain control of his family ranch. Instead he marries her, and proceeds to make her life misery. I know some women think that, in a historical context, such things are okay, and if that's your opinion, fine. However, most Linda Howard fans love the tenderness and protectiveness displayed by her heroes, and there isn't ANY in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have read better...","review":"I have recently developed a serious crush for Linda Howard books, but this one was rather disappointing. My overall impression was that it all seemed very barbaric. All male characters treat women like possessions and the hero is no different. I refuse to go with the idea that sex, no matter how great, solves all problems and heals all wounds. The tragic events were sad, but very flat, and the book ended without a proper heart-to-heart conversation between the two main characters. Realistic maybe, but not what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG Mistake >_<","review":"I've enjoyed lots of Linda Howard's books, but I must say that there are quite a few that left me disappointed. A common problem being, the hero gets away too easily after treating his lady shabbily. I was thoroughly disgusted by the hero in this book. He actually slapped her so hard, she slammed into the wall!! Gosh.... and he got away with it later, as if it was just a petty quarrel over who's to do the dishes! For a great story, try Son of the Morning or Midnight Rainbow. There are many other great stories from Ms Howard, but I enjoyed these 2 the most! ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was definitely not one of Linda's best","review":"I have read many books of Linda Howard and I must say I was rather disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very exciting book and the romance really sizzles.","review":"I really enjoyed this Howard book. The story moves and the characters crackle with emotion. I had trouble putting it down. The lady in the story is delicate and strong with a backbone to match the hero, who happens to be very much larger in size than she. I love ladies who can meet the challenge of a strong man and make him see the error of his ways. That happens in this book, he is laid low and I applaude her for introducing us to another heroine who will not lie down and be walked over. Bravo Linda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"The temple on the picture is Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, located in Mtskheta, Georgia, and has nothing to do with Armenia.

It is actually more about the late 50's to mid-Sixties US. It had a few nice photos but spent more time on the Moon and Mars Landings and the Cold War than it did on the Space Family Robinson. I was tremendously disappointed. Also, it could have been edited a bit better...many quotes are used as chapter headings and as photo captions and then often in the middle of the text as well! It looks real nice but is not worth the money. The best part of the book was the two-page interviews with most of the actors telling us what they have been up to since the end of the series.

So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which Canon camera made the image. So far, there have been no update patches or upgrades to make the RAW images from my 30D useable by this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it to Corel","review":"to mess up JASC's genius.Paint Shop Pro was a great imaging program until screwed with by Corel. I recommend buying the older JASC versions. This one is a brutal unfriendly mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for the price","review":"This is an amazing program for the money. Almost as good as Photoshop at a fraction of the price. I'm running it on a Windows 8 64 bit system (the Final Preview version) and it is fast and rock solid. No crashes. This program is not 64 bit but runs on a 64 bit system in 32 bit mode.Perfect for beginners with all of its filters and effects. Can auto clean up all kinds of damaged or noisy photos. It has layers with transparency and raster or vector styles. Layers can be merged, and changed position in the queue. Saves to almost any format, imports everything.For $10?Very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transaction","review":"This transaction was excellent. I received what I ordered, in good condition, and speedilyu"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold On Before Purchase","review":"Like other reviewers here, I, too, recommend stopping at version 8. Above that, I've encountered glitches that drive me nuts. For example, with ver.9 and up, I often encounter dialogue boxes telling me my system is short of memory and cannot perform tasks at hand. The 1st time this happened, I had 3.5Gbs system memory. On a new computer, I had 4 GB and still encountered the problem. On my latest system, I have 8 GB system memory and I am still being stopped in my tracks for \\"lack of system memory\\". There are freezes, too, and, as others noted here, PSP X, XI up are painfully slow to work with. I really hated to say goodbye to PSP but it is no longer what it was when JASC owned the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I must admit I am a novice in respect to digital photography but this program is a little too complicated for me (more than I can handle at this point). The cyber-shot viewer that came with my camera met my needs for photo editing but did not offer a \\"delete picture\\" option or the capacity to print to a disk. I thought the print to disk option was a part of the Paint Shop package which it does not appear to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy","review":"I create digital scrapbooking graphics and frequently save items in .png format - which, with this program, can't be done properly. It does not retain the transparency. If you save it with the optimizer, you get an ugly background. Without the optimizer, it tricks you into thinking it is alright because it looks transparent to you - however, opening it in any other program (such as PSE, PSCS, PSP9, PSPX, etc) the transparency is replaced by a white background. As of yet, there is no fix for this. It runs extremely slowly and keeps losing track of where my plugins are saved. It's got potential if some patches to fix these issues are released."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Version Is Complete Garbage","review":"I too was excited about the new version of Paint Shop Pro. Then I installed it. It takes 2.5-6 minutes to start it with common operations that used to be done in real time taking seconds. Also the new layout of the dialog boxes add unnessicary extra clicks and moved useful functions like quick preview to inconvinient places. This together with it crashing 50% of the time I run it.Corel now admits that the program is really slow when you have a large image library and say they are working on a solution. If you are wondering what a large image collection is, I'm running at about 17 000 images, which Picasa handles quite fine.I would recommend trying to find Paint Shop Pro X right now and maybe upgrade to 12 when it comes out, but make sure to download the trial version when 12 comes out, because I agree, each version that Corel has come out with has been worse. Though I would call 10 a side step as they did add some good new features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this product !!!","review":"I bought this because I have been using Paint Shop Pro for years .Corel put in a message center , which you are supposed to be able to turn off ...NOT !For over a week now , I get this pop-up from the message center to buy the new version ...pretty annoying if you want to use the program and have that window in the way constantly ! I called Corel and they gave me a \\"tip\\" on how to get rid of the messages , well that only worked until I reset my computer .I have been messing around with my registry and everything I could think of . NOTHING worked so far!Looks like I will be asking them for my money back .I don't need to be paying good money for a program that is pressuring me into buying a new version which I couldn't use unless I change my operating system !They must have been taking lessons from Microsoft !If you are smart , stay with an older version which still came from Jasc ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow","review":"And a resource hog.

I wanted to evaluate which is the best for my purposes--mainly adjusting and tweaking my digital camera's photos. I got up and running right away with Elements, but Paint Shop Pro took a long time to start up, and then I was frustrated trying to understand the program. The booklet that came with it was of course useless. Everything went slowly and I soon became frustrated. Others reviewers apparently liked it but it did nothing for me. I am returning it to Amazon for a refund. I'll stick with Photoshop Elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switched from Elements 3....","review":"I am semi-professional photographer and have been using Adobe Photoshop Elements 2 and then 3 for the last couple of years.. I was about to upgrade to Elements 5 when I read about Paint Shop Pro XI Photo and decided to switch and I am glad I did. PSPXI offers a lot more features than Elements and is more user friendly. I love getting special effects with one click of a button like the Glamor effect or any other film effects available. It looks like I am getting more things done in less time. Give it a try and download the trial version and see it for yourself. You might want to switch, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not pass QA. Buggy and Slow.","review":"I have been a fan of PSP since version 5. For a fraction of the price it does 99% of what Photoshop can do, and the user interface is easier and more intuitive. HOWEVER, this new version is a huge step backwards, and it's a real shame. Whatever enhancements may have been added to the program are irrelevant, as its bugs and _insanely_ slow performance make it essentially un-usable. Basic operations, like opening the browser view, take forever. I've tried it out on two different systems, a Pentium 4 with 1G RAM and an Athlon X2-64 with 2G of RAM, and several times I've seen it completely hang after only a few minutes of use. Stick with PSP 9 or 10 and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Swinging band - listening samples incorrect.","review":"This was the first jazz album I ever owned, which my stepmother's friend gave me when I was 10 - and while the previous reviewer mentions a double album set, my LP (Westinghouse Broadcasting) only had the same tracks that are on the CD:One O'Clock JumpBalkan Mixed GrillAvalonPoor ButterflyYou're Driving me CrazyBugle Call RagMean to MeKing Porter StompSing Sing Sing.The rhythm section swings hard - Arvel Shaw, Roy Burns, Billy Bauer and Rolland Hanna provide a solid feel - Rolland Hanna's solos add a more modern, be-bop sound, which is nice - we have a transitional band here, recorded in 1958, with roots in the swing era but influenced a bit by more modern styles as well.While it may be a pick up band, the playing is fairly tight, and with a fairly all star band, including Zoot Sims in the sax section, the soloing and ensemble work is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for Henry David Thoreau, 0 for Bill McKibben","review":"This book would be a good presentation of the classic Walden if you tore out the introduction by Bill Kibben. While the annotations are helpful, the introduction is over the top, making out Thoreau as an environmentalist and climate change advocate. Totally self-serving on the part of McKibben. Thoreau was certainly a thinker outside the box, but an environmentalist he was not. To suppose that in this day he would be an advocate of climate change is laughable. Look for a true copy of Walden without the garbage added."},{"rating":"1","title":"The print and size of book make it hard to read","review":"Something about the way the book was put together, literally- the size of the book is too big and you cannot hold it right because the print is all the way to the middle crease.

To be frank i would not recommend this \\"classic\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Look how smart I am","review":"It is nice to read something like this even if the best case scenario now is to mock people who idolize Thoreau.Hes writing seems to have no point, no objective, except maybe to make himself seem very smart. I don't buy it. Nor do I buy into the ethics of squatting or the innocent beauty of nature.This book should be read:1) by hipsters who feel their life is pointless - they might be entranced with the descriptions of nature.2) by people who are tired of hearing people refer to Thoreau without reading his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"classic","review":"I chose Walden to read because it is considered a classic. Once I started getting into the book, I found that it was self centered writing. Just because he chose to live as he did, doesn't give him the right to pass judgement on the others in the community for the way they chose to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walden, a life in the wods?","review":"This was a well written essay of life in the wilderness.

Pretty frustrating to be reading this and to all of a sudden come across missing parts, i.e. when Thoreau is enumerating his living expenses, all the information is missing. Instead I spent the $0.99 and got a complete and well formatted version ASIN: B0056OZR26 which also has an illuminating preface by Emerson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book Poor Formatting","review":"I haven't picked up a free book for a while because of poor formatting issues. As I tried to read this one on my Kindle something kept bothering me. It wasn't until I was on the second page that I realized what was wrong.For some reason the entire book is off center. The right side flows all the way to the edge of the page. However, the left side starts off away from the edge. I tried to change the font to a larger size, but this just made it more noticeable.The text being off center doesn't seem like a big deal. However, I never got past it. It annoyed me so much that I ended up removing it from my Kindle because I just couldn't read it this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walden- Thoreau's failed attempt at writing","review":"The message of Walden is interesting, but Thoreau's writing ruins it. Not only does he excessively go off topic, but he also is not able to effectively communicate what he is trying to say.As for this edition, it is very good, and that is where the two stars of my review come from.If Thoreau were to publish Walden today, editors would refuse to let him do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classics aren't always good.","review":"Been reading some classics because I feel I should.

Oddly though, since then it sort of pops up in my mind periodically, like the smell of comfort food or a fond memory, so I've reread the book (in its entirety) every few years. It's like the best kind of friend--you can kind of wander off and do your own life but then return and find the connection is as strong as ever, you still find warmth and something for your soul there. I'm about to buy the Kindle format because it's summer and I need some good summer reading material, and Thoreau stepped in to fill that void. All the nice, wild, nature places are slowly going away and all that we'll have someday is Thoreau to remind us of how foolish we've been building condos and golf courses on all the ponds and woods and open meadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and accessible","review":"This edition of Walden is a joy to read, with lovely typeface and layout. I am not a Thoreau scholar, but found the annotations accessible and absorbing.

I'd see many lines that just seemed to end with half a thought and a comma or double-dash, with nothing to punctuate his statement (price, poem, song, etc.). I just grabbed the MOBI version from Project Gutenberg ([...]) and everything seems to be in order. However be aware that THAT version has no table of contents (DOH!).So ... it's free, yes, but you're missing out on key elements of the book if you download this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle Edition is terrible","review":"I had to stop reading this kindle edition of the book because large portions of text were missing. Namely the list where Thoreau talks about how much all his building materials cost (not really that important) and (more importantly) any time he quotes someone. This is the free kindle edition.Since I did not want to pay any money for it I downloaded another edition for free from Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org). They had a kindle version that includes civil disobedience and has a table of contents. Very nice!

Very pleased.Thank you for sending it off so fast..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn the libraries; their worth is in this book.","review":"As Omar said of the Koran, I say of Walden. This is the single greatest book I've ever read, hands down. Words really can't describe how amazing it is, though I doubt that it will affect many people the same way it has me. That said, this edition (the Konemann) is one of the best I've seen. The book itself is helpfully supplied with footnotes (which are something of a necessity for a born quoter like Thoreau), unobtrusively marked by a leaf in the margins of the pages, which refer you to the notes in the back: this is an excellent way to supply these notes without interrupting the flow of the text. There are no elaborate essays on the meaning of Walden, however, so the reader is left to judge the book on its own terms. The book itself is svelte and compact; a perfect backpack-sized vade mecum.This book, with shipping, is less than 10 dollars. It was one of the best purchases I've ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically important writing","review":"Great ideas in a mixed format, some great observations presented in poeticverse and some rant with confused presentation.

If you truly read this book more than once you will learn things about life and your place on this planet will be enriched. You will undergo changes, you must understand. Thoreau was a master at creating an alternative to living life in the fast lane. \\"Living Deliberatly\\" simply and with a purpose is so important, in this book you will learn how to do all of it. Your life will be better if you really try to understand. Even the slow parts have messages so be sure to pay attention.

Cramer brings light to bear on the puns and allusions that would likely escape the reader of today. It is an uncommonly rich reading experience.The book itself is the best designed I can remember in years. The annotations are side by side with the text; the type is crisp and clear; the book opens flat for easy handling; and it is printed on fine stock. Cramer and Yale University Press have given us a rare gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get another edition","review":"This is a great book, of course. But this edition is awful. The font is tiny, the margins ridiculously thin. I was so disappointed to open the package and find this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not get it.","review":"I think Thoreau was a nut-job. He must have been a communist for the academic community to make such a fuss about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"This is the most horrible book I've ever read. If you think you can \\"discover yourself\\" or \\"discover the meaning of life\\" by going out into the woods by yourself well then you have a social problem. I don't believe a pond can tell you anything about people or about anything for that matter. What can happen to you if you go live in solitary for a long period of time is that you can develop a mental problem, and that's about it. Sure, lets get rid of everything in life that makes us happy, simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. Ha! This only sounds like a very depraved soul crying out for help. I think the only thing we can learn from this book is that it is not a good idea to go live in the woods by yourself, because it's hard. I say this book is a complete waste of time. It is perhaps the most boring piece of literature I've ever laid eyes. I say save your time and money and don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesnt' love Thoreau","review":"I have loved Thoreau since I first read him in middle school and who doesn't love Thoreau. WALDEN is a great book to either revist Thoreau or read him for the first time.

I was very disappointed. The narrator is not only monotone (as another review suggests), but he speaks. Very. Slowly. And. Over. Emph. A. Sizes. Every. Syllable. No joke: he almost sounds like a computer voice synthesizer. It's distracting and it's hard to follow the prose. I listened to only one chapter and had to stop. I have more than two dozen audio books, and enjoying walking and listening. But I'll have to pick up a copy of the printed book on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine piece of literature.","review":"A poignant peek into one man's view of what is and should be the true importance of every man's existence. Thoreau in the 1800s already felt, in my opinion, strangled by too much, unnecessary stimuli. Once out in the woods, on his own, with just the basic necessities, he was able to reconnect with his true self. I can only imagine what he would think of today's world. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and owning great meaning, a must read","review":"Walden, just the name brings immediate thoughts and images.

Even if you don't agree with him, even if you see his contradictory nature towards his teachings, even if you can't understand him, you can't deny that he is an amazing thinker and an influential character of American history. Thoreau's quiet voice of solitude and non conformity provides refreshing alternatives of perception and observation which strengthens inner freedom and personal growth. I have read numerous essays by Thoreau and I have to say this could be the most enlightening. His ideas of progressing back to nature is beautiful inspiration to reevaluate our contemporary life.I recommend everyone read this book...Actually I take that back...I recommend everyone Henry David Thoreau and all of his beautiful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Author...Marginal Editor","review":"I'm not super educated so take this for what it's worth. I read an excerpt of Walden in High School and ever since then I have wanted to read more. I finally got around to it and ordered this edited version. I like Thoreau's outlook even though his writing is a little much for me sometimes. McKibben does footnote some things to explain them. Most of those footnotes, though, are worthless. Some only refer to the other copyright information that Thoreau eludes to (or quotes). And worse even still is when McKibben puts in personal opinions and 'tree-hugger' facts to support what appears to be his agenda of conservation.His editing footnotes really had a poor impact on the book. What would have been useful for a 'hick' from Wyoming would have been some more translations of French words and explanations of references and ideas. That would have made the story much easier to read/understand and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design for a Book","review":"This book is physically constructed in a very low quality way.

He has whole sections that seem incredibly tangential but after you reread them, you realize they were perhaps the greatest parts of the book.That being said, he also has sections that are just incredibly tangential, and when you finish you miss things like narratives, a centered topic, main points, etc. These are just stream of consciousness it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"obviously not a thriller","review":"this book is very similar to something dickens might have written.it has a serious tone that becomes a monotonous drone when it describes something and can be quite flavorless at times. i gave it two stars because the structure is better than grocery store romance garbage, but not something i could imaging anyone finding remotely fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture!","review":"As a social studies teacher and a student of history one can not deny the importance of Thoreau's views on civil disobedience. The impact of his teachings on the world are amazing. Thoreau's views on civil disobedience and their affect on Martin Luther King and Ghandi helped make this world a better place. So again, I understand why Thoreau is important.Now onto Walden Pond. Do people actually read this and enjoy it? I was required to read this for a masters course in early American Intellectual Thought and man I will never read this again.Pages and pages of boring unimportant information about his daily life....zzzzz. How does anyone enjoy reading about how he built his hut or what clothes he wears. Can he bore us some more with his agricultural failures? This book was torture. Yes Thoreau is important, but so is my time and reading this book was a complete waste.If you have trouble sleeping, pick up this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflective, yet limited","review":"Thoreau was a reflective man. He asked pertinent questions, but just didn't go far enough in his search. As a pagan, he was unaware of the realities of Jesus Christ. In spite of his limited vision, he had some profound observations at times. One of my favorites is:\\"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Should he turn his spring into summer?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic novel!","review":"This book pretty much changed my life, and I just love this particular edition of the classic novel.

It made me start questing my motives for what activities I was spending my time doing, what kind of clothes I was wearing, and what things I was saying. I think like many teens a lot of my actions had to do with wanting to impress my classmates or to put up an image that I thought would make me popular.

Walden without the quotes is like a car without wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great edition, Thoreau is timeless and important as ever","review":"Often times a book you *should* read is one that isn't that enjoyable to read. At best, you have to work at it. The writing although informative, educational, and thought provoking is often complex, unapproachable, and drowned in archaic syntax. While not as easy reading as adult teen fiction, I'm about 1/3 of the way through and so far have been able to follow about 80% of it without needing to go back over anything or bust out my dictionary.The Kindle format itself is great and well adapted. No strange formats, no font oddities.As for the text, it should be pointed out that there is more to Thoreau than \\"simplify, simplify\\". His observations on the motivations and trappings of society are accurate and telling, proven even more by the fact that one hundred and fifty years have passed since its creation and little has changed.An outstanding text for anyone wishing to get more out of life and to distill out the things that are most excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an incomplete version.","review":"As other reviewers have noted this version is incomplete and sentences stop in the middle.

I found it to be the worst book in history. It's nothing more than a bunch of jumbled up statements that say one thing and deny it the next. He just repeated everything and since he couldn't make it in society, he moved to the woods. Is this supposed to show us how we are to live our lives, because if it is, shoot me now. He seemed to hate everyone and live with the animals and the pond. No one really cares what he ate or what he did for fun (if he can call it that), or how he failed in everything. If he wanted to find out who he was, he should've become a buddhist monk or something. I've seen someone else who left society and moved to the woods, and he is locked away for a long time for sending people bombs in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a fun book","review":"Do not read this book.

He espouses the benefits of nature as well as the healing properties of simple toil and the benefits of rugged independence. Thoreau's mantra of \\"Simplify, Simplify, Simplify\\" has become pertinent again and again over the years since he wrote this little book. The book is an excellent nature book as well. Thoreau spent hours observing nature, and wrote about it with a simple and beautiful prose. Thoreau spent two years at the pond Walden. This book covers his observations during that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth reading","review":"An interesting picture of the writer and his times.

The book doesn't hold up to scrutiny - for example, he claims that he dug a 5' x 7' root cellar into the side of a mountain in only two hours of digging with a shovel.

Unlike today where bands are not allowed to rise instead electronic garbage is crapped on us, this one is pure fun. Sam and the pharoahs had several big hits. But they really laid down some fantastic garage rockin tunes. Sadly the later sixties tried to be too serious for it's own good.

Good, relaxing, funny reading for the hour before bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut novel","review":"Stephanie Plum is one of the most down-to-earth, funny, and gutsy heroines to come around in a long time. When she gets laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, she goes to her cousin Vinnie in desperation. She is expecting to get a filing job, but instead she becomes a \\"bounty hunter\\", bringing in crooks who have failed to appear for a hearing date. It sounds like easy money, until she actually tries to jockey some of these brutes into her car to take them to the police. They resist in every way possible and Stephanie does some fast, on-the-job training. Her first case is a former lover of hers who has committed a murder, with some debate as to whether it was self-defense. She pursues him while being pursued by a violent, sadistic boxer who threatens great bodily harm to her. This story is told in a breezy, tongue-in-cheek manner which is very appealing and causes it to be a page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it but...","review":"This is another one of those books I wanted to badly to love and cheer about. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the flippant way the author portrayed a six year old being molested that I found myself unable to enjoy the rest of the book. The character lost my interest, and I found her actions predictable and juvenile. I am one who can willingly suspend belief for the sake of a good plot, but the idea that anyone could just become a bounty hunter overnight without any training (or brains) just didn't work for me. There were some humorous parts but they were not enough to earn more than two stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could do without ....","review":"the detailed descriptions of how Benito brutalized and raped women with broken beer bottles etc- after all, who needs these images in their head? Isn't the nighly news enough? Also, the crude language and setting just gives me an ugly feeling. That said, I liked Stephanie and her sense of humor, but I'm not sure I would read more of the series. The fact that these are bestsellers just proves to me that society is getting more and more depraved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"It's been a long time since there came along a book that I couldn't finish. Try as I might, a little over half way through the book, I put it down. I can't imagine why this would have been made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Series","review":"All of the Stephanie Plum books are great and this one introduces the characters in a wonderful and funny way. All the ladies that I work with love this series and we refer to it to describe our own lives. The situations that Stephanie finds herself in are so funny and are sometimes so close to the situations that you can find yourself in. Once you start reading this book, you won't want to stop until you finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding entertainment","review":"Several friends had recommended this series; I was slow to warm to the idea. The books are entertaining, light, humorous and a real page-turner. For an afternoon \\"escape\\" this is the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot get enough of her writing","review":"Janet Evanovich is definitely one of the wittiest authors I have ever read.Her writing is so good that my husband and I fought over who got to read the book first. (We both started reading it at the same time.) I finished it in one day. I cannot get enough of her writing. I hope she writes a thousand more!Leah L Higbe's comments on \\"One for the Money\\" is a good review; she sums up everything I wanted to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown! A Scooby Doo style mstery","review":"I gave this book two stars because it was semi-entertaining, in a bad movie sort of way. It is not the hilarious book other posts have claimed. Maybe you have to be from Jersey to get it. It is generally predictable and unexciting. It is the equivalent of watching a movie made for the USA channel - same tired tv movie plot. My title refers to the Scooby Doo style ending. I'm sure anyone could find a better book than this. This was my first and last from Evanovich!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about your crap movie of the week book......","review":"How could anyone rate this book with 5 stars? It was poorly written, filled with cliches and the characters were not at all likeable or redeeming. Put this on the back shelf and only read if you are desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it me?","review":"I wanted to like this book. If I liked it, then I'd have all those sequels to look forward to. But I couldn't get past the first chapter. Glib, smart-alecky, first-draft-feeling, it just felt too loose and unedited, un-thought-out. No style. More like a boilerplate for people wanting to make a quick buck writing easy paperback mysteries. I skipped around in the book after that, but nothing caught my attention. I even finally read the last few pages, but all I realized was that I would never be able to endure this character for a whole book, much less a whole series. Stephanie Lemon, I'd say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun in the sun","review":"This was a great fun read for the beach. I loved all the characters in this book. This book was fun, witty and had lots of action in it. It is a great intro to the Plum series. It makes you want to get the next one in the series right away. If your looking for a fun very fast read look this one up, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it as a Kindle Read","review":"I bought this as my first Kindle Book. What a hoot! I have never laughed so hard reading a book. Stephanie Plum is a wise cracking \\"I can do this Bounty Hunter\\" crap kind of girl. My sister-in-law kept telling me you should read the Stephanie Plum series from Janet Evanovich. I am such a Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown book enthuasist that I kept resisting until I bought my new Kindle(2). I thought why not try her first one and see what all the talk is about. Well let me say, I read \\"One for the Money\\" in one day and have started on \\"Two for the Dough\\". The story line is good but the humor is worth the price of the read. Give it a try if you like a light fun read, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One For the Money","review":"I thought that this book was great! Very funny-I was laughing out loud while reading it.I have read all five of Janet Evanovich's novels and loved them all. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dumb to live","review":"Evanovich is a wonderful writer, giving a great sense of place and well drawn characters. But Stephanie Plum? Oy! I wanted to throw the book across the room. She drags an injured woman through her apartment window? Even a high school student would know better. She hears, on the phone, a man whose identity she knows torturing a woman. Does she call the police? No. She plugs in her answering device. Dozens of other utterly absurd actions show her to be a total [mindless person]. She is so stupid that she becomes a primary cause of another person being shot!I must say this is the absolute worst book of its kind I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like 3 1/2 stars","review":"Unemployed and down on her luck, Stephanie Plum takes a job with her cousin Vinnie's bail bond service as a bounty hunter. Soon she is on the heels of Joe Morelli, a cop wanted for murder with whom Stephanie also has a complicated personal history. This is a light, breezy story whose main charm is its amusing lead character, who narrates the story and her many screw-ups on the way to ultimate victory in a very humorous voice. The end disappoints by denying us a major confrontation that seemed inevitable and by falling back on the old device of the villain who is undone because he takes the time to explain his schemes. Still, it remains a fast, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"one for the money...","review":"This book is a GREAT comedy/mystery. It is so funny and is definitly a page turner with a laugh a page. recommended to anyone who wants to read a great book and be completley entertained! I wish i could give this books 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stroke of Genius","review":"I'm tired of authors trying to creat masterpieces. It doesn't work. Fancy language, and symbollism doesn't amount to anything without a decent story. Janet Evanovich realizes this. She has written a hilarious, brilliant dark comedy that never tries to be a classic, but will end up being one anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun... sometimes sexy","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The lead character is a real kick in the pants. I can definitely recommend this easy-to-read and fun book about a semi-bumbling, attractive, novice detective to any and all.

Is that a GUN!?","review":"Stephanie Plum is a laid off lingerie buyer for a store that just went out of business because of its shady connections. She's late on her care payment and she can't find a job. So what does she do? In typical burg (Trenton, New Jersy) style she blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job as a Fugitive Aprehension Agent, aka a bounty hunter.This is the first in a series of so far 9 book by Janet Evanovich featuring Stephanie Plum and her adventures. If you LOVE to laugh these are the books for you. I'm talking about laughing till you cry type laughing, big belly laughts.Ms. Evanovich thoughout her series maintains and improves on a series of characters that we grow to love or hate as the case may be. The author has a easy reading writing style that coupled with her obvious sense of humor combines to create a book and a series that are funny, entertaining and with a dash of mystery thrown in are very much worth the reading time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money takes place in the \\"burg\\" located n New Jersey. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is in trouble with debt when her car gets impounded because she has been lacking on her payments.

She ends up buying a car with a microwave and some other appliances. It is a truly fun book to read. She takes a jog from her cousin and becomes a bounty hunter. She will get $10,000 if she catches someone but that someone is an ex-cop and the book has some weird twists. Read it NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Easy Read","review":"I am always surprised at how harshly some judge books. There are some truly terrible books out there. This is not one of them.The author uses the perfect voice for her character. The plot is pretty good. The setting allows for some very funny scenes. There were parts of the book that made me uncomfotable, though I don't think Evanovich went into too much graphic detail.Overall, I think it was well written and funny. If you're looking for something thought provoking and deeply sentimental, this isn't it. If you're looking for entertainment and a few laughs (and you don't take yourself too seriously), you might like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"One For the Money\\"","review":"I tried reading this book because i was always hearing how great it was.

She is desperate. Once she learns that she can make $10,000 as a bounty hunter, she decides to learn the tricks of the trade. Her first task is to bring in Joe Morelli, someone from her past. Now he's a cop accused of murder and presently, on the lamb. Stephanie learns the trade the hard way as we follow her foibles and mishaps, yet there is something endearing about her obstinate attitude. In search of Joe, she gets mixed up with a sadistic boxer, his manager, two call girls, and a butcher. Evanovich, the author, writes superbly with a tight plot and witty prose. A fun read that doesn't disappoint you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK BOUGHT IN TERRIBLE CONDITION!","review":"I JUST BOUGHT AND RECEIVED THIS BOOK IN THE MAIL AND IT'S IN SUCH BAD CONDITION; I DON'T EVEN WANT TO READ IT....I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT NEW FOR LESS MONEY, AND NOT WAITED A WEEK TO GET IT....IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION!

I never used to be an avid reader until I started these books. If you want some light reading that keeps you laughing at the antics of some of the characters these books are for you! I love the way Janet makes these characters seem so real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I had heard a great deal about how wonderfully humourous this series is, so I decided to start with book number one. What a mistake. I am not amused by either junior high humour or violence against women. I found this to be a dreadul book with a sophomoric plot and a degrading, violent, abusive view of women. I did not finish it and will never read another book by this author. I stongly suggest no one else do so, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"kmb","review":"Estremely sad for all the vulgar gutter language and poor taste of speech that added nothing to the plot nor story.

I look forward to many more Stephanie Plum books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Found the Plum Series!","review":"If you are looking for a deep mystery thriller, this series isn't for you. If you are looking for a series to read that is laugh out loud enjoyable, then I highly recommend Stephanie Plum and her friends to you. Stephanie is down on her luck (and money) and talks (coerces) her cousin, Vinnie who owns a bail bonding company into giving her a job as a Bounty Hunter. This is the first book of the series and lays the ground work for each subsequent book. Evanovich's writing is smart and sassy and a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"Sometimes I like to take a break from hardcore detective stories and tearful literary masterpieces and sit back with a fluffy story that makes me laugh.

Evanovich has created a wonderful balance of crime/mystery and comedy with a heaping helping of romance mixed in as well.Stephanie Plum is determined, if nothing else, and no one or no dumpster will stand in her way of collecting the cash prize for turning in a wanted bail jumper. Question is, how does an out-of-work woman with no experience in catching criminals perform such a feat?Prepare yourself for a wild and hilarious adventure. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading","review":"I was told I couldn't find this book used. I did and I loved it. Lots of fun to read.

Her first assignment, worth $10,000 is to bring in Joe Morelli who is a cop accused of murder. She and Joe have a past (fleeting though it may be) but she is determined to bring him in. She runs into him quite a bit but he doesn't \\"let\\" her catch him. The characterization is great and there are a few laughs. I have read the whole series and they only get better and better and laugh out loud funny. This is one of my favorite series. Stephanie and Joe's relationship alone will keep you turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"One For the Money.....","review":"I thought that this book was hysterical.

This book is full of great characters that are fun to read about. I first got the recommendation to read the Stephanie Plum series a few years back from a clerk at the book store after she caught me picking out romantic suspense, but I tend to read more from the \\"romance genre\\" so I waited awhile before trying. I've only read two in the series so far, and so far the developing relationship between Plum and Joe Morelli sure is pulling me in. This is a great book for readers who enjoy laughing, a mystery, and a bit of romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Easy Read","review":"This book was a fun, easy read.

The first couple of pages describing how Stephanie met Joe when they were kids sets the tone for the whole story. If it makes you laugh, you'll love the book, if it offends you, read no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine and easy read","review":"This was a really fun book. It reminds me of a Bridget Jones type character doing bounty hunting for the first time and getting in more and more trouble on the way. It is very entertaining and a fast moving novel. I cannot wait to see this in the movies. Stephanie Plum makes you laugh throughout the book. This was my first book I read of the series and look forward to reading more. I read this on my kindle and had gotten it at a time when it was offered for a bargain. From the beginning of the main character's job in bounty hunting your interest will be captivated in order to find out what is going to happen to her. Is she every going to get the $10,000 by turning Morelli or will he continue to escape every attempt made for his capture. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pass this one up!","review":"I started laughing after the first sentence and only stopped after finishing the last page.

Gutsy, mouthy and funny Stephanie is about to tackle life as a Bounty Hunter!When Stephanie is handed her first assignment she is in for a real ride and a blast from the past because this first assignment is capturing none other than her first \\"sort of boyfriend\\", Joseph Morelli. Not only does Stephanie want to bring Morelli in for the money, but she also has quite the bone to pick with him!After finishing Evanovich's first book in this promising series, I am itching to get my hands on book number two, Two for the Dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book; excellent series","review":"This book is the start of a terrific series. It hooked me from the first sentence. If you like a little romance, a lot of humor and a great mystery, you've just found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hoot!","review":"This book cracked me up. The set-up is unlikely -- Stephanie Plum, out-of-work lingerie buyer, becomes a bounty hunter -- but it's tons of fun. The plot was well-done and interesting, but you should really read this book for the characters. They're all vividly drawn and unforgettable, running the gamut from slightly zany and unpredictable to completly and utterly insane.I just about died laughing. This book is a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged means the good parts are goone","review":"I am new to the books on cd so I didn't realize that abridged meant they took what they considered the unessential parts out. That means all the humor, all the real meat of Ms Evanovich's style are gone and you get just another action story to fall asleep to at night. I loved the book and wanted to share the story with my daughter who doesn't have time to read but likes to listen to the stories on her way to work. I am embarressed to give this to her after I have raved about the author's writing because it is just dull. Why would anyone put out something so disappointing. I noticed they have all been abridged and while I was ready to start buying all of them, now I will not be buying any more. Enjoy the books but do not expect much from the audio cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Mystery","review":"I liked this book quite a lot... Starts off very strongly, but the end is extremely tacked-on and confused. In a lot of ways, this isn't really a \\"mystery\\" in that it is just a wandering character study with a murder at the center of the story. I didn't feel like I had a hope of figuring out the crime, as I didn't get the feeling that the author knew or cared how it was going to end as she wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me laugh out loud!","review":"I enjoyed \\"One for the Money\\" very much. Being a \\"Kinsey Malone\\" fan, I had a hard time accepting a new heroine. The beginning of the book presented some pretty zany stuff, like grandma shooting the chicken, but once I got past that, I found myself engrossed in the story and at times laughing out loud. I immediately orded the next two in the series. NJL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so funny","review":"Having read Hot Six, I decided to read all the books in the numbered series in order. I started with One for the Money.The books are supposed to be amusing, but I found this one very disturbing. In addition to the fact that Stephanie's financial and social circumstances are miserable, she is almost publicly raped by a man she is interviewing and has to be rescued by the suspect she is hunting.Then the would-be rapist stalks her.He telephones her that he is leaving her a present. This which turns out to be a black prostitute, Lulu, left hanging naked and mutilated on Stephanie's fire escape.In future novels in the series Lulu becomes the comic relief.Lulu"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had known...","review":"I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it. Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"I was looking forward to a series of books that so many seemed to enjoy. However, I am slogging through One for the Money. It is so slow moving and the characters are flat, lack charm or any other appeal. I don't think I am going to be able to finish the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie is being made??????????","review":"What the heck, this book, like all her others, really stinks. Janet's books are so stupid it's embarassing to be seen reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's disgusting (to me, anyway) - but violence sells.","review":"I was really enjoying this light and funny book until I got to the graphic descriptions of violence against women. Don't we get enough of that at the movies? I threw the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for completing the book","review":"I first saw the author on Sunday morning getting interviewed in New Jersey. Apparently she was a big success. I bought the first book and read it and passed it on to my friends. None of us liked it at all. Compared to what is out there this is weak. She does do an excellent job of describing New Jersey it is an awful place. I didn't like the main character or any of the others. The grandmother had potential but was highly unlikely as written. The reason for the success of Who wants to be a Millionaire-which I absolutely don't like and the success of this book may be the missing link to all of it. Sue Grafton or J.A. Jance are phenomenally better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite re-reader!","review":"This was the first Janet Evanovich book I had ever read, but it won't be the last! I fell into the story from the first few pages and found it very hard to put down. I'll certainly be reading the other books in this series. Highly recommended for those times when you're looking for a book to lift your mood with a little mystery thrown in for good measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY!!","review":"Stephanie Plum (main character) is a RIOT! There are also other very humorous characters, namely Grandma Mazur. This was the first book in the series that I've read and before finishing it I went out and ordered the next 10 books. It is an easy read with a lot of fun along the way. I often caught myself laughing out loud. (maybe not such a great idea in a public place...people might think your nuts but what the heck...go for it) For any of you that have read Harlen Coben's Myron Bolitar Series or Sue Grafton's A-Z series you might find Stephanie to be a good cross between Myron and Kinsey.(Whom both I love) I highly recommend this book and the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"janet evanovich one for the money","review":"The book was as described however it was not the full sized book but the book club edition. This was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all readers like it, though","review":"This book was recommended to me at a bookstore that specializes in mysteries, and I have a hard time understanding why. The characters are largely stereotypes, and the result reads more like a Hollywood treatment of a mystery than a novel. The background for the plot centers on bail bonds, but provides little detail beyond what one could glean from watching a good movie like \\"Midnight Run.\\" I notice that many of the (extemely positive!) reviews here are written by people who begin by saying \\"I don't like mysteries, but. . . \\" Well, I can see where that might be the case, and respect their opinions (with the one exception that I can't understand the positive comments on the \\"romance\\" in the book because it is so preoccupied with sexual violence). But as someone who loves this genre, this book struck me as an unsuccessful attempt at marrying Robert B. Parker and Sue Grafton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Refreshing Read!","review":"I bought this book for the beach, looking for something light, and I could not put it down. Stephanie Plum was easy to relate to, and the book was very funny at times. My only complaint, being from New Jersey (near Trenton), were the Jersey stereotypes. First, the only \\"radioactive\\" areas in Jersey are near Elizabeth and Newark. Second, we DO NOT wear turquoise or midnight blue eyeliner with cherry red lipstick, spandex shorts, and gold hoop earrings...maybe in the 80's, but not in '94. Third, the dialect was a little off. We don't start out any sentence with \\"probably.\\" Once I got past the false \\"jerseyisms\\" I was able to get more into the characters. I guess I would have enjoyed it more if I weren't from Jersey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mufasa's Kickin' reveiw","review":"One for the Money takes place in the suburbian parts of New Jersey . The Main character is Stephanie Plum. She is in big trouble with paying the bills because she just got laid-off her job as a lingere dealer. Then she has to get a job fast because if she doesn't then she will lose her apartment and will have to move into her parent's house. In her parent's house, her grandma lives there. They have dinner at exactly 6:00. But after Stephanie takes a job from her cousin, she won't be on time as often as she would hope. Once she pursues the man shes after for the money then she will have to worry about a boxer/ rapist that will be after her what will happen to this newbie Bounty Hunter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and great read","review":"Was not sure about this author but my sister-in-law received several of her books and passed the first three on to me. Then I went to Kindle 'touch and found that her books did not cost as much as some and so purchased the the first 3 of the series. Have not had time read no 2 and no 3 yet as have been very sick. Expect them to be good reads as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I loved reading my first ever Janet Evanovich novel. It was fun, unexpected and I read it in one sitting.It's not anything too deep, which is what I was looking for. Her book(s) came recommended by a friend. Looking forward to more about Stepnanie and her adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The book overall was a good read...This was my 1st book that I've read from her, and I am very eager to read the 2nd book in the Stephanie Plum series...In the beginning/middle (in between) you run across slow parts, but if you keep reading and get near the end, you will not want to put the book down until your done. Plus it had an interesting ending, you suspect one person, but it turns out to be someone else which makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"I had heard how good these books were from other people but just never took the time to check them out myself. I am so glad I did!! Great writing! I found myself getting involved on page 1 and couldn't put it down. Stephanie Plum is quite the character. Down on her luck and without a job, she goes to her cousin Vinnie in hopes of getting a job filing. Instead, she ends up a bounty hunter on the hunt for Morelli, a man from her past. I found myself laughing out loud at her family, especially her mother and grandmother. Stephanie jumps right in on the search for Morelli and gets more than she bargained for when she encounters a prize fighter who ends up stalking her. I have heard they were going to make these books into movies. I can't wait to see them! Sandra Bullock would be perfect for the role of Stephanie, much like her character in Miss Congeniality!! This book is a must read! Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip One and start with Two...","review":"Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the series, and cannot wait for each new book. But, I recommend to my friends that they skip the first book and start with Two or Three. They'll meet the characters just fine without the first one.In my opinion, the first book is too 'raw.' The sex and violence are too graphic. To me, it seemed that the author wasn't certain what sort of book she wanted to write. By the second or third in the series, she hit her stride and got more comfortable with her own characters and genre. But the first in the series just isn't comfortable in its own skin.Enjoy the series, though! It's a hoot! I live in NJ and work in Trenton, and love the \\"local\\" references."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grilfriend and i made a deal","review":"She would read a book of my choosing, which ended up being \\"Wizards First Rule\\" by Terry Goodkind, and I would read one of her choosing, which ended up being \\"One For the Money\\" by Janet Evonivich.After thoroughly avoiding the book like the plague for over half a year I finally got around to reading it. Being a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi I wasn't really sure how much I'd like it, but for some reason I did.The story moves at a smooth and generally fast pace never wasting time making the reader bored. It's a murder mystery/ book of self discovery about Stephanie Plum a woman who is out of money and taking on the life of a bounty hunter to get a living.So to all those of you who loved Terry Goodkind, or to those of you who like this genera of books(whatever it is, mystery I guess?) then this book is for you! I give it 4 stars because I liked it. So you should read it to. I love you Amanda! bye-bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Stephanie Plum","review":"I've been hearing lots about these books, but hadn't had a chance to try one yet. I would see my boss read and just start laughing! So, I picked up the first book...Wish I hadn't waited so long.The writing style is engaging and the pace is fast. I read it in one day! Because, I had a very hard time putting the book down. When the book ended, I went to the store and got the second book and order 4-7 on amazon. I plan on grabbing the rest too.It's easy to see why this series is so popular. The fun characters and storyline make for quick, light, and FUNNY reading. I'm looking forward to reading the rest and cann't wait to get them.BUY IT! READ IT! AND LAUGH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little to slow for me.","review":"I really tired to get into this book but I couldnt get past chapter 4 or 5.

It combined humorous times with real life struggles of a single young woman struggling in the world. Great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"Real characters, a decent plot with realistic consequences to both good and bad decisions made by a spunky cast. Over the top at times, but an enjoyable romp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is a great book as are all the Stephanie Plum novels! Always entertaining and I find it hard to put them down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was absurd, funny, and clever, but mostly I think it was because I would love to be as badass as Stephanie Plum. She's spunky, sexy, entertaining, and makes the perfect character for this wild goose chase of a plot. Personally, I prefer books that have a bit more substance to their plots and characters but if you're looking for a book with lots of comedic entertainment value then this book is a great choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, Mystery, Passion, and Humor!","review":"Stephanie Plum is a person with character. Sheloses her job, sells some of her belongings andthis is when she decides to become a bounty hunter. Through trial and error Stephanie learns the ropes of bounty hunting. The relationship that goes on between Stephanie and Joe Morelli, who she is trying to bring in for jumping bail, is refreshing and funny. Must read book that will have you hooked on the Stephanie Plum series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, Funny, FANTASTIC!","review":"Ok, so I judged this book (well, the whole series actually) by the cover....I love the bright colors and the clever titles! I read this book in one sitting and laughed all of the way through! Stephanie Plum and her \\"adventures\\" with Morelli and the \\"bad\\" guys were fantastic! I never knew what to expect around the corner (which is a problem for me with Mystery/Thrillers) and I was intrigued the whole way through! Heck, after reading this, maybe I could become a bounty hunter! I loved reading about the dinners with her parents, her pistol-happy grandmother, and her \\"romantic\\" encounters with Morelli (the boy who seduced her back in her school days). HIGHLY recommended book! I can't wait to read the second one and hope that Stephanie can get her guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new character","review":"I enjoyed this novel. Well written, very funny. One word of warning for the \\"thin skin\\" crowd. There is a bit of obsenity in the book. While it is all in character, I could see some folks taking offense. I think what I like best about Stephenie Plum is that is a klutz and knows it. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"V. Disappointed","review":"After hearing so many great things about Evanovich's series, I decided to start with the first one. I must say I was very disappointed. The quality of the writing made me feel like I was reading a romance novel, with non of the romance parts. In addition, although I must admit I did giggle a few times during the book (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, I also only give 1 star to books that I can not finish), I really could not stand Stephanie, the main character. I have read many wonderful books where you are supposed to hate the main character. This was not Evanovich's intention, however. This was a book where you were supposed to be on Stephanie's side the entire time. All I could think of the entire time was how pathetic she was. And not even in an interesting to read about pathetic type of way. Please do not waste your time or money on this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Money","review":"I have not read the book yet, but my daughter has and recommended it to me.Usually always enjoy the books she has suggested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and boring","review":"One of the most boring mystery/crime novels that I have read. It was predictable the language was uninspired. I would highly recommend Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly over this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm","review":"This book is refreshing and hilarious! What a great bunch of characters and an interesting plot! Easy and great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST Read Comedy Series!!!","review":"The first book of 18 is actually the worst. The book is what I would consider \\"pretty good\\" on it's own but AMAZING as an over all series. I truly recommend you read the whole series. Each book is better than the previous one. I cry from laughing so hard as I get into the double digits. This is a book you can't take seriously. It's definitely a light-hearted just for fun type of book that turns into a Lucy/Ethel comedy type of series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite series","review":"So excited this is coming out in movie form! But you can't beat the book, I guarantee it. Don't read unless you want to be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"One for the Money was a book chosen in my book group. I had read another Evanovich that I wasn't impressed with but this was a delightfully different experience. From the beginning I wanted to continue to read.This was also the first book I read on Kindle. One for the Money was a great introduction to a wonderful system. It held my place, went back and forth so easily.I am looking forward to continuing the series, it was so intriguing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read!","review":"Stephanie Plum is a blast!

I'm on # 11 of the 18 books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - funny!","review":"Read this book in 1 1/2 days - could not put it down. Very funny - I highly recommend. I am hooked on this series. Already read 2 and 3. I'm ready for the 4th in the series. Lots of suspense, action, humor, and even some romance. Light reading. Take a break from the routines and work - relax with a Stephanie Plum novel. You'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"I picked up the book at my friends urging at how great it was. I usually don't have much time for reading but I needed something to read on the plane so I thought I would give it a try. These books are addicting. Since the trip two months ago, I have read 1 through 6 of her books plus Full Bloom, and Manhunt. I love Janet Evanovih's writing style.

For those of you with ties to the Phillie,New York, New Jersey region, you know these people/places, so there's an added kick to the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Recommended from a family member. Just fun reading, nothing intense, deep, or mind bending. Just fun that's it, and sometimes that's all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AUSPICIOUS DEBUT FOR OUR FAVORITE JERSEY GIRL","review":"As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I was utterly charmed by Stephanie Plum's auspicious debut. In ONE FOR THE MONEY, Janet Evanovich launched the career of everyone's favorite Jersey girl. Trenton-tough Stephanie is so broke she has to drink her last beer for breakfast. She manipulates her cousin Vinnie into letting her give the bond recovery business a try. She has to bring in Joe Morelli, an ex-boyfriend from her teengirl years. Her attempts to catch this cop accused of murder are hilarious, as has been the rest of Ms. Evanovich's winning series. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful discovery","review":"I am always so excited when I find a new series of good mysteries! Janet Evanovich has done a great job in portraying a funny, gutsy heroine who does what she has to to survive. From driving her graffiti-d Nova to learning to use a gun, Stephanie Plum is equal to any situation life throws her (with the possible exception of the mamas in the Burg!). This book is fast-paced, funny and just plain fun. Excellent summer (or anytime you need a lift) reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Excellent & Amusing","review":"Anyone who doesn't like this book has NO SENSE OF HUMOR. This is not (repeat: NOT) a serious, gritty mystery a la Sue Grafton. This is a completely fun book, pure Godiva chocolate. I have given this book to many people, all of whom loved it and bought the others in the series. You really can't go wrong with Stephanie Plum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable reading if you like Grafton et. al.,","review":"If you live in Trenton, NJ, you may recognize the landscape in the background. I don't and didn't. However the main character is vibrant and alive, and very life-like. I enjoyed it enough to buy Book 2. Evanovitch is one of the authors I look for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"janet evanovich is my hero","review":"Surprisingly enough, my aunt Cathy started me reading this series, and I have to say that after reading all seven of her books (I'm waiting for eight to come out in paper back), there hasn't been one that hasn't made me bust a gut laughing. Stephanie is hilariously inept, honest, and so real that I wouldn't be surprised to run into her walking down the street. And Grandma Mazur is the funniest supporting character in the series. Her antics never fail to make me laugh. These books were not what I expected from a mystery series, but they are refreshingly different, laugh-out-loud funny, and I am proud to say that they comprise the majority of my tiny college bookshelf.Keep 'em coming, Janet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh your head off","review":"The great news is there are six more in the series.Number 7 comes out soon.They are truly addicting. I can't wait to see what oddball character we get to meet this time. The one with the midget is hysterical.The six foot something cross dresser is a hoot to.I wouldn't want to be in her shoes to have to decide between Ranger and Morrelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"Janet Evanovich has to be one the the best crime writers to date. I love her characters, plot, and especially, her humor! This book is wonderful from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't much of a comedy...","review":"Honestly, I see tons of people saying how awesome this book is and I was so disappointed with it that I actually returned it for a refund. The main character is ridiculous. She's idiotic, consistently walking into situations that any moron can see will backfire and put her in danger. If you like watching people make asses of themselves, this is the book for you. In addition, the boxer-stalker character is NOT humorous in the slightest and the voice mail rape scene was enough to make me stop reading immediately.I was looking for a fun, light read and got an annoying piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible Plum","review":"I didn't like this book. I didn't hate it by any means--I thought it was good enough--but I did not like it. The characters were kind of fun, and it was an easy read. It was also a bit of a page-turner. On the other hand, the main character was utterly and unbelievably dense. I saw nothing romantic about Joe, a guy who molested Stephanie when she was six and took her virginity at eighteen (then never talked to her again and spread rumors about it). I, personally, would probably not make-out with a child molester/player/murderer (but I guess that's just me). Also, were a known rapist and sexual torturer calling me regularly to tell me he was going to rape me, I probably would call the police and not spend all my time alone. Stephanie Plum did the opposite, and somehow the rapist decided not to rape her on her daily early morning jog . . . alone. In short, the book had mostly implausible characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING READ!!","review":"Must read!! Book I just could NOT put down! The movie is coming out in Jan 2012 and I will be first in line to see! I cannot wait for the next book in this series. I could easily give up t.v if all books were this great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Plum, No 1","review":"Very entertaining, extremely witty and so amuzing. The entire family and my freinds enjoy reading her books. I now have the complete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"I started reading this book/series on the recommendation of a friend and was immediately hooked. The characters were funny and entertaining, even if they weren't entirely believable at times. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is a regular girl who finds herself needing a job, and so she goes to work for her cousin as a bounty hunter. She's not anything like the bounty hunters you see on TV. She's completely inept but extraordinarily lucky. The things that happen to her are outrageous and hilarious. It's a good, lighthearted read when you're in the mood for a good chuckle. In fact, the first eight or so in the series are terrific. After that, they start to decline, but don't let that deter you from reading the first several books. Definitely read a sample of this one and you'll see what I mean about entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Force One","review":"Worth reading. Written in 1994 so the technology is dated some now. I think some of the one-star votes are off base. I think the point of the violence against women in the story was to show how far over her head Plum is. Fun to see her get herself out of the tough spots with no real experience. I like how she took the big bad world of Jersey and turned it into her little neighborhood. Running into old high school buddies at just the right time to move the story along. Plum seems to pick things up quickly so I'm looking forward to giving the series another shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie then go see something else","review":"Poorly written and entirely predictable.

The book back cover reads better than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evenovich: One for the Money","review":"This was purchased as a gift, so I have no idea at all of the content or interest, or anything else about the book. It did arrive here, however, in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"One felon chases another","review":"This book was the worst I've ever read. The main character is just a self-interested person who thinks nothing of comitting felonies. It is amazing that Morelli, the man she is after, falls for her. She would sell him out for a dime, yet he finds her irresitable. She judges all these criminals as getting what they deseve, but thinks nothing of comitting crimes herself. The fact that such a self-interested person is the heroine is a sad commentary on our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have nothing better to do read this book","review":"I got this book as a birthday present. I like reading spy novels. So, the crime novel came as something I was willing to try. Well, if you like easy read, this is a book for you. I was clearly disappointed. The main character, who normally reads only \\"funnies\\" form the daily paper, uses unexpectedly word such as inconspicuous, while at the same time using word curiouser?! Also, what annoyed me is that her best friend, the cop and friend married to her cousin, has \\"eastern Slavic\\" features, like there are \\"western Slavic\\" features, only we did not know about them? Anyone who likes loud mouth New Jersey girls with no style, or manners would truly enjoy this piece of trash. I cannot even imagine donating this book to anyone. It would be too embarrasing to even admit that I had it in my possesion at one time or another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely DISGUSTED","review":"I am reading the reviews full of praise for this book. Honestly, it was entertaining....until you get into the racism in this book. Note how many times the author refers to the latino or black characters as ghetto, poor, criminal, etc. Time after time, she takes the opportunity to paint a one sided picture with this novel. It is full of ebonic slang and blatant racism. I expected an entertaining mystery book. Never did I think I would be offended by a book. If the book was about issues of race, then the racist referrences would not mean anything. But in a regular book about a bounty hunter?????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get the books","review":"My mother in-law has not gotten the books yet.

But after reading Book 1, I'm having a hard time picking my favorite.

A great start - I'm ready to dive into Book 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Plum is a Fun and Interesting Bounty Hunter","review":"Stephanie Plum is a fun heroine with guts, a good sense of humor, and easy to identify with. The story is cute, well-written and a good page-turner.Stephanie Plum loses her good white-collar job in retail and becomes a bounty hunter for her sexually deviant cousin Vinnie. Enter Morelli the cop, the bail skipper she's out to catch. They have some interesting history from high school days that livens things up. The book takes place in New Jersey.This is a good page-turner and a perfect beach, plane or vacation book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluffy Fun","review":"I remember first reading ONE FOR THE MONEY about ten years ago, and finding it a very enjoyable, light-hearted read. I re-read the novel recently, and my current reaction is pretty much the same. This book is good, mindless fun.This is the first of the \\"Stephanie Plum\\" books that feature the adventures of a cute, slightly ditzy 30-year old bounty hunter in New Jersey. These books are best known for their first rate comic dialogue, but Evanovich is also a deft plotter, and keeps the action moving in this installment. Plum is definitely a plucky, likable heroine, and it's hard not to root for her as the story progresses. Overall, I very much enjoyed this novel, which is short enough to enjoy in an afternoon.Evanovich is pretty much one of the most successful fiction writers in existence, and this is the novel that started it all for her. If you've never tried a Plum novel, and are looking for some laughs, I encourage you to give ONE FOR THE MONEY a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY QUICK, INTERESTING AND OFTEN FUNNY READ...","review":"I liked the wise-cracking main character and I'm very happy that I started reading this series from the beginning. I definitely look forward to reading the entire series. One aspect of the book that's interesting reading in 2008, the book was written in 1994, is that you can anticipate the growth in the story-lines as Stephanie (the main character) incorporates more technology and modern conventions in her crime solving.As for the book I really enjoyed the writing style and story-line. Although there were quite a few implausible plot-points they didn't detract from the entertainment value of this book at all. I was surprised at the number of times that I caught myself laughing out loud at the reactions that Stephanie has to the different situations that she's in from family matters to being poor to learning how to be a bounty hunter. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a fun, quick read with a good story attached to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"expected fun and sassy....not stupid","review":"My sister raved about this series so I picked up the first book as a 'tester'. Given the multitudes of rave reviews, I expected something much better. I had never read anything by this author beforehand, and it's highly unlikely that I'll read any more in this series. I'm not much into sexist violence, and I'm certainly NOT into stupid women who can't think their way out of a cardboard box. Stephanie Plum seemed to constantly blunder into situations that anyone with an ounce of brains would avoid or solve positively. It's just plain STUPID. I'll leave this series to those who enjoy it....but that doesn't include me. And I do read the occasional 'chic lit' book....Jodi Picoult, Elin Hilderbrand, Jennifer Weiner...but this book doesn't even come CLOSE.Not sure why this isn't coming up as an amazon verified purchase: I bought the kindle version (scratching head)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is lite and fluffy.

I usually read historical fiction and tried this book based on a Pinterest suggestion. I devoured it in 5 hours then checked my windows and doors twice before going to bed.

I really hate reading so I purchase them both in audio for me and paperback for houseguests and friends. I'm drawn in with the excitment and adventure of the story that Janet seems to capture in every novel. It has twists, turns, Lula, mystery, wonder, and of course two very \\"HOT\\" men! Who wouldn't want a mix of both men. :} I would recommend the \\"Plum\\" series, her \\"Full\\" series, as well as her earlier novels of mixed titles. They're all great fun and keep you as a reader at the edge of your seat waiting to see if a cars going to get blown up, who's died this week, who attends the pot roast dinner, who she sleeps with next, what will burn down next, and will she get her man (love or bounty). I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.

Keep 'em coming cuz ill be to the 19 book by the end of the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can understand some of the negative reviews...","review":"\\"One for the Money\\" is harder-core than Janet's later stuff, and, frankly, it's not my favorite because of the level of violence, both to Lula and the poor, old, neglected dog. I can also see a bit of the race stereotype complaints people have, although I can assure them that lightens in later books. With all that said, the series is still my favorite because it's best described as \\"sexy and funny.\\" It's not highbrow stuff, and some people, including my mother, are put off by the language, so be aware..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SERIES EVER!!!","review":"These Stephanie Plum novels, the first one being One for the Money, are the best set of books I have ever read. I was advised by a friend of mine that I would like these books. They combine both the fun and mystery of crime solving and the twists and turns of a romantic plot. I can't get enough of them. I have read all the way through High Five, the fifth installment, in less than four weeks. They are just plain fantastic. If you want the thrill of crime and mystery, sidelined by a reoccuring romantic theme and topped with laugh out loud moments including a transvestite, an \\"enforcer\\", a mortitioner, and a midget - these are the books for you. Stephanie Plum is my hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much violence against women","review":"I had no idea that this book contained so many graphic depictions of violence against women -- I was truly surprised. I had to quit about half the way through. I am a fan of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries by writer Sue Grafton. I was on the wrong track thinking this would be similar! I am just not entertained by descriptions of trussed-up women and brutal, bloody sexual violence. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I've read more books than I could ever count, and no book has made me laugh more and harder than this series by Evanovich. I actually fell off my bed laughing. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is someone everyone can relate to. She is quirky, clumsy, how-many-more-cars-can-I-go-though, man-(oops, men-) problems, just-lost-my-job-now-I've-got-to-get-help-from-my-family type of person. And talk about crazy family.

This book is so funny and the characters are engaging. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh until you cry!","review":"A friend had recommended this title to me. At first I thought it would be just another police/mystery story so it took me a while to even check it out here at amazon and read some reader's reviews. I finally ordered the first book, One for the Money. I think I was on the 10th page or so that I realized that I would definitely need to have the next few titles waiting in the wings! What a wonderful read! Not only is it a book that doesn't require alot of concentration, but it actually made me laugh out loud! Any author that can make me laugh so hard that tears are brought to my eyes, is worth their weight in gold. Needless to say that I have purchased every title available to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartwrenching story of forgiveness","review":"Deb Raney has a way of gripping you by the throat with emotions and literally transporting you into the lives of her characters.

You've got to read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter and His Magic Bedtime Cap","review":"Wow, how touching! This book is written from such an empathetic standpoint. The author regonizes the pain children experience from illness, yet offers each child a beacon of hope--excape through the power of your imagination. It is beautifully illustrated and the words seem to roll off my tongue as I read them to my children. Neither of my children are sick, but I believe the book teaches a lesson which transcends cancer (as the author implies) or any illness. It tells children that they always have the tools to cope through the power of their imagination. Cudos to the author for teaching children such a complex lesson with such simplistic words. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, very moving, captivating","review":"The Intense Measures CD certainly dispels the myth that the only good composer is a dead composer.

I have trouble sleeping with it for some reason although the bigger I get the more helpful it is. I need more support than just for the belly so I have preferred sleeping with a body pillow.

This gave the support that allowed my stomach to not pull down on my back, which made me very comfortable. I continued to use it through out my pregnancy and it really helped. What was wonderful about it is that it gave support, but it still left room for my husband in bed! The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars is that by the 9th month, the narrow end of the pillow began to flatten and slightly curl, but not enough to make it uncomfortable if I remembered to flip it over each night."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT What I Expected","review":"The pillow is too small, I tought it was bigger.

I would take with a grain of salt the review below that claims using this product was like \\"putting a triangular shaped brick under my hip\\" -- this person was obviously using it incorrectly, because it doesn't go under your hip. When placed correctly under your belly, it precisely reverses the anatomical physics that cause your back to hurt while sleeping during pregnancy (torque of the belly area while the hips and shoulders try to stay aligned).While I agree it could be a little wider, it is a terrific value. Its small size has been nice in that it makes it a lot easier to roll over and re-position the pillow on the opposite side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small","review":"When ordering this pillow, I thought it would be one of those hospital grade wedge pillows.

The foam is too firm and doesn't mold well under my body. The fabric was soft enough, but I wish the velcro opening in the back edge was a covered zipper instead. Now, I use a regular body pillow with a cover that I got cheap ($20) at Target, and I love it!

The wedge is very stiff, even after working it for a little while. The angle of it isn't right..it should be thicker at it's current thinnest part, because basically, my belly just pushes into it, and it falls on the floor, eventually.

Since I felt the Snugli body pillow was way to big I gave the Dex a shot after reading the reviews. The first two nights I wasn't very impressed and almost gave up on it. Two things really helped me in utilizing it. First, I think it needs a few days to be broken in. To do this I used it when on the couch when reading or watching TV as well as when sleeping. Second, I also think it helps to lean on it more than lie on top of it. There are no specific instruction on the box, but for me it was uncomfortable if my side was actually on the pillow. If I lean on it I am not using much of the pillow surface, but the support is helpful. As far as using it between your legs, I found this very uncomfortable. For me, a regular pillow works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I loathe sleeping on my side and this pillow is the only thing that makes it bearable. I tried those big body pillows but they were complete overkill. Not only were they too soft but they were entirely too large and cumbersome for our queen-sized bed. My husband said it was like having three people in the bed. This pillow, however, is small and effective. It takes the load off my belly and hips. My pelvic bones are separating and this pillow really gives me relief.

This was appropriate as the book is the author's account of two years spent largely by himself in a hand-made cottage on the edge of a pond. In it he details not only the minutiae of his solitary project, but opens into one of the heights of transcendental philosophy. I anticipated Thoreau's seminal work was powerful, but actually reading it was electrifying. No, I didn't agree with all of his positions. At times he turns tricks of hollow rhetoric though his arguments are nevertheless beautifully constructed.

I give it five stars in the same vein that Lawrence of Arabia is considered a classic: yes, it's undeniably a work of great effort and intelligence, but one viewing is enough. Civil Disobedience, considered a seminal political tract, struck me as anarchism-lite, written in a fit of pique.

This pump is VERY painful (damaging in fact), has inconsistent suction, does not promote \\"let down\\", and is noisy. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone! I purchased this pump before returning to work after the birth of my child. If this was the only product available to me, I would have stopped pumping after a week.

The Medela pump is well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this pump hoping that I would be able to double pump during my lunch break at work. After only two weeks of pumping twice during an eight hour period, the pump quit on me. I called the company & they sent me an entire new pump. About four weeks later, I was only able to single pump & had to call the company again. They sent me just an arm replacement. It has been another four weeks & I have to call the company again for another arm replacement.Even though I have had problems with this pump, the company has been helpful enough in sending me replacement parts. But I wish I had not purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This product was very painful. It took forever to get any milk out. It got to the point where my nipple got stuck in the tube due to thinking it was my fault why no milk was coming. I realized everything was poor working. I ended up returning the thing & using a manual single pump I received from the hospital & it worked like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one!","review":"I purchased this pump because it was the cheapest dual, electric pump I could find. Within 3 days, one of the arms was broken and the motorized pump wouldn't give enough suction to even use it on one side. The customer service people were very nice and sent a new one within 3 business days. However, after 2 months of fairly successful pumping (albeit, sometimes uncomfortable), I couldn't get my milk to let-down with this pump. After weeks of trying and only getting 1-2 ounces at each attempt, I broke down and got a hospital grade Ameda pump. The difference is amazing! Only 30 seconds on the new pump and my milk was flowing easily. The new pump is less portable but SO much more comfortable and efficient I'll never go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"I purchased this pump when my son was 5 days old. I didn't return to work until he was over three months old. As a result, I was beyond the company's return-by date. I used the product for approximatly one month before the suction on both sides went out. I did some research and decided to go with the more expensive Pump in Style, which, I might add, I have been extremely pleased with. After contacting the company, they advised me that I would not be able to get my money back, and would only be able to get a replacement pump instead. I was highly disappointed with the performance of this product, and will be staying away from this company's products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!!!","review":"Don't buy this product!!!

I was wrong. When I purchased this as a first time mother, I really did not know what to expect...I found it uncomfortable and after two weeks - one side broke. I received another one and in a month the same thing happened to the second pump...one side broke as well. I gave up on this pump and bought the hand held Advent Isis.

The motor was very weak and it did not provide the proper suction. I called the company and told them of my complaints, they sent me a new motor and new washer rings (the rings in case the suction was being broken) however neither helped. This pump was loud, and painful and did not allow me to pump enough milk.

I do not suggest to anyone to buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful and difficult to use","review":"I bought this pump because of the low price. I wish now that I had invested the extra dollars and bought a Medela (the same brand the hospital had me use when I was hospitalized for a week at 4 weeks post-partum). Anyway, this pump doesn't suction well and it is extremely painful to use. After trying repeatedly to get it to work well, I gave up and used the hand Medela pump the hospital gave me to take home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not reccomend this pump at all...","review":"I thought that with it being a dual pump it would be faster....wrong. I only found it to be weak, painful and a little on the loud side. I ended up springing the money for a Medula and what a difference. Please rent a pump before you buy one so you can feel what a difference a hospital grade pump makes.

I didn't use it often & it worked ok cause I had the time. When I went back to work I took me over 30 minutes to pump 6 oz. and the motor started rattling louder. I got it out quicker by hand! With the design it sucks milk into the motor & causes it to go bad. My employeer was upset with the time I took & I was afraid I would be forced to supplement. Then I decided to go for a better product. I got the Pump-N-Style by Medela & LOVE IT! It gets 8 oz. in 10 minutes! I wrote First Years and told them how their product was faulty & they returned my money. I will by First Years again, just not their pumps. In the long run, [price] for a pump is not that bad to get a good one unless you have a lot of time on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Decide","review":"I have been reading the reviews for this product and am having a very hard time deciding if I want to buy it or not. The lady called \\"baby enthusiast\\" has me so confused. First she praises the pump and now she hates it. I am so confused by her statements that I don't know what to think or do about it any more. I guess she should make a final decision and stick to it before she reviews again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double isn't always better...","review":"I've been using this pump for 6 weeks now and pretty much since day one, I've not been able to utilize the dual pump feature. If you have large breasts, it's VERY awkward regardless of the fact that it can move in many directions. The suction power was very good (at first) but I've noticed that it is losing that gradually! Not only is it losing the suction, one side has worse suction than the other. I'm still able to get milk out but I do wonder for how much longer. I really recommend going with a single pump if your breasts are cup D or larger. To be all fair, the bottles are great, the bag is somewhat cheesy, it does come with two different nipple adapters, and one cold pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very durable","review":"I loved it at first. It worked great. But after 3 1/2 months it just stopped working. It would be on but with no suction. I don't know why it just stopped working, I need to see if its still under warrenty. Maybe its just a fluke. Luckily a friend of mine gave me her Medela \\"Pump in Style\\". If you can afford the expensive Medela get it rather than take a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"suction stuck","review":"I wouldn't advise anyone to get this pump due to my experience with it. I tried using it twice, for one I dont like the suction it was a constant pull on my nipples. The second time I gave it a try it had pulled my nipples all the way through the chamber till my nipples were sticking out of the other end. It wounld not release me even when I turned it off. The baby was crying and I was crying running around the house looking for something to get these cups off my breast. I finally had to get some cooking oil and a sink of warm water. After that you can say i was swollen and sore. I wasted no time getting rid of that suction trap. PLEASE not go through what I did by getting this pump. You do better with hand expresstion, trust me I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"This pump is the best one I have ever tried. I highly recomend this one.After four children I needed a new one. I wish I had this from the begining! It works faster with the dual action, is very durable and is more comfortable than the others. The price makes this product a GREAT value. It's worth a lot more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three hands would possibly make this work","review":"After my first portable breast pump died I decided to try this one because I liked the idea of saving time with the double pumping option. I found that not only was the suction not as strong with this model, but it would take at least three hands to use the double pumping option. Perhaps I am simply uncoordinated, but it seems that I was only able to get both to work for a minute or so, before I would make a small move and would have to spend another 5 minutes trying to reposition. Once I was able to get things working properly I found it to be a painful experiance. I DO NOT recommend this for any person who has large breasts or is not a contortionist."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"If only I had read these reviews before spending money on this breast pump! I would give it 0 stars instead of 1 star if it was possible. The motor is loud and the breast pump feels more like a torture device. My nipples have never been so sore! I bought this for use with my first baby and had no idea what breast pumps were supposed to feel like. After the pain that this machine caused me, I went and bought a [inexpensive] manual pump because I knew it wouldn't suck my nipples through the bottle! Don't waste your money like I did! I should have done a lot more research before buying this horrible pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved this Pump","review":"Well, although most of the other reviews on this product are pretty bad, surprisingly, I loved this pump. The price was excellent. Under $60. It provided dual pumping and wasn't too noisy for me. It did have a \\"humming\\" sound and is not as quiet as it's more expensive counterparts, but when I returned to work and went into the bathroom to pump, I had no problem letting my co-workers know what the humming sound was that they were going to be hearing. I returned to work 4 weeks after my baby was born, worked 3 twelve hours shifts a week, and nursed until she was 10 1/2 months old. The pump lasted the entire time. Now, it did start to have some problems near the end. I had to hold it just right in order for it to work, but it still worked. For less than $60, it was an excellent pump, and I'm planning on buying another one for my next baby who is due in August.

Add to that the fact it does NOT even cover multi-dimensional arrays or any type of dynamic data handling. How do I store data if I don't want to cap how much data can be entered?Not only is the information lacking it is poorly structured.

The story follows a teenage girl whom I felt protective of and her mother whom I quickly felt sorry for. But the author put in more sex than was necessary. Simple allusions to it would have sufficed.The book reads slowly. It felt like it took along time to get to the first main event in the story. As to its historic nature, the author has pinned many details perfectly and she fills the story with facts and details that brings the story to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, but was left feeling depressed and unsatisfied. I like a book with characters that are more realistic and less perfect, but this book took it way to far; every character was corrupt. Even the young heroine gives up by the end.

There is no possible way this book could ever compare to Gone with the Wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over done and drawn out - disappointed","review":"I love to read, but the author has over done it. It's too long and drawn out. There are too many things going on. The majority of the book, I skimmed over and just flipped pages. I was not impressed. I only read the entire book because I wanted to find out what happened to Barbra and Roger. There is way to much going on and a lot of useless information given. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I feel that the author should have focused on the 2 main characters and their story, but the author just goes into so much non-sense in the book and just draws it out.

The history is a backdrop; that is, the setting is the early 18th Century.

Why she takes 200 pages to get to the point is beyond me.I did get a good sense of the characters. So if you like character development and stories about family relationships, you might like it. What I read of the book resembled WIDEACRE by Philippa Gregory. But if you are looking for historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"Based on the enthusiastic reviews, I was hoping for some substantive and entertaining historical fiction.

I picked this one up at a bookstore, intrigued by the historical fiction aspect of it and that it was about a reign (King George I) that wasn't often written about. I also picked it because I love a good personal mystery, and all the characters were hiding something.This book was very disappointing, because it's barely historical fiction. I think the author used the setting more for the manners and clothes, rather than fully exploring the rich possibilities the era gave. The most disappointing aspect was Roger's \\"big secret,\\" which is alluded to throughout the first half and is exposed in the second half. The secret is a terrible letdown, as most readers will guess it within the first few mentions. Moreover, the historical aspect regarding Roger's secret is totally ignored, and makes me wonder if the author did her research at all, or if she did research and just wanted us to put 20th century mores into 18th century characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a deep and meaningful book!!!","review":"This is on my list of favorite books ever. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The writing is superb. The plot is interesting and well paced. The characters are unforgettable. I have read this book 5 times and I will read it more. There is always something new in it, something that hits me as relevant to my life, every time I read it. It is much more thought provoking than a romance, but it is romantic. It is more story- and character-driven than most historical fiction, but the author brings you into the world of the past and makes you feel you've experienced it for yourself. Buy it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Fiction","review":"Karleen Koen does a great job of presenting a historical fiction novel in early 18th century London and Paris from 1715-1721. The story evolves around the central character, 15 year old Barbara Aderly. She is raised by her grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth. Her mother is pretty useless and selfish, worried more about how she can get more money, boyfriends, etc. Her mother Diana has decided that Barbara should wed the much older friend of the family, Earl Devane.The story is full of duels, deception and romance. It is over 750 pages, but does not drag on. I thoroughly enjoyed the great descriptors of the homes and clothing of the era. There are many characters that you grow to love. Although some reviewers have lamented the ending, there is a great sequel Now Face to Face, which finishes up the details. However, I would recommend reading the prequel, Dark Angels, first so that you get to know the Duchess and keep the history in chronological order."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"This was a great story, I could not put the book down.

But Charles has proven himself time again to be more than just a pianist, more than just a soul singer, more than just a songwriter. He is an artist who fuses a variety of sources into something that is uniquely his own.What's particularly interesting about this collection, drawn from a 28-year period, is the transition he makes. The early recordings take C&W songs and filter them through the jazz and soul stylings on which Charles made his name. The later recordings turn the formula inside-out, rearranging soul tunes with a C&W flair. Perhaps most impressive of all is that both work wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful range of feeling, tempo, style, and sound.","review":"After giving this set to my honey as a gift, we listened to all 4 CDs.

I'm amazed anyonewould attempt to understand the events of 9/11 by reading thistransparently simple minded account.

Hardly any history text book refers (or will ever refer) to such happenings. This book is interesting if you want to know a bit about many of the recent state sponsored criminal acts around the world. You are not likely to know such stuff through TV.However, Chomsky, being a linguist, finds it very hard to stay with easly readable language. This book is a compilation of his interviews. Even then, the sentences are so long and so confusing at times that it becomes difficult to figure out what he wants to say. His language is not easy for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, and inappropriately reviewed","review":"I really wonder if the Library Journal reviewer bothered to read the whole book, or just stopped when he found that Chomsky was departing from the post-9/11 unquestioning acceptance of the 'US vs. the evildoers' party line.\\"Chomsky condemns the attacks specifically and then suggests that the deaths are entirely the responsibility of capitalist globalization\\" - That is a complete misrepresentation; Chomsky repeats several times that Bin Laden and his ilk don't care about globalization. What has created anti-American sentiment around the world, in Chomsky's view, is a US foreign policy dictated by the interests of energy companies, and which supports brutal, anti-human rights dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries because it guarantees access to cheap oil.

Pero en realidad no es lo que esperaba. Cuando vi el título del libro, esperaba encontrar un relato detallado de los hechos que se desarrollaron durante los ataques del 11 de Septiembre, el secuestro de los aviones, la lucha heroica de los pasajeros del vuelo 93, etc..., pero en su lugar me encontré con una serie de afirmaciones y opiniones (por supuesto muy respetables) del autor sobre política internacional de los Estados Unidos para esa época. Es posible que al libro le hayan puesto el título equivocado; de hecho debería haberse llamado \\"Disertaciones sobre política internacional de los Estados Unidos en 2001\\", porque realmente es muy poco (o nada) lo que se lee sobre los hechos que ocurrieron el 11 de septiembre, que es lo que uno esperaría leer en un libro con este título."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un Comentario","review":"Mala traducción al español y además el formato electrónico en el Kindle es deficiente lo que no lo hace fácil de leer. Chomsky, buen pensador y crítico de lo que sucede considera que los hechos del 11 de septiembre tuvieron su origen en todas las actitudes terroristas y desnaturalizadas de la política norteamericana en muchos de los conflictos en los que participó en el siglo XX, especialmente los de Afganistan y Rusia.Un pensamiento que hace meditar al lector, es aquel en el que menciona que en USA es terrorismo todo lo que hacen los demás contra ellos, pero no aceptan calificar como acciones terroristas o como violencia si sucede lo contrario (patrocinados por su gobierno como en el caso de Nicaragua y los \\"contras\\" o el bombardeo a una fabrica farmaceutica en Sudan y numerosos ejemplos más).Preferible leer un libro suyo que una recopilación de entrevistas repetitivas como es este caso."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many mistakes - so little time!","review":"Many reviewers miss the lack of substance herein while breathlessly sharing its contents.

Yes, there is a vast and growing anti-western movement in the Muslim word. There are millions of Muslims now who would praise Allah for the chance of blowing up amerikan womenand children. Why?

He was Rimsky-Korsakov's student at the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1879. After graduation in 1882, he began teaching music, having Rachmaninov and Scriabin among his students. He became a conductor, and was appointed Director of the Imperial Chapel in 1895.The 1st of his 2 Piano Trios was published in 1894, and the 2nd was composed in 1905, a year before his death. The 1st Trio is one of his best-known chamber compositions, while the 2nd is far less known. However, both show Arensky's skills in writing instrumental compositions. The 1st Trio seems more dynamic, with nicer melodies and themes.The trios are performed by 3 members of the well-known Borodin Quartet, taking at this occasion the name Borodin Trio.

I ordered the Large set for my five year old (she's very tall for her age). Somewhere they need to do a better job of being clear on what color you will receive, or give you a choice. I did not even see purple listed. With that said, the clubs and bag seem like quality peices, well constructed and weighted. The stand bag looks like it will hold up for a few years. I think this set is well worth the price of $69.00.

It is remarkable that a transmission in a translated text over a thousand years old can be so profound. I have been reading and living with this book, and Huang Po's presence, for decades and the humor, as penetrating as the Marx Brothers, the generosity of spirit, and the merciless and elegantly paired down exposition of Zen are a continual source of joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen teaching of Huang-Po","review":"The introduction to this book is a good overview and introduction to Zen for beginners.The notes provided by the translator are very erudite and helpful.This is an awsome text from a very enlightened Master. He continually refutes ceremony and intellectualism, pointing instead to the ineffable nature of Zen. Avoiding dualism and concentrating on immediacy, the Master says, reveals the path to follow the Way. This approach to \\"Reality\\" will be very foreign to the uninitiated Western mind.

This is one of three books I'd want on a desert island.Don't be put off by its compression.This book was translated by John Blofield in the 1950s and appears to remain the only English translation.

And what results is a picture of fusion that is simultaneously melodic and funky, spacy but arranged, and almost never easy. Yet it doesn't really sound much at all like the music of Miles Davis during the same period, and that's a compliment, only because most non-Davis fusion I had heard before this was either incoherent or begging for the pop charts. Plus it's refreshing that most of these tracks have no guitar, putting them closer to a gospel/African/soul base but with avant-garde touches, all with thick, warm sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I read the synopsis for this book in a \\"Best of..\\" book list for 2001. It's described as a psychological thriller about a psychiatrist who saves a man from drowning. The catch is the man he saves was once a client of his who he inadvertently helped send away to a correctional institute because of damaging testimony.Sounds good right? I missed it. I didn't find the book tense at all. Every time it started to work towards something I thought was going to be remotely suspenseful, it petered out. I was really disappointed. In fact about the highest praise I can give it is that at just over two hundred pages it reads like a halfway decent short story. A not terribly exciting short story, but a short story never the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly book + Kindle Formatting Problems","review":"Admittedly, I chose this book in a rush - I had read about Barker's WWI novels and chose the one set in present day. It sounded intriguing in the description, but I found the premise to be ridiculous and the writing shallow. Additionally, my Kindle copy had all sorts of formatting problems - I don't know how much of the book was missing (I read it in about 5 evenings). There were a lot of sentences cut off in the middle, and paragraphs cut off without punctuation (I don't think the writer was trying to be avant-garde). I never experienced this before with any Kindle book. Overall, not worth the money - too short, too uninteresting, too unbelieveable - plus the formatting problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book reads like an awesome psychological journey!

I thought it a good chance to be introduced to Pat Barker who seems to get such rave reviews. This is basically a two person character study in the guise of a psychological thriller that is not all that thrilling. I found the store interesting enough and the writing crisp, but thesecondary plot of Tom Seymour and his wife seems lost as she walks out of his life just when he is consumed with this former child patient who returns to extract his revenge. Or does he? I will give this a marginal thumbs up because the two main characters are well written and vivid, with Danny Miller the tormented child murderer an excellent character. But in the end I did not find this very satisfying to listen to and doubt I would have finished it if I had picked it up as a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Real Impressed !","review":"The book is very wordy, but vague. It should not take 1200 or so pages to explain it's contents. The book does not readily get to the point. The chapters on SQL were very poorly written. The syntax for commands were not adequately explained and were horribly intertwined in the examples, such that it was difficult to derive the real syntax for individual clauses and commands. Chapters on modeling the database via ER and EER were also vague and written very poorly. Examples throughout the book used coincidental values and scenarios that mask out the true nature of the concepts being proposed. The author should have taken the time to put in \\"meaningful\\" examples. The exercises at the end of each chapter do not define the scope of questions being asked. They are too open ended. If it were not a requirement that I use this book, I would not waste my money on it!

The writers pretend that such realities as deadlines and budget do not exist. The text is filled with Entity Relationship diagrams that must add 200% to the cost of their designs.

I would suggest this book to people who are not dealing everyday in db-areas. It's a full starting compendium on db theory, technology, design methodology. The arguments are not deeply explained in detail, but the aim of the book is to give the big picture view. The didactical approach is well organized during the exposition and fulfilled with many examples. The language style adopted is easy, the graphical design gives a soft perception of heavy-weighted arguments. The explanation follows a practical way with few formalism applied even if the scientific rigour is always mantained.

The title promised an unhappy ending, and the other books that had been chosen for us to read this year were not my favorites to say the least; however, after reading the book I find myself having really enjoyed it. A Lesson Before Dying was full of emotion and a story that contains a message readers will not soon forget. This book contains writing that descriptive and colourful as well as historically accurate.

Personally, I read the book twice and it still gets to me how much I like it. The author Ernest J. Gaines was so good it made you feel what everyone else felt. I rate this book five out five. His writing was making us feel what people felt on death row.My favorite chapter was 19 the Christmas program because of everything that was going on and Bok pointing at everything and also the kids when they were messing up the line. My least favorite Chapter was was the last chapter when Jefferson dies because you know that he didn\`t do nothing and killed an innocent man because they were racists.

This is just another book written by an angry African American author, who still feels the \\"pain\\" from being persecuted because of his race. In fact the author wrote it because he found that there weren't many books written by African Americans in the public library.

First off, this book does not take place in a cajun community, it is actually of the creole which dates back to the old-south antebellum style of living. Secondly, I have never enjoyed a book less than I did this one. It's long, drawn out cry against racism is as dry as the Sahara, and I merely felt annoyance at the two central characters, Jefferson and Grant, for their reluctance to show feelings toward others than themselves.

Gaines, presents a young African-American man, named Jefferson Cole, who is sentenced to death. He was accused of committing a crime that cannot be forgiven. Grant Wiggins is his only hope to become free.

This book was very intresting. I could not believe that one man could be charged with murder with no proof. Everyone played a good role in the book. I feel that this novel was explaining the ways of the old south. It expressed the racism that went on between black and whites. Racism is still expressed today. If I was Jefferson I would feel intimdated, sad, alone, and very angry. Many people didn't back him up at the beging but at the~~ when it was two late they realized Jefferson died like a man not a poor fool or a hog. This book was very infasnating and unique.~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prejudice Kills!","review":"A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest Gaines shows a classic case of prejudice in that existed in southern states in the 1940s. For a young man to be classified as a hog, and shown no respect is a prime example of the ruthlessness. Jefferson did not have a fair trail. What ever happened to the United States law that states every man is innocent until proven guilty. The outstanding prejudice of the small Cajun town send a man who was not rightfully trailed to death. Who made us God, and how are they to try and do Gods' work. Prejudice is a bad discrimination among people that not only hurt others, but hurt ourselves. Prejudice divides communities, teaches children to hate, and weakens the economy. Ernest Gaines shows us through the townspeople that prejudice just makes things worst. Jefferson was not killed by his actions, but by the prejudice of the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentary on A Lesson Before Dying","review":"The book was very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in African American Culture in the 1940's. The part that interest me the most was when Jefferson's Nannan cooked a meal for him, and they got to sit down at the table and eat with Jefferson. At first Jefferson just stared at his plate and would not eat, because he was depressed. This made his nannan very sad. Grant pulled him to the side and had a talk with him,and he sat back down and began to eat his food. Thus, making his nannan happy after all there struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable but I was left a little confused.","review":"Arter reading the book I felt that there were a lot of unanswered questions.I kept asking myself whatever happened to..?

Young black man (Jefferson) happens to be an innocent bystander at a liquor store when two men attempt a robbery and gun shots break out. Jefferson is charged with the crime - he is unable to prove his innocence in a town where a black man is guilty before proven innocent - and he is sentenced to death. Jefferson's godmother realizes that Jefferson has no way out of his fate and wants him to hold his head high before his death. She enlists the help of Grant, a young local school teacher to mentor Jefferson during the time he has left. At different times in this book, you are nauseous over the racism - you feel the pain and suffocation of the main characters - you are inspired at their determination despite the hopelessness. The author places you right at the scene and you live this story. This was one of the most moving books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing gained","review":"A PC novel.

I won't go into the details of the story as they're written above, but there is one chapter that must be mentioned.The chapter titled \\"Jefferson's Diary\\" is the highlight of this novel. It is written without punctuation and with no grammatic consideration. This is where Gaines' ability to write shines through. This chapter is a much needed rest from the previous mundane chapters.I did not find the novel appealing in anyway. The protagonist is weak and annoying. The story drags on and on as Grant tries to help Jefferson mature out of his mental childhood. Metaphors and other literary techniques are present, but the novel is so boring that it's not even worth noticing them. The author's writing style is noteworthy, but again the slow pace and seemingly useless details overshadow the style. Don't pick it up unless you really need to, and if that's the case, get some kind of summary."},{"rating":"2","title":"gave me a warm feeling in my innards","review":"This was a pretty powerfull book that seemed to take a new approach at some pretty old, yet still controversial sublect matter. Its not a book filled with explosive action (besides the first two pages), and its not fast moving. Yet the pages still move smoothly and hold the attention. The book takes a realistic approach at what its like to be on death row, and what its like to be wrongfully accused. How do you change a person who thinks they are nothing but a pig, fattening up for the slaughterhouse, into a man, and a representative of a race. This is the main problem discussed in the book. But the book has more to it than that. It shows the struggle that blacks had to go through not much more than fiftey years ago. It shows how they began to break free of the mold that they had been stuck in prviously, emerging as the great individuals that they always had been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Recomend","review":"I was dissapointed after reading this book.

They were not friends at the begining. But after they spend much time together, they became real friend. Grant was afraid of facing to Jefferson's death. And Jefferson was afraid of his own death. They were black and grew up in the black society, separated from white people. Although Grant graduated University, he was still segregated by the white men. And one verdict charged not only Jefferson's life but also his grandmother's or Grant's life, and many black people prayed for Jefferson when he died. Jefferson's lesson before dying was completed at the ending. I felt so sad and strange after I read this novel.

Often we find ourselves in the midst of a situation not understanding what a true turning point it actually is until much later. Grant represents many of us at different points of our life. This book is far richer after reflecting on it than during the course of reading it - just like life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a 16 year old!","review":"\\"A Lesson Before Dying\\" Began with a fantastic foundation, a man allegedly murders three people during a robbery and is now on death row. This is the type of story any junior in high school would crave to read, including myself. Then the actual story begins and completely bores any reader my age to sleep. Grant criticizes society and dreads being treated like an inferior thus giving the novel a theme. The issue of injustice and facing responsibility is a great subject matter to base a book upon, until an adolescent must read it, which is then that the book falls out of play. This novel by Ernest J. Gaines is written with precision, consideration and righteousness and would be considered a magnificent novel by many full-fledged persons, but the second it enters the hands of a 16year old, is the second it is set down never intended to be picked up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book blows","review":"A lesson before dying to me was not a very interesting book. My reasoning for saying that is because the book seemed slow. It was like they were trying to focus on one thing for i dont how many chapters. Some good things i liked about the book were the differences that it showed between the blacks and the whites. The book showed good explanation on how the young black children were educated and treated. In my opinion i thought thew book would have been better if it would have been a mystery of what boys were shot or who killed the boy. That would have kept me more interested then the way this story was told."},{"rating":"2","title":"All too familiar historical storyline.","review":"Gaines did a wonderful job in telling this story. He made the characters very real, average, every day type of people. The type of characters anyone could follow and want to know more about. However this story has been told too many times before for a reader not to know the outcome. Particularly, a black reader. Enjoyable reading but for my point of view I am ready to read a story about a white man, committing the same crime, in the 1940's or today, with an all white jury and the same outcome. This story makes you ask yourself, does such a story exist? or will I ever read such a story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"A Lesson Before Dying is one of those rare books that stays with you months after you've read it; the kind that teaches you things about yourself. It is a moving exploration of the problems that have plauged black men in America in the last half of the 20th century. It uncovers deep wounds, and although it offers no quick cure, the kindness, strength, and goodness of the characters signals hope for them as well as for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring from a 15 year old P.O.V","review":"From a 15 year old p.o.v., this book was boring and the plot was underdeveloped and it did not seem as though the author took a lot of time for details."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magnificent ending is worth enduring the dull beginning!","review":"Overall, I would have to say A Lesson Before Dying is a wonderful book. It teaches lessons about love, family, life, death, and friends (just to name a few). I was quite skeptical at the beginning of the novel; it was dull, slow, and uninteresting. Luckily, I stuck with it and am glad I did so! Grant and Jefferson, characters within the novel, under went a change that is uncomprehendable. The book is remarkable simply by watching these two men rise to their full potential. I highly recommend every human being to read this striking novel. IT'S AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed","review":"I was decidedly \\"meh\\" about this book. I think it addresses several important issues -- the plight of young black men in the early 40s, the state of the justice system at the time, the usefulness of religion -- but I think those issues could have been addressed in a better way. The main character, Grant, is not particularly likable. He's bitter, unmotivated, and at times, just plain mean. In fact, most of the characters in the book are not particularly likable. Most of them appear to be downright miserable. A sign of the times? I don't know, but you'd think *someone* in the novel would be a joyful person. Jefferson, the imprisoned man, is an interesting character, but even his turn-around is a little anti-climatic. With the build-up of the novel and the title and the praise and all, I expected much more of an epiphany at the end. For me, the pay-off just wasn't there. If I hadn't been reading this for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lesson Before Dying","review":"In his inspirational fiction, Ernest J. Gaines has explored the most important qualities of soul. Freedom has been a major theme in his works. In A Lesson Before Dying dignity is lifted up. This is a very powerful and touching story. The biggest thing is the lesson it teaches. The reader learns an important lesson about life, family, and education along with Grant and Jefferson. I would recommend this book to anyone, it's very easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audible Version Drastically Abridged","review":"We were very frustrated by the Audible version of this work. It is well performed and well read, but when they abridged the work, they really cut it. Sometimes 3 or 4 cuts within a single page of the original. It is very frustrating trying to follow along. I cannot recommend purchasing the Audible version of Lesson Before Dying."},{"rating":"2","title":"And indepth, deceivingly long story","review":"I have to admit, this isn't the worst in-class reading assignment I've ever had to sit through. I probably wouldn't read it independently, as it simply isn't my genre of interest, but that doesn't mean I disliked reading it.The book is beautifully written. Ernest J. Gaines is a very descriptive author, with amazing character development. You really gain a wonderful understanding of the characters and their relationship with each other. It is also a great depiction of the time period it is based in, and has a perfect point of view from the african community during that time.However, the book often seems hard to follow. It's drawn out, and you may very well be half way through the book before you actually find the main point of the story. As such, I would most likely never have been able to finish it on my own. It isn't very engaging, although it does teach great lessons that everyone should learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great buy","review":"It was easy to order, and a good price. And it got to my house exactly when i wanted it. I recomend everyone who can use the same sender I did, should. I garauntee they will be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad read","review":"While sometimes very slow-paced, I found the book A Lesson Before Dying to be enjoyable overall. The narrator is often pessimistic, and hard to connect with. The characters are fairly likeable, and it's an easy read. Some parts seem to repeat themselves, especially when it comes to visiting Jefferson, but you do see the characters grow and change throughout the novel. Interestingly enough, there are many items that are symbolic and foreshadowing of other events. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable handling of subject matter done better elsewhere","review":"I was eager to read this book after reading rave reviews, but in the end was disappointed with the author's fragmented story-lines and character development which too often dead ended before satisfying my curiosity. I appreciated the authors insights and development of intra-racial issues between Grant, Jefferson, Vivian and the other inhabitants of the plantation. Jefferson's diary and Paul's visit to the school house are powerful images that are well told by the author. Overall, however, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" far out shines this book's handling of the subject matter -- and it was told from a white perspective. Nice try, but no cigar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there more to this story than what's in the book?","review":"This is an engaging read and touches on some important issues, but it doesn't quite address any of them definitively. I found myself fascinated by the main characters. I always wanted to know what was going to happen and that kept me turning the pages. However, I was never convinced that the characters Jefferson and Grant were really connecting as much as Grant believed they were. Grant's romantic interest with Vivian gave an interesting human dimension to the story but never seemed an integral part of the main story. In short, I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but always wanted more information than was forthcoming. Perhaps that's realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"This novel gives a good depiction of what life must have been like for a black community in southern Louisiana before civil rights. The writing is restrained and unsentimental, almost to the point of bleakness. I wish Gaines would not be so clipped and obviously self-edited in his style. Jefferson redeems himself and also the narrator, as well as Paul, the deputy. It is a novel about hope and pride, not just for black people, but for everyone who faces a moral and spiritual dilemma."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyably fast read through a deep topic","review":"Was I ever pleasantly surprised at what a fast read with such deep implicaitons was contained between the covers of this book! It is set in the lives of a condemed man and his loved ones in Louisiana in the early 1950's. The book begins with Jefferson rail-roaded for a murder due to the color of his skin, rather then the evidence. Even his own defense attorney refers to him as a 'hog' in his closing argument. This affront to Jefferson's humanity sets both the community and him on a quest for respect and resolution before his impending execution. The social injustice is haunting and the resolutions are memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put it down","review":"This was my first Lori Foster book. I loved every minute of it.

They were pretty cheap, but I regret not paying a little more for more softer chewier ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative, Creative, Brings a smile to your face","review":"I wasn't sure at first: hip-hop music with SAT words in it? But listening to the CD changed my mind (and my son's) immediately. The lyrics are clever and clean, and put the words in a context that my son understands.He took the SAT's this spring and he's still listening to these songs. It's a great way to expand your vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must if you love the parade","review":"If you like the Spectro Magic parade that is currently running in Walt Disney World, you'll love this CD because it is the soundtrack to the parade.

Other then that, it's a great collector's item."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the noise?","review":"The pictures in this book are great for my 1 year old son. He can easily spot the fire truck, taxi or police car, etc. But the description for this book was misleading. From reading the editorial review, I expected a different sound when pressing the \\"tire\\" on each page. Instead the noise generated was unrecognizable and the same, no matter what page you are on. I thought my book was defective. I would have returned it but my son likes it just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a hankie handy","review":"Jill Henry can write to pull at your heartstrings--you'll need a hankie for the emotional ending.Jill's writing seems to be a little less sure when it comes to plotting. Hannah's Heart seems to be made up of two unrelated plots, neither of which could have carried the book alone. She seems to have stuck them together, one after the other. That said, however, the story is still a good read worth 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scarlet Cord","review":"THE SCARLET CORD by Deborah Raney is a poignant story that tugs on the heartstrings of every woman. I laughed and I cried with the heroine, often seeing myself in many of her struggles and victories. I cheered for her and I understood her prayers.The depth of the heroine's spiritual growth in the midst of turmoil and pain is commendable. She chooses to love, a choice that encourages her growth as a woman of God.Once again Deborah Raney has proved her merit as an inspirational writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver","review":"My daughter doesn't like mint so I import Tom's Silly Strawberry toothpaste from the US to the UK twice a year.

As a Rosary Artisan, I found the book to be vital to my craft (and my spirituality) as it reveals the meanings behind the beads from different cultures and religions. The pictures are stunning, the writing is fluid and beautiful, and the instructions/implementations are user friendly.I highly highly highly recommend this book without any sort of reservation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and funny","review":"This book is a scream, if only for the descriptions of life in the monied set at the end of the 19th century. I first read this book as a child and still think it's quite charming.Plot: A childless young man agrees to take care of his 2 nephews and is utterly overwhelmed by the boys' boisterousness. At the same time he is also trying to romance a lovely young lady, and of course he wants her to think he is great father material, even though in private he thinks the boys are little monsters.You've probably seen this plot in movies and sitcoms, perhaps this book was the original which inspired them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. I've read it several times over the years and my fourteen year-old daughter has read it aloud, to me, twice. We laugh ourselves silly, re-read countless passages and use some of the phrases in everyday life when being nutty. It's such a worthwhile read and anyone with children can appreciate how spot-on Habberton's description of little boys (who are well-intended) can get into trouble (with hysterical results).

While the pacing seems to trip up in places, \\"In Absentia\\" provides several emotional thrills with a tiny dose of heartbreak - but that's Fringe for you. Dialogue does the heavy lifting plotwise, but the heart of this show has always been in the quiet moments, the subtle looks, and the powerful cast chemistry, and this episode is no exception.With only a few episodes to go, Fringe promises excitement around every turn, and I am thrilled to be along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"epic show ever","review":"Very intense season!!

It wasn't about monsters as much as about ideas and family. This episode is no different. This show is for those who want intelligent stories and you get that here. As the recordists are trying to perserve history by recorning it. But should they start making it? You will find out in this episode. Fringe is out on the edges of tv still, because it dared to stick to it's guns and not become a simple show that was a space opera.

She and Claire Danes (Homeland) are the two best actresses on TV . . . ever.Torv was the most fun when her parallel world counterpart was on the show -- someone whose every gesture and move were readily distinguishable from Olivia's. And, in either role, Torv listening is more entertaining than other actors emoting or delivering lines. She is THERE and her face subtly shows an inner life and reaction to all that occurs.I'll miss Fringe, but I'll miss Torv even more if she doesn't come up soon with another series that is well-written enough to allow her to show what she can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extra season that was pretty mediocre","review":"I personally believe the series would have been better without the last season.

This is one of those plots that just plain blows your mind! It killed me.Some here complain about the poor streaming. I can only say that it probably has nothing to do with Amazon and more to do with a person's bandwidth. We live out in the rurals and sometimes our internet is crappy, and to watch a movie or a TV episode and have it start and stop a dozen times, is just too much. So, we now start a show and then pause it for 15 minutes to allow it to buffer. After that, it's smooth sailing. I figure, what the heck, so it takes an hour to watch the episode this way, but it would if we were watching it straight from the TV, but we would have to suffer through or fast forward through the commercials. This is better. You just have to find a way to work with the system or beat it at it's own game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"I was unable to watch my local FOX affiliate because of their horrible business policy of extorting $ from (FOX Broadcasting) COMCAST's competitors.

Were you waiting with baited breath to see if David Robert Jones would actually destroy both universes? Did you have those \\"Ah-Hah!\\" moments where past events suddenly took on new meaning with each new twist in turn in the ever-developing plot?Me too.Well sorry, Fringe fans. All of that is gone in Season Five. Welcome to a dark future timeline where the observers are the bad guys and all of the Fringe characters are losing every last shred of integrity and nobility they once had.

Gone are the fantastic events that required the quirky team of Olivia, Walter, and Peter to make some incredible discovery.

For me the series is already over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete misfire","review":"In the grand tradition of Lost, Fringe's producers abandoned their core audience and went against virtually everything else they'd carefully set up (story- and legend-wise) in the first 4 seasons to create a ridiculously sub-standard storyline, which could be subtitled \\"The Search for Walter's Tapes.\\" What had been an amazingly eloquent and virile 4-year run ended with the thud of this disastrous season. Forgive me for pulling a Pam Ewing, but I'm going to consider this entire 5th season a dream (nightmare, really) and stick with seasons 1 through 4 and never speak of this terrible calamity (and total slap to the Fringe faithful) again.

So you might understand that I was thrilled when I first popped one of these in my mouth and thought, \\"Wow! This tastes just like Starbursts!\\" That only lasted for about three seconds, at which point the chewy globule lost any semblance of flavor except for one reminiscent of a gag-inducing chalkiness and became so sticky, I thought it was going to pull my teeth out.

The monster is symbolic of the threat of nuclear war, as in the original film. The appearance of a great many other Toho Productions monsters brings back many green memories of my childhood; Saturday night horror movies and the giant rubber monsters that dominated them. The scripts were good, though. The new film, by contrast, had great F/X, but a rubber script, if you get my meaning.:-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good ,but not the best","review":"This book is pretty good but not as good as Marc Cerasini's other books. It does have some good parts to it. I enjoyed the part where Godzilla battles a tornado and I also like the ending battle with Godzilla, Mothra & King Ghidora. There are some not so great parts to it. Kamacuras do NOT eat people!!!Over all, I thought it was rather like a real godzilla movie, not great but not bad! Dylan, 10 years old"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Godzilla adventure ever.","review":"This book is amazing and my first of reading the Godzilla books. Marc Cerasini has done an excellant job at bringing back some of the monsters from the Godzilla movies. Cerasini's knowledge of military hardware is astonishing. Cerasini also has done a good job at centering the action on G-Force and particulary Kip Daniels. I loved the parts were the military are fighting the monsters and when the monsters are destroying a city. The monsters (Kamacuras, Rodan, Mothra, Varan, Godzilla, and King Ghidrah) are depicted realistic. Cerasini has made this book (among others) a must see for Godzilla fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK!!!!","review":"This is a good book because Mark Cerasini's got the guts to make a whole series of Godzilla! The story is good, too. I give it two thumbs up. They should turn this one into a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The king of novels about the King of Monsters","review":"As good as Godzilla Returns--Cerasini's first book in this series--was, Godzilla 2000 blows it away! He creates a globe-trotting adventure featuring many of Toho's best-known monsters, but never loses sight of the human element. The reader gets a genuine feel for what it must be like to live (and die) in a world being torn apart by giant monsters. The members of G-Force are colorful and distinct from one another, and we develop a real affection for them and the other characters in the book. We also develop a certain amount of sympathy for Godzilla and the other monsters, seeing them not as evil, but as forces of nature. It's also fun seeing characters from the last book show up as minor characters in this one. Godzilla 2000 can be read on its own, but reading the books in sequence makes for a richer, more rewarding experience in terms of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for fans of the Big G!","review":"Both new and old Godzilla fans will enjoy this exciting, fast paced novel detailing the monster's return to Tokyo, forty years after his last appearance. By creating an original sequel to the 1954 film, Cerasini is able to introduce Godzilla to new readers who might only know Godzilla by reputation, without having to recap the entire movie series. Hard-core fans who might be upset that this book and its sequels ignore the events on the big screen will be pleased at how thoroughly Cerasini has captured the spirit at the heart of the Godzilla stories. While this novel and the ones that follow are written for a teen audience -- and feature young adult protagonists as a result -- adults will find them just as entertaining. If Tom Clancy featured giant monsters in his books, they still wouldn't be this good! Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"This book was surprisingly good, though I was a bit dissapointed that the book's main villian, King Ghidorah, was only in the last fifty or sixty pages of the novel. Also, I was dissapointed with the Varan monster, I would rather have seen it replaced with either Mechagodzilla or Gigan, or maybe even King Ghidorah...imagine an ending where Godzilla, Rodan, Ghidorah, and the ship Raptor One fight in NYC!!! But overall, a great book. I especially loved how the sub-plot with Rodan was done, and the ending to Rodan's story was surprisingly moving"},{"rating":"1","title":"As asteroids come towad Earth, Godzilla, Rodan and morefight","review":"I rate this book a 2 beacause the monsters were boring and less detailed then Mark Cerasini's third book, Godzilla at World's End.

Bisson is one of science fiction's funniest satirists since Kurt Vonnegut announced that he isn't a science fiction writer (My humble apologies to Vonnegut - you were and still are - a science fiction writer.). He paints a satirical look at the future that is as riveting as any I've read in an early William Gibson novel or any of Jack Womack's. Bisson's main protagonist Hank Shapiro comes across as a befuddled, amusing Ulysses searching for the Holy Grail (a Hank Williams LP!) in a dystopic American future. I eagerly await Bisson's subsequent efforts in humorous science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I stopped reading it after the first hundred pages. After that I just jumped to the last 2 chapters to see what happened, but I really didnt care anymore.I read Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" years ago and loved it. When this book was touted to be similiar to 'Fahrenheit', I expected another interesting romp. Boy, was I wrong.The only saving grace was its alternate chapters where we can read of the early days of the anti-old art movement (which is why I give this book 2 stars instead of 1). But even that didnt hold my attention long.If I can only use one word to describe the book, it would be:- BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good candidate for deletion","review":"Certainly, there are elements of Tom Robbins and Douglas Adams and Terry Gilliam in this book, but this is less like a story and more like a collection of interesting elements. The plot gets more and more nonchalantly weirder to the point of absurdity, so I was able to skim the last 50 pages without any worry that I'd miss anything important. I believe that the book could be improved by moving the interspersed \\"history lesson\\" to an appendix rather than forcing the reader to wade through it on the chance there's something interesting within."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is very little historic value to this book","review":"I am a historian who a focuses on Reformation issues, and I wrote many papers over the last three years on the history of witchcraft from an anthropological point of view. There are several wonderful studies of witches and witchcraft, mainly by Protestants during the time of the religious upheavals and the witch hunts (Cotton Mather has some interesting ideas). Montague Summers' writings were trying to revive a dying belief, and he was a complete crackpot (no, not a professional term, of course). He believed in witches entirely, though felt that there were very few true witches left.

The book was a depiction of the legal system, religion and prejudice (in this case Native American Indians) and how those systems and laws affected women in times past, some with good intentions in mind but, because it put all the trust and power in the men folk, also allowed abuse toward women in general but especially widowed woman.

The shcolarship is never pretentious or dull, and the stories are told with a sensitivity that avoids any awkwardness in dealing with subjects like magic.

Great photography by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracks easily, but the price makes that irrelevant","review":"There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points:- End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you bite on the balls accidentally- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. Not so cold.","review":"I bought a couple of these for shin splints. They're a good idea but not very well executed. They're difficult and awkward to get on. It's basically an ice pack inside a stretchy sleeve as opposed to a single integrated unit. The ice pack is only sewn to the sleeve at the very top and bottom, so the rest of it is loose and likes to bunch up. Also, it never feels particularly cold, even fresh out of the freezer. It's cold, yes, but it's almost like it's so insulated that you can't feel it very much. Doesn't last very long either. I like the idea of compression + cold, and this delivers on the compression, but not so much on the cold. Better than nothing, I'm sure, but I'm now shopping for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These Shin Ice sleeves are a great idea, however I think buyers should be aware of a couple of things... Definitely buy a size larger than you think you will need. These are very hard to pull on, especially when frozen. There is much too little \\"ice\\" in the sleeves. Not nearly enough to give shins a good icing for 15 minutes. Loses coolness rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor implementation","review":"As a guy who used to syran wrap frozen peas to his shin, this seemed like the perfect device. The neoprene sleeve holding an icepack to my shin was a nice step up. It worked great for about a week, then one of the ice compartments started to leak, then another, then another. After a couple of weeks, only about half the ice compartments had fluid left. Nothing was obviously poking holes in the ice pack, so I can't figure out where the leaks came from. My guess is that an improvement in the plastic quality/thickness for the icepack would solve the problem. Overall a great idea, if only it were more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped","review":"This product is ok, however there are a few things I didn't like about it:1. The ice pockets are so small that they warm up easily after being put in the fridge (as suggested by product pamphlet).2. If you do freeze it to avoid that first problem, the sleeve is very inflexible and consequently incredibly difficult to put on.3. I felt that it was smaller than listed on the site. I'd go a size up and if it's too big, you can always still use it lying down or duct tape it to fit better. I can't really use mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great just needs to be broken in a time or two","review":"I agree this product is a little difficult to get on the first few times but after that it is perfect. It stays snug and cold. I bought the other shin ice that wraps around and it doesn't seem to be very cold. This one stays cold longer. All it needs is a couple times of stretching it around your calf and it will fit. I have large calves for a woman and it works great now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but...","review":"Make sure you measure exaclty. If you measure too small it wont fit over your foot. Then in order to fit over your foot, you get a larger size and it is too big for your leg. Not enough compression. Didn't hold ice cold long enough for me, might be long enough for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaks Directly To The Inner Person","review":"I found this book uplifting beyond comment - although Anna's personal turmoil, her claustrophobic environment, and the tragedy of the story don't necessarily support the word \\"uplifting\\", Anna's determination, willingness to grow and escape limitations, and her unspoken desire to know life as Divine was just what my own hungry soul needed to read. Trollope has once again presented a real woman from the very inside out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare insight into - and development of - a woman's issue","review":"The Rector's Wife is a wonderful story. Yes, there is the occasional glitch; yes it may seem that a deus ex machina delivers Anna from her major problem. But the story is absolutely fascinating. It takes you into one family, into one woman's mind and heart, in an unforgettable manner. Rich characters and understanding. I absolutely fell in love with Anna. (And her unappreciative husband made me appreciate mine all the more.) A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera in a Box","review":"To her credit, Trollope does give us insight into the isolation and invisibility of the life of a rector's wife in a small town in England. However, most of her characters are not developed, so that there are no grounds for the actions they take. The tidy way she gets Anna out of her troubles in the end could land her a job writing for \\"The Young and The Restless\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The thinking woman's Danielle Steele","review":"This is drama with well drawn characters that I can relate to and care about. I especially enjoyed the main character's self growth. This rector's wife realizes that her life is a poor fit for herself and her youngest child, who still lives at home. The steps she takes to find meaning and make a better life for herself and her daughter were realistic and, because they were realistic, inspiring. I really connected with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning and middle, disappointing ending","review":"This story of a frustrated rector and his equally frustrated wife is realistic, but also quite witty. The main character has always thought herself as a captive of her husband's fate, however, when one of her children is bullied at school and finances do not allow a transfer to another school, she takes matters into her own hands. As she changes, so do the attitudes of people toward her. Unfortunately, as events approach an inevitable (probably explosive) confrontation between husband and wife, the author creates a truly disappointing \\"cop out\\" and, in my opinion, unrealistic ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mindless Read","review":"What a waste of time! And I read the whole thing...why? Maybe because I wanted to see if it would get any better but it didn't, and I dislike giving up on a novel. Another shallow tale which jumped from one fanciful event to another. How convenient an ending for Anna to \\"get on with her life\\" minus the difficulties of a loveless marriage.

Unfortunately, a cartoon is still considered as something for kids in majority of people in the States. If you are one of them, please consider Tezuka manga (comics) as a new media, novels drawn in pictures. It is a new media that enables you to enjoy a story without sitting in front of a TV, or saving your time to go to a cinema, or taking less than half of your time to read a novel. Once again, this is not for small kids. This story deals with some deep issues, such as meaning of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tezuka for Mature Readers","review":"I have been a Tezuka fan since long, but this is the first time I buy a manga (comic book), and the first time I get to know the character of Black Jack.I really recommend this one for mature readers, since the topics are adult oriented and hard to take for children.

The design of these lights to run off of a single LED (Light Emitting Diode) is impressive.

Two days after applying second Algaefix my fish were listless and at the water's surface. I quickly did a water change but it was too late.

The thing about hanguns that a lot of people forget is that if you have to use a handgun for defensive purposes, it will be within 5 feet, and will be over within 3 seconds (on average). Thus, having a gun and getting it into the fight fast is critical, not whether or not you can hit a bullseye at 25 meters, or fire off 17 rounds in a row. Also, the thing most people forget is that during a confrontation, if the bad guy grabs your autopistol, you might not be able to fire it again, because the slide can stick. With a revolver, you don't have to worry about that. If the bad guy gets his hand on your gun, it is much harder to render the gun ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review of a Great Book!","review":"The seminal work on the snubbie revolver providing great insight to its use.

The backpack is really adorable so it's unfortunate that it turned out to be defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"double check edge quality!!","review":"I was really looking forward to using this pan but upon inspecting it after it arrived, there were defects in the steel on the pan edge by the handle. It looked (and felt!) like someone had hacked at it resulting in metal burrs which literally cut my finger. I shouldn't have to keep bandaids at hand due to a pan.

He could have said it all--with examples--in a 20-minute snippet. Just three points sum it up:1. If you want to do something 'disruptive', spin off another company or a somewhat isolated department.2. Since it is innovative and therefore untested, be aware that you cannot project customer reaction in advance [no-brainer]. Refine the product by observing how your customers are using your product [another no-brainer].3. An organization's capability to go ahead with something innovative is to consider its 'RPV': resources, processes and values.Despite the examples, the book comes across as a lot of theory. And it really does not have tangible or practical solutions that one can start applying right away. We all know dilemmas; we want solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is possibly the best book on the impact of technology in business that I have read.

It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought. This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness. However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text. The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed. This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other? You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James \\"Varieties of the Religious Experience\\" has more insight than the rest of the book. Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"I read this book with great interest because research on counsiousness has still a long way to go.

The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that it depends in places a bit too much on theories popular with the \\"Goddess movement\\" that wouldn't stand up to the scholarly scrutiny that is used in the rest of the book.

It's as though he gave special attention to special characters. This book is no exception. One of the main characters is called Owen Chantry. He is somewhat mysterious, but the Chantry name is quite popular in L'Amour novels. This book was also unique as L'Amour gave us another character, Doby, a sixteen year old boy. Doby speaks in first person. We read his every thought and plan. We see how lonely he is living far from civilization. He dreamed about about a \\"golden haired girl.\\" We even hear his poor english skills throughout the book.

I have to agree with the majority of the Amazon.com reviewers who classified it as \\"boring\\". The characters weren't developed, and, basically, just not much happens in this novel. A reader had compared \\"Incubus\\" to \\"The Church of Dead Girls\\" in that it is more if a story about life in a small town disturbed by horrifying events. The difference is that \\"Church\\" succeeded splendidly with the story of life in a small town, and how there is no such thing as privacy. \\"Incubus\\" just didn't move at all, and life in the small town wasn't captured so as to be interesting for the reader.

The problem is these moments are few and seperated by a whole lot of uninteresting self indulgence.While Arensberg can obviously write (there are three great, creepy scenes) her book is bogged down by an over all feeling of \\"I'm better than this genre\\". Her best scenes are the ones dealing directly with the demon/supernatural, yet she seems to be trying her hardest to rise above this. By avoiding sensationalizing, she had robbed her story of narrative power.One last note: Would it [hurt]Arensberg to give us one likable character?

Yes, I like the bravado of taking on Stephen King. Kudos to her for that. But she didn't do much except rehash an old myth, using sexual and gender stereotypes that defied my imagination.

It's about as exciting and/or interesting as going to the laundromat. The narrator is self-centered and not entirely objective and there's not really a character in the whole book that I liked. Arenberg spends her time dealing with the sexual frustrations of a bunch of Peyton Place wannabes and her incubus terror is more humorous than frightening. A real overblown farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing but a tad too slow for my tastes","review":"I managed to find the book both compelling and, at the same time, a bit tedious. The underlying story was interesting enough for me to want to continue turning the pages while I often became frustrated at Cora's rambling style of telling the story and her lengthy descriptions of everything surrounding her. Some details were interesting (gardening) while others made me smile (especially those of her friends sex lives) but many were just plain dull. This tidbit, taken from a scene where Cora is describing herself, could just as well describe the author's method of telling her story: \\"When he (Cora's husband) told me a story I made him repeat himself. When he baptized an infant I asked him to describe the christening dress.\\" (...)Guess this book disturbed me on a level that I wasn't aware of!

Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this book (even though I myself am a horror fan) and found it a refreshing read since it is rather short. The dialogue is clipped but this may be due to the New England dialect, and by extension, the New England culture portayed in the book.

The whole book is a parade of people spending their lives fretting about minute weight gains or the C-cup versus D-cup issue. But that is all it is: a parade of people lost to the world in navel-gazing over something truely meaningless. The authors obsessive listing of numbers does not sound to me like someone who has recovered from an obsession with weight and looks (nor does her picture on the backcover). It is sad how small you can make your own world.There are a couple of really insightful books on weight obsession out there but this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine for 2005, but why selling in 2006","review":"What a rip!

You have to watch this movie without expectation of historical anything -- within two minutes I could hear how badly it would destroy anything vaguely historical. There is a plot and it does circle back to the beginning and reach a conclusion to the opening conflicts but the points between are rather weak. It has a soft-porn quaity to it -- lots of breasts and female bum, very little male nudity, the sex is all distant and softly lit. Ultimately it feels like someone had an interesting idea, some productors messed with it and got their sex buddies jobs in it, and the result is something not really worth you dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but simple good amazon movie","review":"When Xena Warrior Princess was over and before the roar of the Lord of the rings I caught this movie and while you may think What a joke!! trust me when I say the joke is on you while it never it relates to xena this small movie does its job of entertain you and see the struggle of the Amazons and the roman empire.So enjoy AMAZONS AND GLADIATORS and see the birth of a new heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"VillaWare Pizzelle Iron","review":"Purchased a Villaware pizzelle Iron and it is beautiful.

The true stories were engaging and poignant and the reflections provided by the authors on each situation are an invaluable resource to anyone working in healthcare.I would also strongly recommend this book to anyone with a parent or family member living in a nursing home (particularly in Australia). It gives you an insight into the day to day running of a nursing home, the dilemmas faced by staff and the quality of care which should be provided.

The video quality was poor, and it seems like they spent more time on graphics than on the actual working product. I was never told about the $10 service fee, plus that stupid dancing TV never suggested anything relevant to my viewing habits. How does giving Star Trek 3 thumbs up tell Big Brother Tivo that I like Spanish Soap operas? IF A COMPANY IS GOING TO MONITOR WHAT I WATCH AT LEAST DO IT ACURATLEY.

I then bought a Replay TV unit and have since returned it in order to buy another Tivo machine. Replay TV was not a bad unit....but I am going back to Tivo as some of the Direct TV stations I received did not show up on the Replay TV guide & therefore could not be recorded. Replay TV also would not allow me to record Direct TV pay per views (Tivo did). Tivo also allows for slow motion playback which is surprisingly convenient. Finally, Tivo also has a better interface for choosing programs to record. Tivo would be perfect if it adopted Replay TV's quick skip feature (though fast forwarding is easy enough), got rid of the useless thumbs up thumbs down feature, and added the extra 6 gigs of hard drive storage to match the 2020 machine (though I never ran out of space)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but....","review":"I bought a Tivo about two months ago and it has changed the way I watch TV. I have only used the five VCRs in my house about two times since getting Tivo. It is great. My only complaints, are about the fixed pricing on the units and lack of new updates to the software. There is so much more this thing could do, the Phillips doesn't upgrade it to do anything more than it already does. I also want an affordable upgrade for it. 14 hours is not enough recording time and there isn't an upgrade path to a larger storage capacity. I have called several times to see about the upgrades and they keep telling me that there isn't one. I checked the RePlay web site and their users are really happy about the number of new features that they have for RePlay.

(I already got a TiVo for my big screen--but I wanted a second digital recorder because you need one for each TV).I gotta say the ReplayTV is incredible. Is it as incredible as my TiVo? Well, yes. And I think I like it a tad more because Replay doesn't charge the monthly fee I pay with TiVo.Also, TiVo doesn't have the QuickSkip button that Replay has. This is the BEST for zipping through time outs, boring stuff and lousy commercials.I also find Replay's channel guide interface easier than TiVo. Replay's is like my cable channel guide-so it's easier to use. TiVo's is based on shows and is a little more confusing.I guess that at the end of the day, I LOVE THEM BOTH (how could I not love something that makes television totally fun and easy to record? ).

They walked me through the same painful guide and, again, told me they'd call me back. Again, 3 business days later, I got a call with a message.

I called customer support MULTIPLE TIMES, but they never returned my call when they promised. At one time, I was on hold for 45 min. One representitive told me to send it back to amazon.com, when the unit WAS NOT DEFECTIVE. I had to buy another one, when it had the exact same problem, for a grand total of 2 TiVos. Another rep said to go to Radio Shack and buy a wireless phone jack, which didn't work either. They cost me more than they are worth. I ended up sending the other one back too. The unit is really well designed, but if I were going to buy one, I would wait until there are more competitiors.

While often they deal with mundane family matters, the letters contain some theological gems that ask and reflect on questions that are as pertinent today as in the 1940s. Letters and Papers from Prison is a must read for anyone who would take the idea of Christianity and the Christian life seriously in the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer clearly had a link with God.

These letters are raw and real, profound and easily adaptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing With Difficult Times","review":"Letters and Papers from Prison is a most informative and thought provoking book. Bonhoeffer deals with ideas and thoughts that most of us have never thought about. Some of this very likely comes from his dealing with being in prison for a lengthy time.

I admire Bonhoeffer more than any human being because he was able to maintain his faith, despite living in times when that faith was challenged more than it had ever been. Bonhoeffer wrote that the world was more \\"godless\\" and thus closer to God than it had ever been before. Bonhoeffersaw the world at its worst and yet found affirmation and hope. He deserves to be read and to be remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horseman pass by","review":"Bonhoeffer, it has to be said, was a man locked up in a prison. He may have been a visionary, a great leader, but he ended up in prison and had to cope with that. There is a drabness to his writing. It doesn't quite lift you up. It doesn't quite inspire you. Of course, it was his own choice. He didn't have to wage war with the Nazis. He didn't have to come back from America and put his head in the lion's mouth. He went back knowing what was in store for him. It's questionable whether he achieved anything after that. Posthumously? Possibly. But his writings from prison? There are better things out there unless you're a scholar or something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but snug.","review":"This costume is as beautiful in person as it is online.

No doubt this record company was hoping to capitalize on the popularity of Bosteridge's disc or the discs of other countertenors who have already recorded these cantatas with greater sensitivity and success (Scholl, for example). Matthew White does not measure up to the current standard of countertenor and this disc disappoints.

It is the last film of the tenor matinee idol genre (Gigli, Schipa, McCormack etc.) and has a very thin, absurd, and confusing plot including an Italian Sherlock Holmes.

This film was very well done and all the actors were top notch but as I indicated, the subject matter is disturbing.

Her relationship with Jimmy bothered me more than anything -- apparently he was her best friend, yet at one of the most important parts, the author skims right over him and only provides a brief outline of Bean's emotions.

It was like watching the evening news with a little romance added in. The romantic resonance that centered around Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen's characters appeared detached and incomplete as a result of the conflicting plotlines. There was too much going on, and it looked like the filmmakers were trying to make two films in one. If the movie was attempting to be another English Patient, but with late twentieth to twenty-first century issues, it failed.The most memorable aspect of the film was the attempt at presenting issues that have occurred or are occurring within the eastern borders both in the pacific and the baltic or in between.

Angelina Jolie is a married woman who goes off to another country and has a secret love affair while her husband and child think she's off on some humanitarian trip. I hesitated when I saw her on the cover because she tends to flaunt her adulterous and bi-sexaul behavior. I got it because I like Clive Owen and I like movies filmed in Africa.

It made me realise and appreciate all that I have in my life. The warmth, safety, food and cleanliess, that 50 million people, such as those portrayed in the movie lack.This wasnt a boring, draggin-on movie, but a moving drama, that really shows the raw and deep pain of human suffering that goes on, out of peoples minds and awarenss.

Angelina does a good job here, as does Clive Owen, her love interest. The story was interesting and eye-opening. It kept my attention even though this isn't a lightning-paced movie. I wanted to know what would happen to Angelina's character. I was also surprised by a few twists that happen unexpectedly. There's a key scene midway through the movie that doesn't mean a lot at the time, but perfectly foreshadows something that happens later on.I highly recommend this movie. It was very entertaining and it really did make you think. I'm not a big fan of movies like this, but this is an exception. It should have been a bigger hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"A story that has particular relevence to real people in the real world makes it's leading man such a fake action hero and expects his attitude to not detract from the realism of the situations and even expects you to like him. Whatever romance is supposed to be seen in the mutual martyrdom of the couple is hard to find given the two do not appear to have made each other happy even for a second of the film's duration and even when the dude makes his declaration of love speech he expresses no warmth.

The drama's tone is disturbingly melodramatic with the Relief Doctor's appearance at a high society fund-raising ball in London. We can accept this though, given the painful urgency of his message. But when Jolie quits her poor husband to Ethiopia in pursuit of responding to well-intended empathy for the war and famine stricken camps, the balance of the film gets crazily out of whack, and never recovers. It's not to say that romantic love has no place in such dire life circumstances. More, the film makes this point above the far more expressive needs of the people who the aid workers are there to service. Quite addled really, and undrermining all other high-minded and serious utterances made by the lead actors. In Ethiopa, in particular, this seemed in errant taste.

Write down the synopsis of the film, and see the impossible thing that the film requires us to believe. .. \\"Beyond Borders\\" is laudable in depicting them, yes, ... I sincerely hope that it does not symbolize what happened to the career of Angelina Jolie. (And \\"Beyond Borders\\" never even reached #10 of box ofice chart in America.

Also starring Teri Polo (Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers and Domestic Disturbance), Linus Roache (Hart's War, Wings Of The Dove and The Forgotten) and Noah Emmerich (Monument Ave., Miracle and Cellular).

She's happy, we're happy, the baby is happy (unless we're on the opposite side) :) We were able to mount it on the bannister on both sides. We just put a decorative molding on one side to attach the latch to. Only complaint is the supports that hold the hinges to the wall/bannister/whatever are plastic and I'm afraid they might not hold up- our 4 year old likes to hang on the gate and swing, which hopefully will stop soon.

Don't buy this gate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsafe gate","review":"We bought this gate for the top of our stairs. The first thing that we noticed is that the hardware does not allow for any baseboards, so you have to raise it above them for installation. This leaves a gap of about 6\\" at the bottom. The screws that came with it are not good for drywall, so if you are installing it where there is no stud, you have a safety issue. The latch is a great big bolt that slides into a slot. Not only could the bolt injure your child, but it is not a secure lock. There is a piece of plastic that comes over the tip of the bolt holding it in place and you're supposed to have to push a button to release it. All you really have to do is push that plastic with your finger (we were stunned when our 12 month old daughter opened it)and the bolt (and gate) is released. We are planning on returning this ASAP and getting a safe gate. If you are concerned about the safety of your child and not just wanting the illusion of safety, buy another gate!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this product!","review":"After much research into a gate for the top of our stairs, we chose this one and I'm thrilled! It looks great, doesn't have that \\"plastic\\" look that many do, it has very clean lines and blends nicely with our white banister. I was so concerned about a difficult opening mechanism as I have numerous friends who I have visited where it's virtually impossible to open the gate at the top of their stairs holding a baby. This one is so easy!!!! And simple...you really don't need to explain to anyone how to use it. It did require my husband to make a trip to the hardware store as he decided he wanted to add a piece of wood onto the sheetrock side since he didn't want to mount it directly into the sheetrock. But, in order to get something mounted very securely at the top of the stairs, you need to expect a little work.

The gate looks very nice but the latching mechanism is horrible in my opinion. It is very difficult to get open and closed especially when carrying a baby. This one is going back today and I will opt for The First Years Simple and Secure Stair gate. I hope it opens easier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!! Do not buy this gate!","review":"I purchased this gate to use at the top of my stairs. Shortly after starting to use it, I became aware of a major problem. The gate has to be lifted up slightly in order to lift the bolt on the gate up and into the latching mechanism. The problem is that if you lift up too much on the gate (and it doesn't take a lot), the pins on the gate come right out of the hinges mounted to the wall and you're left holding onto the detached gate. Last week my 18 month old daughter went to close the gate. She lifted up too hard on the gate, lifted it out of the hinges, and my daughter and the gate fell down the stairs!!!! And this is supposed to be a SAFETY gate! I am extremely upset about this. Fortunately, my daughter was not hurt, only very scared. But she could have been hurt badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"We bought two gates, to see which worked better on installation, and this was the loser by FAR. The instructions were less clear than the other brand, and the installation guide measurements were off! I had to dig out my drywall anchors and re-drill. The latch is difficult to use, and almost impossible to achieve one-handed. It's unsafe, as when it swings open, the disc-shaped latch it right at toddler eye-height. I would not recommend this gate to anyone. Look for the one that has a push-turn latch instead. It seems much more secure & is a lot easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!","review":"-5 STARS!!!I CANNOT WARN YOU ENOUGH ABOUT NOT BUYING THIS GATE!!!!! IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE GATES ON THE MARKET. THE INSTRUCTIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO INSTALL. THE GATE WILL NOT OPEN AND CLOSE SMOOTHLY- OR EVEN WITH ONE HAND. THE SPRING PIECE ON THE HINGE COMES FLYING OFF PERIODICALLY WHEN YOU TRY TO OPEN IT.ONLY BUY THIS GATE IF YOU WANT TO SPEND FOREVER ON INSTALLATION ONLY TO BE LEFT WITH GAPING HOLES IN YOUR WALL!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Serve It's Purpose","review":"I had to mount this gate against the wall and the banister. The screws included are not for drywall at all. Also, the gate has to be lifted up high so that you can secure it to the top square of the banister. This leaves such a large space under the gate that it doesn't make any sense to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS GATE ...IT CUT MY SONS HEAD","review":"My 15 month old was walking around the gate with my mom to go down the stairs and the bolt part of the locking mechanism cut and bruised his forehead. The locking mechanism consists of two bolts that screw into the top and bottom of the gate...then snap into plastic pieces(one on top and the other on bottom) that are fixed to the wall. Shame on this company for manufacturing someting so dangerous. I notified the company and they made me feel as if it were entirely my fault. They are going to refund my money, however, I don't want to see this happen to anyone else, especially a small child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this gate!","review":"It took over an hour for my husband to install this gate. As soon as I tried it out, I made him take it back down. It was very difficult to open and close, and since we're using it at the top of the stairs, it was not acceptable. It can best be described as \\"difficult to use, loud, and clunky\\". We purchased the Simple and Secure gate by the First Years the next day, and we LOVE it. It is the complete opposite of the Safeway gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO SHOP AROUND....","review":"WE NEEDED SAFETY GATES FOR OUR NEW HOME...MY WIFE PURCHASED 5 OF THESE GATES FROM BABY'S R US FOR 64.99.....CONSUMER REPORTS #1 RATED SAFETY GATE....A FEW DAYS LATER WE WENT TO IKEA AND FOUND THE SAME EXACT GATE WAS 19.99...IKEA CALLS THEM PATRULL FAST....THE SAME EXACT GATE FOR ONE THIRD THE PRICE...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Instructions","review":"I'm going to disagree with thsoe below who found this easy to install. I am fairly handy but I found the instructions and engineering absolutely appalling. Don't know if any other brands are better but if you are a busy parent who doesn't need another project, look elserwhere.Once up it works. It's just a gate. It should. It's not the space shuttle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gate is a piece of junk.","review":"This gate deserves zero stars. This is a very heavy iron gate, which is good - the problem is that the hinges & other hardware supplied by the mfgr are totally inadequate to attach the gate securely to the wall. I have two in my house (I live in a three story home). The hinges are just plastic and one set broke upon installation. Also, both gates have come out of the wall twice. My sheetrock cracked when I tried to put one of the gates back up. Do yourself a favor, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but room for improvements","review":"... would like to add to this a few negative comments... Be aware that this gate uses bolt with a washer welded to the end of it, the height of this feature is right at that of eye level for a child, thus could result in a major accident.The Manufacturer gives no option for retention to contain the gate in an open state. I have added a Velcro strap similar to that found to contain cords... the problem is that this keeps sliding down to the floor and is a pain ... to use. I have also added a felt bumper on my rail to keep the gate from damaging the woodwork.I still think this gate is one of the best, but has an area to improve on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another version of Lucan","review":"If I had known it was another translation of Lucan, I would not have ordered it, BUT I would have made a mistake. This work has a better translation for the modern reader, and lots of good supporting information. Some of the comparisons I made with other versions make me wish I had this ten years ago. The notes are worth the price of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Historical Epic","review":"An underrated work of the Silver Age. There are some excellent epsiodes that could stand on their own as mini-epics: the suicides of Vulteius and comrades, Appius 'rape' of the Pythia, Caesar's journey by sea, Scaeva's aristeia, Erictho's necromancy, and Cato's journey through Africa to name just a few. The historical insights into the lives of Caesar, Pompey, and Cato are also especially enlightening. Absolutely worth a first and second look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! GREAT TV PRICE AND PICTURE","review":"I spent about two weeks looking for a projection TV from other retailers and Target had the best one. I got the TV on 2/3 and the picture is unreal. It is so clear I got it hooked up to my reciever and what a blast! The picture is better then the ones that were more expensive. I am very happy with the Daewoo TV and will stay with this brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY...FAR, FAR AWAY","review":"I bought this TV Jan 2, 2006 - it took 3 weeks to arrive, worked for 4 days, then died. Daewoo sent a technician over, which took another week. He told me it was a bad motherboard, that it would take a week to order (goodbye superbowl party). A week came and went, and he told me Daewoo didn't have the motherboard in stock and wouldn't give him a time frame for delivery of a replacement. Long story short, I had to fight to return it and to this day 2 months later still haven't been able to - I have a 5-foot paperweight in my living room.DAEWOO is HORRIBLE. Stay away from these incompetents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy! Open yourself up to the world around you!","review":"A fantastic book written by Nobel prize winner Niko Tinbergen. I recommend this book for adults and advanced children alike. I read this when I was in 6th grade and it was the book that lead me on my path to a career in neuroethology.Tinbergen opens us up to the natural world around us even to those of us who are city dwellers.Exposing us up to both the world of nature and the methodology of the naturalist he reveals something that the modern day world more and more distracts us from - patient observation and the results that it yields.I recommended this book to a close friend of mine who has two children, a two year old and kindergartner and he uses this book as a manuel in their nature hikes.I assure you you will not be disappointed if you purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than I thought!","review":"I thought I would experiment with these and see if I liked them. It turned out I loved them, even more than I expected, so I can't recommend them highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abstractions Heaped Upon Abstractions","review":"Obtuse. The author writes in a style so verbosely obtuse that the poor reader must read each paragraph 10X or more to garner even the slightest grain of meaning. Deciphering the hidden meaning embedded in an entire page would require {in my humble opinion) years of dedicated study from the most erudite of minds---a task too arduous for my feeble brain.I have aged 30 years in the short span of a single week, trudging thru this impenetrable tome. Needless to say, I am not enamored with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BIG ENOUGH!!!!!!!!","review":"Although this product might work if you had a really small child but with my son it is simply not big enough.
