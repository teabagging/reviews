I wanted them to limit outside noise while not leaking the sound out to outsiders either, as I need them for practicing piano without disturbing my roommates. This is why the closed-back design seemed favorable.In reading reviews of other headphones while trying to make my selection, I found that a major problem with closed-back designs is that the sound resonates and distorts, making it sound like tin cans over your ears.There is no exepction with these. When I tried playing my keyboard through them, they sounded way worse than any headphones or ear buds I had ever used with it.To their credit, keyboard voices other than piano sounded a little better, so maybe these headphones would be great for listening to techno music or something, but certainly not classical.I shall be returning these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks funny...","review":"The headphones are alright...

Likewise, we can see both movie director and Mark Twain have same purpose because in my opinion, conclusion shows their final messages. Therefore, the conclusion is really important in our life.Some people doesn't like this movie because the movie skips a lot of important parts of the book. For example, Tom did not show up in the movie. In general, the movie can't show everything within limited time(usually 2 hours length) So, i think the most important thing is to send a message.

The author's adept ability to create atmosphere and mood are here, as well as her right-on characterizations of Mina, Jonathan, Arthur, and Van Helsing. Bergstrom stays true to the characters Stoker created, but she lets us get to know them better. On center stage with Mina and her friends is the half-sister of Dracula, Joanna. I don't want to give any of the plot away, so I'll just say that the story is seductive, fast-paced, and suspenseful.

It really lacks the grinding ability necessary to grind spices quickly -- it has plenty of speed it appears the double blade simply does not have enough surface area to do the job quickly -- A typical spice mix with the bowl 1/4 full takes 5-10 minutes to grind to an adequate level. Our spice mixes vary but frequently are Anise, Coriander, Fennel Seed, Cardamom, Fenugreek, Cumin.Also, there needs to be a clarification in the description, the actual bowl where the spices are ground is not removable therefore it complicates cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although this grinder looks beautiful out of the box and is quiet, i dont find it grinds all that well. It takes over 30 seconds to grind coffee to fine grind, and even then it grinds unevenly( leaving bits of bean).

I would not buy it again and am considering buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"coffee grinder","review":"The previous coffee grinder I had worked automatically by the grind setting.

I grind up oats, flaxseeds and eggshells (egg membrane is a main ingredient in those expensive dog joint health pills). Everything becomes a nice fine powder and the noise is minimal. The grinder itself is mostly stainless steel. It comes with a small brush for cleaning, though I bought an extra one just in case. I took off one star because this can be a bit hard to get clean. After I sweep it out, I use a slightly damp paper towel to wipe it out with. You have to be careful while doing this as you can cut yourself on the blades. Overall, this was a good deal. It's a well made and stylish grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"blades flew off in under a month.","review":"absolutely stunning, the very best grinder i'd ever had--when i first got it. right now i am just beyond thrilled that amazon will do a no-contest return for items that fall apart & become ENTIRELY USELESS in LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS. i mean, i think it's even too light to use as a doorstop. maybe the motor would run something else but it sure wont grind anything sans blades. & it is surely, & for no reason i can name, BLADELESS COS THE BLADES FLEW OFF. had they not been made of steel they probably wouldve disintegrated.two stars for its wonderful wonder at the beginning. also cos maybe you just cant use a coffee grinder ever day, once a day, like i do? or is that whistling in the wind i hear behind me? or in the dark? unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"Read the reviews and was sold on this grinder.

It is surprisingly quiet. We don't fall into the highbrow coffee drinking crowd; we just love a good cuppa using decent beans we grind ourselves. The Saachi is perfect for our needs and we hope it has a decent life cycle to it. It looks great next to our Cuisinart coffee maker. Although we are Illy fans for our espresso (which we brew in an old school moka), I would be hesitant to use the Saachi for an espresso grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty with little power","review":"I bought the Saachi grinder, as my old great-working Krups is red and didn't match my new granite kitchen.

I returned the grinder after trying three grindings with the same poor effect. I want my outdated, mismatched Krups back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"Great machine. I gave it a 4/5 only because I think the blade could be a little bit sharper but you can't beat the price and it still does a stand up job grinding coffee beans for my press.

I wanted it for the surplus of coriander seeds I harvested, so finally got a chance to try it. I wasn't sure what to expect - it's very simple, but it works beautifully. The included brush helps dislodge the finer powder from around the blade base. Easy to use, love the cord wrapping base, too. Note that the ventilation is also in there, so unwrap the cord all the way. I haven't seen it overheat but I noticed the airflow and it was mentioned in the instructions. I did about 30 seconds and it was just about as good as a store-bought jar. I like my spices a little coarser, so I stopped there. Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good, but not all stainless steel","review":"The only reason why I chose this spice grinder was because it was advertised as having all steel housing. With time, the plastic top of other spice grinders I have owned has deteriorated and cracked. Hence, I jumped at the opportunity to buy a stainless steel grinder. Well, that was disappointingly not true. The top is plastic. While the plastic portion is smaller than that of similar grinders, the plastic top does come in contact with the spices and I am convinced it will follow the same fate as other spice grinders I've had. I'll make sure to update this review over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I needed a spice grinder so I ordered a Krups model from Amazon. It arrived with a vertical crack on the curve of the plastic up near the stainless steel cup. Amazon sent me a new one promptly and it had a crack in the same area, though it was a smaller crack. I never heard of Saachi but decided to take a chance after reading the reviews and ordered their grinder. It arrived promptly and works great. No cracks as it is all stainless steel. It's much more attractive and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grinder to avoid .....","review":"or if you are like me - replace. Very disappointed in this grinder. I only use this to grind coffee beans and it never mixes the beans well as it grinds, even if you shake the grinder to help it along. General grinding power is not impressive at all either. I always have a clump of ground beans at the bottom and many chunks that \\"float\\" on the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does grind coffee, but...","review":"This was less likable than the Mr Coffee grinder we had been using for a few years. Specifically, you can't remove the bin to dump the coffee, there is no timer for automatic stopping, and there is no adjustment for fine/coarse grind. Plastic lid develops a lot of static and helps grinds fly out of the grinder once it is opened. On the plus side, it is well built - heavy, sturdy - it looks nice, and it does actually grind coffee. We returned it and bought the Capresso Infinity, which we like much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best spice grinder I bought","review":"I was in the market for a spice grinder & not really a coffee grinder. This is my second spice grinder & the last one I'd buy or recommend. The construction is very well made, feels solid and works well. The grinding blade sits low enough to give you just the right level of fineness I wanted when grinding spices to make a rub or marinade or even toss in the pot to cook with.The cable stores well wrapped around the base and cleaning up of insides is easy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not grind well","review":"Coffee grinder cup is square and the blade is round so beans get in the corners and do not grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Product","review":"This grinder is exceptional!

The story of a little ''Southern Belle'', and her mission to rescue her father from the Yankee Troups, and later execution. The plot is pretty standard, Shirley of course is a very cute, and a quite appealing young actress. But the film's message is slippery, even dangerous at times. Incorrectly portraying black slaves as carefree, happy, childlike and ignorant, this movie was one of many which reinforced the South's idea of a ''happy slave.'' This was dangerous considering that at this time segregation and discrimination were rampant in Southern cities. The movie itself is sweet and family-oriented, very worth seeing, but the film is symbolic of a very dangerous system and idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues To Please","review":"Like the first, the second book of White Wolf's latest trilogy is a great read with plenty of suspense, intrigue, action, monsters, and gore. Also like the first installment, it maintains a much quicker pace than many of White Wolf's other publications.

If you like horror and the concept of people willingly facing off against all manners of evil then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Matters","review":"I was disappointed because the boards were smalls.

Worse yet is that the code in the book contains erros and there are no updates or other information on the publisher's web site to acknowledge it (or seemingly any interest of them to even reply to my reports). Microsoft's TechNet has helpful resources and is free online at their web site. Wrox also publishes a book called Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition which isn't much better.

Apprently, quality over quantity means absolutely nothing to this guy.If you want a good textbook on random variables, try Peebles. Each topic in Peebles is coherently presented followed by a numerical example that's easily understood.Yes this book covers alot of ground, but it does a horrible job explaining just about everything it covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another book","review":"Very poorly written unless you already understand the topic.Book is heavy on poorly explained theory and provides very little in the way of practical applications or examples.Far too many errors that even the errata card doesn't address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good textbook","review":"IMO, this is not a good textbook. On one hand, it never explains the purpose of the materials. I know it elaborates on the random variables and different distributions and a lot of materials in detail, but I don't know where can I use these things. On the other hand, it omits the mathematical details, too. So when I read this book, I found unclear points everywhere. Someone else recommended this book as a good engineer reference. I think that might be true if there were less errors. I find errors in the equations every two or three pages. Engineers may not need to know the details, and they know what they need to model their designs. But they need the \\"correct\\" thing to do that. Maybe that is not the author's fault but McGraw-Hill's, but to me, a reader of the textbook, it is the same. No recommendation of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classical text for engineers","review":"This is the classical text for understanding and applying stochastics processes. Papoulis gets to the formal point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The exercises are difficult","review":"The examples in the text are very simple but the exercises in the back of each chapter are very difficult. The simple examples are a poor reference for the much more complicated questions that lack solutions. This makes learning, by using this book, very difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classics are not always great.","review":"I've been told by many professors that this is *the* classic text on the topic. You might think this would make it *the* book to read on the topic, but it is definately *not* a classic introductory textbook. Everyone in my class complained about it.

This book is of little help. Just as a little spoiler, the answers to chapter 2 questions can be found in chapter 3. Be prepared for this kind of ill mannered writing and to ask your professor for a great deal of help.I am very disappointed and hope someone else can come up with a better written book for this course. Who would put themselves through that kind of torturer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation of random processes","review":"It's the best book I've read about Random variable mathematics. It's not very easy to get the concepts for the first time, but after some detailed readings you figure how all make sense.

Someone has got to be able to do better than this. The author commits the classic error of defining everything very precisely, without ever saying what any of it means. I have to agree with the previous reviewer (doubtless a frustrated student like myself) that this is probably a good reference book for those who already understand the subject. Unfortunately, the explanations are overly mathematical, the index is incomplete, and the script typeface used for special characters and symbols is often incomprehensible (an alphabet table would help). The examples and exercises fail to relate the material to practical applications. As an engineer, I'm not interested in proofs and mathematical rigor- I'm interested in the math as a tool and understanding what I can do with it, and how to go about doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but too difficult","review":"This book seems to be the classical text on probability in engineering and computer science programs, but is definitely not an introductory textbook. The explanations are overly mathematical. As an engineering student, I'm not interested in proofs and mathematical rigor-I'm interested in understanding how probability works and can be used in practical applications. A much better book in this respect is the recent book by Tijms with wonderful examples and exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Notes to the Professors who want to use this book","review":"Pls professors if u were not able to fully digest and reorganize this book , then do not use it.

I'm suffering now because of this terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin Heroes","review":"The author, Kimberley Anne has presented Twin Heroes at my elementary school. The book was well received by the children and generated discussions on how the children felt about this tragic incident. These children reside on an Indian Reservation in Arizona; yet, they felt that Twin Heroes provided them with a way to express how they felt. This book is an excellent teaching tool and inspirational. There are no other books of this kind in the local libraries. I would highly recommend this book to all teachers and librarians."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE SAR IS TO GOOD!","review":"This book is pointless. It thrives on gore and mindless killing.

The idea of disco Dolly (the song \\"Baby I'm Burning\\") is one that should have been nixed long before she arrived in the studio. In short, an occasionally enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable album. Dolly has done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISCO JAMMING DOLLY","review":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!

This was just downright painful to listen to back in 1978 when it was first released and is even more so today. \\"Baby I'm Burning\\" has got to be the worst song Dolly has ever recorded and heaven only knows why anybody needs to hear it today. The rest of the album is not quite as dreadful, but is a far cry from what Parton was capable of doing then and is capable of doing today."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of her worst","review":"There were many ill-advised forays into disco during the late 70's, but this album was easily among the most painful. Parton had sold out her roots in 1977 with the \\"Here You Come Again\\" album and as bad as that one was it sounded like high art compared to this abomination. Why this title was chosen for a reissue over much more worthy Parton albums is a sad comment on mainstream pop culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover Success","review":"Heartbreaker was yet another venture into pop music, as well as disco, adult contemporary and country, for Dolly Parton. This album offers many sounds for the listener, and includes some of her nicest songs. The hits include Baby Im Burnin and Heartbreaker, both timeless, but the other songs are just as timeless (even today), with some classic ballads like Were Through Forever Til Tommorow, Its Too Late To Love Me Now and Ive Really Got The Feeling, while singing fun songs like With You Gone, Sure Thing, I Wanna Fall In Love. I reccomend this to fans of Dolly, although the country fans of Dolly might find this one disapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"this film is excellent","review":"I have had this film on video for about 10 years and I have seen the part with the little boy behind the curtain more times than the producers, I have never seen a shotgun or a knife and I've never seen it him move, but also I don't think it's a cutout of Ted Danson, this has puzzeled me for 12 years, there are other scene's in the film shot in the same place and the \\"cardboard cutout\\" isn't there.

All those cheesy and dated effects used in the late 80's will probably take you back to those memorable years of your life when watching the movie, but unfortunately Three Men and a Baby will probably only remind you what the decade was like actually putting up with this style of comedy as popular entertainment at the time.

The cast of Tom Selleck, Steve Gutenberg,and Ted Danson was just fine, and the story line was terrific.

Then to discover that Danson is the real \\"Daddy\\" brings an even greater element to the film.I believe that this had to be one of Selleck's best movies, and the ensemble cast is excellent.

I never thought much of Ted Danson until I saw the final scene in this film, in which he plays a senile Anglican priest -- a comic masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the disk.Alternatively, consider buying \\"Three Men and a Cradle,\\" the French film upon which \\"Three Men and a Baby\\" was based.

I know you should not assume that all an actor's movies will be in the same genre but this movie is as like 'Monarch' as Dracula is like St Francis of Assisi. It is raw, gory and sexually explicit. The murder scene at the end involves one of the most graphic abuse scenes I have seen in any movie. Obviously this is not the film that I was expecting. The movie is well made, performances are good but the film cannot seem to make up its mind whether it is an action story, a supernatural spooky, or an examination of supressed sexual desire (those desires include masturbation, cross dressing and raw sexual intercourse). Not a film I could recommend and definitely not in the 'Monarch of the Glen' genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and time!!!","review":"Please, if you value your time and have an appreciation for a good story, do not read this trash.

He trades sex with a [...] to get Marna a bed, and she sleeps with some other guy that she's been attracted to when she thought Matt was dead.

The only good songs on here are; Dido, and the theme song from \\"American Beauty\\". I suggest no one buy this album beacause their are no gems on it.

The screw to tighten the knob becomes loose after a very short while. This keeps making the mike go flip flop - more dangerous for a sensitive mike like a Neumann that I use.

It seems to me that if Mr. Mackintosh ever visited the school , he did so with his eyes closed. He has completly missed the point of the building. Radically undestating its importance and beauty. Most of all I feel that it is truly hurtful the way in which he described the \\"menial nature\\" of the staff which enhabit this fine establishment.

I was definitely not sorry.It is easy reading and, more importantly, it is truly interesting. Ms. Pitman traces the history of the blonde, a subject that she points out has been taboo in the past due to Hitler's fascination with just this subject. It is interesting to discover where I would fit at different points in history. At some points, I would be considered a goddess, the symbol of purity; at others, I would be considered the most vile of temptresses. (Obviously, either choice seems appealing in its own way!)I think blondes would probably find this book most interesting, however, brunettes and redheads may be able to appreciate it also. If you take an interest in popular culture and why we believe what we believe, this is definitely a work you should consider adding to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but poorly organized","review":"The subject matter is interesting enough to get each of us buy a copy of the book. But the book itself is not that interesting though. Each chapter is written to bombard the readers with different stories of the blonde, revealing the cultural history of the hair colour. However, the author did not do in-depth discussion. At some point, the pace of each chapter is too quick. After reading the book, our knowledge about blondes is still the same. The book does not impress me by giving me something I do not know.Pitman perhaps has done a better job on researching than on writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Bleached Brunettes","review":"Joanna Pitman's book \\"On Blondes\\" continues the absurdity of using the name Blonde for Brunettes that are bleached.Brunettes are not Blonde.

It's also a bit wider and thicker than I was expecting, but I think I can get used to it easily (guess I'm used to wearing thinner rings on that finger).

I took one bite and it was all I could do not to spit it back out. Now in the bread's defense I have not tried it toasted like some are suggesting, so perhaps that may have helped some with the texture, but I can't see how it could help the bitter flavor. One bite and the bread turned into a sour/bitter powder in my mouth, that lingered long after I had swallowed the mouthful of \\"bread\\".

The slices are very small, but very satisfying compared with no white bread! With 6 net grams of carbs, I eat a slice or two each day.

The only way it is tolerable is if you heat it in a toaster oven, and even then it is a far cry from the way a bread should taste.Try the gluten-free bread mixes instead (e.g. Bob's Red Mill Bread Mix).

By the time you find something in a breast exam, it is too late for prevention! Dr. Arnot says, DO BOTH! Prevent now, and always do everything else as an insurance measure.

I used a pipe cutter for this, but a hack saw would also work with little problem.This is a very good looking product when done (I got the nickel plated one). I recommend it to give us people a little more room in the shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"who doesn't want more space?","review":"I don't know how I ever showered without this. I bought this 2 years ago - it's been in 2 of our houses now - yes we took it with us when we moved. It makes a huge difference in a standard shower. It makes it feel like you have a much larger shower so it gives a nice makeover with little cost. Well worth it - you'll be glad you got it - especially when washing your hair. You don't have to brush up against the shower curtain when you're maneuvering in the shower. Can't say enough I guess - I just really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sling, would have been nice if the ad mentioned no swivels","review":"Sling seems to be well built, but I was expecting swivels to be included.

Some bad gags about fat. Finlayson wasted as a doctor in a dumb set piece featuring a prostrate Oliver. We have a wanted criminal threatening the boys with a gun, then follows the sad spectacle of their eating a meal of rubbish that was intended for the bad guy. Where is the grace and light that usually fills their films? The gentle saga of two innocents at the mercy of a harsh world? We have started here to witness the deterioration of the L&H opus, perhaps to be laid partly at the feet of director Gordon Douglas. But as they always had control of their own material, we must lay some of it before Stan and Ollie themselves. And it hurts! So, an okay comedy for those who demand little, maybe. Hard work for this lifelong fan, though, when there are so many other, far better L&H comedies available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!!!!!!","review":"Always one of my favorite Stan&Ollie; Films, this one will make you laugh like crazy.The hornfactory is funny and Ollie's \\"recovery\\" from his nervous breakdown in Bed that turns out to be a disaster is funny beyond belief.But what really tops these performances is the scene where Stan has to eat the meal he made himself out of some unsavory objects (yes, objects. Such as a sponge)...without muttering a single word he get's his feelings across to the camera like a master of comedy. It is priceless.I grew up watching Laurel&Hardy; in germany (i am 38 years old) and i am glad to see that they are still cherished by people.In Germany Laurel and Hardy are known as \\"Dick und doof\\", which translated means \\"fat (ollie) and stupid(stan)\\".

The sound quality is awful and the wireless reception isn't much better. If you really like listening to music, then these are not for you! You have to constantly adjust the reception to get even the most basic stereo reception. If you like the primitive sound of AM radio from an old hand-held radio, then these are for you. If, on the other hand, you like to hear the subtleties of the music you're listening to in stereo without a bunch of static then save your money and buy something else.

If I simply move four feet away from the receiver I am punished by extremely loud distortion. It's painful. Since I've had these I've yet to be able to find the 'perfect' frequency, never getting the clear sound I had hoped for. In addition to the flawed usability, these are a lot bigger than they look and a just a little too cumbersome.

A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If you're a late night TV watcher, you too might call this justifiable laziness.

The audio quality was comparable on all 3...but the Advent phones each had drawbacks. The Advent phones had to be manually tuned to the right frequency. That was just too big a pain in the xxx for me. These, the AW770, had the tuning knob and the volume knob right next to each other (and of course you can't see them unless you take off the phones), so you could accidentally detune when you meant to adjust the volume. I recommend the RCA WHP160 phones in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after less than a year of light use","review":"I use the headphone at my desk at work. I've had them less than a year and only used them 20 or 30 times.I like to listen to my music at low volume, but had a problem from the start with the balance in stereo. With the volume set down low, I could barely hear sound out of the left side. So I would have to adjust the balance setting in my output( in this case my computer ). So whenever I changed the volume, I also had to adjust the balance.Now the left side does not work at all when in stereo at any volume level.They sounded good when they worked and were comfortable to use for an hour of two at a time, but since they broke after light use I can only give them 1 star.

That takes a little doing to get it right, and I find that the two parts lose each others' signal several times over the course of a couple of hours.

The concert is just like the old video. But the image and sound quality is terrible. I had to turn up the volume very high to hear anything and the image was dark and fuzzy. The part that really angered was that I paid $22 for this piece of junk. This DVD is obviously a Brazilian bootleg that has entered the American market.

I feel in love wit her music immediately. WIth my love and appreciation for all kinds of music, I've discovered that her music is definately SOULFUL. She came to us wit something new and different. I am soooo glad that she came out wit a new CD. Her first album was sooo great I was thristy for her next, and she came with a double disc album. On this album she took it to another level. She revealed herself, and she was REAL! If you like her style of music you will love this CD. I can't even find words used to describe this CD. All I can say is EXPERICENCE her for yourself. She is awesome, and lilke no other. This is the CD for the holidays to just relax and let her music and her voice penetrate your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preach On Sista!","review":"Oh.....My.....God! Have you ever heard anything as inspiring, fulfilling, and real as Jill Scott's \\"Love Rain?\\" I feel obligated to tell the world that this song is a testimony to ANYONE who has ever felt jaded, misguided, or even abused by a loved one. Jill Scott is ridiculously talented. I've never heard an artist whose studio creations do her injustice. This woman's niche is live entertainment! I could not find one flaw, lyrically or musically, on the entire CD. The \\"Thickness\\" is a message that all sistas need to take heed to. I say JILL SCOTT FOR PRESIDENT BABY! The girl is off the chain! If artists still embraced the sanctity of music the way Jill does, the world would love a lot harder. Jill, you're the epitome girl! If you don't have the CD, you're shortin' yourself. Sacrifice a days lunch and add something to your heart by buying this work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Uncomparable Jill","review":"This cd is all Jill. Real .. Gritty .. Honest .. Beautiful ... Jill Scott. The experience is uncomparable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jill just gets better and better","review":"Jill Scott wows us again with this semi-live twin disc album and guess what it rocks!!!I must say my personal favourites are \\"Gotta get up\\" and the \\"Thicknesse\\". Great drumming and vocals on \\"Gotta get up\\" just let the beats and vocals carry you. I have missed Jill's last two gigs in London due to poor publicity but I am sure when she returns to ole London she'll tear it up. Way, Way, up on many people's music list she a natural star!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trully an Experience!","review":"Jill Scott is great Live. This CD can give a taste of what it is like to Experience Ms. Scott. If you have Who Is Jill Scott Vol. 1, this album complements it very well. In addition to the live Disc, there is also an disc that features new material. Disc 2 give you a break from some of the songs that you have heard for the past year and a half and shows Jill in a different light, including songs with 4 Hero, and Eric Robertson. Check it out, it's Jill and that could never disappoint.Peace & Blessings"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG, Jill Scott Rocked this one out!","review":"I am a huge music lover of REAL music & if you are too you MUST have this cd in your collection. Jilly from Philly killed this LIVE performance. I can't say enough about it or her talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My GOD!............","review":"....... is all I can say about Jill Scott. I had to get this masterpiece as soon as possible. I knew in my heart it would be good but I had no idea it would be like it is. When I bought Who Is Jill Scott? (on the first day) I had not heard anything by her, but knew she had to be dope to be down with The Roots. I've listened to her first CD everyday since I bought it. It looks like I'll be listening to this one everyday too.What kind of world do we live in when someone with so much talent cannot sell more records than less-talented people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get too excited.","review":"I am a big Jill Scott fan, so do not get me wrong. The value in this two CD set in the second CD where you hear new material. The first CD is a live performance of Jill Scott's debut album and too me it's REAL CORNY! Jill's voice is cool but the music is WACK. The sound from the debut album is studio manufactured which is why it cannot be replicated live.The second CD has some good tracks on it. Personally, I am waiting for the next REAL Jill Scott album. This album is semi. If you think that you are going to get an Erykah Badu live album experience then you will be sadly disappointed.I hate to burst someone's bubble but the truth must be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Mess!!","review":"First of all, whatever happened to letting an artist develop an actual catalog of songs, learn some stage presence and showmanship (which Ms Scott. sorely lacks!) then after a few years and albums, release a live set?This album is a horrifyingly bad mish-mash of tired soul sista cliches, bad poetry, terrible sound quality and poor musicianship. After the mess that was her studio LP, I should have avoided this garbage altogether, but NOOOOO, I had to give her a second chance. So I borrowed a friend's copy (she actually buys this) and gave it a few spins. The verdict? Save your money and go purchase \\"Erykah Badu Live\\" and see how it's DONE.A waste of time and effort. The listening public deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"I listen to Jill everyday. I love the way she makes me feel as if I actually had tix and were in the audience. Besides my morning and night cleansings I also feel cleansed while inside my car or in my space when I'm listening to her music/voice. Jill is truly beautiful in many ways and I'm thankful she shares her talents for anyone willing/wanting to experience her."},{"rating":"2","title":"R&B Can Live and Survive!!!","review":"Jill Scott's writings are like Maya A. (real), her voice is like Sarah V.(earthy and sassy) and her sound is like Miles D. and Chaka K.(smooth and funky). The live album showcase she is NO studio puppet and the bonus cd gives you a taste on what we hope will be another album in 2003. She was totally robbed of Artist of the Year in 2001, but that's ok because we all know who the \\"real deal\\" is. And that's Jill Scott."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirits Rising","review":"There isn't much to say other than outstanding! If you are a Jill Scott fan, you should already expect greatness. This CD exceeds that expectation. Her voice plus the band creates an uplifting and positive energy that it's hard listening to it with any other emotion. I would highly recommend buying this CD! Your spirit will move and rise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Year in Sports: From the Rose Bowl to Figure Skating","review":"I bought this as a gift fro a friend and he loved it!!!The pictures are so good............"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I use this speaker set for my shower.

The transmitter's wire should not break in about 9 days thus creating nasty sound. The customer service rep. said that no replacement is available. The wire is special has 3 not to wires inside!2. The sound has too much popping even with in 30 feet away from the transmitter, even more annoying at night.3.

They sounded pretty good, although there were some \\"popping\\" sounds that were disturbing.I decided they were \\"good enough\\" to re-arrange my cabling and install them more permanently. Luckily, I tested one more time and found that the transmitter would not always turn on as indicated by the green light. Plugging the audio cable in half way would usually get the transmitter going, but that's not they way things should be. I'll be returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - until it breaks","review":"Randomly unplugged it to move some peripherals around - plugged it back in and it didn't work. The light only flashes briefly as you try to plug in the power adapter. Did some research and apparently this is a common issue - and the customer service at RCA leaves you SOL. Buy another brand - from the research I did of other people with the same issue, my set lasted the longest - and that's only five months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transmitter burns out...","review":"The wireless transmitter burned out, even on a surge protector.

Unfortunately there is very little Bob on official DVD, so the less than stellar video and audio on this release is very disappointing. Hopefully a better version will be released by Sony/Columbia. In the meantime if you have the VHS version it's better than this. If you don't have the VHS, than you should get this at least for the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bootleg","review":"another bootleg dvd, all this material is being traded among fans for free and often in better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is \\"Hard To Handle\\" on DVD","review":"This is an exact duplicate of the \\"Hard To Handle\\" Laserdisc. It isn't the same great audio/visual quality but it is the same performance. It is a stunning show - Bob is great. It appears that he may have \\"taken\\" a little something because as the show moves along, he seems a bit \\"messed up\\". He begins to stare off into the crowd with a blank expression. It is cool. In the Garden is supurb. The cover photo is from the 1970's. Kinda weird. All in all it is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else","review":"I bought this book primarily for the CD, which could have been a lot better. The program cycled through test questions that I had already answered, and I only took a few tests. Also, it seems to only have one version of each type of essay.If I were just judging the book, I would give it 1 star. The actual text is awful. The questions are horribly constructed. Many of the analogies do not even contain words that are the same part of speech (ETS would never do that), and the reading comprehension questions mostly asked for factual information.Barron's has a much better prep for the GRE and ETS's free CAT practice test is a much better way to practice computer test-taking.Wow...I really can't believe how bad this book is. I feel like I wasted a lot of time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Story, Melted Heart","review":"This is a fine piece of storytelling. Don Horton has created a work with such intricate design of the human spirit, it is difficult to believe that his characters are fictional. A definite must-read for anyone who enjoys a cup of tea, a fireplace, and words and illustrations that help us realize the true importance of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Republic's better postwar serials","review":"In this action-packed serial, Clayton Moore and Ramsay Ames doggedly refuse to let the evil Roy Barcroft stand in the government's way. If you like Moore as The Lone Ranger, you'll enjoy seeing him in a \\"civilian\\" role as an athletic leading man, and the striking Ramsay Ames gamely joins in the action. Lots of stunts, fistfights, etc., and an excellent editing job: spectacular footage from older serials and features is cleverly worked in to give viewers their money's worth. Fun for serial and action fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet, AMAZING! Album Of The Year!","review":"I love the vision and creative edge that was put into this album, ive been a Janet fan for a long time. The production with legends Jimmy Jam and Terry and Jermaine was God sent. They mix very well. I love the Tribute to some of janets classics with a twist. Very Modern, fresh, and memorable. I love it janet hands down it is the best. Real music finally returns.True Legends NEVER DIE!!!!!!!!!Love you Janet!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"20YO 4/5 Stars","review":"Janet Jackson has been through a lot in the past 20 years and now she is coming out with an album of joy. 20YO is a great album, not the best....but noting compared to the last two albums..AFY & DamitaJo. Songs like Enjoy, Daybreak, and With You brings me back to the \\"Janet\\" 1993 ages..while Show Me, Get It out me, & Do it to me are winners in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very weak album","review":"The only track that I really liked was \\"Take Care.\\" Everything else justseemed dumbed down and lacking of Janet's individuality. \\"Damita Jo\\" wasso underrated. The good news is that 20.Y.O is selling well and hopefullynext time she'll do better. Like many other reviewers, I'm bored withthe sexed up stuff too. She needs to make a creative statement like shedid with \\"The Velvet Rope\\" to get me to buy anything she does again"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed Bag as well...","review":"I didn't know she even came out with this cd, I remember when Call on Me came out and your heard about it for a week and then it pretty much disappeared! At first I was really surprised how strong and great the the album was. I used to play it on my ipod all the time, but then it eventually wore off and got really lackluster. To me this is better then her previous album,but it's still not that great. I thought some her song choices sucked... Call on me was ok... Do it to me was really execellent(hot beats!).Get it Out me was pretty good as well. There's some crappy material and some good material. It's a mixed bag overall. If you like Neyo or rihanna's latest cd's then this def. the album for you to get. I would recommend this to any pop music fan or r & b you can get your use out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"20 Y.O. a failed successful project","review":"I too was one of those who passed on this album thinking it was going to be mediocre. I too have given up on Janet at the time this album was released. But thankfully Discipline regained my faith in her to a degree. So I decided to put my money down and buy 20 Y.O.No regrets here! I'd dare to say that it's tighter than Damita Jo!On 20 Y.O. I could listen the first half without any hesitation. Ms Janet wants to have fun and bring back the nostalgia of the 80's. And why the hell not?! The beats and sounds are all good. The songs DO NOT fail to please! People definitely overlooked this one in my opinion and that's unfortunate for Janet.Perhaps it was a bad choice to choose Call on me as the kick off single because honestly it's not the best track on the album. By the time So Excited came around, it was already a bit too late to salvage 20 Y.O.It could've been grand!It was all a miscalculation-the promotion, the interest, etc...But 20 Y.O. will stand the test of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album since \\"Velvet Rope\\"","review":"I have been a Janet fan since the release of \\"Control\\" 20 years ago and it's good to see her back in the \\"Pop\\" groove once again. This is by far the best since \\"Velvet Rope.\\" I was surprised that much of the \\"explicit lyrics\\" Janet has commonly used since her \\"All For You\\" album are gone. Not that it takes anything from the album. It's a fun album, very upbeat and reminds me alot of \\"Control.\\" Janet definitely has it right this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited Edition verison of Janet Jackson's \\"20 Y.O.\\"","review":"I have'nt bought a Janet Jackson cd since \\"All for You\\".I love her newest one \\"20 Y.O.\\".It's very enjoyable to listen to.The DVD is a pleasure to watch too.Wish it was a little more longer and had her video of \\"Call on me\\" with Nelly on it.If you love a real good limited edition(The packaging is preety cool) and love great music to listen to(\\"Daybreak\\",\\"Enjoy\\",\\"Show me\\" and of course \\"Call on me\\" with Nelly).Pick it up while you can before it gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"Unfortunately the fierce Janet Jackson of \\"Control\\" and \\"Rhythm Nation\\" and the sultry Janet Jackson of \\"Janet\\" and \\"Velvet Rope\\" have left the building. This album is average at best and Janet's creativity seems to have stalled. Jermaine Dupri's production may be great for singers like Usher and Mariah Carey who bring powerhouse vocal ability to the table. However for someone like Janet with her limited vocals the result is uninspiring. It seems like she has regressed rather than progressed and this album doesn't live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point anymore?","review":"If Janet is going to continuously make the same album, what's the point anymore? I see that her fans are trying to up the ratings of a failed album of epic proportions. Her worst reviewed album of her entire career. This is the third failed attempt at something decent, all in a row. If she doesn't want to do it anymore, just retired. She's over 40 years old and still trying to recreate what she already did in 1993. Isn't she suppose to be an artist? She used to make albums with a point. Not sappy, romantic, ballads that are so bland and boring, it's unbelievable. No thank you Miss Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a used copy of this cd! It's obvious that she's more concerned with her image!","review":"I've always been a Janet Jackson fan and would never see myself writing a bad review about her music. But I've been sadly disappointed with \\"Damita Jo\\" and now \\"20 Y.O\\" as well. The first two singles were lame and the entire album is just tired. The production quality is the most impressive attribute on this album. They're no solid singles that you've always expected from Janet Jackson. \\"All For You\\" started the trend of her releasing shallow albums, heavily explicit and sexual. I'd forgiven her for the XXX \\"Damita Jo\\" and new that she would redeem herself. Madonna did it with \\"Confession On A Dance Floor\\" after that awful \\"American Life\\" album. But Janet has failed to deliver to us something memorable, groundbreaking or worthy of our time. If you don't it, purchase \\"Velvet Rope.\\" It is by far her best work to date. And what's up with that tired bootleg album cover that was designed by a fan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't believe in Janet anymore.","review":"Janet used to be an icon, now she's just like every other singer who releases horrible music only purchased by her undying fans who'll purchase absolute garbage just so they can say they are the \\"true\\" fans. This CD is levels below her previous work and even levels below the catostrophic Damita Jo release. Janet began getting old and tired when she released All For You and all her creativity and talent just seemed to fly right out the window. This is the rock bottom for her and it shows. Every song on here sounds like filler, and those annoying, disruptive interludes are still present. This was supposed to be a return to form for her, but it's obvious that was just said to hype the record. I'm no longer looking forward to anymore releases from this washed-up \\"artist\\", I've lost faith in her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I all alone?","review":"Am i the only real music lover left on this planet that thinks, no knows, that Janet CANNOT sing. Don't get me wrong, very nice body, nice dancing, but her voice is garbage. For that matter none of the Jacksons can sing, stop playing, keep it real."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALRIGHT","review":"Let me be totally honest, this album is OK at best. The 20 Y.O album is not classic janet or new and improved janet, just overproduced janet...nowhere near the level of her previous works. I would have been happier with a digitally mastered 20th anniversary re-issued Control album."},{"rating":"2","title":"JANET\\"S BACK!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The more I listen to this CD the better it gets. Every week I have a different fav track. First it was the DO IT TO ME, then GET IT OUT OF ME. Right now its DAYBREAK. Other stand out tracks are:WITH ULOVE 2 LOVEENJOYSHOW ME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet's OK","review":"I've never been a serious Janet Jackson fan. I mean, the girl is definitely beautiful, and can dance her a** off, but I never thought she had a strong singing voice. However, I give her much respect cause she knows how to entertain. I bought this to commemorate her anniversary ... and it was worth the price of the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 years old? have you learned nothing?","review":"This is album is was total disappointment. It was supposed to be a 20 year tribute to Control. If only even one song on the album could even hold a torch to Nasty it would be something. Come on Janet...give us what we want!Janet is at best her in the pop genre with a hint of R&B; flavor. On this album she just misses the groove. It's no wonder this album has one of her worst selling first week sales. Even though Damita Jo floundered under the backlash from the Super Bowl flashing inicident, it was a much better album overall and closer in every respect to classic Janet.We love you Janet, but we don't want grooves with no hook or catchy chorus. Stick to what you do best. Maybe it's time to keep Germaine Dupree in the bedroom, but out of your career. Here's hoping you still have a career at 25 yrs old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JANET GOES ELECTRO-TRIP-HOP R&B on 20 Y.O. !!!!!!!!!","review":"If you thought Run DMC had some wicked beats & sounds on there earlyer stuff...then JANET'S new album \\"20 Years Old\\" takes you on a very similar funky-fresh dance zippy hippy dippin' yo-thang type of vibe ! Does that make any sense ?...nor does twenty years of being in the music bussiness according Janet's new album!One might get confused as to which cd artwork to choose from...I counted 5 different versions released in the USA today (9-26-2006). The music is a clever blend of crisp,cool sounding futuristic bleeps and Zaaaps; mixed with Janet's mellow sultry purrs & hyms..I mean like real hyms as in praiseing the lord like on my favorite track \\"enjoy\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"It's rare that an establised artist gains new fans. Which would probably explain the lack of air play. 15 year olds just aren't listening to artists from the 80's and 90's. With this in mind it's puzzling that Janet would release 2 albums back to back with the same type of R&B / Hip-Hop material. Yes it's popular but your fan base isn't listening to this type of music. Madonna has figured this out, it's a shame Janet hasn't. Follow your fan base. Most of us dedicated fans still listen to the old material, dance, pop. Despite what Janet says this is not a dance album. I don't know of any club that is playing this material. It's not that it's a bad album. It's just doesn't have any stand out singles. Each song blends into the next with no change in tempo. It's just not catchy or exciting. Still it is significantly better than Damita Jo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you and is enjoyable","review":"I was a hater of this cd but re-listened to it a couple days ago. I don't know what I was thinking!In fact, I have new favorite songs now.. \\"Get it Out Me\\" and \\"Daybreak\\" are very good and the latter is beautiful because of the bells in the background.\\"Show Me\\", \\"Do it 2 Me\\", \\"With U\\" are also nice ones.Some of the best songs are ones you love more with each listening and that's what happens with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 Y.O. is Classic Janet - A Must Have!","review":"Janet Jackson's new album is so good! The beats are hot and Janet sounds amazing! The DVD is a look inside the Call On Me video shoot and dancer rehersals, it is a nice addition to this smokin CD.Definately a must have of 2006!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was She Even In The Studio?","review":"All the \\"tricks\\" in the studio and special sound effects cannot hide the fact that Janet Jackson is indeed a very weak \\"singer.\\" I've always contended that she was firstly a dancer.Overall, I don't consider people talented, who need 30 to 40 dancers behind them with explosions and light shows to destract from the fact that the \\"singer\\" cannot sing. I didn't buy this, I heard it at a friend's house and thought it pathetic. You can hardly hear Ms. Jackson, she seems to be singing from the room upstairs while the microphone and orchestra are downstairs!I confess, I have never purchased one of her albums and never will. I lean more towards singers that can really BLOW. This lady just whimpers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beats but not good songs","review":"I was disappointed by Ms. Jackson.

After i actually purchased it, it literally has been in my CD player only twice. Once when i first bought it to skim thru it and the second was because my sister was in my car and wanted to hear it. The moment i got back in the driver's side it came out. The only reason why i bought it was because JERMAINE produced it. And I am truley a fan. He doesnt get the credit he deserves for his talent. But this time i can honestly say this was not his best. I was so disappointed in him. Im not sure if this was rushed, but this is NOT HER BEST..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This a horrible CD. The songs are devoid of any melody. Not one single track has a good hook or stays with you. It's one big yawn. Once again the lyrical content is mostly about how sexy she thinks she is and how bad she wants to get....well, you know what she wants, she's been singing about it like a broken record for the last decade. The CD sounds like outtakes from \\"All for You\\" or \\"Damita Jo\\". Those were not very good albums and these songs aren't even good enough for them. If you like today's R & B (which has neither R(rhythm) nor B(blues)) then this kind of posturing posing as music might appeal to you.

It seems she's given up all of her ambitions from the '80s and '90s and decided to settle for anonymous cookie-cutter R&B; drivel. Granted, there are a few decent tracks (\\"Enjoy,\\" \\"Take Care,\\" & the foreign bonus track \\"Days Go By\\"), but the vast majority of the album wouldn't make the cut as filler on any of her pre-\\"All For You\\" albums.I was a big fan of Janet's up until \\"All For You,\\" but she needs to get her act together... and fire Jermaine!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"20 years: Control to out of Control","review":"I never thought i would write anything on here,but i cant take this.I have been a fan of Miss Jackson's music for twenty years now and ive never been so dissopointed...let me get to the point.If it aint broke dont fix it.This album sounds like Mariah Carey's\\"Emancipation of MIMI\\"A true fan grew up with production by The Great Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis not this Jermaine Dupri sound of the so-called culture. There is nothing on this album that is brave or progressive,i know she said she was not trying to be serious...But i had no idea it was for a sixth grader.As long as she continues to allow JD in on the studio sessions her material will suffer.Her music has been dumbed down.Like i said im 20yrs in but if it aint broke dont fix it.Jermaine's sound is killing her.He should go somewhere and wait on Mr. Raymond."},{"rating":"1","title":"janet it's time to retire","review":"how many times can she show off the goodies janet dear everybody seen your wardfrone malfunction numerous times and if she let ratboy jermaine dupri hitr anybody can her cd sucks just like nher last 2 cd';s suck pass this on by the jackson family has no clout since mj wenmt broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Bad Album","review":"Janet is no longer daring. If doing porn is daring then maybe. She just has nothing to talk about and what's worse, her music is bland and boring. So sad to see the woman who used to create great albums, keep churning out the same dud more than twice now. She just doesn't get it. Her image is awful, her fanbase is gone. None of this had to happen, she let it happen. Her albums sound souless and pure fluff. Janet needs another Rhythm Nation or Velvet Rope. Something that expands her as an artist again. I doubt she'll wise up though. She end up like the rest of the Jacksons, in their own little world, and over the hill clowns. She was the normal Jackson. Now she turned out like all the rest of them. She retreats into her own little sex world while not dealing with reality. Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations","review":"This album really exceeded my expectations.

Now. You have an amazing musical legacy that will last forever - please don't sully it with more boring releases like this one. I have always loved Janet's music and I hate to say it, but whereas once she was an innovator and looked ahead, she has now been left behind.

What in the world are they thinking? \\"So Excited\\" is great, but only because of the girl rapping. I can't believe CALL ON ME was #1 on the R&B charts. Where is Rene Elezondo? He really helped Janet produce some really good music. Stop blaming Jermaine for this terrible disc!! This cd is just a hot mess!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone girl!","review":"Pros: Janet Jackson has created a very impressive album with beats that make you want to juke, lyrics that make you like/love that special someone all over again, and remind you who's really running things in R&B.; Songs like \\"Do It To Me,\\" \\"Love 2 Love,\\" and \\"Take Care\\" are classic songs that make you close your eyes and reminisce on \\"that guy\\" or \\"that lady.\\" On \\"20 Part 2,\\" it is obvious why Janet has come so far. Her interludes are as tight as her full songs! I wasn't really into \\"Call on Me\\" at first (nor the video) but the more I hear it, the more it starts to rub off on me. I like Nelly's melodic voice.Cons: I know screw music is supposed to be the new \\"in\\" thing but the rap on \\"This Body\\" slowed down the album for a minute. That could've been left off altogether.Other than that one song, this album was a play-all-the-way-through classic.

I'm sure she does this so that all the negative reviews can be discredited. SORRY MS. JACKSON I AM FOREAL!I don't know it seems to me that Janet needs to take control of herself and stop making music. Honestly she's never been much of a singer to begin with. She was an entertainer and now she's an aging entertainer. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against growing older, I just think you should do it gracefully. A fortish woman losing her clothing on stage while peforming with a twenty something is not graceful at all.

Janet was ready to take us to another level. I'm a fan of Janet's Slow Jams! All of them!!! on this CD I'd have to say the song titled \\"Take care of me\\" stole my heart!

I really like most of her previous albums but this one I will not consider it as one of her best albums. My opinion is that she whisper or mumble most of the songs.Just about all of them are at the same tempo when it come to her vocals.

Yes there are interesting insights and anecdotes peppered around the book, but the reader has to work hard for any reward.

It is much easier to move and position, image is great, does 8x11 sizes really good. I use it inmy bathroom and set it on my music stand at a height thats very comfortable for me to trace the image.I really think it works better then the Prism at 1/3 the price.If your a painter and need canvas size images I'm going to advise you to try the Tracer.

Its focus feature doesn't do much, with \\"focus\\" usually involving moving around the chair or whatever else this is resting on. There is no way to adjust elevation other than to stack items on which to rest the machine and hope the stack doesn't fall. The room must be so dark that the user can't see what they're tracing or if anything was missed. In this case, you don't get what you pay for because it costs more than it's worth.

When I returned it to the store they basically replied \\"Oh well its a cheap projector\\".

But since I have retired this griddle. It is too hard to clean up and is limited to what it can cook. I have a non stick Cephalon 13 inch griddle with a handle on it that is smaller but much easier to clean and use. Also some large Non stick skillets. All much easier to use. But the large griddle is impressive looking. I don't need any more of this Cast Iron conditioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This product is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it.

And food still sticks.With this product, I scrub the pan clean and then put just a dab in the skillet. Rub the gel/oil around until the entire inside of the pan is lightly coated, and put it away.

I'm not sure that it's better than shortening (Crisco for example), but it's more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Seems a bit better than shortening or cooking oil for restoring cast iron that has been abused by soaps and abrasive scrubbers. Since the conditioner won't turn rancid over time like those products, it is great for cast iron that gets stored (sometimes for months) like a camping dutch oven.

I am concerned about breast cancer (with a family history) and am currently on Tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer. I wanted some answers about using preventative drugs like this and possible alternatives. This book has the information I need to further discuss this with my doctor. It explains diet, supplements and testing in a technical manner but it also summarizes everthing more simply at the end of each step. There is a great explanation of estrogen, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Good Second Installment","review":"The Sorcerer's Gun by Peter Garrison is the second volume in the Changeling saga that was started in The Changeling War. It picks up right where the first book left us hanging. TSG is just as good as the first book and doesn't let up.The characters are developed further as we get a closer and more in depth look at the fantasy world of the castle. Some of the book still takes place in our \\"real\\" world as it did in the first book, but most of it takes place in castle.As some mysteries get resolved in this book, more get introduced. The plot grows, but it is still understandable and fun. This series is a great one for both veteran fantasy readers and for first time fantasy readers.This installment of the Changeling Saga ends like the first, with the reader hanging and wishing for more. The third volume is scheduled for publication in early 2000 so there won't be too long to wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it!","review":"This product was dry no matter how much top coat you put on.

There are not many good books on this neglected founding father, and this one is by no means exhaustive, but it does give a good, balanced overview of his role as the president of Princeton College and the only clergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence, among other significant contributions to the founding of the United States of America. The list of his students at Princeton that went on to serve in government roles is staggering by itself, and secures his place in American History.This book merely whets your appetite to know more about Witherspoon, but unfortunately, there are not many other sources to go deeper, so I recommend this great volume about a neglected founder that deserves more attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money....this book is tripe.","review":"this book isn't worth the paper it's written on...it provides no insight into parenting, and it has silly/annoying cartoons throughout. it reads quickly, because there's no substance....and yet i couldn't even bear to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanus System VM200S TV Wall Mount","review":"Great product at a great price.

The book doesn't even explain how to create the basic user interface. this book is a farce. The book's author should have been persuaded to rename the book, C++ for beginners, and even then it touches so little on the Object Oriented Programming, that you could laugh. You would be better off learning VC++ with a MCSD book or someother VC++ programming book.I read this book and can't believe that the author never even used VC++, just MSDOS application.

The pink one is newer version as well and you will find a similar comment from someone that bought it.

Has been durable too - tossed about in the van a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I bought a leapster for my daughter for Christmas of 2008, well fast forward 11 mths later and the darn thing won't power on anymore.Customer service was a real help after giving them all of my information and being put on hold I was informed it was past the 90 day warranty and that there was nothing they could do about it.So I let them know I wasted my money on something that doesn't last and told them I would be posting a review here about it too!Buyer beware, We have 3 leapsters in our house and only 1 of them works correctly all of the time.Our other one has dead spots or needs to re-calibrated all of the time and of course the first one won't turn on at all either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun and educational even for some children under 4...","review":"This is the second Leapster in our home. We bought the pink one for our daughter last Christmas. She was 2.5 yrs at the time. While it was perhaps just a bit advanced, not too much, for our little girl, she still enjoyed. At that age she particularly enjoyed the simple built-in drawing program. On year later she has a few cartridges and enjoys figuring out the different games. This green Leapster was for our son who is only two and some months. Again the Leapster is a little to advanced for a child this age. However I've noticed that our boy also likes the drawing program. The Diego cartridge is definitely too complex for our boy, but we know he'll eventually figure it out. For now he's sharing it with his older sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of glitches","review":"We bought this item for Christmas 2005. I would recommend keeping your receipt and box for return. The Leapster worked fine for 2 weeks, but now lots of glitches and power outages. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Of course, we had just trashed the receipt and box. Very frustrating for 5 year old, as well as us! When it works, it is a fun learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another broken Leapster","review":"This is a great toy, but Leapfrog doesn't seem to be able to get their quality control together. Please, guys, you NEED to fix these widespread screen problems. I hate seeing my kid disappointed because his favorite toy is broken again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be rough on it...","review":"We purchased this toy for our son last Christmas, and it was the #1 hit in our house. Both my son (6.5 yrs) and my daughter (4.5 yrs.) loved it. We took it on vacation this April, and a heavy-handed friend of my son's played with it, ruining the screen (he pressed the stylus on the monitor too hard). The screen now has black lines down it and you can't see well anymore. I tried to contact the company via email to see if we could get the screen replaced, and they NEVER REPLIED.So, I'd have to lean toward the \\"buyer beware\\" camp of these ratings. My son is very dissappointed.Good luck..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, a great toy!","review":"My mother sent the leapster to my son for Christmas, we didn't pull it until right after his second birthday. I was relucant to pull it out because of the age listed on there, and my son was not up to speed with a lot of things. Now (still 2)he know his shape, and it took only a matter of a few weeks. We also have the \\"my first leapad bus\\" He gets so much more use out of the leapster. I love it and would buy it 100 times over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"leapster","review":"We have a 4 year old that just loves the leapster. We are very pleased with it as well. One complaint-One of the choices that comes loaded into the game is a series of ads for other cartridges. I feel this is inappropriate. I can see including a leaflet or booklet in the product packaging but to actually load this into the game is not right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for two weeks","review":"My 3 and 6 year old loved the item but after buying it for Christmas, it only worked for two weeks before the touchscreen stopped working. I then found a number of websites where people report this is a very common problem and has been for at least a year. Some people have returned two, three, even four of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Leapster","review":"My son received a Pixter for Christmas 2003 which we exchanged for a Leapster due to the increased educational experience. What a mistake! In the middle of January, my son started experiencing the infamous calibration problem with his Leapster. We returned the Leapster to the store and received a new one. Now, it too is having calibration problems.Save yourself alot of time and don't buy a Leapster. Or, if its too late, like me, keep your investment in the Leapster software low. If you aren't having the calibration problem - you will. I'm hoping that the company will publicly acknowledge the problem and do a recall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype!","review":"After having my son completely ignore the LeapPad and PowerTouch systems, I was hesitant to spend my money on the Leapster. Having such good reviews, I decided to give it a go. Finally, a toy that will keep my 4-year old son's attention! By far, this is the most he has EVER played with any toy. We started with the Dora cartridge and the one that comes with the game. Both cartridges have several \\"games\\", each with three levels. He has easily mastered the first level of each and is working now on the second level. I love the fact that they have designed the cartridges to provide progressive learning experiences. We also bought the Kindergarten cartridge recently and he loves that as well. I would encourage buyers to get some type of carrying case, as the cartridges are rather small and get easily misplaced in a 4-year old's room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge hit at our house!!","review":"My seven year old and four year old both LOVE the leapster. We have had it for a few months now and, unlike the leap pads they both have, it isn't one of those toys that they get bored of after a few uses. It is still used on a daily basis. Every child that comes over to play (from ages 2 to about 8 yrs) takes instantly to the Leapster. My only complaint is that now I have to buy another one b/c they all want to use it so much! (and sometimes they have to fight mommy to play it to, lol)The pros, it is small and very portable. It doesn't have the books to keep track of, like the leap pads do. It is VERY interactive with various levels on the games to suit kids of various ages. I would recommend buying the carrying case as well though b/c it is an easy place to store the games so they don't get lost. As a mom, the best part is that it is so educational. They are so creative with incorporating math, etc though, that the kids don't even notice they are learning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"The LEAPSTER series has HORRIBLE history regarding the touch screen. The unit may last fine for 3-4 months, but YOU WILL experience a complete failure of the screen to respond to the touch pen. For us, it occurred outside of the warranty period (at 8 months of use). There is a plethora of people who have had the same problems with this product (Google \\"Leapster screen problems\\"). I recommend that you completely avoid this product altogether until LeapFrog stands behind their product with a better warranty. At $60 for the unit and $20 per game, I hardly consider it to be a \\"toss in the trash after 3 months\\" toy, but that is all that their warranty covers. As I titled this, BUYER BEWARE - I recommend that you find another product with less problems, or expect to be frustrated soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EDUCATIONAL/FUN ELECTRONIC TOY OUT THERE!","review":"I JUST BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR CHRISTMAS FOR MY 7YR OLD BOY, AND ALMOST 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.

I SHOWED IT TO MY 13 YEAR OLD AND HE EVEN LIKED IT AND PLAYED AROUND WITH IT (MOSTLY BECAUSE HE LIKES SPONGEBOB TOO)HE SAID IT WAS PERFECT FOR HIS LITTLE SISTER AND BROTHER AND HE KNOW'S THEY'LL LOVE IT--ME TOO. I WAS GLAD I BOUGHT THIS OVER THE LEAPFROG WRITING PAD BECAUSE I COULDNT DECIDE WHICH ONE TO GET BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH GREAT PRODUCTS, BUT THIS ONE CAN DO JUST AS MUCH, I BELIEVE IT HAS A GAME YOU CAN BUY THAT YOUR KIDS CAN ALSO WRITE WITH IT JUST LIKE THE LEAPPAD, AND THE COOLEST PART IS THAT ITS JUST LIKE A VIDEO GAME THAT TEACHES THEIR FIRST STEPS TO READING,MATH,WRITING AND BEYOND.IT'S REALLY WORTH THE MONEY.AND ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, A Fun Educational Toy","review":"My three (almost four) year old loves his Leapster. He takes it everywhere. I am loving how well it keeps him entertained in the car and even at restaraunts. I only wish that they made software for the popular characters for each age group. He really wants the Incredibles but it is appropriate for much older children.I was concerned because I had read reviews indicating that the screen was too fragile. My son has dropped it on the sidewalk several times and so far, it has held up beautifully.Also, though he has used it daily for several weeks, we are still on our first set of batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"gad","review":"this falls in the catagory of tries to do to much and sucks at everything.first of all, we purchased it for my sister for christmas, and she NEVER uses it. first of all, the touch screen barley works,(if you draw a line, it does the jaged thang)and the games are boring (the only games that my sister has ever played was the free game that came with it. they have already made another version of it.

The L-Max is a what older system now. We owned one a while back. Had a bad experience with it. Had to get a replacment. You can check my review on it Leapster L-Max Learning Game System. But check out theLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Greenor theLeapFrog Leapster Explorer Learning Game System (Green), before you decide. These are both much more recent systems from Leapfrog, at MUCH better prices then the price of the L-max here. The Explorer is the most recent system from Leapfrog. Do some research before you decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an educational game that keeps their interest!!!!!!","review":"Finding toys for my son that he will still be interested in the next day is like mission impossible. He is 6 years old and loves to be actively engaged in what he's doing. Cars and trucks just lose his interest. Well, I had a friend then tell me about the Leapster. I decided to give it a chance over the Game Boy, and I'm glad I did. He has not set it down since Christmas morning. The graphics on the screen are amazing. He only got 1 game with it, Dora (all the others were sold out), and he loves it. I love the fact that he's having fun and learning at the same time. Every parent should get this system. It is awesome and you won't regret it. If a boy as picky as mine loves it, trust me, your child will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN IT WORKS - it's 5 Stars !!!!","review":"We are now on our 3rd Leapster and the stylus is again not synching correctly with the screen. When you 'point' to a '1' a '3' gets clicked and so on...However Leapster is great and has swapped them for us in the past, [...] - that said though when it works our 5 year old will play on it for hours - recommend you get the rechargeable power pack or buy shares in Duracell....!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift for fun and learning","review":"5 yr old grandson, has all types of toys and video games to play, but likes this one best because of the different levels of games to play. Never boring for him as he can ramp up the challenges the leapster offers and its mobility makes it so he can take when he travels. I don't have an opinion on the durability yet. Overall I feel $ well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves to learn with Leapster","review":"This is a great product, why didn't they have things like this when I was a kid??? We already had a pink one for his sister, and my son had been asking for this for over a year, and got one this year. He will sit on his bed playing games with it as long as we will allow it. He loves the cars game and instead of just mindless interaction like the playstation etc. he is actually learning something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational toy","review":"The best learning toy I ever bought my son. It is a must for every family with preschool and school age children. Daycares must have this toy!

He likes this game but it doesn't have the excitement of the video games he plays at the store. The Leapster more than satisfies his craving for a video game. He received game boy advanced and leapster and he put down the game boy to go back to the leapster. The screen is a nice size and he can play it in the dark. I really can't say enough about this... it will be passed down to my younger children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleased mother","review":"I thought about getting my 5 year old daughter a gameboy advance for Christmas but found this and thought I would see how she liked it. WOW I cant get her away from it!! She plays it all the time. With the Dora cartridge she already knows her colors in spanish!!! With its backlit screen and the awesome animation if you are looking for an educational game that wont rot your kids minds with violence and nonsense this is for you!!

She does not get bored with it quickly at all....and it is educational and fun for her. I played some of the games to check it out. It lights up well enough, even when we were in the car recently at night, she could see it just fine. The screen is wide enough, and the quality of the images are good I think. Of course, it has different levels (1 - 3) which is great too. I was worried she might have trouble working it, since she has never had a hand-held game system before, but she had no problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning device!","review":"I bought this for my daughter her 5th birthday. She has been playing it almost nonstop.

Last Christmas I bought it for my daughter, she played with it for a short period of time, loved it, but the touch screen stopped working right. Certain parts of the screen wouldn't work. So we brought it back and got another one. Guess what? It did the SAME thing! And I hate to even say it, but I brought that one back and got a third, I thought it was working better, it was for a while, but after a month or so, she couldn't even play some of the games because the screen slowly started doing the same thing again!! So take it from me, three bad ones can not be a fluke, the touch screen on this item is POORLY MADE. I was very disappointed and so was my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylus Problems","review":"I must have a Lemon. I also bought my 4 year old a Leapster for Christmas. We are having problems with the stylus not getting a response when touching the screen. In calibration mode, I can not get a response from the top right hand corner or middle targets with the stylus. We also have difficulty having the stylus to work when choosing a \\"player\\" and at various other places throughout the programming.Update: I have returned my Leapster for a replacement. The replacement works flawlessly. There must have been a bad batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE- THE DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY","review":"Within the first week of purchase of this product the stylus went bad. The retail store would not exchange so we had to call leap frog. Leap frog was unwilling to replace the stylus contrary to the terms of their warranty and i understood that after 3 seperate calls to them to representatives that had a hard time grasping the englisdh language. I guess they too outsource their customr service center to some country on the other side of the world. Needless to say, we will never purchase any product again from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a risky purchase","review":"Bought this last year for Christmas for my 3 yr. old son. For a year I thought he was leaving it on because it never seemed to have a charge. Instead of getting better the problem kept getting worse. Until finally, I put new batteries in it and it indicated no charge before it even booted. When I contacted their customer service department, Leap Frog told me there was nothing they could do because it was more than 90 days old. My older son has the Leapster L-Max and likes it and the games are educational and age appropriate...when they work."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"I bought this for my son's birthday in November of 2006. I had the choice of getting him the leapster or the leapster l-max.I chose this one because the screen was bigger and it had all the same features, plus, I wanted something portable, I mean we have learning games for the computer, so I wouldn't have to move my husband's gamecube and other systems that he has going on (a plus for that).Fromt he moment he received it, he's been addicted, he calls it his gameboy and he doesn't realize he's learning new stuff while he's using it. I love how he gets soooooo excited when he gets a lil star or a congratulations o something.The Leap Frog toys are great, I'll be a Leap Frog mommy for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"My son was given this on his 4th b-day, he absolutely loves it and so do I!

After just a few months of use both Leapsters died. The company will not answer any phone calls or e-mails. I recently found a web group where NUMEROUS consumers experienced the same problem. With how expensive these units are we should be able to get more than a few months out of them and the Multi-million corporation should be able to have a customer service office that will at least acknowledge a customer's problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great toy for kids all the way upto age 8 or more","review":"I just bought Leapster for my 6 year old for Christmas. I was a little hesitant because Amazon's recommended age was upto 6, eventhough the manufacturer's age was upto 8. There are plenty of cool educational games and activities in the Leapster to keep her entertained and challenged for quite a while yet. And the back of the box said they will be releasing software soon for second graders. I cannot even begin to tell you how smooth the animation and graphics are on this toy. Also If a player cannot accomplish the game at the level they are trying, it stops and gives a quick tutorial to help them and then encourages them to try again. If they still can't get it, the game knows to get easier. It's absolutely amazing. I'm glad I spent the money on it and I know she's going to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOY","review":"I bought the Leapster two years ago for my then 4 yr old...when it first came out. It has really been a great toy. My daughter loves it. When my younger child started playing with it, we bought him one, too. They still play it frequently....especially on trips in the car. They will be getting more cartridges this Christmas. I highly recommend this toy for it's educational and entertainment value.The Leapster does go through a lot of batteries - - though I certainly don't have to change them as often as some of the other reviews have suggested. I know there is a recharging station you can purchase, which might solve the proble...though I haven't found it necessary get one. Overall this has been a great buy for my family. You won't regret giving this to your child for Christmas! I hope they continue to come out with more cartridges! Way to go Leapfrog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its good -but beware!","review":"I have purchased two leapsters (originals) because my kids love them and they learn alot. Yes, you go through alot of batteries, but something you must know is we have had problems with both and have sent them both back to Leap Frog to receive replacements. However, both are acting up again. One wont recalibrate and the other makes an annoying sound when a game is inserted. What you need to know if that LeapFrog only warranties these for 6 MONTHS! I personally think this wrong! You pay alot for these systems and I think that they should stand behind their products alittle better than that. Just wanted to give all of you this notice before you consider buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"has my vote","review":"I manage an afterschool program for k-8.

Well i wasn't disappointed. The only thing i was disappointed about was they release a 2nd version about a month after my purchase. The nice thing about this one is that the new games are backwards compatable and the pen/stylus is attached so you can't loose it. My son played this for hours and hours when we got it in the mail. He still plays it on a regular basis (it lost some of its cool value) but it is still a very entertaining/educational game system. You can get just about any disney/pixar character you want in a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so durable","review":"We purchased the Leapster for our daughter last Christmas and she likes it (although she says she would rather have a DS). However, last month she was sitting on a step stool (very low to the ground) and the Leapster slipped out of her hands and fell to the tile floor. The leapster has not worked since and I have tried everything. This is a children's toy and should be able to withstand a fall to the floor without permanent damage. We were very disappointed and could not even blame our daughter. It was just an accident. That having been said, we are shelling out for a new one this Christmas, but be warned and do not drop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice!!","review":"I had purchased the leap pad for my daughter and she barely looked at it. I was scared to spend the money on this thinking the same thing would happen, but it didn't. As soon as we opened it and put the batteries in she was using it. It was very easy for her to navigate and she is 5 years old. We have the Dora and Drawing cartridges. She takes it in the car and we take it to resturants to entertain her while we wait for our food.

Now this one lasted one play time and now will not turn back on. It is now past the 30 day return time for Amazon. Doesn't really matter because I will not be messing with another one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter yesterday and we can already tell she is going to love it. I expected that I would have to help her at first but she was so interested in it I was just left to sit and watch her play! She got the knack of playing the games and using the stylus quickly since everything is explained as you play. The games installed on the leapster are great: art studio, memory game, shape sorting, all things she loves to do. We bought extra game cartridges (princess and letter factory)when we bought the Leapster, we thought she might need them.

I look forward to the recharger coming since we are already on our second set of batteries (which is why I gave it a 4 for durability.)

There is also a Pre-Kg. cartridge becoming available soon. There is a charging dock that will be available soon as well as a carrying case that will hold the Leapster and 6 cartridges. After falling in love with the concept of the LeapPad Books, I have focused most of our son's presents and friend's presents on LeapFrog products. This product is more than worth the money.

The screen just goes dead in the center. My sister is on her third. the same thing is hapening to hers. I can't say it's from missuse. I am at the point that I don't even want to buy anymore games for it. It gets to be expensive at 20$ ea and the thing is always breaking.

It was a bit advanced at the time, but he loved trying to play it anyway. As he has grown, it has stayed a favorite in our house. The original games we bought have become educational at different levels and there are always new games. We only own 4 games and he is never bored with it. I think it is a great gift for boy or girl ages 3-6 and feel it is something they will use for years.I do recommend getting the charging station, as batteries tend to wear out. We bring the charging station on trips so we can charge it before the next car ride.We don't have any other accessories, but it would be nice to have a container that holds the Leapster and the games together.If you have someone under 3, the My First LeapPad was great and we passed it on to our younger child when our first upgraded to the Leapster."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!!!","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present when my son was 4 yrs. old -- he's 5 now. He absolutely loves it and has quickly learned how to navigate everything on his own, which isn't really surprising as he's very tech savvy. The games are extremely educational (I tested it out myself!), but fun at the same time so there is NO way kids would get bored playing it. He's got every game except for the ones designed for girls. He's still in kindergarten, but he often plays with the cartridges at the 1st grade level. I definitely would recommend this toy to all parents. Most parents complain about the price, but I still think it's worth buying because it teaches kids so much. But still, it's a shame it's practically half the price I paid for it because it is so affordable now and it even comes in new colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My four-year-old is in love","review":"I bought this for my four-year-old son for his birthday. He absolutely adores the system. His teenaged cousins love it too. I view it one of my best investments in my child's entertainment because it is educational and fun as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest toy ever","review":"this toy has been in our house for over a year. My now 5 year old daughter still picks it as her favorite toy. Anytime a long car ride is in order, the leapster comes with us. It is the greatest learning tool, the kids do not even realize they are learning. I recommend getting the rechargable battery with the charger base to go with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapster, excellent alternative to Game Boy","review":"My 5 year old has been begging for a Game Boy, but I am reluctant because I would like to see him use his free time for something more educational...so I bought the Leapster and WE LOVE IT!!! It fullfills his need for a handheld game while at the same time meeting all my \\"educational\\" requirements. He is able to use it without help (after a month or so of practice), and his 3 year old sister can even manage some of the more simpler games. We bought Dora's Wildlife Rescue, as well as Spiderman, and Kindergarten. The only one I wouldn't recoomend is The letter Factory, and ONLY if like me you already own the DVD and the Leapster game will then be boring. This is a must have for kids going into, or already in kindergarten. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the screen tends to get scratched the more we use it. Still, even knowing that in a year or so we might need a new one, I WOULD STILL make purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH EVERY PENNY","review":"Bought it for my 3.5 yr old and she can't put it down. Even the games on it were great. It is very durable unlike some of the leap pads we have bought in the past. I wish I didn't waste my money on the past leap pads.We bought the V-Smile system first since it had great reviews but I am SOOO happy that we returned it. She hardly played with it and the graphics stunk. It wasn't clear what letters were on the screen.There are sooooo many different things to play on this system.Being able to pack it up and bring it in the car is great too. I give it an A ++++++++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"these drop like flies","review":"between my daughter and my niece, they've been through 3 of these. 2 of them had lines going down the screen before they were a year old, and all of them totally stopped working and don't even turn on. I contacted Leapfrog and they said if it's a year old and/or I have no proof of purchase, they can't do anything about it but told me I could purchase a new one on their website. I guess they don't care that they have a crappy product, as long as they're making money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy...battery killer though","review":"I bought this for my son for his 5th birthday and he loves it! His favorite game is the Sponge Bob game that his 9 and 10 year old sister and brother like to play as well. Its great because he looks at it as his 'Gameboy\\". He is having fun and learning as well. I wish leapfrog would lower the prices on the software. I will be getting the charging station because it needs batteries after 3 hours of play. Also Radio shack does have a car charger for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!!!","review":"I bought this for my sons 4th birthday, and he loves it. He has the cartridge that came with it, and the Kindergarten cartridge.I've already got the First Grade cartridge to use while we're on vacation. This is an *excellent* toy for the car or anywhere that you have to wait. The only thing is at this price you want to make sure to keep up with it, so I may need a bigger purse! Also as much as we love it, this thing sucks batteries dry. We go through about two sets of batteries a week. We're looking forward to the docking station/recharger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both our kids love them","review":"We have two of these, one for the 6yr old and one for the 3yr old. They both love them. As parents we find many of the games to be very educational and that they reinforce the learning the kids are doing in school. Also great for road trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"williesmom","review":"I bought this for my son for his 4th birthday. He uses it every free moment he has and the batteries have held up really well for so much use. He learned very quickly how to use the internal games and loves to draw and color. A great gift for any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Substitute for Gameboy or Nintendo DS","review":"I bought this for my five year old son for Christmas. He asked for a Nintendo DS. Leapster has a lot similarities with these other systems. It is more durable and educational. My older kids - Ages 10 & 11 - also like to play it. They don't even realize that they are learning. It's just that they are playing a game. I also like that there are many different games available."},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is worth every penny!","review":"My son (age 4) is the most active kid in the universe, but this toy keeps him quiet for hours! He loves it. It's highly portable, and he likes to bring it with him wherever he goes. It does a great job of teaching basic math, spelling, phonics and other important concepts while keeping him entertained. A terrific toy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapster FAILS!","review":"Why the Leapster was fun for my kids when we first got it, we have had to return two Leapster because the screen will not calibrate. This has only been in a two month period. If I have to return to get a new one every month it is not worth it. I am curious to hear if the Pixster is having the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of age range","review":"I ordered this because it said 4-10yrs in the description, even the picture of the package shown on Amazon says 4-10yrs but the box I received says 4-8. So I went to Toys R Us and they had boxes with both age ranges. I am not sure if Leapster changed the age range or if this product has two different age ranges. But I was looking for something that would be appropriate for 8-10 age range. Since I purchased it as a Christmas present I can not rate the toy itself at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend a replacement plan","review":"This is an excellent toy, however, the touch-screen durability leaves a lot to be desired. There have been 4 Leapsters in my house in the past 18 months.I purchased the first for my 4-year-old. That one crapped out less than a month after purchase, so I took it back to the store. The second was covered by a replacement plan. After the second one died, I called the replacement-plan administators who instructed me to send the game to them. Three weeks later, I had a check for the replacement.I finally replaced that one and to top it off, I also had to purchase another for my 2-year-old. In total, my house has seen 4 leapsters.I strongly encourage one to purchase the replacement plan. $15 extra in the beginning saved me $140 on game consoles and over $200 worth of games that would have been rendered useless. Imagine those numbers now times 2.This is no exaggeration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not educational; very hard to see the screen","review":"I really regret buying this toy for my 5-year-old. I bought this instead of a GameBoy or something similar because I thought it might be more educational. Unfortunately, it isn't, and she will outgrow it quickly. I will admit that she loves it -- after all, it's a video game. But it's worthless in terms of its educational value. It teaches things like identification of triangles (uh, yeah, she's 5 -- she knows what a triangle looks like) and how to manipulate video game buttons (last time I checked, that wasn't on any proficiency test). More importantly, the screen is very little and VERY hard to see. I really limit her time on it because she sits squinting at the screen with her shoulders clenched and her neck bent over. Since this is essentially just a video game system with no educational value, I should have saved my money and gotten a Wii or a PlayStation. At least those game systems wouldn't hurt her vision and posture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective but great","review":"this product arrived defective. This is the second leapster i have purchased for my grand children and both they and the parents love them. Educational, fun and reliable with good battery life.Amazon took the defective unit back, no hassle and shipped a new unit immediately. You have got to love that kind of combination. I have also found the customer reviews immensely valuable when buying for kids that grow so quickly and ones you don't see very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!","review":"Short and simply, this is a must buy toy. Very educational and FUN. Hours will be spend playing and learning. This product is worth every penny.The product itself is very well built. Batteries last a long time. The cartridges are filled with activities to do. It is very portable.I thought the leap pad was great, but this is much more wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk for the money","review":"I thought this game was great for about the first week, then the touchscreen stopped working. You can't even get into the games because the calibration doesn't work on the unit. I've read of numerous problems of this sort and am furious that I paid over $70.00 for something with such a serious defect. The cartridges are ridiculously priced as well, and we bought 5 of them for my daughter; that means about $125 of software that is virtually useless unless I want to drop another $70 bucks on another leapster and take my chances that it works. Spend you money on books instead...there is nothing educational about a child who is frustrated because he/she keeps trying to spell his/her name and the unit won't respond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all cost","review":"Bought the Leapster for my 4 year old son who has been playing with Daddy's IPAD for over a year, based on the educational value recommendation of many customers.The first leapster survived all of 15 minutes before deciding to never turn on again. This was with my son playing with it on the sofa.Returned the defective leapster for exchange. The next one I got was a bit better - lasted 2 days before doing the same thing.Googled the words \\"Leapster wont turn on\\", to discover that whatever quality products Leapfrog made in the past, their current manufacturing runs are producing turkey after turkey that self destruct far too quickly, and with a customer service attitude that wins awards as the \\"worst customer service\\". Hundred upon hundred of comments can be found to the self destruction capabilities of this product.Returned the second one for refund.Avoid Leapfrog products at all cost unless you define \\"usability\\" as replacing the device with a new one every three months."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter Loves It","review":"Great for travel or to play around the house.

Come to find out there is some issue with the battery cartridge. I got an adapter for it and that works, but it is not a portable game now. I buy all my gifts around August for Christmas, so the warranty is expired. After reading the reviews, I don't think I will bother with replacing it. Might try upgrading though."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Stopping My 4 year old!","review":"We gave this to our little boy on his 4th birthday.

To be honest I enjoy playing with it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun without problems","review":"We had bought this toy for our 3yr old daughter and she loves it. We currently have all the games and hope for more. She is constantly playing with this on long trips and at night, instead of the TV.I wish I had read some of the reviews before purchasing this product. It has been one month so far and of course the pen doesn't respond to certain spots on the screen. I had calibrated the screen several times and since then had customer support help. There is a dead spot on the lower left, and now need to take it back to the store for a new one. Hopefully the problems are worked out since I don't feel like making a monthly trip for a new one.Great educational toy, bad quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calibration Problems!!!","review":"Two units and two bad problems with the stlus calibration.

She played with it for about two months and then became extremely frustrated because the pen was not working correctly. I tried to recalibrate it but it would not finish the process. It froze on the last point in the center. I returned the Leapster and got a new one. (The company was great about it.) It took a little while for her to become interested in it again because she had been so turned off to it when it was not working. She again played with it for a couple of months and the pen needed to be calibrated again. However, when I went to calibrate it, it did the same thing as before.

They immediately loved it and the learning concepts are great. However, I would not recommend purchasing this item, my kids are very disappointed now because the touch screen no longer works, thus making it impossible to get any further use out of the unit as they are unable to log in.

She has never been able to make it past one story reading. We bought games to go with it, but have no idea if they are good or bad, because we've not been able to get that far. The batteries die, then it sits for a while until I change them again. She plays for a little bit, they die, and then it sits again.

So I can't return it til I leave the job. Not very useful. I am stuck using the answering machine and getting a duplex phone jack, so I can use an old-fashioned corded phone for my calls, one that I can find locally.

In the wreckage he finds the remains of an amnesic cyborg which he names Alita.Battle Angel Alita is set in a world where nothing is what it seems. The dirty post-apocalyptic setting gives the writer the ability to play with the hidden and dark nature of the world.The author, Yukito Kishiro, also does a great job blending science fact with science fiction using real functions of the human body with a blend of futuristic technology to explain some of the properties of Alita's robot body.It's a terrific and exciting beginning for a series and I'd give it a 9/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST: MANGA in all it's glory","review":"After being literally resurrected by Professor Daisuke, Alita (Gally) discovers there is more to her than there seems to be.

Sure, there are pictures of the bad guy eating brains, but the character design is so ugly that it just fails to be disturbing. I can put it this way: the violence in Alita is equally disturbing to the scene in Shrek where lord Farquad tortures the gingerbred man. I couldnt care less about the characters, they were too stupid and too full of tired old cliches and sentimental junk to be interesting. \\"Somewhere deep inside me is a heart bla bla bla\\".

Of course, I wasn't expecting him to be painting any scenes of raping virgins, killing animals, or all that hocus pocus in the B-movies, but anyhow, the work could've been done far more professionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good guide on practicing satanism.","review":"i think the rituals/ceremonies are original. the only thing i don't like about this book was how Mr. LaVey didn't give some clue as to when the Black Mass or Das Tierdrama were to be performed. i also don't like how LaVey didn't tell you what chemicals to use to make the flame for the Call to Cthulhu ritual black or how he didn't show what special sigils to use in some of the rituals that didn't use the baphomet for the participant(s)to wear during the ritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I've been looking for this book for years and finally found a copy. The introduction is very good as well as the rituals themselves. In all rituals, LaVey gives background information. The H.P. Lovecraft rituals sound confusing because they seem to see Cthulu etc. as actual entities, but might be symbolized by costume. I like another reader would find this to LaVey's most inflammatory book if I had preconceptions. Satanism has the worst reputation of almost anything, at least credit LaVey for bringing logic to it as well as some damn good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"brain-food, this is good even for the solitary","review":"An outlay of many different types of well-built ritual and ceremony; I don't get the empty feeling of \\"but something's missing here\\" that i do when reading buckland or cunningham or starhawk; some of these (especially \\"Das Tierdrama\\")could be put to use no matter what your religion (even if you're an atheist), and of course the Satanic Baptisms can made to fit any religion that utilizes magik and/or the four elements. There is something powerful and moving to these rituals (even just READING them), and they seem to have more than just one or two layers to them. I believe it's the best book of rituals I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and emotionless attempts at Satanic Rituals","review":"Yet again Mr LaVey presents his own little concoction of pseudo-Satanic concepts. While reasonably well researched, Le Messe Noir (The Black Mass) is let down by the fact that it is partly in Latin and partly in English, whereas other authentic texts of this most infamous \\"satanic\\" ritual are generally entirely in Latin, and if lucky accompanied by an English translation. This for a start ruins what little the book has going for it.As for the rest of the book, the rituals are mere ceremonies, devoid of any genuine emotion, joyless, unnatural little games that even make \\"white lighter\\" rituals of the wiccans look impressive.Anyone looking for genuine satanic rituals however would already realise they aren't likely to find them in a mass produced little book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as the first","review":"I was a big fan of the first 2 sections of the satanic bible, feeling that the last part (the part dealing more with magik) was contradictory to the rest of the book. Well, this whole book is like an expansion of the that last section, and contains none of the wit and charm of the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes to long to send","review":"to long of a wait for this product to ship. i am studying all books and need it as soon as possible"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Capella album - I've heard better..","review":"I first heard the Bobs on the Harry Shearer show. Specifically, it was the \\"Slow Down, Krishna\\" song. It really reminded me of Moxy Fr��vous. However, the album itself was disappointing. There were a couple witty songs, a very good cover of Paul Simon's The Boxer, and the rest put me to sleep.If you have heard the Bobs before and have some sort of an emotional attachment to them (hearing them live, perhaps), this album might be ok for you. It wasn't for me, although occasionally I'll still listen to the tale of a Hari Krishna who spent his sect's cash on a red trans-am.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!","review":"In my opinion, a poor quality product overall. Content is inadequate (and repetitive). Monochrome print version is cheap. CD color version is garish and poorly illustrated. It is not a course at all.

This book is bad, but bad in a way that -- before I read it -- seemed impossible. The badness is transcendent in that as you read it you go through stages: disbelief, more disbelief, confusion, hilarity, and then finally a mystical place of joy in the fact that such a astoundingly bad book exists and can be purchased.

There was so much emotion and strength in this book that it has been a treasured (and much read) addition to my library. It is one book that has appeal to both non-Trekers and Trekers alike.

Instead, I found a dull collection of \\"wacky\\" and gruesome vignettes. Instead of characters, we have carboard cutouts. Instead of subversive thought, we have plain ideology. Instead of true invention, we have unfocussed experimentation. And instead of a story, we have a plot. A bruising disappointment for a huge fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful escape.","review":"Luchbreaks, train journeys, bus rides spent with tribes, gorrillas, armies and cats.

Having come to Bernieres through Corelli - which I loved (and again that puts me at odds with many others), I had high hopes for this book, but I thought it overdone and contrived. Maybe I was in the wrong mood? Whereas Corelli had kept me entranced, with smooth easy flowing prose simply wafting me from page to page, Don Emmanuel just grated on me. Corelli was made into an awful movie. I suspect someone will make a movie of Don Emmanuel too, and I'd probably enjoy it - as a flimsy distraction. But the book didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book was a keen disappointment. Although you can see the seeds of a good writer here (culminating in Correlli's Mandolin), this book is a mess. The characters are difficult to remember, and none of them elicit the least bit of sympathy. The fact that the author kills them off or subjects them to graphic torture doesn't help. As for plot, good luck. I kept hoping for some redeeming scene or resolution, but nothing arose. I sold this book to a used book store to retrieve something of merit from my waste of time.

The story, setting and characters all suck. A creaky script is dragged further through the mud by the clumsy attempts of Jude 'quite posh really\\" Law to portray a joyriding adolescent, and all action is pedestrian, predictable and clich��-ridden in its presentation. The phenomenon of teenage boys TWOC and driving Volvo estates through shop windows is potentially a great cinema story, but it's not one that is told here. This is a piece of tat which was an embarrassment to British film-making at the time and, next to a genuine criminal caper like \\"Lock, Stock...\\" looks like one of the Children's Film Foundation's poorer efforts.

I've yet to discover why, though. It never happens when I'm watching and the kids can't seem to tell me what they were doing with the game at the time it crashes so trouble-shooting it has been tricky where that's concerned.

The scientific method he extolls is nothing more than a rehash of skepticism. In fact, all science can be reduced to skepticism. Skepticism is one of the oldest philosophical positions in the world. I strongly agree with skepticism as a method of investigation, however Gardner fails to realize that those he criticizes are also skeptical. Charles Fort for instance was skeptical of data that science ignores. Yet in this book Gardner criticizes him without mercy. This seems very odd. Gardner makes several good points on being doubtful of claims and to investigate them. On this I completely agree. However his use of skepticism is seriously biased. I recommend the reading of this book,but keep a skeptical mind on Gardners claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda dated","review":"The book was a hard read, I think because it is so dated (1957).

The Einstein was Wrong chapter was a hoot. I still smile thinking of guys trying to disprove Einstein with phrases like \\"he done gone and tried to make us believe all that stuff\\".The wacky belief systems are also dissected but one has to keep in mind that this is BEFORE the age of the Hollywood medium, the channeling of the ignorant or the use of ouija boards (Reagan) or crystal balls (Hillary) at the White House.

Ythrians are an avian race, quite capable of flight. One of Poul Anderson's strengths as a writer was his ability to create imaginative non-human races and extrapolate and attribute a non-human psychology to them. The Ythrians are an unusually imaginative example of this, and the interaction between humans and Ythrians makes for a very interesting tale.This story is part of Poul Anderson's Technic Civilization future history series, which features some of Anderson's best writing. This story is set during the rise of the Terran Empire after the fall of the free-market Polesotechnic League. The rise of the Empire and its encroachment upon Avalon is the theme of the story, and it is excellent entertainment; typical of this series. Highly recommended for lovers of \\"hard\\" science fiction. RJB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Mystery","review":"Respectfully, I wish to disagree with Harriet Klausner. This is not a cozy mystery. It is a thoughtful mystery by a thoughtful writer who is the Anne Perry of the contemporary eastern old money establishment, a chronicler of the mores and social rules that bind this elite community of the privileged. It is well written and well plotted. It is sedate, which is a perfect match for the environment in which the murder and its resolution occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...should be called \\"Bolero\\"","review":"I had to write a review of this because it was so disappointing.

They talk about how depressing it was that Bolero was his most famous piece, yet they ONLY talk about Bolero and play that one composition during the whole episode. They say how he shouldn't be known for just this one piece, but then only talk about it. They say how Ravel was depressed about this fact yet only they only talk about Bolero.

Perhaps I'm just a romantic at heart, but Nerilka's \\"romance\\" with Alessan seemed a little more 13th century Earth than that between, say, F'lar and Lessa in \\"Dragonflight\\". The first person perspective doesn't really add all that much. The material that isn't covered in \\"Moreta\\" doesn't really add much.

While I resonated with the introductory pages, once getting into the heart of its text I have been severely disappointed. In fact, I just can't even read it. I wish I could send it back and demand a refund. The author's discussion reads more like the typical home magazine articles that target women yearning for crafty ways to live. But what finally stopped my perusal looking for something more substantive was when she started describing how to fold laundry or hang the toilet paper roll--! Please. BTW, I am a middle-aged woman, so know that I am not dumping on that segment.

This was an original anime not based on any manga.Taking place in the distant future, two amensiac fugitives find themselves in the middle of the desert. After a quick crime spree, they're caught and sentenced to a prision on what's left of the moon. Once there, they team up with the other inmates to do the ultimate prision break. This leads to some amazingly cartoonish fight scenes. It's literally like a cross between Tom & Jerry and Quinton Tarentino. It leads up to a big battle, an immature pregnancy, and lots of explosions and violence.A censored version of Dead Leaves has been featured on Sci-Fi Channel's Ani-Monday, and a few other cable TV showings.

Add in the toilet humor, the sodomy \\"gags\\" (one inmate has a powerful drill for his \\"equipment\\") and the shear volume of bloodletting and you have what amounts to a basically pointless romp. They try to insert a point and a story with a unique poem that the two heros can barely remember as they are suffering from amnesia, but in the end nothing is really resolved - and you are left wondering what the point was.

Inside each rod is a piece of electroluminescent wire that glows a pale blue, and no matter what color rod one uses, it is still a shade of blue. That's fine, because all EL wire has a bluish look. The problem with this kit is that the connector balls are very cheaply made and the barrel-type jacks and plugs don't make solid electrical or mechanical connections. If they had used 1/16\\" phono plugs and larger balls with tighter jacks and a better quality of plastic, they would have had a first class product.

Him in the supermarket wanting to bite the steak was brilliant!Highly recommended for someone who needs a smile on their face.Cannot wait to read the rest in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucern's Lifemate","review":"Single White Vampire is yet another mindblowing Lynsay Sands book. Lucern is being annoyed but his new editor to do some publicity but can hardly do TV when he needs blood, avoids sunlight and of course doesn't age. How long can he keep his new publisher and her co-workers in the dark? And how long can he deny his attraction to her a thirst he hasn't felt for centuries.Lynsay Sands does it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN PROZAC....","review":"This is the most side spliting humor and good vamp series I have ever read.

A Must Read as are all of Lindsay Sands books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single, White & Boring","review":"Not the first book in the series, but the first I started with. I got to page 108 and had to stop. I don't feel a connection to the main characters. Plus, I don't feel the main characters themselves connect. Sands is clearly trying to write a paranormal romance (as is the trend these days), but is rushed in doing so. Kate and Lucern have no spark."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one sucked. And I don't mean blood.","review":"I forced myself to finish the book just because someone had recommended it. Oh boy. The whole premise was really kind of silly. There was some steamy sex which I was really embarrassed about having read most of the book while at work. Auuuggh. Now I hate myself for reading it. It was THAT bad. After reading it I threw it in the dumpster so no one else would have the misfortune of picking it up and reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucern: from grumpy antisocial to a puppet","review":"Lynsay Sands Argeneaus's books are nice romances, I didn't like this one. I had to force myself to finish it so I wouldn't miss the line of the whole series.Lucern starts as a grumpy, antisocial vampire but in the end he is a puppet in Kate's hands, going to ridiculous balls and accepting every kind of thing. OK, he is in love, but did it have to involve all that nonsense? He is often showed as a fragile vampire, physically and his strong mind disappears in the end.I wouldn't recommmend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read in a long time.","review":"Boy when I read the reviews on this book, I wondered if I had gotten a different story. This has to be one of the worst I've read in 2003. The heroine was a fool and the hero was a pain. I saw no comedy in this book, barely registered the humor and couldn't even finish it. I finally skipped to the last few pages from the middle just so I could see what the ending was and if I wanted to try to finish it. Nope, ended up throwing the book in my get-rid-of-in-a-hurry box. Wish I could get my money back as this was not worth the money I paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"Great book, excellent series. Very inventive, and not your typical \\"vampire romance\\".Loved the whole series! Read them each several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Good Book","review":"This book is representative of Ruth White's former books upon chakras and spirit guides. This book gives a basic review of the chakras systems and goes in depth about contacting your own spirit guides. White provides useful exercises for meeting your spirit guide, such as vision techniques, meditation techniques, and the proper questions to ask your guide.If you enjoyed White's previous books, this one should not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I really couldn't get through this book. I'd had such luck with several books prior to buying this one, but this one was so dense and so filled with verbal clutter I simply couldn't get through it.I ended up just scanning through the beginning of each paragraph through each chapter, hoping that something would strike me interesting enough to actually read. I didn't. I didn't find anything that hadn't been covered in a much more effective way in the books I'd already read.I was very disappointed with this book. I'm sorry I wasted the money. I got much more out of \\"So You Want To Be A Medium?: A Down to Earth Guide\\" by Rose Vanden Eynden, and \\"Spirit Guides & Angel Guardians: Contact Your Invisible Helpers\\" by Richard Webster. I'd recommend both of those books whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book fun to read!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

One side is just more flashy. If you like to use card guards then you will be happy this any one from this line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake!!","review":"Beware!! This coin is looks good on the one side, but have you ever seen the other side? There is a good reason you only see the one side and that reason helps the seller, but deceives the buyer. Side 2 is horrible looking, I thought when I bought this product that the other side was going to look like the front, but it doesn't. Since my bad purchase I have found better card guards out there that have both sides finished and are much higher quality. Just do your shopping and you will be glad you did. There are some other websites that I have bought from that have a much superior product and better prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive book on cosmetics","review":"I am currently studying the development of consumer product manufacturing processes, and borrowed the book from the library to get a good feel of the subject. To my satisfaction, I found this book containing important pieces of information suitable for general readers as well as for experts in cosmetics science. The first section describes different aspects of cosmetics, including usage, processing, and even sources of information such as journals and websites. The second part deals with various cosmetic products in great detail. It provides a very systematic discussion on cosmetics ingredients, nicely classified according to their function, which is very useful for those trying to understand the logic behind cosmetic formulation. It also describes the typical equipment for cosmetic production, although not in detail. In summary, I really think this is the book to read if you are interested in cosmetics formulation and processing."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK","review":"SON RECEIVED AS A GRADUATION PRESENT.

Picture quality is so bad that I am ashamed to show these pictures to my friends. No matter whether it's dark or light, picture quality remains poor. True, this camera is very cheap but that is the only advantage of this camera. Do yourselves a favor - pay some few bucks more and get a decent camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Easy to use, good value, great pics.

Is easy to use. Very affordable. Sends pictures easily to your e-mail addresses. Has a built in lens cover. Can be used with 2 AA batteries. And is compatible with most ditigal printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Battery recharge.","review":"I didn't have the problems that most people had with bad pictures. For the most part, my pictures came out surprisingly good. The only times they didn't was in low light situations and that's the norm for digital cameras. My problem was an on going problem with the batteries and the recharging. I have always had the low battery sign when I first use the A340. I'm sure it's in the Camera itself because new batteries don't even work. I looked at the battery area and I see signs of corrosion, but I use this camera about 2 times a month and I check the batteries religiously. I don't know what the problem is but I have noticed that I'm not the only one that has this problem. I have since bought a new Camera... Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"it kills the XD cards!!!","review":"I have used this camera for about 2 years, and have taken a lot of wonderful pictures with it, although I agree with the negative reviews (the quality is noticeably worse at 3X zoom, slow shutter speed, almost impossible to take a decent picture in dark places, etc).However, I believe the BIGGEST problem this camera has (and it took my wife and I a while to figure out wtf was going on) is the fact that it destroys the XD card when one erases all the pictures on it! It happened to me on several occasions when I was abroad in some beautiful places, and had the cards full with pictures from previous trips; I erased all the pictures using the \\"ERASE ALL\\" option in the menu, and promptly received the \\"CARD ERROR\\" message after trying to take a new picture.I am giving this camera 2 stars instead of 1 only because somehow I managed to get a lot of wonderful pictures (though I spent a lot of money on cards); I am currently shopping for a new camera, and Fuji is not on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for something a little better.","review":"I found the fujifilm camera takes mediocre pictures. The flash always seemed too bright, which always made the subject too light and the background too dark. Outside was the only time I got a good picture and that was rare. Inside, without the flash, you get a blurry picture. I honestly got better pictures from a disposable camera than with this digital camera.It might've just been my luck, but I also lost 5 memory cards to this camera. Every once in awhile, I'd turn my camera on and the screen would read \\"card error\\". All my pictures were erased and the card became useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuji Flop","review":"I have to agree with erosomniac, from Seattle, WA. The FujiFilm A340 is a waste of money. I previously had a FujiFilm 2600 and it took far superior pictures than the A340. I contacted Fuji (sent them pictures from the A340 and they sent me back pictures with the same problems) and that was also a waste of time. Outdoor pictures are either too bright or too dark, really hard to get a good clear picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not working...","review":"The product did recieve power, but after buying a XD card not an SD card, we found it did not work. If it had worked it would have been a perfect for our child who wanted his first camera.The person we purchased from was excellent though. Shipping was very fast, and he had no problems processing our return. He even gave us a goodwill credit for our troubles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuji A340","review":"Good average pix taker, but dated. It fits a niche here. Is strong enough to take mild shocks, bumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice design, but too small!","review":"The new pink/purple leapster has a nicer design than the old version. I like the new pen holder on the front. The arrow dial on the left side is better than the older (round)version, too. HOWEVER, we are exchanging it for the older version. The reason: THE SCREEN! The new leapster's screen measures only 5.4 cm - the old version screen measures 7 cm. Also, the pen on the new leapster is smaller. Customer service said everything on the new design is smaller \\"to accomodate smaller hands\\"...that's nice, but it also requires better fine motor skills - which smaller hands do not necessarily have. For those of you who purchase this and are considering the recharging kit - I was told that this design needs the L-max recharger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun AND Educational!!","review":"My daughter wanted a Leapster for Christmas. I wasn't sure which was the newer model, the triangular one or the smaller, rectangular one. So, I bought both to try them out. Screen size was also an issue for me. I thought the larger screen would be better. But, believe me, the newer version (small, retangular) Leapster's screen is sooo much clearer, crisper, and the colors are more vivid! My 4 year old daughter has no problem manipulating the buttons or the pen and SHE loves it! She plays it all the time. Now, my 7yo son, who has a GB Adv. SP wants one, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not holding up after three months","review":"My daughter got this for Christmas and loves the toy. She likes the games and is able to play them without trouble. It's also great to have something like this geared towards her younger age that she can use in the car when her older siblings are playing with their game-boys or listening to music.However, the toy has been working improperly for more than a month now. We have tried new batteries but find it continues to have a lot of the problems associated with low batteries such as delayed response, improper movement (she tries to get the character to go left and they go down or similar problems.) It's very frustrating for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent learning tool","review":"My 6 year old daughter just got the Leapster Learning System for Christmas yesterday and she loves it.She has not put it down since she got it.

I bought her 2 cartridges that it already has on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Leapster Best","review":"I have both the old and new version of the leapster. My younger daughter no longer uses her new leapster because it was difficult to hear. So we purchased her an old leapster that we found at a store. The new leapster is cute, I must say, but the sound is much lower than in the old version. I spoke with a Leapfrog representative (fabulous custormer service) and after testing it while I waited, he confirmed that the sound decibal was significantly lower. However, since it met their standards it was not technically a defect. They informed me that the old version has not been in production for quite a while and no plans were in place to bring it back. Any old version you find for sale is all that is left."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO SOME RESEARCH, BEFORE YOU DECIDE !!!","review":"This is an 'older' system version from Leapfrog.Why buy these,... when you can getLeapFrog Leapster Explorer Learning Game System (Green)or theLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Green.

Great for 'alone time' as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Warranty is Ridiculous!","review":"My three year old absolutely loves this toy. He got it for his birthday in July. It's now a week before Thanksgiving and it won't turn on. It has brand new batteries. The battery terminals have been carefully cleaned. It hasn't been dropped, water damaged or anything (I keep it when he's not playing with it). It has just decided to quit turning on.I went to Leapfrog's website thinking (it's only been 4 months, it should be covered. Afterall, Nintendo and Playstation have a 1 year warranty as does most electronics). I get to their website and was shocked to see a 3 MONTH WARRANTY.A company must realize they have a crappy product when their warranty is only 3 months long. Any company that has a good product would stand behind it and offer a decent warranty such as a year.Instead of buying new Leapster games for my son, I'm going to buy him a DS. He uses his brothers and it's lasted longer than 4 months without any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapster","review":"My 5 year old is enjoying her Leapster.

She has no problem playing any of the games and will just sit for hours playing it. I love that it has a volume control because some of the games are louder than others.

My 2 yr old enjoys the drawing and coloring option and our 7 yr old son wants one as well. We're very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment, Durability Issues","review":"I purchased two leapsters for my children for Christmas. Overall the games are great. The main drawbacks are the cost of use and durability.I bought two recharging kits to save on batteries. You must do this as regular batteries won't last long. Then there is the expense of the games, usually $25 for one game. Having said that, I still thought it was worth it for the entertainment and learning it provides my kids... until today. My daughter's leapster inexplicably stopped working today. I had registered both leapsters, but when I went to check the warranty, I found out they only had 3 month warranties. It seems they only make these things to last for three months, which is not acceptable.I am very disappointed in this leapster. Protect yourself, and your child, and purchase learning games with a better warranty. For the amount of investment we are putting into these things, we deserve something that will last a year or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Except for the small screen","review":"I'm about to purchase a second leapster for my 3 year old daughter, as she's getting tired of sharing her 5 year old brother's leapster. I'm a bit disappointed that the screen size in this model is smaller than the older model. It's hard enough with the bigger screen for the kids to use the touch screen.The leapster my son has is now about two years old and has taken quite a bit of abuse, and it's still working perfectly. The games for this system are great and I can really tell that my kids are learning something.Personally, I think the recharging system is a waste. Why have a recharger that can only be used on the leapster? I picked up a generic battery charger and some rechargeable AA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this!","review":"We got this a few years ago for my daughter.

My son has his own Leapster with the Cars game-that one they both share as well. The Jedi math is a little scary for them, so we'll save that one for later.We also like the preloaded games, since Coloring Corral is so easy to play, and Rabbit River reminds me of Frogger.Easy to get the games set-up, but a little hard for not so dextrous three year old hands using a stylus to type in names, etc. Overall well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for child with ADHD","review":"My husband and I got the Leapster for our 7 year old daughter and are very happy with it. She is a child who typically can't focus on any single toy for more than 2 or 3 minutes at a time. She has ADHD and normally jumps from one toy to the next. We have tried all types of toys...dolls, dress-up items, board games etc... Nothing has gotten her attention for long until now. For some reason this toy has grabbed her attention and gotten her to focus. She is understanding educational concepts that have been very hard for her to understand in school. These are the same skills that have left her in tears in the past. I am VERY impressed! This is a GREAT learning tool for our daughter and we highly reccomend it.

He gets bored easily so we were hesitant to make any purchase that would require more than 30 minutes of his time. However this was a huge hit! He enjoys racing and often selects the more advanced levels. We ended up buying a second leapster for my daughter.

He has just received his hurried direction in clipped sentences, has checked into the Hotel Kafka, and has been intercepted, probed, scoffed at, ignored, and wiretapped.Then for no reason at all, he goes through a door, and is on the ice at the Berlibber Ice Palatz, to see the Gunatzis Brothers, Hans and Junni, shoot it out with weapons of increasing caliber and fierceness...It was their first album, and thus one of their more transparent.

The album itself is a very good album although in some ways, this feels like the most dated or \\"reserved\\" of their work. The back and forth between the guys isn't quite as free flowing as it would be on later albums or so it seems to me. That's not to say that this is a bad album, quite the contrary as most of it is downright inspired and even groundbreaking in many ways. Temporarily Humboldt County is a stinging bit about the treatment of Native Americans, Le Trente-Huit Cunegonde is a priceless take on what it would be like if Hippies ran the world and the second half is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely perfect","review":"There is not one single bad thing I can say about this film. None. It is my 3rd most favorite film of all time. The acting is some of the finest out there, the costumes, plot, drama, wit; superb. I gush about this film to everyone I know. When I am in a foul mood, all I need to do is put this in my dvd player and I am perfectly fine 2 hours later. Anyone who is and isn't a Jane Austen fan should watch it. If you love period films, then this is the movie for you. Like I said, I could never critique it properly because I could never find the right words to describe it.Though people would consider it a 'chick flick', I have seen this with my fiance and he actually liked it as well. I cant stress enough how wonderful all the actors are. Kate Winslet, who is probably my favorite British acress is spectacular in this, Emma Thompson and of course the ridiculously perfect Alan Rickman all make this film worthwhile to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite movie!!!","review":"Though I was never a Jane Austen fan in high school, this movie has made me a fan. I have gone back and re-read every one of her books and now finally understand why they are classics. This movie has everything. It's romantic, funny, heartwrenching and heartwarming. From the scene where Elinor sits on the stairs drinking tea while her sisters and mother cry in their bedrooms to the scene where Edward at long last, confesses his love for Elinor, this movie is perfect. I highly recommend it! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"Without a doubt, the best movie adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I have ever seen! I was enraptured by the perfect choice of characters, the breathtaking acting and dramatic scenes, the music (I couldn't rest until I had bought the songs Marianne plays on the piano so that I could play them for myself!) and even the poetry!All hopeless romantics will fall in love with this film; I watched it twelve times the first week I saw it. Having read the book, I would say that this movie represents one of the few instances where a screenplay outdoes its book.All the characters have been wonderfully cast, especially Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon, Kate Winslet as Marianne, and Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings. (My personal favorite!)Be prepared to love this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I watch it over and over. I think all the actors are great. Very close to the book.

It's funny, poignant, sad and best of all, happy endings!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance by Kate Winslet","review":"Good movie, but I recommend you read Jane Austen's book Sense and Sensibility first. The movie is not exactly like the book , but still enjoyable. I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance. I thought Emma Thompson was too old to play this role..she's supposed to be 19 yrs old in the book, she looks like she can be Kate Winslet's mother. Hugh Grant does a great job playing Edward Ferrars. Overall a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and subtle","review":"It's extremely difficult to write something different than what already appears here about this extraordinary film, other than to reinforce the nuances which make it so fine.Yes, it's the acting; it's the painstaking detail in the costumes, jewelry, scenery; it's the tight script and poetic pace; it's all of these things, and yet what makes this movie so wonderful is not minutia but evocation. Whether you identify with the idealism of Winslet's Marianne or the endurance found in Thompson's Elinor, we all know -- intimately -- the range of emotions which this terrific group of artists seem to so effortlessly touch with words and deeds.It's a stunning piece, I have yet to meet someone unaffected by it. Share this movie with someone you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"The thing that surprised me most about this wonderful film was Alan Rickman's subtly sweet performance. Those who do not fall immediately in love with Hugh Grant's stammering charmer Edward Ferrars, will certainly find themselves drawn in by Rickman's heartbreaking Col. Brandon. Don't let the \\"chick-flick\\" title fool you, this is a terrific movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just a girl movie","review":"I really like 'pride and prejudice'. I loved how tiny the events of all the characters were against the landscapes. In sense and sensibility I found those same enveloping landscapes. I only picked up this movie because of two reasons. I've already named the first and the second was because of Ann Lee's direction. He handles his films to my tastes. I have enjoyed nearly all of his films. The acting in this film is high, and it has a unique feel that is opposite of what is out today, even of Pride and Prejudice. I felt that the characters of Sense so refreshing to watch. I really like how hugh grant and emma thompson played. It's because of how they acted that this film is far more than a period piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality film","review":"The kind of movie that I like to add to my library collection because of the life style, manners, etc. that I want my family to emulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful!!","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite films. Everything about it is just superb, from the gorgeous scenery to the clever script to the perfect casting of every role. I could never tire of watching this, it has a deep appeal to the romantic in me.I dare say it will do the same for anyone who loves romance and has an imagination. Ahhh, if only there could be a sequel!! But it IS hard to outdo perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKE JANE AUSTEN MOVIES","review":"I love Jane Austen, I love well-done 19th Century Brit Lit classic productions. The actors are fun...Emma Thompson, as always, is superb and Hugh Grant, of course, is the bad boy one just loves to hate. This movie is really multi-purpose: a great way to spend some time if you are home with the sniffles, a great escape on what might be the end of an all too modern day, or just cozy to watch curled up by the fire.Definitely worth owning...sort of a \\"little black dress\\" DVD. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hopeless romantic's English delight!","review":"This is (in my opinion) the finest of all movies based on Jane Austen novels. An extremely fine cast and beautiful English settings, along with Emma Thompson's beautifully written screenplay make for a fine evening for all hopeless romantics! This is a story of two sisters who lose their dowry due to their father's death and all the money goes to his first son. Elinor's sensibility is contrasted against Marianne's (superbly played by Kate Winslet) lack of sense in pursuit of romance as each girl endures various obstacles pertaining to the objects of their affections. Each sister endures and grows to find the true love and happiness that they've always hoped for. The soundtrack is also an asset to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent romance","review":"I'm not good at movie reviews, but this one is an excellent romance movie for a quiet night at home with your partner. Its one that can be watched over and over with enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning just for the audio commentary!","review":"My wife and I love this movie. I won't go into details about the movie itself; many others here have already done that quite adequately. Let me tell you what I like about this particular DVD release.I bought this when I realized it has been re-released with extras. (I believe the first outing was pretty much bare bones.)The audio commentary with Emma Thompson is more than worth the price of the movie. Absolutely hilarious. As is the clip of her speech at the Golden Globes - written as if penned by Jane Austen herself.We still haven't digested Ang Lee's commentary; but the disc is well worth the price so far.Buy it and enjoy! Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story well told!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies, it is most certainly a *classic*. The story of the Daschwood sisters' troubles are told so sweetly- the sisters love each other so much and want each to be happy. It is funny, too, Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte lighten up any person's day yet they also make you frustrated for Marianne and Elinor. The scenery and music in this film are lovely... they portray the spirit of the scene you are watching. This movie was what made me a Jane Austen fan. Immediately after watching S&S I read it and fell in love with Jane Austen. I think everyone should watch this movie, you will be touched!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Such a great movie to watch at home and be taken into another time and place.

Emma Thompson did a superb job of writing the screenplay. She followed Jane Austen's book almost as it was written. She even included the third child which all other screen players did not. I do not know why some screen players think their script is better then the author's story, but they do. Buy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight","review":"If you like period films, wonderful heroes (some dashing, but flawed - others not so dashing, but true!) and intelligent heroines.

Sense and Sensibility has always been a favorite of mine. The cast is wonderful and Alan Rickman as the gentle and lonely Colonel Brandon is one of his best roles.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Sense and Sensibility was not typical of the other films. Emma Thompson did an excellent job of writing the screenplay and playing in the movie. This is a classic romance story that will give you the sensation of falling in love over and over again each time you watch it. The film is timeless, the acting superb, and the story unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"British accents, period costume, love, marriage,deceipt","review":"Emma Thompson again gives a great performance as a pre-Victorian woman of great common sense. Kate Winslet portrays her sister, who allows her heart rule her life. The life situations that play out for these two ladies provide humor, sorrow, and a lesson in life in their time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the good definetly outweighs the questionable","review":"Okay, so ELinor was supposed to be 19 and Brandon only 35. Emma Thompson fudged with the ages a little. So what? If I was Emma Thompson and over 19 and writing this screenplay I would do so myself. There were a couple of times, I grant you, that I did wish that Elinor was being played by a younger actress. But only a couple of times and I have watched this movie more times than I care to report. And Alan Rickman was over 35 but he's ALAN RICKMAN and he provided a beautiful portrayl of Colonel Brandon. As for Ms. Thompson's alterations and additions they were for the most part not only neccessary for a screen adaptation but delightful and on reading the book I missed the scene about the atlas. Ms. Thompson's writing is quite charming and a delightful companion to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"This movie transports me.I highly recommend it to Jane Austen fans,who love her language, her stories, her humor.There are many lessons to be explained to a son or daughter in this film.A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies","review":"With a such a cast as this, who could have expected anything but sucess for this movie.

There's something about this film that makes me want to see it again and again and each time, it's as brilliant as the first and I end it with tears streaming down my face. It's a completely successful adaptation of Jane Austin's story. Emma Thompson's wit and \\"sensibility\\" shines. The acting is supurb and I have already turned my young daughters into fans. Don't miss this wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"For once, a movie that is actually as good as the book","review":"Ang Lee has done a magnificent job of bringing Jane Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" to the screen. The acting, directing and screenplay are terrific. Emma Thompson is wonderful as Elinor Dashwood and Greg Wise is excellent as the heartbreaker Willoughby. I've always had a problem with the character of Marianne; she is so ridiculous that you just want to slap some sense into her; but Kate Winslet's memorable performance actually makes her more sympathetic than she appears in the book. With all the great acting by the lead and supporting cast, the picture is stolen by Hugh Grant, who is absolute perfection as the bumbling Edward Ferrars. The movie more than does justice to the book; Jane Austen would be proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything by Jane","review":"My favorite movie of ALL TIME!!

Despite that, she does an incredible job with the part, as do all the actors in this movie. Alan Rickman's Colonel Brandon makes me swoon every time I watch it. The direction is lovely - every scene is like a painting, with beautiful landscapes, set design, and costumes. I had to buy a second copy on Blu-Ray because I wore out my original DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is an overall wonderful movie. Unlike Mansfield Park, it stays more true to Jane Austen's story, and it doesn't try to sugarcoat the situation of women in that era. These women are smart, interesting, and as independent as they can be in their society. The acting is superb. The movie is a perfect adaptation of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"This film is absolutely brilliant! There is not much more to say! Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet give magnificent performances! The storyline was written beautifully. It is witty, endearing, sad and triumphant all at the same time throughout the entire movie! You can't help but fall in love with all the heroic characters and come to despise the dishonest ones. And the director, Ang Lee, did an amazing job of capturing the story through such a simple and understated way, yet it hardly comes across the film that way! I recommend this film to anyone who loves a good storyline with a plot and brilliant acting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the other version","review":"Don't get this version. Get the 2008 BBC version. This version was poorly cast and lacked chemistry. Except for Alan Rickman who was actually pretty great as Colonel Brandon. The rest though, not so much. Especially Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant who had zero chemistry as Elinor and Edward. Emma Thompson was actually pretty bland. The 2008 BBC version has everything this one lacked."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"This was not a beliveable story because of the casting.

I liked Pride and Predgious far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"OverEdited","review":"This movie was an extremely cut down version of the full flick. Missing over 45 minutes of movie.

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as 2008 adaption","review":"Other than Emma Thompson being way too old to act as a nineteen year old Elinor, Hugh Grant(Edward) looking absolutley stiff as board, Alan Rickman(Col. Brandon) looking as if he was sleep-walking throughout the movie, and Kate Winslet completely overacting Marianne, I suppose this movie is okay.

Kate Winslet & Alan Rickman are my two favorites in this movie; they both give magnificent performances. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys true drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem with Emma Thompson","review":"Emma Thompson is truly an acting treasure. This particular film also demonstrates her superb writing skills. So great in fact it won her an oscar. Kate Winslet is demure and refreshing in one of her early performances.

This film is filled with wonderful nuances, simplicity, real emotion. For example, the looks on Elinor's face when she thinks that her beloved is engaged and she must keep the secret or when she thinks he got married...those looks break your heart. The last 20 minutes of this movie are about the most perfect 20 minutes of any film I've seen.

Issued in 1947, the encyclical focuses on the preservation and nature of the liturgy - including the mass, the hours, devotionals and sacraments. Interestingly, many of the examples used by Pius XII in the encyclical, such as going to a \\"primative\\" original eucharistic celebration, the return to the \\"table\\" style altar, elimination of Gregorian chant, the use of the vernacular and similar items were, within 20 years, adopted by the Church as part of the Vatican II reforms.

As if this were not frustrating enough, the player decides to shut off on it's own, and once off, will turn itself on again, going off and on repeatedly. The only way to stop it is to pull the battery out. Calling Samsung and complaining only amounts to having to send the player in to be repaired over and over.

I sent it to SAMSUNG to get it fixed and they returned withouth the music that was in it, and also, working as bad as it was.I really liked it, but not working badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems, here","review":"I've had my Samsung 1GB player for about 2 months now and have had no problems with it as some other people have mentioned here.I don't use OGG files since I really don't see any benefit to them (other than not having to pay a license fee for use of the OGG codec) and instead use 320kbps mp3 files, managing to get at least 6 hours total of playing time off of each playlist I download. It handles large files (over 10mb) with no problem at all and since I listen to a lot of jazz and classical music, it suits my needs perfectly.As far as the radio is concerned, I don't listen to the radio anymore so this isn't an issue for me, either. I also recommend getting the Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds for great sound since the stock buds the Samsung comes with are sub par.If you are looking for a small player for your commuting needs, I fully recommend the Samsung. Hopefully they'll come out with a 2GB player in the near future since I'll be the first in line to purchase one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great - Durable","review":"I've had this MP3 player for a about 2 months. My initial impression was that it was a great player. Very small with a nice screen. I thought I would have problems with the battery door but that has not been the case. I've dropped this player off the treadmill at least five times and it keeps on ticking. My only complaint so far is that the player menu system bogs down while playing VBR WMA files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't sweat it!","review":"If you are planning on using this mp3 player to workout, get something else. I got a little sweat on mine and it quit working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little player -- bookmarking would make it perfect","review":"The only thing I wish this player had was a way to set bookmarks during playback. I downloaded several large WMA audio books and they play great. The only thing is if you are not careful you can nudge the joystick too far to the left or right and then you are forced to start the book over from the beginning. I like the flexibility of haveing an FM radio and voice recording. The sound quality is excellent and I haven't even messed with the EQ. The AA battery really does last a long time -- probably close to the 40 hours promised. I don't really miss the option of a belt clip or wrist band. The player is so tiny it is easy to slip into my pocket. When I am jogging I just hold it in my hand; the removable plastic cover protects it from sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"e-books","review":"Purchased this item primarily to listen to downloaded digital books.The fault I find is: It dosn't hold my place in the book, if I change to radio or music. Result, once I begin listening to a book I pretty much don't switch to another mode until the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice for joggers","review":"This player has some terrific features and battery life. I was excited to get mine but disappointed to learn how unreliable it is when running. My whole reason for purchasing a flash based player was to use it when exercising. Unfortunately, (and as other reviewers noted), this player will randomly shutdown and refuse to start for a while if you use it while exercising. (And yes the firmware was up to date). It was great while it worked, but definitely not worth the headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I remember years ago watching this on TV. This is so much better in widescreen and HD.

As she transforms into a beautiful young lady, it is hard for us to recognize her. However, following though Caron's realistic transformation, we can relate to Caron. Furthermore, Gaston also represent everyone's ideal husband - both friend and lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Leslie","review":"The first time I saw this movie - several years ago - I was not very impressed. But now, today, it appeals to me much more. I can appreciate it upon 2nd or 3rd or 4th viewing. It is definitely worth having in one's collection. Leslie Caron is a fine little actress, and her leading man is very believeable as the filthy-rich, bored-with-life snob. UNTIL he tangles with sweet, funny, gay, enchanting Gigi. She softens him, falls in love with him, and when she blossoms from a giddy schoolgirl into a charming, alluring adult (teen-ager?), with the help of her grandmother and sophisticated aunt, his eyes are opened, he is definitely hooked, and all ends well. \\"But it, you'll like it!\\"I would have given it a 5-star rating but for the fact I thought there's a bit too much of Maurice Chevalier in it.P.S. - It does offer English subtitles.

What a shame. It was produced from a print with bobs and scratches and blurry colors and on occasion, focus. There are no special features, as with other major MGM musicals. The score is enchanting as are the performances. This is not a DVD to own, rent it, and wait for the studio to put out a restored version, whenever that may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie!","review":"This is an amazing movie. The Blue-ray looks awesome for something so old. The disc contains two versions of the movie, one is the older black and white version (which the quality isn't so great), and the slightly newer color version. I ordered this movie somewhat on accident, but it has quickly became one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahh.. for the love of french!","review":"I just love this little movie. Funny and so French. Audre Hepburn (sp?) wanted this roll but she was too old to play the part. The older gentleman that is in this movie later played the candlestick in Beauty and the Beast...you know... be our guest, be our guest... to our service to the test! My daughter loved to laugh at the young girl getting tipsey on the wine her Aunt is serving along with the quality time being spent playing cards and poking fun at each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Won an Oscar!","review":"I've come to the conclusion that these reviews aren't very helpful. I mean, we are likely to review only those things we enjoyed, which obviously affects the validity of these reviews. So I have decided to review this relatively terrible movie. Leslie Caron, undeniably beautiful, was perhaps the only thing worth watching in this 90 minute waste of time. The songs were inane, as was the dialogue which also bordered on vulgarity at times. Uh, who came up with the idea that a story about training a girl as a courtesan in misogynist France would be a great musical? This might have been a decent movie if the genre were more suited to the topic - a drama perhaps. I must admit my slight bias - I don't care for musicals as a rule. They're just so petit-bourgeois. All right, some nice things about this movie... hmmmm.... nice costumes, nice setting... that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bore","review":"This was one of the few movies I have ever seen that made me want to sleep. Though there are a few good perfomances, songs, scenes, etc, they were few and far between. For some reason none of the actors wanted to sing the mostly regretable score (I can't blame them) leading to a nearly three hour long musical with no singing. To top it all off, the plot is sexist, dated, and unorginal. Do yourself a favor and find another movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is anyone bothering?","review":"Bought it because wife saw it in formative years and wasn't able to resist her importunings to buy it for her. It's cheaper than a new car, but I wouldn't anticipate ever actually watching it. With any luck, it will be buried among other stuff she has to do and forgotten. Obviously, can't give learned disquisition on its finer? points, don't care if you buy it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS ALREADY OUT!","review":"How about releasing some titles that aren't on DVD yet instead of rehashing some that have been out for years? How about other MGM musicals like I Dood It, The Thrill of Romance, Yolanda and the Thief, Thousands Cheer, The Opposite Sex; anything! Just don't retread other editions of the same movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Showcase of Horrors","review":"This film was insipid, vapid, and in poor taste on every possible level. I can't believe people actually consider this swill entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a snore","review":"I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"End of a lovely era","review":"Minnelli's best works and it deserved the nine Academy awards for sure. The Blu Ray version is crystal clear and brings the beauty of this film to life like never before, almost feels like a live performance. The added features are worth the price of the disk alone, especially the enlightening and charming interviews with Leslie Caron. Awful shame they stopped making these beautiful musicals, although I would imagine the cost would be too prohibitive today. Unlike \\"An American in Paris\\" ( another favorite of mine ) this film was actually made in Paris and it is almost a travelogue in itself, the scenes and costumes are absolutely are stunning. I would recommend this addition to anyone's collection who enjoys a bit of romance and happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"ginger","review":"We have loved this movie since it came out, so we were very happy to find a DVD in very good shape at a reasonable price.

It's beautifully shot on location in Paris. Leslie Caron is lovely, too; she looks so different than in An American in Paris! And she gives a good performance. Maurice Chavalier is clearly having the time of his life, espicially in the first scene, and is wonderful. So is the aunt; she's pretty funny. The lavish costumes and sets are great. \\"thank heaven for little girls\\" and \\"i remember it well\\" are the best songs, though they probably aren't as good as others in the Lerner&Loewe canon. The last great MGM musical; if you see it, you'll see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal Favorite!","review":"I've been watching this movie since I was a little girl and I could watch it over and ver again every day.

I own most of them and have been in several during my life.When it comes to \\"Gigi\\" the best way to discribe it is fairy tale of innocent love. This is a wonderful musical with ageless songs. Songs that you'll remember as a kid and songs that will you hum after the movie is over. If you happen to have a 5.1 sound system it will be even more of a thrill. The sound on this DVD is like hearing it in a theatre that had magnetic Stereo Sound System. IT IS FLAWLESS. This movie is also headed by a wonderful talented cast of likes that will not ever grace the screen again.

I wanted to see this film because Audrey Hepburn ws in the Original Boadway Cast, and Barabra Walters recomended it. However, I failed to see it's charm or appeal. The songs were corney, the acting was terrible, the cinematography was laughable (and I did laugh), and it's because of films like this that musicals don't apeal to a wider audience. Boo, hissssss.

With My Fair Lady you will get Freudian points of view regarding her adaption and others, but this one there is no psychology at all. It is all just about plain love, which for me is too flat and going nowhere, and the songs here are not to sing after, the lyrics are again too flat. The actors performance are at the next-lowest level, I cannot figure why this movie received Oscar at all, maybe through lobbying?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIGI-A DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"\\"Gigi\\" has a cute storyline but was not made well. There is no foreshadowing and the characters do not draw you in. The story was difficult to understand. Gaston was constantly coming to see Gigi then storming off, just to come right back again. During the time that he wasn't with Gigi, you do not see what he is feeling. This movie is poor, and not worth the time it takes to be seen.P.S. Did you know that Gaston is at least 14 years older than Gigi?"},{"rating":"1","title":"As close as you could get to kiddie porn in 1958.","review":"I'm far from being a prude, but my skin started crawling when Maurice Chevalier sang \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\\" while eyeballing six year olds at the playground. And plying the young Gigi with champagne, spanking her, etc all gave me the creeps. This movie was probably as close as you could get to public kiddie porn in 1958. The plot is ridiculous and laced with script sure to make any pedophile long to head out in search of a little girl to spank and call his own. Roman Polanski would have been proud to have made this piece of trash. I have two primary regrets about my experience with Gigi: One, that I actually watched it through to the end (I kept thinking it would get better, but it only got worse); and two, that my Blackberry battery was almost dead so I couldn't play Brickbreaker during the really bad parts of the movie (pretty much everything between the opening credits and the end).

A major difference between American writers and Russian writers in math writing is that Russian authors are more reader concious. Consequently, their books are more reader-friendly.

The most recent Russian edition has a lot of other important topics (missing in Dover's reprint), such as differential calculus in Banach spaces, which is so difficult to find a decent treatment of.

I can't enjoy them because as I watch, their sad (tragic, really) history comes to my mind and totally ruins the movie. I would suggest that if you are a fan as I was that you don't read this book. It's not really about love. It's about obsession; and there's a huge difference between the two. The word sweethearts has a positive connotation, while this book brings with it so much negativity, it was difficult for me to read. I realize that I should have stopped reading near the beginning, but it's hard for me to put a book down once I open it. So if you're just interested in movie history, you may want to read \\"Sweethearts\\", but if you really enjoy watching the movies, I'd suggest you skip this book and find something else to read. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulls***","review":"I stopped reading this piece of s*** when I got to the page where the \\"author\\" states that actor Ramon Novarro was killed when some men shoved a solid gold dildo (a gift from Rudolph Valentino) down his throat. First of all if the \\"author\\" had done any semblance of research she would have found that this was a stupid rumor with not one iota of truth that was debunked many many years ago.

The writer claims to have gotten a lot of the dirt from Jeanette's sister Blossom Rock. The reader has no way of knowing if Blossom was an accurate source of information.

The part of the cassette that protects the tape was broken on one side. I was lucky to have an old cassette so I was able to replace the broken part from that cassette. This is the first time I have been disappointed with a purchase.

Well written and worth several reads, my only disappointment was the sadness of their passions being coerced when each married another.We can only presume that MGM icons feared great financial losses at the box office if the two had married. Their magic on screen, maybe, was threatened if they'd validated their love in private matrimony.The book is tenderly poignant, a vicarious experience. Each died too young - in their 60s. We appreciate the drama of two talented beautiful people living a fantasy. Only in 1930/1940 Hollywood could it be so compelling....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough around the edges","review":"I normally don't like books about pushy, overbearing men, but this one just pushed me in the right direction.

I just don't believe that John loves Michelle and that she is capable of loving a man like him.

The cover was decieving, I was hoping for some good sexual tension and sparring but no.... John just seemed to be horny all the time and HAD to have her whenever.2. I was really disturbed by him having to have sex with her while she was asleep, then getting her pregnant during the encounter talk about careless, I know condoms and pills arent a romance novel favorite but cmon be safe!!3. The jeolous, psycho ex has been done too many times.4.

Even when he finds out that she's just a loveable bundle of neuroses, he still thinks she lied about having been run off the road rather than own up to wrecking his car, but he magnanimously forgives her.

Weak plot but still enjoyable.","review":"The underlying plot was John and Michelle immediately falling for each other but fighting their feelings for 10 years while they were apart. It was primarily her fault, since she tried to make him not like her by acting haughty. She feared he would be a heartbreaker. After they got together 10 years later, he liked her a lot but she kept assuming he did not and adjusted her actions accordingly. The author used Michelle's erroneous assumptions about John's feelings to spread out the story. Unfortunately, neither one of them communicated their feelings for each other which would have ended the story much sooner. I love this author, but not this book. It was well written, and I did enjoy it even though I kept shaking my head at the lack of communication. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: about four.

Its basic message is simple and intellectually sound. The recommendations are based on both solid science (multiple studies with convergent findings) and the results of the author's own heroic battle against cancer. On a personal level I found the book quite inspiring, providing just the impetus I needed to adjust my personal diet and exercise regimen. Dr. Heidrich doesn't equivocate or offer us simplistic solutions that require no work on our part, but the reward of good health and a vigorous old age should more than justify our efforts.

The \\"recipes\\" are dreary, unimaginative, slightly altered retreads of what we've found in other (better!) books, and many are little more than ponderously described descriptions of how to prepare the basics that are already staples in our kitchens.

This book reads more like the movie \\"Tombstone\\" (a great movie on its own) and lacks that historical bite. He has a different take on Wyatt Earp than many, which is OK, in that he doesn't place him on the pedestal that most others place him. It's fairly obvious, from other references to Wyatt and his brothers, that he doesn't hold them in very high regard.(Especially in his Luke Starbuck novel \\"Tombstone\\") In this story the characters seem to be written as cliches of themselves and the lack of insight to their characters makes it hard to feel for them and become involved in the story.

It looks very digital and not at all film-like.The songs are frequently spliced segments from multiple shows...I mean on the beat or measure, not the whole song. It is like a lousy piece meal edit job. Very little comtinuity and nary a whole song performance on the DVD.Buy the acoustic Chicks DVD first. If you have that, buy Alison Krauss. Save your dough don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keepin' it real....","review":"Being a musician and having seen Dixie Chicks live on this tour, I can tell you that both live and on the DVD the singing and playing from all three is live.For people who feel the singing is not live, perhaps they are struggling with the fact that, yes, there are attractive women who are this good in terms of musicianship and can think for themselves. While I can see why some would find the video editing distracting, it has grown on me after a couple of viewings.My only complaints are that Truth No. 2 should have been included since it is a galvanizing moment in the concert, and that the labeling of the DVD could be a bit more up front so that people expecting a single live performance would not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not do justice to the Dixie Chicks","review":"The songs are there but there is no feeling or emotion conveyed to the listener/viewer. Unfortunatley, all has been lost through very poor editing. This DVD is mixed from multiple concerts and suffers badly as a result -the only plus is that you get to see the girls in numerous outfits! Sound quality is questionable too, lacking base and warmth. If you want a live DVD of the Dixie Chicks, skip this DVD and buy the superior \\"An Evening With The Dixie Chicks\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Chicks. Hate the editing.","review":"I find the frenetic costume change with every shot editing of the DVD very distracting and would have preferred a single performance at a single venue, or at least each song whole from a single performance/venue rather than the contrived, abeit expert, mixing of shots from many performances during the course of each song. The Dixie Chicks do not need this kind of technical trickery to entertain me and I much prefer their first DVD for the purity of performance. If they chose to release a second version of this DVD without the frenetic editing, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"First of all, for those that have said the sound on this DVD is too perfect (inplying that it's been \`touched up' in the studio), let me just say that I've had the pleasure of seeing the Dixie Chicks live, & they do indeed sound this good!The Chicks are great live performers - energetic, enthusiastic & entertaining, & you see it all here!The reason I've given this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's suffering from severe schizophrenia - it's actually filmed at about 10 different concerts, but you don't see a whole song from 1 concert. Instead it will be a few seconds from one, & then on to another. The first time I watched it I found it quite bizarre! However the editing is seamless, & it's fun seeing all their different outfits.I've now watched it a few times, & it's really grown on me!!No extra's to speak of, but then in music DVD's they rarely seem to bother with them any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Went to two concerts of the Top Of The World Tour.

For that matter where is the song? It is terribly sad that this great band felt so overwhelmed by the pressure of ignorant people that the highlights of the concert do not appear in the DVD. I loved the concert I saw in Philadelphia though I admit it was disappointing since Natalie looked so sad and uninspired. That annoying splicing in the DVD at least proved it wasn't only at my concert that she didn't smile. And the \\"Top of the Word\\" tour concert without showing them play the song only so that there would be no mention of \\"the controversy\\" on the DVD? Frankly, this is just not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Concept for a Concert Video","review":"It's different...you have to give it that. Unfortunately different doesn't always mean better.On the plus side, the audio and video quality are quite good. That along with the Chicks' obvious talent almost salvage a 2-star rating, but not quite.The incredibly annoying non-stop splicing totally ruined this video for me. It's quite distracting when the outfits and hair styles change every few seconds during a given song. Your mind starts wandering and thinking thoughts like...\\"I wonder which of these random video snippets from the various concerts actually goes with the audio for this song? 5 seconds here? Ten seconds there? Most of it? Some? None?\\"To me, a concert video should feature an actual performance. The fragmented nature of this collection makes it somewhat pointless to even call it a \\"Live\\" production.Overall, very disappointing and definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dvd is a lie","review":"the title of this dvd is \\"top of the world tour live\\" it should be called \\"images of a tour\\".when i brought this dvd i was very excited but after watching it i was disgusted. after watching the first three songs i had a headache after seeing natalie in about 15 costumes now i know the dixie chicks are a really cool texans but this is just wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown!","review":"Let me begin by saying that I love the Dixie Chicks and was eagerly anticipating their second DVD. I found their first release, \\"An Evening With The Dixie Chicks\\", to be sensational. But the \\"Top of the World Tour\\" DVD is something else. My main complaint is that each song is completely disjointed because each one uses multiple clips from several different 2003 concerts, and every few seconds, the Chicks are wearing different outfits and and are performing in different locales. At no point do you get the nice homey (pardon the pun) feeling of watching a song performed at one venue. The new punky look of Natalie and the girls didn't thrill me either, but that's another story. Two stars is all this DVD deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back Posh Spice, all is forgiven !","review":"I thought the \\"Evening with the Dixie Chicks\\" was a great DVD, so was looking forward to viewing this one.

I saw a comparison of the Dixie Chicks and the Spice Girls somewhere, and it was pointed out that the Spice Girls rely on Lip Sync and overproduction - unlike the Chicks at that time.Well, on the evidence of this, the Chicks have descended to that level - on their released \\"live\\" recordings at any rate.Come back Posh Spice, all is forgiven !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I need a wide screen TV","review":"The Dixie Chicks should give away a free wide screen TV with every purchase.

What I got was a music video with clips from dozens of different concerts. If the intent was to give an overview of the tour, they could've easily just put 17 of the best single performances from different cities. Instead, they chose to edit footage to the point that all you can focus on is the constant variations in clothing and background. For me, this totally killed any possibility of even pretending the performance was live. Horrible production here, and I can't recommend this DVD to anyone hoping to see a live performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"Who purchases a concert performance on DVD to see something completely processed and redubbed? Chopped up into brief visual bits so as to make you feel completely distant from the experience?

But, after the first song, it's easy to get used to, and kind of cool.Don't be nervous because of all of the negative reviews.

And at the price, it's the best 10 bucks you're likely to spend all year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top of the World?","review":"I love the Dixie Chicks, but this DVD was disappointing. For one thing, it's the \\"Top of the World\\" tour, and they never even show them playing that wonderful, chilling song (although the music video for it is included as an extra).The other thing, as others have mentioned, is that the frenetic editing really takes away any sense that you are watching a concert. No audience interaction (except for a few shots of them shaking hands with people in the front rows during a few songs), no stage banter at all, no real sense of their unique personalities.Also -- Natalie should sue whoever styled her hair for this tour. In most of the many, many different concerts spliced together for this DVD, she looks like she has a bad mohawk. Not a very flattering look for what we know to be a beautiful woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a studio DVD this is the one for you","review":"What a complete ripoff.

This video was packaged as if it were a concert. But as others have mentioned in their reviews, it's a bunch of concerts spliced together. When I buy a concert video, it's so I can get a feel for what the artist is like in concert - not to see a lengthy music video.But I think the most annoying thing was the lead singer. She was an assault to my ears and eyes. The other two are so talented (and pretty). Perhaps they can swap-out the pudgy one for Faith Hill.

I like the top bars that hold the sleeves in place when the case is closed. Also, there are two rows of sleeves -- each row has an extra sleeve in front with an index card (it lists the numbers for each sleeve and has a line to write the name of the disc at that index). The only annoying thing about this case is the sleeves -- their openings to put the disc into have a plastic cover that must be taken off in order to insert the disc. However, once they are off, it never has to be done again, so it is an annoyance that only has to be dealt with once, which isn't too bad. Still, had the sleeves come ready to accept discs, it would save quite a few minutes of time.

The next comedian was VERY dry but at the same time funny. He was a little slow at first, but once he got going it was funny. The next guy was more of a prop comedian and did a great job with it.I definitely recommend this DVD. I greatly enjoyed watching. With that said, these are not shows you would consider headliner comedians. However, they are quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Clean Humor","review":"I gave this as a gift to a friend who has shared it with all his other friends.

I was pleasantly surprised","review":"There is an obvious emphasis on being unoffensive, even \\"Christian\\" (culturally Christian, like the I have a Christian dog, Christian cat, and Christian lawn, nothing to do with doctrine kind of Christian) in these routines. I have to admit, I am immediately skeptical of any of these Christian-trying-to-emulate-something-the-world-does kinds of products. Nevertheless, my wife and I definitely laughed and thoroughly enjoyed most of this dvd.The magician was poor, but the rest of the routines were funny, some (Joe Wong in particular) were even incredibly memorable. I could definitely see us watching this again in the future. That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's pretty bad when a Christian based comedy series breaks one of the Ten Commandments in the title","review":"All they got out of me was a few smiles, no laughs. I thought the first and second comics were pretty entertaining, but the other four had many cringe-worthy moments. I can't believe the people in the audience were laughing at these lame jokes. Maybe they have never been exposed to good comedy or the DVD was edited to make it seem they were laughing at almost everything that was said. Clean comedy is almost unheard of nowadays and it was refreshing, but the majority of this group just wasn't funny. I know many people in everyday life way funnier than these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"I brought this as a gift for my Brother. He loves it.

It proved that comics do NOT have to use profanity, but it begs the question \\"Can comics not use profanity AND be truly funny? Well, not in the release, anyway. It's okay, certainly isn't \\"bad\\", but it won't bring tears of joy to your eyes, either.Next time I'm looking for good clean fun, I guess I'll have to dust off Bill Cosby's \\"Himself\\". I hope the VCR still works..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"Having never heard of or seen any previous versions, I did not know what to expect but was intrigued by the thought of stand up comedy that did not use profanity and crudeness to get a cheap laugh. While this definitely fit the bill for most of those things, it came up really short on comedy. I now know why the title is what it is - you are being commanded to laugh even if it is not funny. I found it to be rather bland and boring, and not even worthy of a cheap rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of the series -","review":"Thou Shalt Laugh 4was an entertaining program, but none in the series have equaled the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few grins","review":"I didn't find these comedians very funny. So I viewed the DVD again with my mom, and she hardly laughed either. We both agree that Dana Daniels was by far the funniest show on the DVD, and that the rest of the comedians were just not that good. One guy had such nervous body language that we found him painful to watch and skipped most of his routine. I'm not sure why this is called Christian comedy... it doesn't have foul language but it does have a few sexually suggestive jokes that I found inappropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean humor...","review":"Thou Shalt Laugh 4 contains good clean humor for the whole family to enjoy. The DVD was completely family-friendly. Many comedians appearing on prime time TV are just plain crass anymore, and not suitable for family viewing. No crassness is contained in Thou Shalt Laugh 4.The comedians on the disc had a broad range of humor styles, which further contributed to the entertainment value of the DVD. I especially liked the fact that the DVD was \\"for Christians, by Christians\\". Thou Shalt Laugh 4 made me laugh out loud quite a few times with jokes that were sometimes silly, sometimes serious and sometimes just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating Forensic Facts For Forensic Fanatics","review":":) This easy reading book has many vivid pictures and facts. It was well researched and written. If your into Forensics and such, your NOT wasting your money/time on this one. The writer does not baffle you with fancy words he doesn't explain, or speak to the reader in a \\"If you've got to look it up, you shouldn't be reading it\\" tone. Worth your time!! Esp. if your just curious and don't want to get in too deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kentucky Bluegrass Award Nominee - Excellent Choice","review":"This book is a 2003 nominee for the Kentucky Bluegrass Award for high school students. I would definitely choose this one for any student who had an interest in forensic science. Hidden Evidence is not just a fact-filled textbook-type of book. Owen explains the process behind many types of murder investigations, from arson to drowning to poison. The details are well explained and easy enough to understand even for those who are not familiar with forensic terminology. The book contains forty true crime cases and how forensics helped (or didn't help)solve them. It contains many graphic photos of actual crime scenes, but is definitely not for the squeamish. This is an excellent choice for anyone who enjoyes reading about true-crime and forensic science."},{"rating":"2","title":"To each his own","review":"I have read all of the reviews and I guess everyone has a right to their opinion, so here is mine. This video is clear and concise in it's instruction. Joynan has a very open and easy to follow teaching technique. She obviously has a lot of experience. The three performances clearly show her individual style and technique and are an inspiration for beginners. I have six belly dancing videos in my collection so far and this one is by far the best. I'll buy anything else that she puts out in a second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for first-time bellydancers","review":"While Joynan does seem to be a nice, pleasant person, I really can't say that her video was for me. I have never done any belly dancing in my life, and I found it difficult to follow along with her. In the first segment (which is the only part of the video I viewed) she wears a long navy blue skirt which makes it difficult to see her hips, legs and feet and what she is doing with them. I think this video would be better for someone who does know the basic core moves of belly dancing and just wants to improve or refresh themselves on it. Probably not good for a person attempting to learn belly dancing for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all what you expect","review":"Absolutely basic, it has a small sticker that says \\"Basic Elements\\", you don't see this until you get the video, the title should be complete\\" THE ART OF BELLY DANCING WITH JOYNAN: BASIC ELEMENTS\\" Dissappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video","review":"I enjoy this video a great deal. It amazes me that Joynan's a grandmother and looks so great. She explains the moves clearly. Each teacher/video offers a slightly different approach, and her explanation clarifies some things that I was missing on other videos. She is very clear and has a patient, gentle and encouraging way of describing the movements and correct posture. I also like how she has segments of how to use a veil and zils, and there are a couple of dance segments, which are great. She doesn't dance or teach in cheesecake costumes, which is wonderful. My only real complaint would be I didn't care for the video effects during the dances. It was a bit too-eighties, though slight (fortunately) and I felt it didn't fully showcase her moves as well as it could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain BAD","review":"I dont' know if it's because I was raised as a child in the early 80's NYC Middle Eastern club scene and grew up watching some of the best bellydancers there are....but I found this tape almost laughable! First of all, aside from the dancing, the production looks like a bad public access show with distracting \\"special effects\\" during her \\"solos\\". One thing I will give it is that she shows the very *BASIC* moves and only having taken about 3 or 4 lessons on my own, I felt beyond the level of this video...I am simply a firm believer that one has to be a good DANCER to be a good teacher and well, Joynan really isn't a good dancer. Her body seems stiff at times, not really fluidly moving and undulating like it should be, even in basic moves. I wouldn't NOT recommend this video at all. Sorry Joynan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"This is the best I have seen and I've seen a lot.Precise instruction and dynamic routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful as a desktop reference","review":"My major complaint against this book is that it is not useful as a reference. The index of only six pages is hopelessly devoid of useful information. Nearly all keywords listed in the index merely point to a table of keywords, with no explanation or further reference. Not in the index: \\"<=\\" (which has two meanings), \\"explicit literal\\", \\"aggregate\\", and \\"assignment statement\\", for example. Index often references wrong page.

It has an all-star cast with Michele Lee, Melissa Gilbert, Lurene Tuttle, Christopher Lee, Jo Anne Worley, Dick Van Patten, Roddy McDowell, and Eva Gabor. It was made in the early 90's, and is a wonderful \\"fairy tale romance\\" for any little girl, or girl-at-heart! It has a great message of love and giving.

The events that unfold are told from the perspective of this \\"reluctant\\" callboy, and it's through Justin's singular interpretation and frank observations that we are delivered a fresh narrative revolving around a common theme. But beyond the basic story we find an underlying deeper message, rare with these kinds of tales. By providing a unique and thought-provoking study in duality, Christopher Scott Sarno blurs the boundaries between right and wrong in an attempt to understand the ways in which gay men behave. He forces us to examine our choices, our needs, and the consequences of our desires. A fine first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and Real","review":"Spending my \\"coming out\\" years in Atlanta allowed me to relate to this book from the start, hence my initial reason for purchasing it. Set in Atlanta, it is an interesting and honest account of a boy's life as a reluctant prostitute. His humble beginning, noble attempt to define himself, and his subsequent downfall are chronicled with finesse and candor. While I can see why some have labeled this book \\"erotica,\\" it really is more of a narrative with erotic moments. The story itself revolves around the sex but focuses more on the character's predicaments. All in all, it was a quick and enjoyable read that definitely delivered what it promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for the clueless","review":"This is one of those books that spews out common-sense advice such as \\"know what gets you ahead\\" and \\"seek out opportunities to excel.\\" Okay, this might be useful information for some.

And it is going to take more than reading this book to change that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiiilarious","review":"This show is hiiiilarious!

I think it is one of the best comedies on TV right now. With that said, it is NOT appropriate for kids. Too much cursing, too much drinking and way too many sexual references. But for adults it is great fun. You don't need to like football (I do but it is not my favorite sport) or play fantasy football (I don't and really don't know much about it except for what this show has taught me) to like this show. The writing is consistently funny and the actors are great - excellent characters that are well developed and quirky. It is also funny because there are guys in the group with kids and others without and that is always a funny interplay - especially between the single guys and the kids. Taco singing about how Ellie was \\"made\\" by her parents at her birthday party has got to be one of the funniest songs in a TV show.

The huge hit single, \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\" is one of the most heart wrenching, romantic songs of that era. The way that Mr. Hill sings it with such passion and raw emotion still brings goose-bumps to me every time I hear it. His simple, yet meaningful lyrics tell of the pain and anguish that he tries to convey so well that you cannot help but be touched by the tune.The rest of this album also marks well with regards to his songwriting ability. Simple, yet meaningful songs, each telling their own special story.I would recomend this LP to anyone who is, or ever has been, in love.

But I must say it was better than I expected.The production by someone named Dirty Bix is very chilled-out--in the realm of Thievery Corporation or Kruder and Dorfmeister, but with Aria's sweet female vocals on top to make it more poppy. I would call it Trip Hop if that weren't such a dirty word these days, maybe Icelandic Lounge Electronica would be better.I'd say if you like Sneaker Pimpps, Morcheeba, Bjork, Zero 7, Mono, or Thievery Corporation, you should definitely get this CD..BTW, how does Iceland, a country with something like 150,000 people keep producing such great musical talent.\\\\?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like trip-hop...wow!","review":"Fans of Hooverphonic, Sneaker Pimps, Mono, and their ilk will find a friend in this CD, a superbly put-together collection of smooth ethereal vocals and laid-back beats.

And as far as non-raregroove downtempo goes, it would actually be not half bad ... a nice intro or sophomore effort perhaps while the group is still finding their sound. But the vocals take away big points. Whatever inspired qualities it may have had musically are all but drowned out with lyrics that venture off into hip hop territories that feel incongruent with everything else on the disc. But let's await their next release before dismissing them entirely..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what you think","review":"Okay, I've been waiting months for the new release by Aria--composed and performed by Paul Schwartz. This album is not by Paul schwartz. This is more of electronic music mixed with some vocals. The album is extremely short, and wasn't very exciting.

The beats are fine, I'll grant him that, but the annoying prevalence of the blunted, annoying, piercing sound of the 303 just drives me insane. The only parts I enjoy are the 30 second jazzy interludes. Jenkinson has also apparently lost his sense of melody completely.

Just one comment for those who wonder if deriding this bit of propoganda makes one a woman-hater, as is implied by its True Believer advocates: has it occurred to them that just because something makes them feel good as feminists, that doesn't make it true or accurate? This book is a historical hatchet job, no more scholarly than the \\"scholarship\\" of Communist Party hacks in the late and unlamented Soviet Union, and the idea that people are *afraid* of Walker's book because it's TRUE, and therefore threatening, rather than FALSE, and therefore disturbing, is patently absurd.

It's just that it all manages to escape this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloriously frustrating!!!","review":"Good resource for interesting tidbits.

As a naive grad student I thought I had found a treasure chest of information, but I quickly found out that I was very wrong. There is a lot of information in there, but most of it is simply not verifiable. This should be taken the same way as The Golden Bough by Frazer.

It was too hokey for one thing with all of the hocus pocus reference. Seemed to anti-man and just all around not my thing. I don't know about the accuracy of the contents as others referenced. This is one case where I'd really recommend going to a physical bookshop to look at it before buying it to see if you like it.

I return to it again and again for the \\"original\\" meanings of words that today have been masculinized beyond imagining! It reveals what most women secretly have known about our patriarchal culture - how it distorts, demeans and belittles a woman's life and all the issues she deals with day in and day out.

The incomplete scholarship and wild references are a constant chuckle and I would recommend the work to anyone who needed a pick-me-up. I do wish Ms. Walker would update it however - a lot of archealogy and research has happened since 1983! To see such divisive, one-sided, dogma proves there really isn't that much difference between the sexes...Good Show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Myth is Myth","review":"This book provides an island of sanity in a world ruled by current myths and fairy tales. If you are not christian and a scholar of the bible, you are often belittled for non-belief, forced to defend yourself by only using the words from their sacred texts. This book provides the neccessary background and linguistic roots to counter many a theological offense. What Barbara Walker reconstructs from 4000 years of obstructed truths is nothing short of amazing, even if it is not *100%* accurate, and has feminist leanings. Christian doctrines always favor patriarcal interests. So fear not this book! Read and open your mind. Many things will click. Worth every penny. I have bought this book twice at full price, and I would buy it again if need be. An essential reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sourced used to make claims are questionable","review":"This book was not created by a professional scholar, but a \\"professional researcher\\" whatever that means. It stands on the \\"Myth of the Burning Times\\" when this is all it is, a MYTH. When you use this book as source material, you are giving yourself over to questionable, refutable evidence. This book should be listed under \\"popular\\" or \\"New Age\\" history, for it misleads the reader to believe that women have practiced paganism and witchcraft from time immemorial;it tells women that they were innocent victims and helpless bodies of torture and death throughout Western Civilization. Not only is this unheartening, it simply isn't true. Always question what you read and check the source material. Apparently, Ms. Walker has grossly failed to do so. This book is not a classic, it is classically wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Women Studies Student's Hopes are Dashed!","review":"I remember happily embracing this weighty tome in highschool, thinking that the secrets of the universe had finally been revealed to me. I was so excited at what seemed to be such an in-depth recovery of women's 'herstory' at last revealed! What a let down to find later on such eminent feminist (& Pagan) scholars as Margot Adler (Drawing Down the Moon) deriding Walker's sources and her interpretations of said sources.It would be marvelous if B. Walker honestly re-edited & re-released WEMS with more stringent scholarly research, even if the resulting book is just half its original size. This would restore much credibility to her work and be worth the effort. For myself, I'd be happy if such an encyclopedia was only a quarter of it's original size as long as it was ACCURATE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I find myself picking up this book and just opening it to any page and reading!Such in depth information and the research is amazing.marijomoore.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redefining Chick","review":"Barbara definitely has her slant but she does allow historical truths and a collective voice to resonate with the reader.

I consider myself a feminist in the sense that I believe everyone should be equal-and the male bashing ALONE is enough to turn me off (which is why I've been reading it in small doses). As more than a few people posting reviews have pointed out, her research is abysmal, the etymology is terrible, and, in my opinion, it seems to be completely revisionist.While I am not a scholar, I consider myself pretty well-read, and there are far better books out there for Feminist/Woman's Studies/Pagan and/or Religious studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge is Power","review":"This is an amazing book.

That's a little distracting, but it is a period piece.The show stopper Brush Up Your Shakespeare with Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore is excellent. Although neither is a singer or a dancer, they are charming.The comedy by-play of Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel as the feuding divorced couple starring in a play within a play is wonderful. The staging of their two dressing rooms along with the choreography as they waltz through the rooms and hallway is fun to watch.The dancing is top rate with Ann Miller and Bobby Van, but my favorite person to watch is the very young Bob Fosse. Even in the early fifties you can see the dance moves that made him famous for the next four decades.This is a movie I'll watch again and again.

The reason for this review is to let people know that in order to make the art trays stay on the easel (several people have complained that they easily fall off), you have to reach behind (inside) the easel and snap them on. You don't just sit them on; they snap in place. Do this and they won't keep falling off. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad tray design!","review":"I bought this easel for my toddler because of Crayola's good reputation and attractiveness of this easel, but I was disappointed.PROS: 1) Easy to assemble, 2) Comes with magnetic letters and numbers, 3) Nice hooks to hang drawing paper, and 4) Sturdy plastic construction with rounded edgesCONS: 1) The 4 trays that are supposed to hold the magnets, drawing supplies, and paints fall off ALL THE TIME! The plastic parts that are supposed to keep the trays in place are very poorly designed and any time my child leans on them or accidentally bumps the easel, as toddlers often do, they would come crashing down. I tried double sticky tape for carpets which only worked temporarily, and finally resorted to velcro-ing the trays down. 2) No drawing supplies came with this unit - only magnets. So, be prepared to buy chalk, erase board markers, paper and crayons when you buy this easel or else your child will be disappointed that he/she cannot draw right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all the best out there","review":"I have several easels. I host toddler art days at my house once a week. The clips on this easel aren't strong enough to actually HOLD paper :-( Also, the chalk board on the one I have doesn't really work.

I DO NOT recommend this easel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced; and not a real \\"black\\" board!","review":"I think this is grossly over-priced!I bought this item at ToysRUs for 45 dollars and I still think it is over-priced.The black-board is \\"plastic\\" hence doesn't draw well at all...

They're not bad in terms of durability and my son doesn't seem to have a problem gripping them. But the spouts have started to give us trouble. My son has to suck so hard on them that he collapses the rubbery top part. I have to constantly unscrew the lid to release the pressure and the spout pops back out. He's fine for a few minutes and then we have to unscrew the top again.We use other brands of cups with the same soft top/valves and don't have this trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"I initially loved the cups but grew to dislike them","review":"When we initially purchased the cups, I was thrilled with their non-spill and non-leak feature. My son would throw them about without any leaks.After a couple of weeks of usage the plastic valve broke which allowed my son to place his thumb inside the valve and rip the plastic out completely. If I had not caught it, I'm sure it would be a chocking hazard.I use them for my 14-month old son's thick smoothies of fruit and yogurt and just keep a careful eye to detect when he's grown tired of it so I can grab it before he sends it flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I purchased this despite the negative reviews since the brand has been pretty good for me. One cup came that is absolutely not spill proof. It leaks absolutely everywhere and the nipple sinks into the cup after my daughter drinks out of it. Really wishing I would have listened to the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I liked them....","review":"I initially liked these cups (and so did my daughter,) so I bought another pack of two...Unfortunately after about a week I hated everything about them. First of all, it takes some time to line the notches up to get the nipple in the ring, and once it's lined and secure, it's hard to screw the top on the cup straight. It almost always takes some adjusting. Secondly, the nipple collapses with almost every sip! I'm not sure how everyone isn't having this same problem, as I know it's not a defect in my daughters cup since we own 4 of them. I'm constantly having to unscrew the lid for her and pop the nipple back out.

Second cup was used today, exact same thing happened.My older nuby cups have been dropped, thrown on concrete, and pretty much gone through what a toddler can do to any item. They are still in tact and working well.These are thin versions of the nuby sippy cups I normally use and have bought (not online).

I noticed there was dirt under it, between the soft part and the hard plastic part of the lid, and that could only be cleaned if the top (the clear part with the sipper) came off and was washed separately, which seemed ok I guess, after all Nuby should've known that it can get really nasty if we don't wash the lid parts separately. After I did that I but it back exactly like the way it was before and did all the adjustments but they kept on leaking! They leak so bad it's impossible for my baby to use it without having water pouring from everywhere. And the price wasn't too cheap either. Now I have to throw them away because they're just useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good sippy cup.","review":"I have used other sippy cups before, and this one is not the best. It leaks all over the carpet and I end up stepping in the leakage. Milk? Milk on my sandals? Why is there milk on my sandals? Oh wait, that's right. The defective piece of crap that is this sippy cup has leaked out once again. I would not recommend buying it seeing as though there are better ones out there. It makes me feel bad inside, and if I were to receive this as a gift I'd spit on whoever gifted it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transition cup!","review":"My son was not interested in ANY sippy cup for any reason ever. I got this cup (the one I got is actually an older model w/the mouthpiece in the middle instead of on the edge of the top) and my son took to it pretty much immediately! He likes the fact that the top feels like a nipple. He had no trouble figuring out that he should bite it to get the liquid out. I've only had it a day, but it doesn't appear to leak easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant leaks","review":"The top of the spout is squishy so every time my son throws this cup down the spout is depressed and the cup leaks. He usually is tossing the cup at me so if I'm sitting on the couch the leak goes right for my pants. Really kind of annoying. I wouldn't buy these again. I'm shopping right now for replacements. This also makes it so you can't put liquid in it for travel. Some of our sippy cups I can toss in a bag and not worry but the spout of this one makes that impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, they don't leak...","review":"These lids do not leak. But the minute my child drops one from his high chair, the whole lid comes off. If he drops it hard enough, the lid comes off and the nipple insert pops out. It's very dramatic and not at all the purpose of a sippy cup. Trust me, we've tried hard, but there is NO WAY to put these lids on tightly enough that he can't perform this \\"trick.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Brake when they hit the floor!","review":"We got these because we liked other Nubby sippy cups, but needed more. We have had them about two months, always washing them on the top shelf in the dishwasher (which I guess weakens the plastic) and all of a sudden this week each one broke whenever our daughter threw it on the floor. She throws any/all sippy cups from time to time, but these are the only ones that have broken! What a waste of money if they only last 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks? It pours!","review":"My son's bottles leak when they are tipped over, this thing is like a slow faucet, 10-15 minutes and it's empty.

The design of the cup is great. And when it works, it's fine. BUT...The spouts leak after a while or if your child chews on them. Wal-Mart has the cups for $1.79 but the replacement spouts cost at least that much plus shipping. I had been ordering the spouts from the manufacturer for 85 cents each until January but they decided to only sell them retail since the demand was so high. I wonder why?DON'T BUY THIS CUP. It's a money pit. Unless you consider $2 sippy cups disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, Nipple breaks, No Good","review":"Anyone who gives this a positive review hasn't owned it very long. The spout leaks and after a few times getting chewed on, the end of the spout breaks. What a racket. The cup is $1.74 at Walmart but the spout is $1.75 on ebay. Might as well get a new cup. Lame!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid suctions in after every drink!!!","review":"My daughter would only take this type of cup due to the soft spout, so that part was great. The problem is, after every single drink, the lid gets suctioned down and then it will leak everywhere. I either have to unscrew the lid or pull on the spout to get it to go back to normal, and that's a pain. I did buy some different Nuby cups (VERY similar in appearance) at a store and those work fine. Those are more of a \\"sport\\" model I think, and we love those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really satisfied with the product","review":"My review focuses more on the practical aspect of the sippy cup than the way it's made. I don't have a problem with the design or color, it's just that somehow the air is not flowing as it should and as the baby sucks, the nipple shrinks in and you need to open the lid and let air go in so the nipple gets its form back. Maybe I need to poke the little hole that it has on the lid and make it bigger..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sippy Cup for Transitioning from a Bottle","review":"My son was very resistant to switching from the bottle to a sippy cup. His daycare recommended this cup and my son easily adjusted to using it instead of his bottle. (I also recommended it to a friend whose son was also having a difficult time and she also found that her son was able to adjust easily to the Nuby cup.) It is true that the silicone spout tears with use, but sippy cups are just another transitional step to an actual cup. Ours lasted until my son was ready for that step. Also, it is possible to buy replacement spouts online and we are doing that for our second son who will soon start to switch from the bottle to a cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for transitioning from bottle to cup.","review":"When I was trying to get my daughter off the bottle, she flat out refused all sippies. I gave this one a shot at the suggestion of a friend, and it was the winner. She took her milk from it with no problem at all. A few weeks later, I transitioned her from this cup to a hard-spouted sippy and never looked back.I wouldn't, however, recommend this cup for everyday or long-term use. The cup does leak, no question about it. And the spout does tear open if abused (and actually, my daughter never chewed on it and it STILL tore!) But if you need a cup to help get your child off the bottle, do give this one a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend for younger babies as first sippy cup","review":"These cups are great to introduce the sippy early and get rid of bottles. We used them from 9months till about 13months and then transitioned to cups and the harder, valve sippy cups. They are soft and easy to introduce and your baby does not need a long of hand dexterity to use. However, they do not last very long (although they are SUPER cheap) and babies eventually learn how to make them leak all over. Once my daughter learned to turn it upside down and mash it to get fluid to come out, I knew that it was time to transition to a cup and the hard top sippies. Once they have that dexterity, there is no need to keep them using these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for teething babies","review":"What I liked: This cup is great for transition from bottle to cup, it's leak-proof and easy to clean.What I didn't like: My son learned quickly to squeeze the mouth piece with his gums and let the liquid run out all over his shirt.We like the Playtex sippy cup best."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter loves them . . . I hate them","review":"These were the only 'sippy cups' that I could get my daughter to use after stopping breastfeeding. Yet, now at 18 months, she still only wants these cups and they leak horribly and are time consuming to prepare. Even after the tedious job of lining up the notches perfectly (and the silicone spout often slips when you screw it onto the cup, so you often have to take it out and line it up all over again), we often get leaks from some other minor problem in the lid. I have to triple check every aspect of the lid to ensure no major leaks.Also, the spouts break very easily (which causes major leakage), and I have had to keep replacing them. I am desperately trying to break my daughter of these cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect sippy cup","review":"These do not leak, I can shake formula and not make a mess. They are easy for my 6mo old to hold and the silicone nipple is familiar to her and she takes these fine whereas the hard plastic sippy cups she pushes away.I have found these for $[...] each and for that price I dont worry about them getting lost or ruined or left at grandmas like I did with the Dr Browns bottles.Only problem is the 10oz and 14oz cups cant use eachothers screw-on caps, and so somtimes I have to check to see which one it is. Because it will tighten and if you click it too far it will open and my 6mo old can open it and spill the entire contents. But if the right cap is used there is no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great look, but bad results!","review":"I bought this cup for my daughter a couple days ago. I kept wondering why she was so irritated with this cup. Last night I finally tried sucking on it myself to see if liquid was even coming out and guess what...nothing! I literally had to suck extremely hard to get a couple of drops out. I am now thinking about cutting a larger opening in the silicone spout so that my daughter gets uesd to holding a cup. It will somewhat defeat the purpose of a 'no spill' cup, but at least she'll get something out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get liquid out","review":"I tried this cup for the first time this morning. My daughter screamed when she couldn't get the milk out of it. I tried it and I couldn't get any milk out either. You have to bite the nipple to get the liquid out. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while but don't last long","review":"We got these sippys when our twins got old enough to drink from a sippy we thought that they were cool, easy to clean, and easy for the kids to drink from. And then it happened the nipple part cracked and needed replaced, no big deal our walmart carried these thats were we got them, we got them for 99 cents a sippy. Bad news!!! They don't make replacement nipple peices. So once its ruined you have to through the thing out waste of money. I really thought I was going to like these and I did at first but after your kids's teeth come in it wont be long before you throw the sippy out, so if you stop to think about it, its cheaper in the long run to get sippy's that have replacement peices and ones that arent silocone. Wish I would have stuck with my gerber and playtex sippy cups, harder to clean but I don't have to replace them unless something really bad happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cups","review":"I like these because they are simple and easy to wash. There are no valves. Washing valves and caps for most cups(Playtex) has always been hard and I was never sure if they were clean enough. I just bought 4 more of these this past weekend. The cups have been upgraded with caps and the spouts have been improve as well. I would recommend these to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Cup","review":"I like this cup because there is no valve to lose and my 2 yr old son can hold it easily. However, the lid is difficult to twist properly onto the cup and the cup leaks or if my son drops it the lid comes off. So we stopped using this cup after a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"poor sound quality","review":"we recieved this dvd yesterday from the great people at amazon.with everything of bruces we always can\`t wait to watch it,but we were really dissappointed with the sound quality.whoever produced this dvd has really let bruce and the e street band down.live in new york will still stay our favourite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing show but sound could be better","review":"The show itself deserves five stars, it's truly incredible.

It's disgusting. I compared the broadcast version against the \\"real\\" DVD and the broadcast sounds like a soundboard. The \\"real\\" DVD is a disgrace. My guess is that Landau and Co. wants the fan to feel like he's at the show. Well duh, I'm not at the show, I'm in my living room, where I have close-ups of his nostrils and overbite.

As a student getting a science PhD, I find this book very entertaining to read. It answers questions in understandable English.Certain things I think can be explained a little better, like why the atmosphere is thinner at higher altitude. Or the difference between static friction and rolling friction. But these are just nicky-picky little things.Overall, this book is a joy to read.

I still really like the shave I get with these blades and the power handle. My problem is the quality of the handle has gone way down. My first one lasted forever. I left it at a hotel and figured I'd just buy a new one. The two replacements I've gotten both stopped vibrating within months. The first just stopped. The second seemed to have some leakage.

I have used one for the past 10 or more years. I shave in the shower and have a heavy beard. The combination of shaving in the shower plus the vibrating makes my shave less likely to cut and does a better job for me. I use a new blade this way every week where I used to need a new blade every day not to cut myself. I highly recommend it but don't understand why it is no longer sold. My guess is that people with normal beards don't care as much, but for me with a heavy beard this really helps.

So its basically its really durable, sounds great, but accidentally stops playing if you put it in pocket without putting it on hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned two players.","review":"Had to return two players.

So, I installed the software provided by Samsung to upgrade the firmware to version 2.121 (downloaded from Samsung website). I plugged the player and started the update process. Everything seemed to be ok. When I unplugged the USB cable the player would no longer turn on. I had the same exact problem with the second player.

We cant even talk on one of the phones more than half an hour now until it beeps to say charge battery, and one of them has a battery that is completely dead. None of this would be much of a problem if you could buy a new battery right?

The Circulon roaster came in time for Thanksgiving and a test with the fresh turkey I had ordered locally. Two things stand out. First, cleanup of the pan was a breeze, and of the rack just slightly less so. Second, the bird was done significantly sooner than I expected (and I usually have the opposite experience). I am convinced that the rack, which is raised well above the bottom of the pan, promotes the circulation of air and cooks the fowl much faster.

Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has more than doubled in that era, but the earth cooled a tiny bit! The only thing I can say is that one robin does not make a spring and a few years of [what seems to short-lived humans!] extra warmth or drought or rain or cold does not constitute a trend in climate. Back off a bit and look at thousand year cycles if you want to know about climate. Lynas has done a good job of finding the \\"low-hanging fruit\\" that always gets picked first, but he certainly has not investigated and used his brain to analyze data and reach adult conclusions.

It recounts many of the main themes within it (including my favourite part where it says \\"Shes like the sunrise, precious like starlight,\\" etc... describing Helen). If you enjoyed previous albums by blind guardian then this is a MUST. It manages to convey in the sheer sounds of the music going from softness to heavy drums and guitar solos, showing the moods in the story of sadness and triumph. The meaningful lyrics are a prime example of blind guardian's finest and Hansi's singing is again almost flawless. Just buy it!

You faithfully paid for a product and you never thought that Samsung could treat you like that.I finally found out that I can get around Napster by using WMP10 but the thing is that you paid too much money, too much time, too much energy for a total neglection of Samsung.

I bought a Zune 30gb about a month later and never looked back. I am now using the Zune HD 32gb and am quite happy (as I got it on major clearance!!). Do NOT buy this MP3, even if it only costs you $1!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPPY!!!!!!!","review":"Initially I loved this item. But as time went on the love faded, really fast. After a few months the battery life became less and less. I initially purchsed this to record my lectures, and it did a fantastic job, for a while. Then after a year of having it the internal flash stopped working. This made it completely inoperable because I wasn't able to access the various functions. I called Samsung customer service and they were not helpful at all. This is the last Samsung item I will ever buy. I didn't want to give this thing one star, if I could I would give it negative stars for wasting my time and hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, boring, 300 pages too long","review":"This book goes on and on and on.

Don't buy this!","review":"This phone is horrible. Before this phone, I had a panasonic cordless for like 10 years. It worked great, but the buttons began to fail. I wanted a cheap one, so despite the bad reviews for this product, I thought, \\"I will be different.\\" plus, it was very cheap. Well, it's cheap b/c it sucks. There is constant static when I'm using it, and changing the channels on it won't help at all. The speakerphone feature, which was the main reason I got this one, is awful. It is hard to hear the other person even when it's on the highest volume setting. You have to hold the phone up to your mouth, which defeats the purpose of speakerphone! I would return this phone, but returns are always a big hassle. And also, while I was getting a new phone, I wouldn't have use of a phone in my house. And also, it would cost like $10 to ship it back, and the phone is like $20, so it's pointless. In conclusion, don't buy this phone. It's a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisey reception. Confusing interface.","review":"So... if you're on speakerphone and you click speakerphone again to disable it... it hangs up.

It's sort of like one of those \\"real\\" nature books with drawings, habitats, and biological information, but it's all about aliens from major Science Fiction authors. You figure the authors of this book have got to have a lot of information to put something like this together. For those of a puerile nature (or those who read a lot of Niven's rishartha), they even have some alien species' mating habits. In the middle there is a scale diagram of all of the aliens' sizes which was my first exposure to the wonderful world of the metric system.

Apparently, this CD is an unreleased live album with a few added tracks. The main album was recorded on two nights in England in late 1976. The added tracks are the ten-minute-plus \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" from the 1975 Volunteer Jam (featuring guests Dickey Betts, Chuck Leavell and Charlie Daniels), and \\"Ramblin'\\" and \\"24 Hours At A Time\\" from 1974 (and previously released on \\"Where We All Belong\\"). Sound quality varies on the tracks, but most of the performances are amazing. You can hear why this band was such a hot live commodity. I wish the editing between tracks was better; that would give more of a semblance of a real live show. Still it's great, just having this stuff.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice release - should have been 2 CDs","review":"Very nice release. Was lucky to see the original lineup a few times in the early 70s.

It was as if Zaks knew my own, unique desire to learn and how it naturally unfolded. It felt as though he had prepared each of the steps that I would need by having been where I was.

As well it was simple to adjust the harness for each of them. It is nicely padded, our daughter says it is very comfortable. I read some reviews that the reclining feature was nice for when their kids went to sleep but if you install it correctly the reclining feature is only to make it fit your car properly and for when it is rear facing, you have it in the recline position...which is nice for when they are asleep their heads are not flopped forward.we bought the seats directly from BabyAge because combined shipping was $7.highly recommend this seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed","review":"when you buy a car seat at a store you have the opportunity to check the manufacture date and decide for yourself if it suits you. when you buy online you depend on the sellers integrity.

The one I wanted to \\"protect\\" my 9 year old from. The worst was with his sister Janet, who in this video was grabbing her breasts, flipping everyone off into the Camera, and standing in front of a toilet as if to \\"pee\\" like a man. I don't care WHAT the twisted message was trying to convey, my son and I were appauled. After that, was a video of Michael rising from a pond with angel wings attached to his back as we watch him emerge from the water. So....what's wrong with THAT picture.

The others are OLD video music clips that you used to see on MTV decades ago! The quality of the sound for those clips are laughable -- you would laugh too if you didn't pay money for the DVD.

He captured our hearts because his own heart was bigger than any person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. His music and dancing will live on forever as long as we listen to his songs and watch his short films.

There are other favorites of mine on this video as well which is the best video or short film as Michael preferred to call them and that's Thriller. You will also get the video that skyrocketed Michael's career to another galaxy and that's the Billie Jean performance at the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today and Forever anniversary.

Well, that was shown on t.v. to promote the history c.d. Also, the Billie Jean live from motown had the ending cut off. If you watched it back then, you'll get the three songs performed instead of just billie jean. there are a lot of his videos here. no remixes though like they've been shown on t.v. such as the megamix history i guess with a mixture of all his songs.

This disc makes you remeber why he is one of the greatest entertainers of this century.Two Highlights of this disc are: 1)Michael's 1995 MTV Awards performance. It's probably his single best performance of his career. 15 minutes of singing and dancing to five or six of his past hits and finishing off with \\"You Are Not Alone\\" in front of a choir. 2)A Special feature that allows you to read the lyrics of the song as you watch the videos.The only negative is the fact that you have to flip the disc over. For some reason it's on two sides. Other than that, Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect DVD Set","review":"Purchased both of the History Films.

Don't expect anything too prophetic from this guy, but he is pleasing to hear... the only downside to this, was this cd was way too short. 4 songs plus a clean verion of the first track, didn't really cut it for me.

As a Shiatsu practitioner I find this to be a good complement to my daily exercise program."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video for beginners!","review":"This video has simple instructions and poses for any beginner.

It's so obvious, the guy's name is Gatsby. Also this book claims to not use the letter E, but it uses the letter E. They're trying to mislead us, but I wont fall for it. They use the letter E in the title when they state his name ErnEst VincEnt Grant.This novel is obviously part of some commie plot to take us over, don't fall for it guys. The Motherland still lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a substitute for the original!","review":"This review refers *only* to the Ramble House / Fender Tucker edition, 2005/6.I bought this edition from the publisher (Ramble House / Fender Tucker) in May 2006. I compared it carefully with my copy of the original edition (1939). I was disappointed to find HUNDREDS OF ERRORS in the Ramble House edition -- including some real howlers like \\"Smiting\\" (page 164) for \\"Smiling\\" (in the original, page 252).On the whole it appears that this edition (Ramble House / Fender Tucker) was printed from a defective e-text made from a fuzzy photocopy of the original edition. And since there are already a number of defective e-texts on line, it's hard to see why we need one in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This was a very low quality book. The pages were cheap feeling paper, and the cover was very grainy looking. Like if you stretch a picture on a computer. I would look for a higher quality book if I were you.

It looks more like a college text book than a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gadsby","review":"This book is totally worth reading if you're interested analysing in how he managed to write a novel without using the letter \\"e\\", but by god don't read it hoping for a good story - Wright was a terrible writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not quite worth it.","review":"Immediately after opening the package, I noticed the cover was incredibly pixelated and did not fit entirely on the cover. In large sections of the book, some characters, especially apostrophes, display as squares ('), representing a missing character. The quality of this product is very low, and it is apparent that little care went into its creation. The story itself is mediocre, but decent for not using the letter 'e'. The best part of the book is looking at some of the clever ways the author avoided using the letter 'e', but don't expect a good story. I intend to return this item if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"It's proportionately wrong to feel like a proper book. Cover looks like they stretched out the image on MS Paint and the paper is extremely low quality. If they had kept it the size of an average book it would be decent but it's uncomfortable to read and feels as if you're reading an 8th graders math workbook. They made it so large that and thin that it looks like a child's picture book. There are no marks that tell you where the introduction ends and the real story begins or anywhere marking new chapters. Incredibly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...And the time has finally come for me to pack my bags and walk away...\\"","review":"The music of the Marshall Tucker Band brings neverending enjoyment to my ears. It's like the Metallica of Southern Rock: I just can't stop listening. Their first self-titled album is solid from beginning to end. \\"Take the Highway\\" and \\"Can't You See,\\" both being my personal favorites on the album, should be considered timeless classics in the Southern Rock genre. The other songs, including the 12-minute Everyday (I Have the Blues) recorded live, are extraordinarily well-written and well-played. To be honest, however, this is the first time I have ever stumbled across an album by the Marshall Tucker Band. And I don't think I'll stop right here. This is great music; it's certainly better than the mainstream music that we have today. Up next: the second CD called A New Life!Grade: 9.5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marshal Tucker Band","review":"I heard a track of the Marshal Tucker band in a bar in UK.I really liked that track, so I bought this CD on the strength of it.However, the CD was not quite what I was expecting and rather disapointing. Too 70'ish for my liking.Perhaps it might grow on me ??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"The debut album from The Marshall Tucker Band is one of the greatest. This album brings out the sound that MTB does so well, from country, to rock, to blues, all rolled together into a southern sound. Doug Gray's vocals on \\"Take the Highway\\" are fantastic, Toy Caldwell's \\"Can't You See\\" remains a favorite, \\"Hillbilly Band\\" adds a bluegrass feel, \\"Ramblin\\" is full of energy, and the live \\"Everyday (I Have the Blues)\\", displaying how massively skilled Toy Caldwell was, is one of the greatest guitar songs I've ever heard. All in all, I highly recommend this album to every MTB fan along with fans of Southern Rock and Country rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product sent","review":"A wrong set was sent to me and I dint have the option of returning and getting the set I needed.It was a christmas gift for my Girlfriend and thanks to you guys she wasnt happy with the cell phone.I dint have the option to cancel the line because by the time the cell got shipped to me the deadline for cancelling the line from cingular was over.Amazon is not doing a good job and i recommand not to purchase from your website"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare experiance with AT&T","review":"I was an AT&T customer, never again after this experiance.

We only used 350 of the 550 because most of our friends also have cingular (free m2m). After reviewing our bill we had over 3000 minutes combined or about 2cents a minute. The only cons i see are that 1) Cingular will be raising the sms from 10 to 15 cent. Total ripoff! 50% increase wow! 2) the first month you need to pay in advance.

Like many of the family genealogies of this era (1928), there are no sources quoted, as required by serious, modern genealogists. It does, however, make for very interesting reading. The author goes on to discuss her other family lines including the Taunton Leonard family, the Aldens, etc. At the end she lists each family's genealogy as well as identifying royal lines that go way back into history."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of DISNEYS best","review":"i first saw this when it came out, & thought it brilliant that is why i have bought it.of all disneys works next to this is Snow White, again i saw this when it first came out,& it is a pity they have not come(to me anyway) anywhere near making anything as good. the Living Desert I would say to anyone if u have not seen it, then you are missing a lot,not only for the music, but the antics as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAMENT FOR A MAKER is complex, challenging, absolutely fascinating!","review":"Michael Innes has written many mysteries, all of them worth reading.

I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed the Archane books in the past this one doesn't let you down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was once a unique, creative idea now overdone","review":"This is not her best work for sure, but I find a lot of JAK's work to be all over the place w/ respect to quality. When she first started w/ the Arcane series, I found them intriguing and unique. There was just enough sprinkling of the paranormal to make it almost possible and the characters had, well, character. Now everybody and his/her uncle has a talent, and the talents are getting more and more unbelievable, and the characters are very 2D with just a few moments of humor and realism. I also couldn't buy into the attraction b/w the main characters, who, in typical JAK style, jump into the sack w/in the first few chapters. If you're a die hard fan, save your money and take it out of the library if you must rather than buying it. If you want a good read, save your time too and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I have read many books by this author, and liked them. Thus, my continuing to read her books, but after this one, I don't think I will read any more of them.First, the characters were two-dimensional at the best of times. There was not any real depth to them. Even though the author tried to give them some depth with their back-stories, I found them boring and nothing I haven't seen a dozen other authors try to do.Second, the story followed the same old formula. Two wounded, psychic, people who are attracted to each other, fall into bed, in the first few chapters, and have hot animal sex with their psychic abilities making it the best sex on the planet. But no real romance or genuine love.Third, the dialogue was boring.Finally, because of all that, I have never cared less about any story or character, before or since. I managed to make it most of the way through the book, but started laughing and couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Arcane Society","review":"This book is a huge disappointment for this long time Krentz fan. It meanders around trying to create credibility for the psuedo science it's full of and does little or nothing to give you insight or frankly interest in the characters. I had to force myself to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best villian ever","review":"is the 'Killer Diva'. I just loved her. I don't know how she came up with her but I thought she was fabulous. I liked the main characters also - I thought they were pitched just right. Enough character / 'tough life' stories to make them interesting but not so over the top they were unbelievable. Of course you have to buy into the whole Arcane Society thing but if you can it all works. I would like to see at least one main character who is not an off the chart talent though. One thing I appreciated about Running Hot was the minimal fill-in stuff about the Arcane Society. I've read all the other ones and was glad to see I didn't have to wade through a lot of repetitive explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the paranormal already","review":"What's with JAK's obsession with the paranormal and ESP. Every book she's written in the past 5 years have been about this. Very boring. And her characters are only clones of characters in her other books. No originality. I've noticed lately that several old time writers have gone down hill in their writing. Stuart Woods for example. His last several books were lousy. Very sad. I used to think JAK was a great writer. Now she's mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual and Musical Masterpiece","review":"I have watched other musical DVDs in the past but, this DVD was so captivating. The visual sets and the musical compositions are outstanding. Carmen has such great presence and great vocal artistry. The supporting musicians are fantastic and work very well together. The only thing that could have been better was to have attended the live concert in 02/05. Luckily, with this DVD, we can relive those moments. There should be an award for best musical DVD, I am sure that this one would win \\"Hands-Down\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Package.","review":"This a great concert DVD. Carmen Lundy is a wonderful singer and composer. She is fantastic is this live concert performance in a small theatre in Los Angeles. She is supported by a group of outstanding musicians in performances of her own compositions. The musicians include Bobby Watson, Steve Turre, Victor Lewis, Smitty Smith, Nathan East, Billy Childs, Robert Glasper, Phil Upchurch and Mark Shim. The photography and sound are first rate. At times, there are two drummers and three bassists on stage, but the music supports the numbers of musicians, and things stay organized. The band looks and sounds like they are having a great time. Ms. Lundy displays her wonderful vocal range and dynamite personality. There are many fine female jazz singers at this time, but Carmen Lundy stands apart because she also such a wonderful songwriter.

It is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears, the guide and the frame.

I actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point.End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it, but it broke","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift, and it really does make opening a bottle of wine fun and easy. But the pin that holds the mechanism started wearing, and it finally broke after about 3 or 4 months. So we're back to our handy, trustworthy waiter type bottle opener.

I *love* it. Brag about it. Find excuses to open bottles of wine.Therefore, when I saw the low price on this item, I bought 2 for a couple of friends.I wish I hadn't gone so cheap. These are so poorly manufactured, I wont even give them away. Mostly plastic, every part is shaky qnd on the verge of falling off or apart.Stay away from this item, very poorly made.

I wish I hadn't. The 90 day warranty is not long enough. I used it with some regularity for almost 120 days. The main lever broke off the gear while pulling out a cork. Also, the included foil cutter doesn't cut foil. The one I bought as a gift is from Bed, Bath & Beyond, costs $9.99, comes with extras (including a handy stand), and has lasted a couple of years so far. So I bought myself one of those. There's more metal and the foil cutter actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got ours on a special offer and...","review":"it worked magnificently for about 30 bottles until...kapow!...it failed spectacularly and broke into several pieces.

Their vitrolic accusations against males, whites, Christians, etc. insight me to become an advocate for those they discriminate against - to expose their hypocritic instructions to be respectful, empathetic and flexible toward others. And by the way, for \\"experts\\" to use the term \\"homophobic\\" is a clinical and education travesty. To discriminate against those who do not condone the lifestyle by calling them names is simply politically correct, immature, and evidence of their agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"extreme anti male bias","review":"this book was required for my grad school program.

How many times is it going to be funny that people mistake this bear for a hemmingwayesque man ?Obviously, somebody out there likes this thing, but I had a creeping sense of deja vu at the beginning, kept waiting for some new unexpected twist, and then finally gave in to overhwelming boredom as I finished it up.

While I was forcing myself to read this drivel, I went out on date. She and I were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it. I was advocating the 25 page litmus, and she insisted on at least fifty. She did several long train commutes a week to and from work, and so read a lot of novels. Anyway, I started describing this book. She recognized it immediately, and interrupted me saying, \\"The Bear Went Over The Mountain! Don't read another word!

Both books are in Very good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fable Too Far","review":"The Bear Went Over the Mountain was a clever idea, and seemed to portray a firm stance - natural and terse is betterthan man-manipulated and complex. But it went on too long. The arguments for the human side lost groundsteadily, until the energy to represent that side practically fizzled out entirely. If that was what the author was going for, hemade it. But it was too snide and arch for me, almost from the beginning. Neither side was believable, at any level.I love the natural world, but it didn't appear in this book - only a caricature of it. The humans chosen to be in the actwere also larger and more grotesque than life. Being a woman, I especially balked at the portrayal of women. They were allghastly, and continued to get worse as they \\"developed\\".

I could not even get into safe mode with winXP. I had to go to a USB keyboard in order to get back into windows and work as before.

First my goal was to have access to both Linux and Windows for research and general purposes respectively. Those who have tried dual-boot Linux and Windows in early 2000s know how unstable that combination is -- shelf life of 6 months at most. Frustrations on that front led me to get my first KVM switch. Since I used to work from home (still do) and have personal interests, KVM switch came in handy again.A month ago my previous switch died. I don't recall what brand it was, but it worked for 2 years. After reading the reviews, I bought this piece. It worked on one computer but not on the other: a single tap begat scores of letters on my desk and I could not use the backspace key. I use the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard for the past 4 years and do not understand why this piece of junk won't work with that.I bought the KVM switch (USB only) from TrendNET and that seems to be working fine. Skip this one and try TrendNET instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This KVM was released in 2002 and I think it just wasn't made for current machines. I tried to use the KVM with two Dell WinXP boxes, one with PS/2 connections the other with USB. Another reviewer said using a PS/2 to USB converter would work and since I'm already using such a converter for my keyboard I figured it wouldn't be an issue.The keyboard on the USB machine never once worked, and after hitting the Scroll Lock twice to toggle the machines it wouldn't work with either machine. I didn't try plugging in the mice and there were no issues with the monitor, but if I can't get the keyboard to work it's worthless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great KVM switch","review":"I've been using the IOGEAR GCS62 for about a month now.

Easy toggling between the 2 computers with a simple double keystroke on the seldom used \\"scroll lock\\" key.I don't do any intense, fast-paced gaming. I have used it on a flight simulator game and for simple typing, even at my quickest and it works flawlessly.

HOWEVER, I have a USB mouse and I used a USB to PS/2 converter to make it work with this KVM. Over time my USB mouse has stopped working properly and I have to unplug the mouse for several seconds and plug it back in. Otherwise, it does odd things like completely locking up, causing my browser to go backwards and forwards and sometimes closing windows. So, I dug into the documentation and found where it does indeed say that you can't use USB devices with it, which make this purchase was a COMPLETE waste of my money. I suppose it was my fault, but they could have made the USB - PS/2 conversion incompatibility more eye catching. It is very interesting that their USB version of this device is almost twice as expensive.Update: After going through two USB mice, I tried another USB mouse (same type of mouse) and the mouse has been working fine for probably 6 months.

It switches perfectly, produces practically no video shadowing (running at 1240x1024x32), and perfectly emmulates the presence of a keyboard and mouse when a machine boots up with the switch set to the other PC.

I did not know it was the KVM issue so I formated/uninstalled/reistalled windows professional/2003 servers on both PCs for at least 5 times. My Dell 8300 finally died on me with a message like bus drive not recognized and I could not even see any hard drives when I tried to install the windows xp. Finally, I unplugged the KVM and my survived pc (SC400) works fine and it has never shut off itself.I am not sure if it was the usb mouse or high resolution on my monitors causing my PCs malfunction.

It worked fine for connecting the keyboard and mouse to the PC, but KVM messed up the display timings for the monitor (1920x1200 resolution), resulting in a flickering, distorted image. Connecting to the laptop resulted in the same image problems, as well as the keyboard not working at all. I know these old IBM Model M keyboards draw more current than newer PS/2 keyboards, but apparently this KVM wasn't able to handle that. I sent mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it if you are using an IBM or Toshiba Laptop!","review":"Hooked this up to a Dell desktop and an IBM T43P via docking station. Mouse doesn't work with IBM laptop, even if laptop is rebooted.

Yeah right!I called customer service, which has no toll-free number, long wait time, and they eventually just said \\"yep, doesn't support IBM\\".Wish I had sorted the reviews by \\"worst first\\" before buying, rather than relying on the overall rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't type too quickly or it will bonk out","review":"What a piece of junk. I am tired of having to restart my machine because this thing bonked out because I typed too quickly. Apparently it cannot process too many keystrokes.When I type quickly, the Iogear Mini KVM switch apparently gets confused and freezes up and starts \\"switching\\" the monitor off, then on, then off, then on in 1 second intervals. The keyboard is no longer responsive.The only way to fix it is to turn it off by unhooking everything that can provide electricity to the unit (all cords to both PCs).However, sometimes that doesn't fix it, and I have to restart my machine, which means I lose ALL unsaved work.My advice is that, if you work from home, AVOID this at all costs. If you are in the middle of doing anything important and you type one-too-many-keys at the wrong moment, your work is toast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little speakers, Big sound","review":"I am extremely pleased with the purchase of this speaker set. For such a small system, the sound quality is intense! While sound was the most sought after element, I wanted something that looked great sitting next to my iBook. I've always been turned off by equipment that was cumbersome and preferred something that was aesthetically pleasing. The controls for the bass, treble, and volume are located in convenient positions and do not detract from its smooth appearance. Within 5 minutes, my new sound system was up and running. If you want a cool looking speaker set with great sound, there's no need to look any further than the JBL Creature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Looks AND Sound!","review":"I think these are the best looking speakers out there. The coolest part may be the blue lights underneath the left and right speakers. They really do look like spaceships. The sound is fantastic, especially considering the small size of the whole system. The subwoofer is not as large and bulky as other systems in this price range and it's probably the only subwoofer you wouldn't want to hide anyway - cause it looks cool! Would have been even better if it too had blue lights. The only downside I can think of is that there's only one input jack. So you can't hook up multiple sources directly to the system. I've tried mini-phone Y adaptors but the sound becomes distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"I have always trusted Altec Lansing for decent, affordable PC speakers with a sub, but when I was furnishing my new office, I figured I'd give JBL a try, since they have always been one of my favorites for home use. I can't express my disgust enough...the overall sound wasn't great at all. About a month in, the bass control knob stopped working....anywhere you set it, it gives you maximum bass. I figured out that if I push the knob hard enough, it corrects the problem....so now my ... speakers have scotch tape on the subwoofer, holding the bass knob at an angle. My advice....stay away. Go buy some Altecs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Sounding Speakers","review":"JBL did a great job. Easy to assemble, light weight, nice to look at, and most of all the sound is amazing for speakers that size. I would have prefered a better design for the volume control.

But, overall I intend to keep my Silver Creatures for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design, great sound, great price","review":"I spent almost all of my time with these speakers at the Apple Store during my first ever visit to the place!I echo the same positive feedback that the earlier reviewers have given. This is the purest sound I have ever heard from a speaker set of this size and budget. Aesthetically, trendy looking white Creature is goes very well with other white creatures like the iMac, iBook, and iPod. An excellent choice for desktop speakers.

Really fantastic sound. It's hard to believe such great sound comes from this small compact set.

Why? Fred's ability to take a track, find the essential elements, and rearrange them into house-flavored jams is amazing. He transforms the punk/hip-hop \\"Astounded\\" by Bran Van 3000 into a deep journey. The plaintive vocals on Random Factor's \\"Without You\\" are given a new insistent quality by his touch, and the Northern Light Orchestra's \\"Loverboy\\" becomes even more romantic. It's much easier to mess up a remix of a good than of a bad song, and although his mix of Jaffa's \\"Elevator\\" isn't too exciting, his retakes of \\"It's Complete\\" by Atjazz or \\"Watch Them Come\\" by Roy Davis, Jr. redeem him. Some of the tracks may lag at the end, but that's because they were designed for mixing, rather than listening.

Now for this certain album, I have to say was my greatest mistake in terms of buying electronic music.

An excellent read for anyone interested in aviation, commercial aircraft, management and start-up growth. While his was focused on aviation and the birthing pains of the 747, it is analogous to many of our own dreams and trials as we strive to do what we 'know' in our gut to be our contribution to our businesses, organizations, or environment. His lessons in leadership, perseverance and a healthy dose of 'independence of thought' are great reminders not to follow the crowd, but carve your own path through them. Joe sounds a little arrogant at times, which you can easily ignore. He does give plenty of credit to legion members of the team, including those he didn't particularly get along with. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An empty, tedious book","review":"This book reads like the co-author, Jay Spenser, sat down with Joe Sutter on several different days, asked Joe to tell him a story about some person or event, then wrote down the ensuing tale. The resulting book suffers from a disjointed narrative that bounds back and forth through the years, a dearth of specifics, and a heaping helping of self-aggrandizement.

Avoid it if you have any devotion to Clive Barker. The reason it gets 2- Tony Todd is interesting, not accurate, but interesting.

Scary and stylish horror film based off Clive Barker's short story mixes psychological and visceral thrills into one deft and extremely well-made blend.

Most recently someone is brutally murdered, but is this the responsibiltiy of Candyman or is it something else? Tense, psychological horror thriller.

The acting is decent, but that cannot make up for the severe boredom you will subject yourself to by watching this film.I fought to stay awake through this poor excuse of a movie hoping it would eventually have moments - it has very few.

Some nice colours, details.Audio quality: 4/5The English audio which is in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Dolby Stereo, i must say it sounds pretty good.

I will have to say, on top of all that, it's also up there with one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. A great movie to watch, and a great movie to think about later. Definitely worth owning and re-watching, you'll notice more symbolism, allegory, etc in it the more you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candyman, Candyman..............","review":"Candyman is a creepy and very scary horror movie. The first time i saw this i think i was like 11 maybe at a slumber party, i was so scared.

Helen Lyle is a writer working on a story about the Candyman, an urban legend in which if you say the name Candyman into the mirror five times, the Candyman comes to get you. So Helen goes about to prove that the urban legend isnt true and says Candyman five times in the mirror. Soon she is being stalked by the Candyman and she will live to regret her actions. Both Helen (played by Virgina Madsen I think?) and the Candyman (Tony Todd) are portrayed superbly.

Candyman.Her life begins to crumple around her as she's accused of 1st degree murder and kidnapping, and her husband reveals a devastating secret.Candyman is by far the best horror movie I've seen since Texas Chainsaw Massacre.There is gore, but not the kind that makes you gag. Its semi-subtle.Plus, acting from Madsen and Candyman Tony Todd is far above average.And the ending is fantastic. Gosh, I saw it a mile away but it still scared the crapper out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been waiting to see this one but...","review":"I love horror movies and this was one of the few that I haven't seen. The acting was okay, but the pacing was slow and it really didn't live up to the hype at all. Rent it first as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Think","review":"I remember the old reviews of this movie which was once called, \\"The scariest movie since Silence of the Lambs.\\" That reviewer must not watch many movies...and this must have been the first one they watched since watching Silence of the Lambs. This movie is not only NOT scary (even by older standards) I cringe at the idea that it is called a \\"horror classic,\\" This IS NOT a horror movie. A psychological thriller, maybe, but not a horror movie. Actually it would be a three-four star psych-thriller, but don't bill a movie as something it's not. This was a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I generally credit myself with being able to sit through just about any movie. But this was boring!

Avoid this movie at all cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Worth It","review":"This film is not worth buying unless you absolutely must own every horror flick out there.

It depicts the horrible living conditions of hard working individuals, due to a number of circumstances beyond their control.

He actually went through the entire time, and said he felt better afterwards. Any other dvd, he would have only lasted about 10 minutes.Then... I became sick, and didn't practice yoga for almost two months. This was a terrific practice for me, to get back into the swing of things. Not too hard, but a good stretch and flexibility session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this!","review":"I am a yoga instructor and I bought this DVD hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students. This DVD is NOT a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title!

In most of the movements she taught, this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion.Pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for special needs","review":"I got this one for my grandmother who has never exercised since her teens.

Eva Marie Pilapuf takes you through an hour of various warm up exercises and yoga poses. So many introductory Yoga vidoes are so challenging that they discourage prospective practitioners. Most people using this video, however, will not get outside their comfort zones doing these poses, but after the workout they will feel good about themselves from the activity and their accomplishments. Isn't that what Yoga should be all about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring in the extreme","review":"This video is a poorly-filmed, self-promoting, monotonous waste of money. And that's the \\"polite\\" version of my opinion. This DVD does not inspire me to do anything but shut it off before it annoys me further. It's a very long stretching session with almost no real yoga, and the \\"meditation\\" session is frankly jarring with these clanging bells that snap you out of any good place in which you might have had your mind.Try YogaZone or any other beginners' yoga, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT YOGA AT ALL","review":"This is a scam and a rip-off. This is a DVD of someone going through some motions, but not yoga. I wouldn't even call it calisthenics. Even a complete couch potato expends more energy than this woman does. Please don't be fooled by the title - even the most extreme of beginners deserve more than what this woman is offering. If I can give this a rating less than 0 stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a dud.","review":"I ordered this DVD. The program looked like it was what I was looking for esepecially after I read the reviews. Unfortunately the DVD I received is garbled and defective.

So here are some suggestions of things you could do with the book that will improve your birthing experience:- Cut it up and use it to make a paper mache belly cast- use it to start a bonfire in your backyard that you can use for your baby shower/BBQ- you can bite it during contractions- use it to clonk anyone on the head who tries to tell you idiotic things during birth like \\"that baby won't come down\\" or \\"your pelvis is too small\\". Also good for fighting off those unnecessary pelvic exams.

To Christian mamas out there, please research the author and the lack of support (renouncement) out there from the Christian community (esp the author's former church and Focus On The Famliy). Ezzo's advice is NOT the only Biblical way to birth/raise a child (in fact, I don't find it biblical at all in my research in the Word).

Our 2 daughters (2.5 years old, adopted as an infant and 6 months) thrive on the common sense, practical advice in this book. Both slept comfortably through the night by 8 weeks. Many people have commented that we are \\"so lucky\\" to have such happy, content and healthy children...it's not luck, it's the awesome and loving parenting skills learned from reading Babywise books! I can only assume the \\"one star\\" reviewers are just anti-Christian, anti-common sense folk who didn't actually read the books. Shame on them for giving false reviews of this exceptional series.

At first the girls are already topless introducing themselves. When they start to play they are already Naked. This tape could have been like each 10 points the team loses a top or something.

Xuanzang made his trip during a time of political unrest, as does Sun; both confront obstacles and both come to understand Buddhism and themselves better for their encounters with others on the way. I found myself checking how many pages left and eyeing my next read with increasing frequency as the book progressed: never a good sign! Readers interested in Buddhism would find this book informative and enjoyable; readers with less of a fascination might find it somewhat repetitive and a bit slow.

The editor even writes in the introduction that he is taking a look at Nazism with an \\"elementary morality.\\" It is quite disturbing to see how many historians actually feel morally obligated to condemn Hitler instead of using fact to illustrate his thoughts and actions.

There is a love story which flows in the middle of the book, but I don't think this was truly fully developed (the reason for the 4 stars). I did enjoy the technology and the frightening (and almost too-real) look at what the future holds, or may hold for us in the real world.

And Emily's brother, the duke, just a real jerk along with the rest of the brothers and his romance with Jane was like what romance? Since when is yelling and frowing and disliking someone a romance! Jared's reason for keeping his little girl a secret was realistic and if Emily or the Aunt was smartly involved in spying, etc, well, she should have understood.

It really does help understand the process of living in the moment and feeling the energetic effects of simply being.The author describes the journey that this book represents not as being a \\"how-to\\" guide for Reiki, but as a \\"why-to.\\" Narrin truly feels that Reiki cannot be adequately described, and therefore she leaves that to the reader to find their own Reiki experience. Thus, the book is left to be a journey into understanding the tangible, real-life benefits of approaching life holistically and with intention.I strongly reccomend this book to everyone, not just Reiki practitioners. It will honestly enrich our human experience. Jus the author's personal story related in the book is wonderful, and it is so nice to see a Reiki book that isn't regurgitating the same information as every other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tasting Protein Bar","review":"I have this bar with a cup of coffee as well. It's a great tasting protein bar, that goes well with any diet..very filling, and bigger then most of the other brand bars out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a much better version of this concert also for sale on amazon","review":"Every cut on this CD is truncated from the original concert. This album was produced in Germany and apparently has had more than one distributor. TIM the international music company, Acrobat, and Prism Platinum, all containing the same 8 tracks and all sold on Amazon.. There are five or six albums out there with the title. \\"Take Five\\" probably hoping to capitolize on the best selling single of that name from the \\"Time Out\\" album. The better version of this music is to be found on the Take 5 Quartet: A Jazz Hour With Dave Brubeck Quartet\\" imported from Portugal. This album contains the full length recordings and adds a bonus track from Cannes, France as track 9. It's UPC number is 8712177036998 if you care to search for it, or look under my reviews. I wonder if Dave made a nickel out of any of these imports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gray's best (not even that good)","review":"It is obvious that Gray spends more time counseling married couples than singles. His understanding of the differences between the genders seems sound enough, but it is obvious he has not been a part of the dating scene for some time. All of his books require some generalizations to meet the needs of so large an audience, but much of his advice in this particular book is so oversimplified as to not be practical. I have enjoyed (and would recommend) some of his other books, but this one doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK to browse through, but don't buy into the stereotypes","review":"This book is definitely written from the point of view of a man, and 75% of the \\"do\\"s and \\"don't\\"s are directed towards women - very disappointing. It has a few good points about general behaviour of men and women, some of which you may not have thought about. My biggest objection with the book is the over-generalization of the behavior of people based on their gender. I'm a dating woman and I don't associate with most of the supposed behaviors described in the book. My guess is that most readers won't either. We are all complex individuals based on genetic and environmental makeup. It is absurd to think that there are only two general categories of behavior models for our population!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my \\"handbook\\"","review":"Mars and Venus on a Date is the first John Gray book I've read. Having been widowed a year and a half and being back in the world of dating, I found that this book was very helpful to find the kind of relationship I'm looking for. There were so many parts of the book that I wanted to refer to, I got out my yellow highlighter, and now view this book as a sort of 'handbook' of dating. I have a better understanding of how men think, and how women think, and the mistakes many women (myself included) seem to make in an effort to find their \\"soul mate.\\" I highly recommend this book to anyone who just don't seem to be getting anywhere in the world of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad image for amazon","review":"I am very disappointed. I bought this book more than a month ago and have not gotten it yet, I do not even know if I will ever get it. I sent an email to the seller but did not get an answer. The seller was LittleBella..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at first, then offensive","review":"The first 2/3 of the book was OK, with balanced \\"points of view\\" and \\"how-to's\\" for both men and women. Some of the information was interesting, explanatory, and useful; some was not.But then the author began giving unbalanced treatment, primarily telling women how they ought to behave and what they ought to say. The message was that a man has a large and fragile ego, and that a woman should support his ego. She should never disagree with him, except \\"playfully\\". In public, she should paint him as a white knight, regardless of what really happened.Perhaps it was just the author's writing style, but most of his examples, supposedly of real couples he'd observed or counseled, seemed made-up.Finally, at the end of the book, the author insults the reader's intelligence with an idiotic, redundant, and unnecessary list of 101 places to look for a mate. Very patronizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men: don't bother","review":"Another installment in the continuing saga of Kiss Her Butt Enough and You Might Get Lucky. It would be nice if these authors who write \\"you're right--he's wrong\\" books for women would not represent them as being beneficial for both sexes. A better title for this one might be \\"Women Should Always Get Their Way\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to review","review":"I received another title in this series instead of the one I ordered. Therefore, I cannot provide any direct feedback for this title.I did glance at the other book (Starting Over after divorce) and it seemed very high-level and did not provide any deep insight into life after divorce that I had not seen in other sources. It is fine for someone who has not done any reading on the topic, but not worth the time/money for someone who has read other texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generalizations with no supporting data","review":"John Gray certainly sounds convincing as he outlines for us the roles men and women must play in order to successfully navigate the dating game. But the roles he proposes are just too rigid to be realistic. He attempts to convince us that the man must be the pursuer and the woman the pursued, with little supporting evidence to back up his claims, aside from testimonials of people attending his seminars and clinics. This book ranks up there with \\"The Rules\\" for moving male/female relations back into the dark ages. Believe it or not, Dr. Gray, there are men out there who admire a woman who goes after what she wants, even in relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Gray Makes Dating a Game - Count Me Out","review":"New to dating after years in a marriage made me uncomfortable so I bought this book. There's a few enlightening segments that make sense but most of the book relegates dating to being a game that is played between man and woman. I would like to think that someone is attracted to who I am from the start. I consider myself an educated woman and frankly, some of what Dr. Gray suggests I say or do to get a positive response from men is downright degrading. I would hope that men are attracted my intelligence and would like the fact that I can solve some problems and give some good advice. I guess I just don't like the fact that Dr. Gray wants men to stay the way they were before the women's movement and wants women to bat their eyelashes and ooh/aah a man to her web. That's what this seemed like to me. Count me out of it. I am doing pretty well in the dating scene without this type of stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty... bad","review":"While not completely devoid of value, this book relies heavily on vastly simplified gender stereotypes. This alone is some sketchy stuff, but the writer seems to insist on an incredibly unhealthy sounding relationship dynamic which can be boiled down to \\"men are happy when they serve women successfully and women are happy when they are served by men\\". If women were actually half as fitlessly narcissistic as this book portrays them to be then it'd be time to go gay, fellas.There are a few pieces of insight to be gleaned from this book, but with many much better books floating around there's no need to spend time on this thing and its trite cliches rehashed in psychobabble smoke and mirrors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Stay away from this one! I read the whole thing, including the 101 suggestions mentioned by an earlier reviewer. I considered a few of his suggestions to be common sensical, but they were unfortunately few and far between. Primarily, he promotes tired sex-role stereotypes and preachy, opinionated pop-psychology. IMHO he creates more problems than he solves, suggesting that you present a fairly artificial side of yourself until the person you've attracted has committed to you for life. Following his formulae are sure to leave both you and your partner bewildered later, as the true nature which you withheld from each other emerges."},{"rating":"1","title":"promotes stereotypical behavior","review":"This is a rehash of his first book, with \\"tips\\" on how to attract a date. However, his system seems to be based on antiquated, stereotypical, gender-biased behaviors that i believe are destructive and deceptive. For example, he recommends being cheery and upbeat at the beginning of a relationship then-whammo!-letting your true self out after the attraction is established. Not good advice, if you ask me! Stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Mechanically Go Through Life's Most Natural Process","review":"I bought the book when I was seeing someone and it doesn't help! It's so mechanical. This thing about you \\"just know\\" when someone is right for you is the only part of the book that makes any sense because Dr. Gray can't explain it. You can either buy the book and fumble through the dating process or you can just fumble through the dating process till you \\"just know\\". According to Dr. Gray, there are 5 steps in the dating process. I suggest that there are 1001 ways to live without this book and find the right partner anyway.John, if you read this, please know that I understand you're trying to help people through the dating process and I know you can do a better job than \\"Mars & Venus on a Date\\". I still find your original Mars & Venus outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Info.","review":"John Gray offers some important information that can be overlooked in men/women relationships. In this \\"PC\\" world we live in it isn't polite to say that men and women are different, but we are. And this book has some interesting insights into our differences. It has helped me to not take it so personal when men say and do (or don't say or do as the case may be) things that can be offensive. This book helps me to forgive and love the men in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and boreing","review":"good examples of differences between men and women, but book could have been written on half the paper used to make the book! It seemed like it took forever to read this boreing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I read this book 15 years ago!!","review":"I have always fought the idea that men and women are inherently different and for the longest time refused to read any of John Grey's books. However, dating someone I thought \\"was perfect for me\\" for only a couple of months, I found myself going through yet another hurtful breakup. Wondering what I could have done differently, I found this book in a bookstore and began browsing through it. To my suprise, I found this speaking to exactly what I should have known all along! Now, about to turn 40 and still single, I find myself giving alot of this advice to my college-age neices. Im on-line ordering it for them now -- so they don't have to go through the same experiences of looking for Prince Charming the same way I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!","review":"John Gray is laughing all the way to the bank as he continues to crank out book after book that says the same thing. Everything he knows about realtionships, sex, men and women could have been put in his first book. He couldn't care less if you're helped by his book- he's just gouging people who roam the self-help aisles looking for a quick fix. There were some good points in his first book, but enough already!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn to Trust Your Instincts","review":"I was very, very disappointed with this book-on-tape, after having read \\"Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\\" (which I'd give 5 stars). Gray seems to be saying that men and women should pretend or act differently from what their gut tells them about themselves. The switch from promoting UNDERSTANDING of the \\"other sex\\" to giving advice on TRYING TO BE OTHER THAN WHO YOU ARE is not the direction I would have expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, practical guide for dating","review":"It's funny how there are so many books out there written for men to teach them how to win over a woman while dating her, yet not many books written for couples who want to have a meaningful dating experience that could lead to so much more. Thankfully a trusted relationship espert, John Gray, wrote one. I've enjoy and benefited from John's books for years. This one was no exception. I really appreciated how he explained the \\"stages\\" couples go through while dating. It takes away confusion and fear of the future. While my partner hasn't read the book, I have applied what John suggests to our relationship. I am much more at peace and am enjoying myself much more than I did when I was constantly worried about where my relationship was going and if I should brace myself for disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A time honored classic","review":"I am a Mars Venus Counselor in the Boston area. I teach it, I know it, I love it, but the real story is that people who have read this and other Mars Venus books find amazing relevancy in John Gray's ability to share his wisdom. In Mars & Venus on a Date, you have established guidelines that WILL help you to be successful. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful, but...","review":"This book was very insightful in many areas, but it seemed to have a lot of repetition. Also, Dr. Gray failed to give any mention or acknowlegement toward interracial and intercultural relationships. (I am a white male dating an asian female, BTW.)Aside from that, Dr. Gray did an excellent job. For guys, I also strongly recommend \\"Women: Maxim's Unauthorized Guide.\\" I don't think it's available here, but if you mix Dr. Gray with the writers of Maxim Magazine, you really can't go wrong. Best of luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stages worth learning","review":"I believe Dr. Gray wants people to better understand the differences between men and women, how we react to situations differently and how to accept these differences. Take from this book what you like and discard what you find not applicable to your situation. Gray uses many generalizations that I did not agree with but I still found the book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide","review":"This is a great guide to help narrow down the possibilities. It has great insight and I found it to be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Words that Stick With Me","review":"Glad I got this and read it- over a decade to start up again.

The overall production quality is top notch, the audio is great, and it is visually appealing. It has the look and feel of a very intimate performance. I think the editing was great. Rather than a lot of quick cuts and panning of the audience, the focus is on the performers for the most part. Also, unlike another reviewer, I felt that the dancers (which were used sparingly) added a visual element that enhanced those particular songs. And, with the exception of \\"Shining Star\\", which was a bit altered, all the other songs were true to their original recordings. The bottom line is that this is a very entertaining DVD and would be cherished by any EWF fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their greatest hits in one DVD","review":"I missed Maurice White, but I think the band is sounding as good and as powerful as ever. I think the dancers could have been ommited (this probably is one addition from their Las Vegas show, and don't get me wrong, the girls are beautiful and good dancers but unnecessary), and the ego of Philip Bailey minimized (just look at him and you will know what I mean) to leave room for other members to shine. My kids have listened to their music for years but now that they have seen them, they like EWF more.

Even though he has had it for a few years and can read books that are more difficult he still enjoys this one. It's the story of a class that is planning to exchange pen-pal letters with an other school. But there is much more to the story . It teaches about learning to get to know someone before you prejudge them and how boys and girls can become friends. It also is about friends, bullies, and maintaining friendships out side of school with writing. It's a really great book. The art work is charming and my son thinks it's a scream! This would be a good book for either boys or girls. I feel it is also a good transition from books with only a few words per page to longer books. Even though there are 48 pages there are color pictures on everypage so it isn't intimidating.

Broken hearts and business don't mix well; risking love could hurt the family business as well as their love, or so Destiny's business obsessed nephew believes. Nonetheless, love delayed is not be to love denied as they take a second chance on it.** Despite the nice aspect of having a hero and heroine who are extremely young and the hopeful air that the message that it's not too late conveys, there was something less than engaging to the tale, making it hard to hold focus on it. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite romantic comedies","review":"I'm not from New York, but there's just something about this movie. The small parts alone almost make it worth a watch... Megan Mullaly (now on \\"Will & Grace\\") as a drunken bar conquest, Richard Kind (of \\"Mad About You\\" and currently on \\"Spin City\\") as a partygoer, Todd Field (Nick Nightingale in \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and the most unexplained/useless character in \\"The Haunting\\") as Cecil.I loved Mantegna's ability to get by on attitude (\\"I can work with that\\" - \\"box seats, the Mets, tonight\\"), Jamie Lee Curtis' cameo, Linda Fiorentino's ability to make \\"backed up anger\\" sound like \\"back tabanga\\", John Malkovich with a shotgun... and Tom Waits' character of Monte is one of the most loveable onscreen scuzzballs you'll find.It's not a movie you love for the continuity of plot or the great acting throughout.

Although this attempts to be an ensemble piece such as The Big Chill, I found some of the characters difficult to believe: Kevin Bacon's character (not his performance, which was fine) shouldn't have been able to pick up the woman in the bar, yet he did. Maybe if I were from New York I'd believe it more. If someone wants to watch this for a particular actor, Joe Mantegna seemed to me to be the most central character, although it isn't evident from the description or cast list. In the same spirit, female fans of John Malkovich looking to see him in yet another sex role should be forewarned that his character is gay. I haven't ruined the film for you by saying so, however, since it comes as no surprise in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringe-Inducing","review":"This movie is lame, lame, lame.

Anyway, we'd sort of hoped the movie would be ok, but after the reviews (or pre-hype, don't remember exactly now) we knew it would be just awful. And it was. It was Tony's personal love song to his old neighborhood, but with every cliche and stereotype there is. Joe Mantegna was about 20 years too old for the part.

Right after the warranty expired (month 13) the pc started to overheat and shut down automatically. I called HP and they said they cannot do anything since the warranty expired. So basically I cannot do anything with this pc because it overheats just by turning it on.

Her plans to sightsee get derailed when Marjorie turns up dead and Jessica is the prime suspect!I really enjoyed this novel. The mystery was great and kept me guessing till the end.

I felt that I had read it before, but was confused because it stated she had just met Inspector Sutherland. I knew that she had met him before thru previous novels. Also, the title was one that had been used in previuos series. Now I found out that it is a reissue. The book should have stated this. The credit page did state that April 2000 was the first Signet printing but should have stated it was a reissue. This is what has bothered me.

My daughter is 6 years old and my son is 9, both are fascinated with dinosaurs. My wife and I played the game with our children, and i must say, that was one of the best activities we shared with our kids. I thought the game had an interesting angle of each one of us becoming a different dinosaur, and competing with each other, we definitely had our unique personalities and virtues. we were kidding each other for days later. The children remembered so much about different kinds of dinosaurs, their eating habits, their natural habitats and the challenges they faced to survive. It is rare to see a game which is so much fun and educational at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and more!","review":"As a science teacher, I'm always on the lookout for fun games that reinforce concepts. This game is fun-- my 3rd graders love it (and older: former students remembered the game three years later and asked to borrow it to play on a 6th grade free day!). It also teaches good science concepts, unlike many board games that have a science title but then just have the \\"roll and move\\" approach that has nothing to do with the concepts. Herbivores, carnivores, habitat, reproduction rate, natural disasters, speed and strength all affect your survival in this game! It used to be available only at specialty toy stores-- I'm glad to see it available here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome educational game!","review":"My 4 year-old, now 5 year old, loves this game.

I had no idea what a life-changing book this would be for me. Bunny Wilson,the author, does an incredible job of detailing her life of bitterness and rebellion due to a lack of unconditional love from her mother. She shows with vivid word pictures that betrayals can lead to bitterness which is like a crying, whining, baby. The only way she could stop this cycle of bitterness and rebellion which was being passed to her own children was through unconditional love. The most impressive thing I felt she said in the book was that she was demanding something that her mother didn't have to give - unconditional love, a gift her mother had not been given. If you've ever been hurt or betrayed in some way, this book will help you see how to get through without becoming bitter.

My feeling is that people tend to overpraise Rushdie's novels as a kind of celebration for having plodded through them. How depressing to spend a week of your life laboring through a narrative that just ultimately wallows in the fetid stink of its own self-absorption. Rushdie doesn't allow his characters to reveal themselves to us, electing instead to drool words, relentlessly, carelessly, sloppily, mercilessly. He tells us everything without ever showing what it's like to be one of his characters. For a novel purportedly grand in scope, this one feels suspiciously like navel-gazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I ever bother","review":"Salman Rushdie is a spent force.

Rushdie's writing is pitched at a variety of consitituencies: the PC crowd, the feminists, and so on. But great writing cannot emerge without a strong focus and consistency in purpose. I re-read this book last night and was sorely disappointed. I'd say that \`Satanic Verses' is Rushdie's best book.While Rushdie plays to the gallery he has alienated most spectators.

As an Irish person the idea of reality and dreamworld is not a difficult one to grapple with. I wonder is it a function of being post colonial or specifically post British empire. Irish poets and singers for generations lived and wrote in dreamworlds of their own.This century saw many writers emerge that share the same kind of compulsions and radical rethink of the novel that Salman seems to espouse.As rich as a rich novel can be and full of the wonderful sense of humour that sets him apart.I can not wait to read the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the fan","review":"This is not an easy read.

The reading is however a bit harsh and takes some getting used to. Overall, however, the book is spellbinding with some memorable characters and remarks: O' falsely foul, foully false love !One thing that did leave me puzzled was the fact that the Moor, who is narrating the story, is so well versed in the english language considering that he didn't even attend school properly, according to the book.

Far from the Jihad against him being his only claim to fame, this book solidifies it. I have not read such a wonderfully sarcastic, funny, and intelligent book in quite a while. Perhaps Rushdie figures himself to be another James Joyce to a smaller degree, using quite many different langauges. Luckily, I have close Indian friends and have been raised in Europe, so I humbly submit that I can read through this book whole (and laugh all the way!). Some of my friends have found this book hard reading but I think it is merely a fact of getting used to the style of writing that Rushdie employs.

Not as enjoyable, for me, as Midnight's Children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exuberant prose","review":"Rushdie, like Nabokov and Joyce, musters an acute sense of the sound of words. While character development tends to fall prey to thematic exposition, the joy of listening to his words spill out from the page (one can't read \\"The Moor's Last Sigh\\" without hearing it) propels the story to its breathless conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, funny, an immense and lovely experience","review":"This book is quite simply one of the best I have ever read. Amazingly well-written, witty, expansive and amazingly accessible, it is modern literature at its very finest. This is the first Rushdie book that I have read, and I am sorry it took me so long to take a second look at this controversial writer. I enjoyed it greatly and look forward to reading the rest of the Rushdie books. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh . . .","review":"I began this book 3 times before I was able to penetrate Rushdie's language enough to make it past the first 5 pages. But once I got to reading it in earnest, I couldn't put it down. The only thing I ever knew about the author was through all the controversy around the Satanic Verses. The whole thing sounded scary and political to me. I never realized what a beautiful and poetic writer he is. Reading this book was like having a love affair- it left me with a light head and a full belly.The Moor's Last Sigh has left me hungry for more Rushdie. Read this book with a clear head.

I even pressed down as hard as I could with a cast iron lid on it and no dice. I also did not taste any grill flavors at all.My stove is electric but that should not matter, it still gets hot. I am very disappointed in this pan, no wonder it's on sale for such a great price,however the price that you pay for it is still to much money.

It's very high quality and an excellent size for a small dog.Please Note: If you are planning on using this in your REAR seat, you will need to have an adjustable headrest (as shown in the graphic here for the product. If you look closely at the picture, you will see that this item comes with a \\"backboard\\" which is great for a front bucket seat but in the rear, if you do not have the aforementioned headrest, you will not be able to secure this seat and because of the backboard (non detachable), you will not be able to even rig it.That said, I like this item very much, as does my Pap. It's very comfy and certainly is a 'snap' to set up, as a previous reviewer noted.The manufacturer is shipping these with a stronger and thicker connector for the top assemblage that is indeed better and more secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful that you have the right sized car seat for this product.","review":"Have the wrong-sized bucket seats, I guess. This booster seat won't lay flush against the back of car seat; this will cause the booster seat to tip over as there's nothing to support the booster. Called the company asking about return policy (had free shipping). They claimed I'd have to pay the shipping charge ($20 plus) to send the product back, which is nearly half the purchase price. Not a good deal. Be sure the booster seat will fit flat inside the contours of your bucket seat. It may be well worth your time to take careful measurements. Hope this review was useful. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It BROKE!!!","review":"Overall I like this dog seat and my dog ,Romeo, an 8.5 LB. pomeranian loves the seat. However after 3 weeks one of the clips that hold the top strap of the dog seat to the car seat broke and my dog went flying out of the car seat and ended up hanging by his harness to the leash holder on the car seat.

I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Sadie who now weighs 17 pounds. I bought this delux car seat when she was just a little puppy and she still fits in it. However she's a little squished when she tries to lie down now that she is full grown, but there's still plenty of room when she sits up and is just cruising. So I bought the larger one and keep it in the back seat for her when my boyfriend and I are in the front seat, but when he's not with us I whip this one out of the trunk. It's so easy to just put over the head rest, and she jumps in the car and uses the console arm rest as a stepping stool to get into it. She really loves to go cruising and look out the window. We live in Hawaii and I especially like the fact that the shipping was free! I loved this so much I bought a spare one when the price dropped just in case this one broke or went out of stock.

If this is the case, it should not be advertised as item #62291 because it is not that item. This is false advertising.

I'm not so sure it was worth the price..... I think $25 would have been more reasonable. Half the asking price, but then I saw the others offered at that price and I don't think they were as nice.

Assembly and installation took me a little longer than expected, despite reading the directions. The booster was installed in the backseat of a Honda CRV, so I don't have to move it when I have another passenger. It doesn't seem overly sturdy and I am not sure about the 18lb. weight limit. My doxie wears a collar. The seat has a nylon strap with a snap connector to secure your dog in the seat. Well, my doxie managed to twist herself about and chew through the nylon strap, all the while I was driving to my location. When I arrived at my destination, she was no longer tied, but fortunately remained in the seat. I have since purchased thin chain, still using the snap connector and threw out the nylon strap. My doxie likes the seat and I know she can't chew through the chain. I'll wait to see if she will need a larger seat, but this one has worked well so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"My dog almost strangled herself trying to turn around in this.

The seat I received is just like the one I purchased at a pet store and returned because it does not work in the back seat because you can not get the bottom strap around the back of the back seat. It might work in the front seat but my wife is not going to ride in the back seat so the dog can ride in the front seat.

Then you get accepted in the Corleone family, and even get to talk to the DON himself.

Some of the missions were interesting (ex: trip to see the movie director), but after you complete all the missions, you must take control of all safehouses, hubs, businesses, etc. It really gets redundant: all of the clubs, brothels, hotels, etc. are exactly alike! Also, I think the chronology of the game would be confusing for someone who has never seen the Godfather before. I would have loved to do a Hyman Roth mission or a \\"Kill Fredo\\" mission lol.. Overall, I think the game is a HUGE disappointment. Please DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Oh yeah, I really felt like the game was GTA Godfather style.. only GTA is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"how many grand theft auto games do we need, exactly?","review":"if you've played grand theft auto, you've played this game. which i guess is good if you really love GTA and want to keep playing it again and again. it's the same even down to the map and having a safehouse. \\"bully\\" was a GTA ripoff too, but at least it had new interesting characters and story.. it would be nice if they made a godfather game in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is horrible!","review":"Can you say repetitive? The game starts out fun. Admittedly I had a great time extorting businesses for money and raiding the factories of rival families. Then I came to the realization that the level design is absolutely the same for every type of building. When taking over a factory by force you can expect the same enemy pattern every single time. On the bright side the graphics aren't bad. With exception to the cars the game controls great. The cars are way too slow and steering is cumbersome. Rent this one. You'll enjoy the first few hours then come to your senses and realize that EA is simply trying to capitalize on the popularity of the Godfather license."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Glitch (not anymore)","review":"During high speed chases the road would suddenly vanish from beneath the vehicle resulting in losing and having to start over again. When I slowed down during the same chase I would still lose because the other vehicle got too far ahead of me. I bought this game NEW, and factory sealed. The collectors addition. I still think it's a good game but I am going to have to return it because of the glitch. *UPDATE* I did return the game in exchange for another of the same. The glitch I mentioned before is not on the replaced game! May have been that the previous game had encountered the glitch during its process (a rarity) at the factory. Overall score now is 4 out of 5 STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"the game hype try to infuse, then to be ana##@ defused!!!!!!!!!","review":"this game is miserably ok to flat out sucks!!!!!!!! dont get me wrong, i love the godfather, but is nowhere near the movie..whats up with the character customization?? i think its a bad idea....if you were from another race or origin rather than italian,you know don corleone will be giving you the boot!!another thing is you see one building, you see them all!!!! they all look alike...!!! mafia \\"the game\\" was way better and it can be purchased for like 10 bucks i think??? official x-box magazine rates the godfather a 7.5...being not the best!! its not just me....lets hope scarface makes up for such a mess!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get the game to load.","review":"You know I would give this game a good review, if I could..you know...

I have tried this game on 4 different PS2's so it's not just mines. This game I feel is defective.I can't take it back because BX policy states \\"any opened video game and/or system can not be returned/refunded\\" SO basically I'm screwed. I wouldn't sell the game to anyone because I would feel bad. So I have a game that I can't play.Let's compare: I have Socom 3, and the disc looks like it was buffed with sandpaper, and it PLAYS.

I'm a new fan of loose tea leaves and invested in this product not knowing what I was in for. But it's absolutely fantastic.

I bought 2 of these; one was for my office and the other for my house. This tea ball is hideously cheap and I'm expecting it to snap apart any day now. The latch to close it seems dangerous. You can probably slice a piece of your finger off if you're not paying attention. The quality of the mesh seems cheap and I'm almost afraid it's some kind of cheap, dangerous metal and not something safe to be steeping in hot water. I should have taken the trip to Bed, Bath & Beyond to be able to check out other types of tea balls before getting this model. I won't argue about the fact that it's big. It fits a lot of tea leaves in it. But its quality is lacking and there are definitely better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Tea Ball","review":"Got this bad boy home and made some Tea.

I found that, unlike the way most clippers are designed, these have a small metal pin that holds the lever in place. This pin does not stay in very well. I have only used them a few times and found the pin had slipped almost completely out. Even when I pushed it back in it slid in with no effort so I know it will not stay together very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward to use","review":"I don't like these at all! They are nice and sharp, but the part of the handle that you press down on in order to actually clip gets caught on the rest of the handle if it isn't lined up absolutely perfectly. The problem is that when you're trying to deal with tiny wiggly little fingers, it's hard to keep this part from swiveling slightly off center. You try to clip, and it gets stuck yet again. They're a pain to use. The handle needs to have a much wider channel for the top part to fit in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"These clippers came pre-packaged with other baby safety items. They are very tiny, which I know is because babies have small fingernails, but because they are so small, I have to cut each nail twice; once on each side. If you have ever cut a baby's nails before, you know how hard it is to line up the clippers just once, not to mention twice. They also don't really cut completely through the nail. They will weaken it, but then you have to pull the nail off with your fingers to get it completely off. Because of this, there are a lot of jagged edges left that can scratch up my baby's face."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok product., but very nervious to use it.","review":"It does it's job. However, it's very sharp and I cut my baby's finger twice. The problem is it's very small and hard to see my baby's finger nail. It always make me very nervious everytime I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, but leave the nails soooo sharp!","review":"These clippers work fine, the only problem for me is that they leave the nail edge a bit jagged and very, very sharp. I don't have this problem with other clippers I've used, just these. My baby winds up scratching herself and me. I think the First Years clippers w/ magnifying glass is a lot better for smoothing the nail while clipping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't cut it","review":"We have had a very disappointing experience with this product. It just does not perform well. The blades appear to be dull even when brand-new, and there is very little leverage produced on the clipping lever to make the necessary clips, even pushed all the way down against the plastic shell. In fact, these clippers clip so poorly that they are actually dangerous to use on a baby.Perhaps what we have experienced is limited to the unit that we have received. Either way, we are very disappointed in what we have purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sharp","review":"I hate using this product to cut my infants nails the blade, it is too sharp!! Also i feel like its too big to really get in there. II like the whit first years nail clipper much better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best clippers to cut little hands!","review":"We received about three or four different nail clippers as gifts and I had them stored all over the house and in diaper bags so we always had them readily available. On a whim (after reading customer reviews on Amazon), I purchased a pair of these right before our daughter was born. They have become our 'go-to' pair of clippers. I need to purchase more so my husband and I aren't always asking where we placed them last! They are really easy to use for adult hands, most others are small to use. Also - we like that these aren't smooth (so our fingers don't slip off while we're cutting her nails). It has a coating to keep your fingers and hand in place. Highly Recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good surfing, bad everything else","review":"Although the actual surfing footage in this film was awesome, most everything else was pretty disappointing. I was not that into the soundtrack, but I would be ok with that if the sound quality didn't totally suck. The narration is fuzzy and generally too quiet to be heard over the music. Not well mixed. Also, did not find the fake phone calls and gimicks entertaining. There's a lot of potential, but somebody botched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good film but lacks in depth.","review":"It seems like there are so many \\"surf films\\" being produced lately that are throw togethers for magazine promotions. there is nothing really special about this dvd ... grat surfing footage but nothing you can't find accompanying magazines for free (price of the mag.Sorry... not a hater, just didn't think it was that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK","review":"I bought this single simply for the two unreleased songs, C'mon people I already own from the album, \\"Make a wish\\" is a decent effort, it's a song you could just relax and listen to without much emotion, and the other track is a remix of Song for the Lovers, it's also decent, there are no lyrics in this one, just effects mixed up.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good lesson in shoestring budget movie making.","review":"This movie has become a late-night favorite of Cinemax and the USA Network's \\"Up All Night.\\" Filmed in 1991 in Austin, TX, this ultra-low-budget comedy was a multiple nominee in the 1994 Drive-In Movie Academy Awards (\\"The Hubbies\\"), and is great viewing for anyone interested in creating or otherwise involving themselves in the area of low-budget movie making. When that wears thin, there are always \\"catgirls\\" to look at. The important lesson aspiring filmmakers should derive from this movie is what it looks like on screen when blue filters are used on the camera lens to simulate nightime during daylight shots (i.e., scrape up the extra money and BUY SOME LIGHTS). As a final note, this Troma Team release is well worth the price as a collector's item alone -- Lance Henry's feature film speaking-role debut as \\"The Paperboy\\" is only sure to rise in price. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Alot of Troma movies are out of print and its hard to find them at a good price. Teenage Catgirls in Heat is one of those movies and it hovers around the 40 dollars for a copy of the movie. Dont worry, your not missing too much. The movie is hard to see because its dark most of the movie and so what if there are naked girls. There is alot of better looking naked girls in other Troma films. All in all, a disappointment and im glad I didnt pay 40 bucks for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, very sad","review":"The DVD was a lot better than the movie it contained. The movie could have been soooo much better (more of the girls would have been a good start), but the extra's almost made up for the price.

Therefore, anything she has to say on the subject of living a Christian life is just so much hot air.

Possibly as a result, the pieces are short and light. The author is influenced by early 20th-century British authors who would write about pastoral things like landscapes and such. The book is divided into two parts: the first is a fact-based fictional account of individuals at a 19th-century fort in Colorado, the second part is a collection of essays on modern and historical topics. This book had a great essay on Walt Whitman's possible racism toward Natives and a wonderful essay on the vulgarity of Mount Rushmore. Nevertheless, I didn't particularly enjoy this work. ... If I met this author in person, something tells me he would be one of the coolest, most progressive guys around. But I didn't care for this particular text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appeals to the emotions, not to the mind","review":"I was disappointed with this book, because the author maintains that one man \\"decided to save\\" the city from bankruptcy and self-destruction. There are simpler and, at the same time, more sophisticated explanations. I'll indicate two here: a city's unsustainable finances are, well, unsustainable. A financial crisis necessitates a remedy, so that any remedy was imposed is no surprise. Second, the entire economy performed well in the 1990's, so the fact that Philadelphia did comparatively well coming out of the modest recession of the early 1990's is, again, no big surprise.There are some nicely crafted segments of this book, and there are pleny of hastily crafted segments. For readers who like vignettes about real people, there are a handful of those. Readers who would have preferred some thoughtful observations or commentary on political economy should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth","review":"This is easily the least literate book I've read in quite a while.

I was born and raised within 30 miles of Philadelphia and now live in Houston, and this book drained my emotions about the city I still think of as home as well as my new home. In showing how Ed Rendell used all of his character and will to turn the city around, and also demonstrating how he was powerless in many of his attempts to achieve reform, Bissinger proves that Rendell fought the good fight and that others must as well if our cities are to be saved. His final chapter, on the fate of the city's Navy yard, pulses with human drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful serenade to the city","review":"As a student at Philadelphia's University of Pennsylvania, I'm an immigrant to Philadelphia from Los Angeles. I came here with a deep hatred of the place. Everything seemed worse: the weather, the harsh edge of West Philadephia, and the clamor of urban life.Two years later I still held many of these feelings -- until I read this book. I finished it in about three sittings. Bissinger is a journalist, but this book really isn't a history of the city (although my knowledge of historic and present Philadelphia was greatly supplemented by reading it). It's an homage to former Mayor Rendell, his aides, and many of the working-class characters in the city. Bissinger has a remarkable penchant for creating heroes out of normal people.

Plus, it is an insult to people in the military. Military members are supposed to help the community, not hurt the community! I find it creepy-very creepy. I felt something weird come over me in this movie. I also felt very defiled after I had watched it. However, I do appreciate that it expresses how God has power over satan (his name should not be capitalized.) This is the worst movie that I have seen Cloud Ten Pictures produce.

This attractive little novel tells the story of Josefina and her family in 1824. The book will make an effective integration with discussions about US history regarding Mexican trade in the US, Indian blankets, weaving, and textiles. The book provides a project for tie-dying a shirt using onions. This book has the potential to quickly engage students with US history in a personal way. The novel may prompt students to write their own novel.

In the book, the grandmother dies and sails around on a ship. This gives children the impression that when people die, they go on a boat ride and eventually return.This book is very confusing for young children.

The kitchen aid replaces my old bread machine that I uses strictly for making dough. The old bread machine only made a single batch at a time and with my sparkly Kitchen Aid I can make up to a triple batch of dough at a time.

Shot in gritty home video style, the film is deeply personal and compelling. Weaving childhood videos of Zachary's father, along with his grandparents and family friends, the story is told through their shock, their sadness, their anger. A creative approach to letting a story tell itself, this documentary is well done and nothing if not incites greater need to fight for swift justice and children's rights.

I could not find from printed literature if the M66 center hard steel layer that makes the cutting edge would rust or not.

This may not be important to some who are used to rustable carbon steel but I like fully rust free tools. Otherwise I like this knife, good fit and finish, comfortable handle, very sharp, OK balance.

It was good for about one year. On the outside its BEAUTIFUL but the inside started to rust. I have to admit that after I make tea I can't get every drop of hot water out, so water does stay at the bottom, which is possibly what caused this. But unless you have the time to dry it out each time you use it I would not recommend this product.

However, the spout cap on the second one was defective/crooked (cap would not close properly so it would not whistle), so we replaced it with a third one (identical to the other two). We've had it only a month and a spring has emerged from the underside of the spout cap keeping it from closing. Three defective kettles in a row is just too much. From our experienced, and from the experiences described by other reviewers, it is pretty clear KitchenAid has an uncorrected quality control problem on this unit.

I love the color and we've no complaint with the whistle, nor have we had pouring problems. You do have to use a pot holder on the handle because the heat-resistant silicone only covers the top and bottom leaving the sides of the very hot metal handle open to the hand grasping it; clearly a design problem. In addition the silicone on the lever of the spout cover has split and is separating from the metal creating another source of possible burns, and this one is not easily rectified by use of a pot holder. A disappointing product from Kitchenaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I have had the worst luck with this tea kettle. It is very cute and looks great on the stove, but there are so many problems with it that I threw it away this morning. First of all, neither the lid nor the spout fit tightly, so steam escapes around the lid, making it hard to grasp the handel and pour the water. Speaking of pouring the water, it pours terribly. Maybe I should have filled the kettle more, but I don't like to wait to boil more water than I need. You have to tilt the kettle so much to get any water out of it. It sputters a lot too. And last week it stopped whistling altogether. I've had it about 3 months. I guess looks aren't everything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 6 months","review":"I really enjoyed this kettle for about six months and then the paint began to blister. The enamel on this kettle is not thick enough to keep it from peeling off of the stainless steel. I bought it for the color and functionality but now it's an eyesore on my countertop. I love the style but quality? Not up to Kitchenaid standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice look but needs a fluted spout and is not rust-proof","review":"The good: this kettle looks very nice, and it's got a rubberized grip so you can pour immediately after taking the kettle off without having to worry about burning yourself.The bad: the spout is not fluted, so if you're tilting the kettle up to get the last of the water out, the hot water runs around the edge of the spout, falls off in half a dozen places, and makes a puddle of steaming water around your tea cup. If you happen to have your hand on the cup's handle, ready to take it away, you'll burn yourself.Also, this kettle rusted within six weeks of purchase. I do not recommend this kettle for anyone intending to get serious use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea kettle for the serious tea drinker","review":"After trying a number of name brand tea kettles, I trusted the name of Kitchen-Aid and thought I'd try one. I boil a LOT of water for tea daily and this kettle is up to the job. It doesn't leak and its whistle is tolerable (not like some). You can't lose with this kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful investment","review":"I had read the other reviews on this product and I saw most people were complaining about the splashing that occurs when pouring hot water. It has been my experience in any tea kettle that has really hot water that it will splash. I still went for it because a huge factor for my wife was the looks and it looks great in our kitchen with the other red appliances.My recomendation for this is to buy it and use it as the directions recommend, which is to heat up water on medium heat and let it set for a minute before pouring and you won't have any trouble. It is one of many great products by kitchen aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Looked attractive in the ad. However, the finish where the spout attaches to the pot cracked and rusted in less than two weeks. Water sort of dribbles out--does not poor smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"some what dissappointed","review":"The kettle is a wonderful color of red and looks well in my kitchen. However, it is very difficult to get the lid off the kettle and I really do not like to have to manually open the spout when I pour the hot water. I followed the instructions for keeping the flame down so as not to burn the sides of the pot but for some reason the bottom of the kettle shows some red through the black now. Bascially the kettle is not user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty, but not perfect","review":"I love the look of this kettle. and the silicone handle is a great idea, but doesn't help that steam escapes the top and burns my hand while i am pouring. and the pour spout pops closed sometimes while pouring and i end up geting scalding hot water all over the place. then i am left holding down the lever for the pour spout- wich puts my hand that much closer to the lid and the escaping steam. i use the kettle multiple times a day and have had it for a year now. if i used it less frequently i probably wouldn't be as bothered by the flaws. i'm going to keep it- but if i had it to do over agin i would have gotten something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This kettle is awesome.

Now there is some flaking of the coating on the inside of the pot. Haven't found anything on the web of whether this is hazardous but I'm worried about using with this flaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty, functional, excellent customer service","review":"Received this kettle very quickly from amazon.com and the price was fantastic. When I opened the packaging, the adhesive scotch tape used to hold the lid in place tore off two large (1-inch square) pieces of red porcelain enamel..! I immediately called kitchenaid customer service (phone number is listed on info card included in packaging) and explained the situation. They offered to replace the kettle immediately if I would fax them my receipt, which I did. Four days later my brand new kettle arrived and removal of the scotch tape did not incur any damage. Fantastic customer service!! This kettle boils water and looks pretty sitting on the stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"have owned for approx. 3 months. whistle stopped working first then material around spout melted and would not open to pour water out.Kitchen Aid is a great brand, but this is a bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless piece of junk","review":"The spout is not contoured which means it will pour all over the place. I can't pour anything without it getting all over the countertop. The lid of the spout will not stay up unless you have the kettle lid positioned just right. The small lid opening makes filling difficult especially with the handle positioned right over the hole. The shoddy ceramic coating cracks off and flakes at the slightest accidental impact.Buy it if you want something nice to look at in your kitchen. If you want an actual kettle for use, get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"This was purchased as a gift for my husband. It is a nice teapot.

Other than that it seems pretty great so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for attractiveness, zero stars for rustiness","review":"I thought KitchenAid had higher standards. My cheapie IKEA tea kettle has a rounded design like this KitchenAid one but is not as cute; however, the KitchenAid tea kettle is rusty inside and the IKEA one has not rusted after several years of use (even though we keep water in it almost constantly).

I saw myself and every golfer I have ever met in this book. And I couldn't help but laugh at most of those golfers that Owen met including himself sometimes.

The book is never dull: it offers much needed insights into building strong teams, fostering collaboration, and developing a winning team.

Though it is set in Egypt, Malarkey's descriptions of Cairo's geography and history in the late 1940s should have been fact checked. (For example, she refers to the \\"Oberai\\" hotel. This hotel near the pyramids is now called the Mena House Oberoi and is part of a the Indian Oberoi chain. The Oberois didn't have anything to do with it before the 1970s or so.) My sense is that she has visited Egypt but doesn't know the country well enough to place a novel there convincingly. And finally, Wilton Barnhardt wrote an excellent, excellent book, Gospel, on this very topic about ten years ago. Read that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic Rehash","review":"Take some basic controversial Christian themes, mix in an exotic setting and here you have an uninspired novel.

Too bad, as the potential was there to say something deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing resurrection","review":"Having lived in Upper Egypt in the late 80s, for more than a year, I am always a sucker for novels set there. Malarkey's book was big on the 'sucker' rating. Kind of a Zane Grey action romance, but low on action and romance. Some of the characters were starting out interesting but with no real depth revealed. Then there was the tourist description of Cairo and the Nile...The caricature of Christianity she kicks at seems to encompass all other expressions within her highly critical view of the Catholic Church hierarchy (a la Dan Brown). Did all these people go to bad Catholic high schools, or something? When I read the obvious historical error (p354), that Constantine [post 300AD] (after aligning himself with Christianity) wiped out the Jews in Palestine, I realized she really is mixed up on a lot of stuff. Jerusalem was destroyed in 70AD and the last Jewish-Roman war (Bar-Kokhba) was 135AD in Hadrian's reign.but good, mindless, summer reading..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like I was there...","review":"I was provided with a copy of this book by the Aikens on my last trip to California.

This is a fictional history of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi codices in Egypt in the 1950's. The premise is great, but the book just does not deliver. The author spends way too much time on the emotional status of the gospel-seeking herione. Her feelings about her father's death, her feelings about her love for her two half-brothers are part of the uneasy pathos we have to suffer through with this woman. The book is slow-paced and unconvinving,ultimately ending with another Mary Magdalene story. Gag. Quite frankly, I'm tired of all the Mary Magdalene stuff - can all these authors get off that Da Vinci caboose? I'm giving this a two-star due to her interesting topic which had the potential to be a thriller, if it had not been so predictable. The author has also done alot of research to her benefit, however, with some minor details which were flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow.","review":"I picked this up after having it recommended as a sort of thinking person's Da Vinci Code.It does a couple of Da Vinci Code angles: Roman Catholic Church hatred of women, RC Church willingness to kill to maintain its position.

What a story! At last, the Daleks have special effects befitting the would-be conquerors of the universe. The plot is fantastic and fast-paced, and slyly ties back to the original story, and has numerous other references to the series' 26-year history. This is one story that I was sorry to see end, and anxiously awaited a couple of days to pass so I could watch again (with a minimum of complaint from my wife!). This is easily one of the best Doctor Who stories ever, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a very close second to Genesis of the Daleks. Sylvester McCoy (my favorite!) is excellent here, adding more mystery to a character who epitomies mystery!

They changed the entire background of the Doctor during this era, going from a mere timelord who absconded with a TARDIS from Gallifrey to a near God-like figure. I can't understand how this is acceptable in the minds of some people. Why is it that they have a problem with the 6th Doctor shooting Cyberman and asphyxiating a sadistic killer like Shockeye but are ok with McCoy's manipulating Davros into destroying his own Daleks? I don't get that one. All this said, at least Remembrance of the Daleks is better than the Crappiness Patrol."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly, not well done at all","review":"First I'd like to say I've always been a fan of Doctor Who and have watched many episodes. I hadn't seen much of the Sylvester McCoy seasons, though, and was very disappointed with this episode. Doctor who has always had cheesy special effects and a low budget (which is part of its charm), but the plots are usually fairly well thought out. In this case, the basic plot idea is interesting, but the writing and execution is terrible! The dialog is childish and the characters completely one-dimensional.

Why should fans have to 'double-dip' in our own pockets for production mistakes?If you do NOT already own this release, by all means, but the 'corrected' version, because the story is excellent.

Bush is portrayed as an asterisk under a large cowboy hat. Many of Bush's major misspeaks are included, for as the relevant cartoon characters point out, it is impossible to improve on them.The absurdity of the results in Florida, from the clear conclusion that a majority of Florida voters intended to vote for Gore to the vote in the Supreme Court that gave Bush the victory are all described in Trudeau's effective cartoon style.

Also, it seems that the writer begins to fancy himself a \\"great novelist\\" himself, what with his repetitve, melodramtic references to the \\"Factory of Death.\\" Maybe he got co-opted by Hemingway, much the same way the people in his book that he criticizes did.

I decided to disreguard the warnings that it just stops working one day. Then one fatefull bus ride on the way to school, my YP-T7X stopped working. I spent hours trying to revive my $100 investment. But it was no use; with my warrenty out, I had a useless pile of plastic and metal in my hands.On a lighter note it worked extremely well while it worked. Music was crystal clear, far better than any CD player I have listened to. The FM radio had poor reception, but considering I live in the middle of nowhere it was to be expected. The voice recording was great, gave me a chance to sleep during class, just record my teacher's voice and take notes later. I never used the photo viewer.All in all, its a good little; I mean little, player if you willing to take the gamble. I would advise finding another player, that is more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, poor return policy.","review":"Oh how I wanted this little baby to work for me! Well, it didn't and it died in February of '06 after I bought it in December of '05. I went a couple of rounds with the business that is contracted out to service Samsung's products (because they don't do it in house). The service center was nice and accomodating but still couldn't get it to work. And it had all the options I was looking for (le sigh). I should have paid heed to the poor reviews and bought something else. Now, unfortunately, I'm thinking of getting an Ipod because of the great reviews on Cnet.

It has nothing new except for Miller. Personally I would not even call this a movie. It is just a bunch of clips from the series. There is only about 10 min. of new footage on the dvd. If you have the whole series already and are trying to decide weather or not to get this just think to yourself; is it worth [the money], and could I think up a better story then the one given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"I thought I was getting a movie that went passed the final episode 20. Well, I was wrong. Basically this just reiterates all the events that happened in the series. It sheds some parts about missing things but other than that,I would move on. Go see the next series in Gundam's universal century series. Go and get 0080 War in the pocket and 0083 Stardust Memmory. Those I highly reccomend watching after 08th MS Team which happens in 0079. Make sure to watch' em in sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a lot of repeat video!","review":"Well, I would say I'm a huge fan of Gundam, but this movie is a disappointment. The regular series is awesome, but this movie is just a couple of episodes edited with the character of Miller put into them. Not worth it all. Unless you're just collecting everything Gundam. Anything else just skip this one. Nothing is really added to the story, and I say you've already seen about 90% of this movie any way. Only 10% or less is even new! It's just not worth it. Much better ways to spend your money than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"If you have seen the other 4 discs, DO NOT BUY THIS~!!!!Why? Because you have already seen it.

Midnight Tiger contains information on a large amount of games.

I searched high and low for a crib set with puppies that wasn't too cutesy or cheesey. I viewed this one multiple times online and decided against it. After seeing it in person at BRU, I loved it. Very cute and colorful. The manufacturer was rated an \\"A\\" by Baby Bargains. For safety, the crib bumper has ties at the top AND the bottom so the baby can't somehow get underneath it. I have one complaint- I wish the sheet had elastic the entire way around, which is supposed to be safer, but that's not a big deal to me. There are so many colors in this set, I can buy many solid color sheets to match with added elastic in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"something different","review":"I liked it, it was different to the crap that we're usually sold as British horror. The story was more complex that average but the characters were so good (and wierd) that i was involved all the way through.

If you have the misfortune of dealing with the public, you will relate to Carl Fellows in his struggles to deal with crazy customers,incometant coworkers,the neighborhood devil worshippers and life in an old summer rental.

It's the romp on the way through that draws you in! That being said, I can write this without any guilt. I personally prefer comedy to drama anyday, and Sands' delivers this quite well. While the editorial posted by Amazon scoffs at one vampire's surfer/hip lingo, I personally found it quite funny. Maybe it's because I grew up with 90210 and Saved by the Bell, but I love valley lingo because of its absurdity. Vampires who wallow in their own damnation are no fun at all. And that's what this novel is: FUN. Don't expect anything that will knock you to the floor laughing (Single White Vampire is better for that), but this is a cute bit of fluff that's great for rainy day reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitten once again!","review":"Like \\"Bite me if You Can,\\" \\"Love Bites\\" was the same story, different people, except Etienne had more Kindness for the person who he transformed, wherein Lucian did not. So far, the books that I have read of Sands' do not fit in with the category of Vampire Romance, except for Single White Vampire, but more of Vampire transition, if there was such a category. Once again, one of the Argeneau vamps turns someone and then has to deal with the transformation. Except for Single White Vampire, which was cute, Sand's books can merely fit into the \\"Fiction\\" category but hardly romance. Love Bites is not \\"a keeper\\" and will give it to the library. It was boring and easy to put down to go and clean house! If I had not ordered \\"A Bite to Remember\\" and \\"Vampires are Forever\\" I would not have even considered buying any more of her books, as money is hard to come by these days. But, since I did, now I am stuck with them and will read. Who knows....I might be surprised! There is always hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! NOT A NEW NOVEL","review":"Apparently Lindsay Sands is playing the Nora Roberts game of rereleasing a book with a different cover in order to trick people into buying it more than once. I am SO sick of that. This novel even comes up in the \\"new releases\\" list on amazon. It is NOT a new release -- in fact, it was only released in 2004 -- in paperback! -- so it's easily found with the old cover design in bookstores.Be sure to check your bookshelf and read the description of the book carefully before you buy! Sad when you can't trust that a new release from a favorite author really IS a new release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Her books are great, you can enjoy a laugh and be enertained for every minute you read this. Every book she has written is a delight to enjoy. I simply love this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"This book did have a very interesting premise, but it could have been written in a whole much better direction than just to have the two main characters repeatedly having sex throughout most of the book. I did like the fact that 'respectable' vampires drink from bags of donated blood instead of attack people on the street (could have made a good subplot dealing with the blood bags); and the straws getting stuck on the woman's fangs so that she didnt have to taste the blood was kind of inventive too (but then she could have moved on with her life and tried to eke out what she could of the life she had before becoming a vampire). Too bad the blood issues were the only interesting things in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Bought it at a grocery store in South Dakota while on vacation for a quick summer read, should have left it there.

Most of what Tracy says is some combination of boring, obvious, and predictable. Also, he's fond of citing dubious statistics at every turn (example: \\"Only 2% of people can work effectively without supervision\\". Really, Brian? Where did you get that factoid?). \\"Eat that Frog!\\" does contain some valid advice -- but don't expect anything surprising, insightful, or new.

I encourage anyone in a professional job to consider this CD (or book). Brian Tracy's approach has 21 tips and if you are able to implement just a few of them--you will see rapid results.

I guess it could serve as a reminder of goal setting and prioritizing. But, I felt like it was mainly a rehashing of parts of Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and I think Covey said it better himself.

Instead, Brian Tracy, a man who's own success speaks pretty loudly, takes some of the best wisdom out there on the topic and puts it in a compelling form. This is important beacuse time management is about more than having the right information - it's about putting that information into action.

I now refer to my most important project of the day as 'eating my frog'.Regarding the reviewers who have stated that information later in the book is contrary to the author's overall view, I disagree. You can use more than one method when it comes to achieving your goals.

I know what to do, but still can't get over the mental block. This book says, Just Do It, and you'll feel better, and want to do more! This is useless advice. If I could just do it, I wouldn't need a book.Unless you're completely in the dark about goal setting and time management, avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for the procrastinator","review":"\\"Eat That Frog\\" by Brian Tracy is an excellent book about creating habits to stop procrastination. This easy to read book gives 21 pieces of advice to stop putting off the things that really need to be done and just do them.I found a lot of these examples repeated from his book, \\"Million Dollar Habits\\" but repeatition is sometimes needed to learn some techniques. Additionally the layout in this book is much better so I highly recommend this book also.The mostly focuses on the importance of setting goals, planning and attacking the big tasks from a piece by piece mindset. While I found this advice relevent and helpful, I would have liked some examples, especially in the planning part of the book. However there are plenty of other books out there on that topic and examples were probably left out to keep the size of the book small and easy to reread.In all, definitely a great book and worth reading. I give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat that Frog","review":"Very disappointed in the non-ability to hear the audio version I purchased. Tried it in two vehicles and the same result.

I read Tracy's book and was in total control of my life immediately. This is no joke. It really did do everything for me that I had hoped. To be completely honest: I was about half-way through reading 'The Success Principles' when I read this book. So, that book had actually helped me, too. I was on my way back from dropping off my motorcycle at the shop for maintenance. I took the bus downtown, ate at Subway, and was done reading the book by the time I got home about four hours later. It is so amazing. The solutions to overcoming procrastination are so simple it will amaze you. I suggest you get 'The Success Principles' by Jack Canfield as well. It doesn't matter where you are in life. If you haven't read it, you need to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some recipes for REAL familes!","review":"I'm so sick of \\"family\\" cook books that expect me to spend an hour or more cooking dinner. No one in the Real World has time like that when you've got little kids. This cook book is great. It's full of yummy recipes that don't take too long to make. Even my VERY picky toddler will eat most of them. Some top picks include Cracker Chicken, Sweet and Sour Grilled Chicken, Spaghetti Pie, Apple Crisp a la Mode, and Pork on a Bun. I do wish the book had more recipes but it's well worth the money. And it's especially worth it since you'll actually be able to spend some time with your kids, rather than just cooking for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was so excited about ordering this book.

I don't like extremely high heels because I am tall and also because I like to walk quickly (I find very high heels to be a hinderance). I got them in black. They weren't too exciting but functional. Or so I thought... I didn't wear them THAT many times - maybe twice a month maximum. I have 5 pairs of black heels counting this pair. Notwithstanding this relatively infrequent wear, the plastic cap on the heel wore completely through to the metal by June (yes - within 7 months of relatively infrequent wear). I wasn't pleased. Normally I have a good experience with Nine West shoes, so I was surprised. I wonder if one of my shoes was defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable, beautiful and elegant","review":"the shoes are comfortable, beautiful and elegant.

When I did, they were definitely comfortable and they fit very well, but unfortunately the toe was way too pointy for my taste. It made my foot appear an inch or two longer than it actually is and it just looked silly sticking out from my pant leg. As much as I wanted to love these, I had to return them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too high","review":"These shoes fit perfectly. They were not too high so you won't break your neck in them. It's hard to find heels that are workable but these fit the bill. Stylish, yet you can wear them for several hours at a time. A little bit pricey for me but I would like a pair in every color.

I wear them to work and despite how fashionable and sharp they look, they're extremely comfortable for dress shoes and they go with EVERYTHING. I also wear the black leather ones when I'm going out and they match perfectly with jeans plus the heels are high enough to give you some height without being too high that they would prevent you from walking far. I've gotten many compliments on these shoes and my only regret is that Nine West stopped selling them in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"What were they thinking?.....","review":"The honchos at Nine West are airheads - they discontinued the Nuncio - one of their most popular and best selling shoes. Why? Who knows... And the supposed replacement shoe, \\"Adrianna\\", is selling so poorly that they're now deeply discounted. Not as attractive, certainly not nearly as comfortable. I have about 40 pairs of the Nuncio (bought them up when I heard they were discontinued) and plan on wearing them until they all wear out or I die, whichever comes first.Maybe all us Nuncio lovers can join forces and get them to bring it back?

It was fun just to look at his alternate world map. However, the pace of the book was very slow. This book might have made a decent short story, but not a novel. The characters are not that inspiring. I was also dismayed to see the few remaining patriots portrayed as racist terrorists. I find it hard to believe that even had the revolution of 1776 failed, colonies would not have sometime later fought for their freedom. Portraying the British as the good guys was more than a bit disconcerting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL SNOOZER!","review":"By the end of the first chapter of this book, I though it moved dreadfully slowly. I foolishly continued reading in the hope that it would eventually pick up the pace. Although the authors' vision of a world without the American revolution or the technology-spawning World Wars is not totally without interest, there are no truly new ideas here, and everything is presented in a wordy, overwrought style I find reminiscent of Dumas sans self-effacing humor. I cannot honestly recommend this book to anyone other than insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting AH premise wasted.","review":"Turtledove and Dreyfus have combined to take a potentially fascinating alternate history situation, the American Revolution that never happened, and bury it under a slow moving and unsuspenseful story and pedestrian writing. The characters have little depth or believability, and not surprisingly, the dialogue is cornball. The biggest disappointment is that more details aren't presented on the alternate history, the why's, how's, and effects. The inclusion of the \\"Tricky Dick\\" character was a cheap shot that's hard to believe anyone would consider humorous or clever. Advice: pass on this one, and pick up a copy of Turteldove's The Guns of the South instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"A THOUGHT PROVOKING NOVEL","review":"Many of the following negative reviews seem to disagree with Turtledove's and Dreyfuss' portrayal of American society in a world were the American Revolution never took place. These readers question the different societal mores, conventions, level of technology, and racial integration that this different America possesses. Let us not forget, however, that the very premise of alternate history states that the world would not be the same if certain historical events had occurred differently. By leaving our prejudices aside and reading between the lines, we can actually conclude that Tutledove's and Dreyfuss' alternate America seems plausible enough. Although the plot at times moves at a snail-like pace, the storyline eventually gains momentum and finishes up with a bang. Ultimately speaking, this novel embraces the reader with its gallant characters, creative storytelling, and thought-provoking implications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"A potentially fascinating alternate history situation, the American Revolution that never happened but some how bothTurtledove and Dreyfus create a slow moving and unsuspenseful story and pedestrian writing.

I found the places and People very interesting. I thought that the mix of action and history made it almost impossible to put down. The thing that kept me on the edge the most was waiting for the point in the story when we would find out that the Sons of Liberty were the good guys. I won't spoil it for those who have not read it, but I was on the edge until the end of the book.

Every book I've read has been awesome, so I picked up \\"The Two Georges\\". Slow paced isn't even the word for it. I think the problem was the two Authors couldn't decide if they wanted to paint a portrait (forgive the pun) of the main Character, or of the Changed America's. Something was definitely lost in the translation either way. I found myself not caring about the Mounty's personal life and just wanted him to find the darned painting. I'm still a Fan of Harry's but I'll certainly not read any more books with him sharing the credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both Georges are no doubt spinning in their graves.","review":"This by far the worst book I have ever read. I finished it only because I was looking for the punch line. There wasn't one, and I've never so regretted time wasted. Since I've never read a Turtledove, I'm not sure who to blame here. I suppose I can blame both: A good writer would have made an attempt to fix the book, halt it's release, or take his name off the front cover. The action is clunky, the prose is stilted, the dialogue is unnatural and cliche, and the premise is as uninteresting as it is unimportant."},{"rating":"1","title":"While Harry wasn't looking, Richard sank the boat.","review":"A slow slog through literary jello.

Maybe the under 6 age group. Funnily enough I'd looked forward to reading this book and even ignored the bad reviews other folks had given it. Please don't make my mistake, order something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hopes and dreams of the left leaning Richard Dreyfus.","review":"As one who both loves the past writings of Harry Turtledove and viewed the typical trendy leftist expressions of richard dryfus I should suggest they both stick with their own talents. This book proved to be slow, disjointed and full of contradictions in plot and effect. To have the latter day founding fathers expressed as a bunch no better than today's militia fruitcakes is an insult to freedom loving people. To see that science has not been stimulated beyond gas filled balloons and AM radio is proof of the tremendous contributions our great country has acheived. I gave the book to a freind who is a British citizen who is a monarchist; she loved it but expressed dismay that America had been displayed as stagnent and unimaginative. This is the only Turtledove book worth guiding a wide berth around. Mr. dreyfus should go back to acting and making dismal comments on sad, sad \\"Politically (In-?) Correct\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before I read the book. It would have saved me a lot of time. I almost stopped after the first chapter, but I've liked the other Turtledove books I've read so I kept going thinking it would get better. A mistake -- it didn't.The premise of a world that hadn't had an American Revolution is interesting. But they didn't develop that premise. They describe a world that has a different state of technology than ours, and it would have been interesting to learn why the technology is different. But they don't discuss it. They describe a world that has different social structures and mores than ours, but don't discuss why. In fact they basically ignore the premise of the book and just pursue a simple who-dunnit.But, there could be another book starting with the same premise that actually explores how and why things would be different if there hasn't been an American Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtledove's Best Work","review":"In my opinion, this is my favorite book done by Turtledove period.

It's set in America and the authors would have us believe everyone is still bowing and scraping before the British King-Emporer (!) Charles III. It's every character's dream to put Sir in front of his name, including the main man and his sidekick. We have people like this in Britain. We despise them. The underlying story is of a murder but this gets lost in the depiction of a seriously unpleasant society where no one questions the authority of a political system based on class and privilege, or the right of an unelected monarch to political power. On top of that, it's overlong, badly written and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"Each time I sat down to read this book, I found myself nodding off. I wanted it to be a good read.

It's just so far out there and it is definitely not able to reach a large audience. As a huge sci-fi fan I had to take a look, and I was mildly amused.

Those with a knowledge of the Director fare better than those of us getting our first taste. This is also definitely a movie that benefits from watching more than once.

Most of the characters are rendered in CGI, which gives the film a very, artsy feel. At first I wasn't sure I liked the film, but the film managed to pull me in., despite the fact the story is winding and not at all easy to understand, and the plot jumps more than a hyper frog, something about this film is very captivating.The film is roughly about an escaped convict, a rogue Egyptian deity, and a woman with no past and an unknown future named Jill. Somewhere included is corporate greed, police that have been horribly deformed, twisting monsters, genetics tests, and flying cars. It makes for a very odd jumble.And if you're one who likes plot threads resolved, this isn't your movie. Most of the minor plot threads are left dangling, but the film captivates you so much you'll have a hard time caring.Highly recommended for sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can so much effort produce so little","review":"I am a major fan of sci fi but am easily willing to admit when a film is unappealing at any level. I found nothing about the imagery extraordinarily interesting or original.

They try to merge it with real actors, for so so results. Neither is there anything stunning or exciting in the visuals.The movie it's self, was easy to follow, but rather boring.

This movie has worse graphics than most Saturday morning cartoons.I would like my money back, but that is not possible...so I'll watch this movie burn into a nice pile of black platic instead.

The only saving grace of the movie is that it's visually impressive, but then again, so is The Lion King, and you don't see me running out to buy that.

Chesterton's wit is delightful, but repeatedly and unexpectedly you will find a joke that catches you with humor at first and then drives home the point, artfully and naturally. Chesterton asserts through his characters that commonplace things are noble, but far from merely stating this, he makes you _feel_ it. \\"Napoleon\\" is a prose work, but written with such grace and art as to carry poetic power. The dialogue of the President of Nicarague especially is capital stuff. An example: \\"You have good authority,\\" answered the Nicaraguan. \\"Many clever men like you have trusted to civilisation. Many clever Babylonians, many clever Egyptians, many clever men at the end of Rome.

Many quotations are from Christians, but not all. The book is arranged by topics in alphabetical order (Death, Faith, Holiness, Home-Family-Marriage, Joy), with an author index in the back.Some quotes are rather humorous: \\"I have spent a lot of time searching through the Bible looking for loopholes.\\"--W.C Fields, attributed during his last illness. Others are more profound: \\" 'I can forgive, but I cannot forget,' is only another way of saying 'I cannot forgive.'\\"--Henry Ward Beecher.The variety of authors makes the book quite intriguing, compelling the casual peruser to stop for this one, and that one, and the next one: Rose Kennedy, Victor Hugo, St. Francis of Assisi, Billy Graham, H.G.

David Moulton even sang some of his songs for us after answering many questions. The memoir-type story grabbed my attention when he first wrote about black/white American soldiers in WW II. The beginning takes place in London and environs before he moves to the US. An abusive father, unfortunate jail sentences, sprinkled with music, rock bands and painting, provide a rainbow of heartfelt experiences. From singing in St. Paul's Cathedral to metal art work in California, the story is expansive and appealing to any age.

While there is some truth to this history, Miller certainly overstates his claims. The fact is that large numbers of immigrants to this country resisted assimilation and many returned to their home countries to avoid the oppression and persecution they found in the U.S.Miller's writing is much akin to Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s \\"The Disuniting of America.\\" It is persuasive, but shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raven rocks me until I drop.","review":"Raven unites the pop sensibility of Sweet with the power-crazed metal of Iron Maiden. Many cite this Newcastle trio as one of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal's direct precursors of American thrash metal, though the connection is only obvious on a few songs (e.g. \\"Tyrant of the Airways\\"). By NWOBHM standards this album is almost giddily upbeat, sporting instantly memorable riffs, shout-along choruses, and the wailing vocals of bass player John Gallagher (reminiscent of Rob Halford by way of Jello Biafra). It's a welcome change from the often dour likes of Maiden and Motorhead.For British metal at its feel-good best, you can't go wrong with ROCK UNTIL YOU DROP."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest metal albums ever made","review":"The title says it all. I bought this album unheard from an import bin back in '82 and my life changed forever. This was the first time I had ever heard rock played with this kind of speed and intensity. The most amazing thing about R.U.Y.D., is that the songs can be so heavy and manic, and yet catchy as hell. Not many bands can slam your head against a wall while making you hum at the same time...Raven can. This band influenced Metallica, Skid Row, and dozens of others. Quite possibly, without Raven, more agressive styles of metal may never have happened, or at least not in the same way. The most important album you've never heard of.

Very little meaningful insight into any other religion exists. Even when the author does attempt to give explanations of a particular religion, they are often far too overgeneralized to provide any real connection with its practitioners.In the absence of informative content, the reader is presented with an endless series of stories that are more reminiscent of an adolescent's journal than the expert writings of a serious scholar of world religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly excellent memoire; exceedingly well written.","review":"Someone gave this book to my wife for our old booksale at church and suggested that she might be interested in it. (She's an Episcopal priest.) She passed on the book but I was intrigued. Ari Goldman, a New York Times reporter, writes with immense skill and in a very appealing way about the difficulties and rewards of being a reporter and an observant Orthodox Jew, the burdens of growing up in a disfunctional family, and of his fascinating search for a deeper understanding of religion during a year long sabbitcal at the Harvard Divinity School. His portraits of his fellow students are wonderful. I strongly recommend this work. As he ends the book, he finds himself reading catalogues from rabbinical schools. I wonder if anything ever came of that. I would love to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what is advertised","review":"It's not that I didn't enjoy this to some degree, but the more I got into the less I enjoyed it. It is not as advertised. Goldman skims the surface of other religions and I really got the impression that he doesn't think too much of them. What this is is a story of how an Orthodox Jew came to terms with having a job that sometimes forced him to work on the Sabbath. If anything, his stint at the Harvard Div School in 1985 reinforced his own religion, and that is about it. Good for him, but it does not make for an elightened experience at all. With true ecumencial joining he would have given a little of himself to each religion that he covered, not simply \\"reported\\" on them, along with his feelings about individuals representative of each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and candid view of the Harvard Divinity School","review":"This brief autobiographical work gives a very candid and interesting view of life at the Harvard Divinity school.

Now the joints are a little tight but this is by design. if the pieces are too loose the dino will not stand up properly. Adults love it just as much as the kids do.

I had to buy a metal file to do so because the sandpaper included in the set wasn't heavy-duty enough, and even with the metal file, I had to spend so much time making each notch larger that we could only assemble a third of the dinosaur during a two hour session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parking Structures","review":"This book will never make any best seller list, but if your job includes maintaining a parking ramp then this book is not to be missed. It gives complete detail on planning, design, construction, maintenance, and repair of parking ramps in a way that anyone with a smidgeon of technical knowledge can read and understand. It shows what can go wrong due to weather and time and how to repair the problems. It explains mechanical and electrical systems that keep parking ramps functional. It offers insight into how parking structures are designed and built in words anyone can comprehend.In all this book is a necessity if you need to manage a parking system from a maintenance perspective. The ramp that I'm responsible for is less confusing to me now that I have this book to serve as my guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"This paper is NOT a true 4x6","review":"For some odd reason, Kodak chose to make this paper 4x6 3/8.

For example in The Good luck Story. A girl found a penny. She picked it up for good luck and put it in her pocket, but the pocket had a hole. I'm not going to spoil the end of the story. In this journal it's Amelia's birthday. But I'm not going to tell you what she got for her birthday, either! Also something happened Amelia's school. I can't tell you any endings. Her best friend Leah asked if she can look in Amelia's notebook. Amelia didn't know what to say to Leah, yes or no. In the last part it will tell you. So that means you have to buy the book to see what happens. I give this book four stars because a few parts were kind of boring, but most of the book was really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing...","review":"I bought SCREENTEST TAKE 1 for the Batman screentests. What was here was nice to see one time, but were obviously edited and incomplete. Also, there is unnecessary narration over the parts of it that were shown. ... Would I purchase a DVD of a Stones concert if it had a narrator commenting how good Jagger looks or how well the band held up over the years? I think not. CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD EXCEPT FOR A CASUAL VIEW. Not worth the money, nor suitable for a permanent DVD library/collection/archive because of the above mentioned problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Especially DOLLY Shots","review":"This DVD is a good show, interesting to watch. Obviously, everyone will have different reasons for purchasing it. Some will look forward to seeing some screen tests over others.I bought the DVD for the HELLO DOLLY screen tests and costume shots. I was amazed that this footage was not used on the newly released Fox DOLLY DVD! Extremely rare Streisand costume and wig tests and screen tests for the supporting roles are the highlight here. All of the DOLLY footage is in excellent condition. Danny Lockin's audition is very charming and it's obvious why director Gene Kelly chose him. You can even hear Kelly off screen reading with Lockin. Also interesting is Sandy Duncan's audition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle Hearthstone is very sturdy and looks beautiful on our dining table","review":"I was looking for the dinnerware that Albertsons had in their store awhile back and found some matches on Amazon..so was thrilled to see they were here and ordered..my order they handled perfectly..this was my first order with Amazon and I would shop here again..thank you, Kathy"},{"rating":"2","title":"kq","review":"i bought green and red 75plates from corelle site,really nice and heavy,good for parties,where guests can sit,hard to carry in hands and eat.I hate to waste paper plates"},{"rating":"1","title":"not pictured","review":"i ordred this product and it not what is pictured. what you get is a bumper hitch that mounts on bumper not on frame. i think its a false ad and they should picture the right style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim fast Low Carb Snack bar","review":"These snacks are delicious.

Taylor has a quirky sense of humor any intellegent person is apt to enjoy. This is my favorite of his many books. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor production values","review":"I bought this for the Brothers Hildebrandt images of which I am a huge fan. The images on the DVD are fuzzy and small. 2nd Disc \\"Landscapes of Middle Earth\\" has no images or maps, just music. For the serious Tolkien fan this is a VERY disappointing product. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame stuff","review":"Unless you're the sort of hopeless fan who swoons with delight at any mention of Middle-earth, this documentary is dreary stuff. The vaunted three-dimensional maps are rudimentary at best; the maps already in the books are far superior for conveying detail and flavor. As for the live-action interludes re-creating scenes from the books ... well, let's just say they're a little too middle school-ish for Middle-earth. The film clips of J.R.R. Tolkien speaking in his rapid-fire mumble leave one feeling sorry for the students who had to take notes during his lectures. The package is rounded out with kitsch-sodden calendar art from the Brothers H that makes one happy that Alan Lee's painting were the visual guidepost for Peter Jackson's films."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"This is the saddest attempt to cash in on the movies I have seen. Not only does it have nothing to do with the movie, it is not even good Tolkien. It consists of an interview with one of the lesser illustrators, music by an unknown British singer, of dubious talents, a very poor tour of Oxford (the outsides of places where Tolkien lived), interviews with non-Tolkien experts (Oxford students and low level dons), and a lot of footage of people who like to role-play being warring elves and goblins. The only \\"professional\\" bit is an interview with one of Tolkien's biographers, and that is not much. If this thing had been better described, on the web page, I would have never wasted my time buying it. It is the only thing I have ever bought on Amazon that I was not satisfied with."},{"rating":"1","title":"<<<Do not bother purchasing this DVD>>>","review":"This is NOT worth purchasing at all. Get it from your local library instead. I picked it up on a whim, then watched it. Big mistake. If it was possible to give this a rating of 0 stars instead of 1 star, I would have. Just fluff, borrow it from a friend, or again, go to your library and borrow it from them. Sorry, but this isn't really worth your money IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing I didn't already know. Don't waste your money!","review":"If you are interested in learning about Tolkien read Humphrey Carpenter's excellent biography rather than wasting money on this DVD. The only thing of interest on this disc is the footage of Tolkien himself, but there's not enough to make the price you pay worthwhile. The majority is taken up by a badly performed synopsis of the story. Also includes a disc of totally boring music supposedly inspired by LOTR. Buy Howard Shore's soundtrack to the Peter Jackson films if you want great music that really sounds like it fits the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"This is really a pretty good story about two people whose lives have been turned upside-down and inside-out.He's an undercover DEA agent who only finds out that his tryst with a drug supplier's sister resulted in pregnancy when he's presented with a baby whose mother's dying wish was that he take care of the child. She's a burned-out bank loan officer with out-of-control diabetes exacerbated by the stress of her job. They both end up living at the same friends' home.It was a fairly realistic portrayal of two people at the end of their ropes, struggling to make some sense of their lives, unable to trust or let someone else in.I got a bit impatient with them toward the end of the book, and they did seem to stay at the friends' house way too long, but other than that, it was a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good grammar book of Tagalog","review":"This is a good grammar book with straightforward explanations. Although almost 40 years old, I think it is still the best book on the market at the present moment. My only caveat is that the author does not know how to use the accent system of Tagalog, a suprising thing from someone teaching the language. For instance \\"child\\" is spelt b��ta' whereas it should be spelt bat�� or b��t��; \\"nothing\\" is written wala instead of wal (last syllable stressed and closed by the glottal stop), etc. Also accents are not used systematically, many sentences are left without accents. Imagine a similar book about Czech, French, Spanish without their accents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Paul H. Scudder is the reason I'm a chemist.","review":"This text is beautiful. Dr. Scudder teaches a logical approach to organic reaction mechanisms with clarity and precision unrivaled in modern chemistry education. His analytical approach to problem solving was the catalyst that converted me from languages major dabbling in the sciences to chemistry student without even looking back. Now, I'm in chemistry graduate school and it is clear to me that I have been very well instructed compared to the vast majority of my peers. I am so excited for the next edition!

Great to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on VHS, even better on DVD","review":"You gotta love a concert video where they start a song, screw it up and then just start it over, and don't edit anything out! I was only a marginal AIC fan when my brother got me the VHS version of this as a present, but I liked it so much that when I saw that it was out on DVD I had to get it again. It is enjoyable enough on VHS, but both the picture and sound quality on the DVD are way better. It's much easier to make out the lyrics on the DVD, and the sound of all the instruments is amazingly clear. Also, while there are not that many extras, it does have a great menu set-up that allows you to leave the program at any point, explore the menu, and then come right back to the same spot by clicking on the single arrow at the bottom of the screen.The video is very well edited, with some nice fades, and all the songs sound great. No Excuses was originally an acoustic recording anyway, but it's astounding how well the heavier songs carried over to unplugged versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling A I C performance","review":"This dvd to me personally is the best in the Unplugged series well this one & Nirvanas . The late great Layne Staley in top form despite the fact that it was rumored that minutes before taking the stage did a big dose of heroin .and it shows at one point during the show as he stumbles thru one of the songs and just asks the audience \\" whats my motovaion here \\" . Nonetheless a great performance in all .a must if your a big Alice in Chains fan. Its quite chilling to view this as Layne still sends chills up my spine to this day when I watch it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This is as good today as it was when it first appeared on MTV. Pure Alice at their best in a unique intimate environment. Although it is a little sad to see Layne so weak from his addiction, if you look closely you can see how Jerry watches over him, encourages him and tells him it's OK when he misses a lyric. Must have for any AIC fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"My husband LOVES Alice in Chains and I bought this DVD for him for Christmas. It does not work. I saw the review of the buyer that also got it and it did not work, but since there was one that did play I figured I would give it a try. We tried on 3 different DVD player and 2 computer.

So please, don't be like me and waist your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this with the expectation that I would be able to watch it.

This is serves me as a reader more as a conceptual one, especially when compared to \\"Programming Game AI by Example \\" by Mat Buckland, which has quick and fun examples. It's difficult to read for the casual reader. BUT, this does not mean, that it is a bad book, by no means, when I need new ideas for AI, I come back to this one and get new ideas, as it covers all techniques that I could think of, which should make it a good reference for the serious reader. The whole library behind it shows, that the author has invested much effort in this. So my final recommendation is to buy it together with Mat's book as both together make a nice team, especially so as Mat's book is easier to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"large Tyrannosaurus Rex wooden 3D Puzzle","review":"Well made, solid big 3-d puzzle.

It is built of cheap plastic and would have probably survived one fall off the desk if one were lucky.

After 2 weeks, I received my \\"repaired\\" computer, only to have it break again 3 weeks later. Once again, I've lost all my data. Fortunately, I have been able to back it up. Unfortunately, I don't have a psion on which to back it up and nobody at the Psion company has been of any help.

I find input of text much faster and easier than the Palm even though I am fairly experienced with Graffiti.2. It has 16MB of RAM and is expandable with off the shelf CompactFlash cards. One of the first things I did was purchase a 48MB CompactFlash card.3. You can program in perl, java, or python on the 5mx.4. There is a lot of freeware/shareware available. Not as much as for the Palm, but still I find that software is available to duplicate almost all the functions that I used on the Palm.5. The 5mx can multitask.6.

Unfortunately, my Psion broke just in time to be out of warranty. The company will repair it for $160 without guarantee that it won't break again. I have heard from several others that their Psion Series 5 or 5mx also broke shortly after the warranty period had ended. Psion does not offer extended warranties, either. I have had a very poor experience with customer service; they are not helpful, and don't seem to care whether they maintain the customers they work so hard to acquire. Furthermore, I've noticed the company being more stingy, unaccomodating and generally customer-unfriendly over the past few years. I would be surprised if Psion stays afloat given the competitve climate for hand held computers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this.","review":"Bought the Kodak paper because of Kodak's good reputation.

Then you have to e-mail them several times to get a response, and all they say is \\"Send it back to the retailer,\\" even after the 30 day return period.I bought theirXACT COMMUNICATIONS XG2500 Cordless Headset Telephonein late 2008 and it was of mediocre but acceptable quality at first. But then the battery life took a nosedive. A cordless phone that lasts ten minutes on a full charge isn't useful. And that happened during the one year warranty period.

It may accelerate battery fatigue a bit, but only marginally.Very nice design on digipower's part, the plates are a very slick way to cover the ridiculous amount of various camera batteries on the market.My only complaint is that digipower does not make the plates available individually.

Or, at least, it *should* be easy. The pattern says to CO a multiple of 16st+3. So I got to row 4 of the pattern and did it stitch by stitch until I ran short of stitches on my needle.So I added up how many stitches you actually *need* on the needle in order to do it exactly as written, and it's 33.I really hope they publish an errata, because though I could easily figure out how to fix their patterns, I really shouldn't have to take the time to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let your creativity run!","review":"Many, many great ideas for any type of items you can imagine.

There are actually only 100 patterns for knitting (since I do not like to crochet, the 100 crochet patterns were irrelevant to me). In looking at many of the patterns, I realized that they were the same stitch patterns, but with different combinations of colors, which make them look different when they are not. I also have read other reviews that mention mistakes in the instructions, and although I have not found any of these yet, I find this inexcusable.

The author constantly compares Java with Small Talk. Unfortunately in keeping an open mind I over looked the bad coding style. This could have been an excellent book for beginner programmers that wanted to write professional code. However, the author writes code in the style of C++ and Small Talk. The author's code should not be used as a template, which is what most beginner programmers will do. Another problem with this book is that the author has made assumptions that all the techniques he has learned from other languages will work the same way in Java. This is not the case. While this book does contain some valuable techniques, I believe that the poor coding style and the author's lack of understanding of Java will mislead beginner programmers. Therefore I can only rate this book 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!

I guess Jackson is the metaphorical embodiment of the US Govt? Poor thing, with its hands so tied. Poor, misunderstood US Govt, just trying to save people. And Moss is the confused, somewhat good-hearted American people? She has a decision to make! She needs to 'stop making this' about her...stop being so squeamish and moral. It was really bad.

Especially considering that most of it takes place in a single room. The torture is graphic, and the drama is very heavy. This is one of the finest roles I have seem Samuel Jackson play. The same goes for Michael Sheen. They are both amazing, and make a great duo. This movie also makes you think about what kind of things happen to ensure our freedom.

How far do you go in torturing one man in order to save millions?The scenes are graphic, the dialogue realistic. This is a powerful movie in all aspects. I can't guarantee everyone will like it but to me it is the best examination of what we need to win the war against terror."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"Intense from begining to end.Strong performances by entire cast.

He gives the date and time for the bombs to go off, but no more. A mysterious interrogator known as \\"H\\" (Samuel Jackson) is brought in to find the locations of the bombs. An FBI counter-terrorism specialist (Carrie-Anne Moss) is a witness to the interrogation.The orders from on high regarding the interrogation? No holds barred. Find the bombs.Along with the screaming, the soul-searching, the missing fingers, the free dental work, and more, there is repeated reference to whether information obtained during torture has any validity. H doesn't care... he just ratchets things up as the terrorist (an ex-military US citizen) holds out.Is there anything H won't do? As the time gets closer to the deadline, is there anything people don't want him to do?

It's a very well done thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie","review":"I consider this an amazing movie - not for the acting or script, which we both fine, but for the thought provoking subject. I guarantee that if you watch this movie you'll be talking about it for days afterward.

This DVD contains outtakes from many famous Fox films, trimmed sometimes for censorship or even political reasons or maybe simply to reduce the running time.If you know the films, you can mentally piece the outtakes into the originals. Some of the numbers are pretty awful such as Bert Lahr's incomprehensible song. Others are memorable like Jimmy Durante's number with Shirley Temple and Alice Faye's \\"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\\". It is also amusing to see the performers grimace and pout as the camera starts to roll. The DVD is a gold mine to the film buff and since the material has been taken from original negatives and restored, it is in great condition.The DVD is partly documentary as narrated by Joan Collins. Whatever you might think of Collins as a performer, she has a beautiful English accent with perfect diction.

The 2 CD set compiles some of the best VU tracks + NICO's \\"Chelsea Girl\\" that I think would be a very good introduction to some of the people who aren't familiar with the band at the best possible price but will be a disappointment for long time VU fans since it's just one of those VU stuff that has been remastered and released over and over!

I now know that I had a form of radiation sickness that was caused by exposure to the equipment that I was working with, the products that were in my home, and too much sunlight exposure (the Sun is a nuclear reactor!). This is an excellent book that confirmed my own personal findings. Today I have good health that I thought was impossible to achieve a few years ago.

Written by an award winning nationally acclaimed science journalist, you can trust that the information in this book has been well researched and documented. If you are one of those unfortunate people who have developed Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity Syndrome (EHS), meaning that you feel ill around computers, wireless routers, and other high EMF electronics, then the actions that you will need to take, in order to feel healthy again, will be miles beyond those of the average person, and this book will help you to start on your road to recovery.

The memory feature is useful- stores the document and can broadcast or resend automatically to multiple numbers. I like its white classic fax like design. Am not giving it 5 stars because: it takes only 10 pages at a time for sending, I have not figured how to turn off the error report printing feature (the error code like E2 or E4 hardly helps - you know there was ane error from the lcd screen, so why print?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plain fax","review":"This is a good simple to use fax, I seldom need it to receive just send and so far it has worked very well.

My downsids of why this was brought from five stars are:The last almost third of the book is about groups, which would be fine, if the title was different, in my opinion. Personally, I also wonder if a \\"druid\\" alone would be a \\"druid\\" or if they would simply be another title such as bard, ovate, seer, or along those lines following on the same path.

However, when he arrives at the role of the Spirit his text becomes harsh and narrow. The Spirit is restricted to sanctification, with the gifts of edification (prophecy, tongues and interpretation, miraculous healing) reserved for the apostolic era. He goes as far as to state that those that practice tongues are deceived and filled with an evil spirit. He does not state that they have lost their salvation but does suggest that these events have ceased - not arguing for or against, yet the declaration that these events could not happen and if they do are the result of demonic deception appears to great a claim to make, one which attempts to restrict God (as identified as father, son, and spirit) and labels that which may be God as demonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth its weight in gold","review":"Several years ago I was asked to teach a class on doctrine at my church. I had read Dr. Cottrell's excellent commentary on Romans, and I went searching to see what books he may have written on theology in general.

As contrived thrillers go, this one was pure Hollywood, complete with dopey plot twists that make less sense the more you think about them. Plodding, pointless and pedestrian, Murder At 1600 is so dull it actually put me to sleep twice, I finally did finish it, though I admit that I fast-forwarded through the tedious fight scenes at the end, will Wesley die?

This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself.

It starts out with the murder of a White House staffer and ends up with everyday cop Wesley Snipes and his Secret Service counterpart Diane Lane trying save the nation from a constitutional crisis. Therein lies the problem with Murder at 1600: it is really two not very good movies in one. The first half is rather ho-hum, but is still believable; Snipes wades through bureaucratic bull while investigating the death of a White House intern. The second half is pure fantasy, livened up with shoot'um up action, as the trail of crumbs leads to an incredibly dumb conclusion. If the producers of Murder at 1600 could have decided which direction to go, they would have had an average, but entertaining movie. Instead, we get a movie that is average and not entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as Absolute Power.","review":"This is the first murder mystery film to have the White House as the location of the crime.

I was looking for a romance story with a fun, vampiric element. I did get the vampiric element, but I found the humour to be a bit underdeveloped and at times very childish. I think there were only three or four parts where I laughed out loud.Plus, romance books based strictly in the first person are confusing and difficult at best. I have only read two to date that are worthy.I have the sequel to this book, and deep inside I am hoping it offers more then this first one did. Interestingly, the author gives thanks to Christine Feehan whose Dark series are the hottest vampire romances on the market. And, although CF's books have been lacking of late, please don't look to this book to offset what you haven't been recieving in a Feehan book.If you are looking for fun vampire romance in the first person then I suggest Mary Janice Davidson's \\"Undead and Unwed\\". That book is absolutely hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had to stop reading","review":"i purchased this book based on the good reviews it got and was completely disappointed! the heroine is annoying, her vampire is dull - i stopped reading half way because it kept putting me to sleep, literally!if katie macalister was going for fun romp, she needs to take some lessons from mary janice davidson - 'undead and unwed' or 'undead and unemployed'. even linsay sands does a better job in 'single white vampire', 'love bites' and 'tall dark & hungry'.or, for a more dark read, try emma holly in 'catching midnight' and 'hunting midnight. i enjoyed these most of all. hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution You MUST have a sense of humor to read this book!!","review":"Katie Macalister's latest is filled with action,a legion of pop culture references and a ton of comic relief. If you like to slide into a romance and hit autopilot this is not a book for you. There are quite a few scene changes, multiple characters that spring in for a chapter or two, lots of side plots, and one liners that sneak up and pop in on you.The characters are all incredibly down to earth, and realistic. They are wonderfully flawed and easy for the reader to relate to. Katie has a wonderful way of teaching the reader through the trials of the main character and her issues, to love themselves just as they are and see their true beauty.All in all a good read, a FUN read."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great book","review":"These two characters are in my heart, plain and simple.

If you read \\"Sex and the Single Vampire\\" first you will most certainly want to read \\"A Girls Guide to Vampires\\" and most of the mystery will be gone when you read it because they tie in together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"For all of you who loved this book I start out by saying that this is simply my opinion - Not Very Good. There were some funny moments in the book but I just couldn't connect with any of the characters - quite frankly they all seem like they were intellectually challenged. Beyond not caring a lick about the characters, I also found the plot to be a little lacking. It was a good idea for a book but I though it was poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Personally, I found the writing to be juvenile at best and just boring at the worst.

For all of you who felt for Christian, worry no more. Allegra is his perfect match. The book is fast-paced, action-packed, sexy and funny. Katie Macalister has truly outdone herself.

Everything that people have been posting has been true and more. The gameplay is awful, I guarantee you could play a half and point out at least 15 major problems. Also, if you're fantasy drafting a team why can't you get out before you have to watch the entire draft, hire a coaching staff, and go through training camp? Also, why is it that if you finish a season your young players are more likely to lose freestyle controls than gain them. I just had a team with dwight howard and andre iguodala and they improved in every category, howard lost his power and iguodala lost his outside stopper, what is the point of this? And whoever thought of the PDA idea should be shot. We all need to boycott future NBA Lives until EA Sports decides they want to make a quality game. That or bring back NBA jam, that game was sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Has The Fun Gone?","review":"I have only been playing NBA Live since 2003 but I must admit that 2003 & 2004 are the best looking games they have made. Superior graphics, moves, complaining to the refs and more made these games very entertaining. In 2004 your created players had faces that moved on and off the court, award ceremonies, stat screens and now for 2006 just this sour mugshot killer looking face appears representing your player. It seems that EA games is just trying to make a buck, this is the last game that I will buy. Save your money, buy a used copy or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NBA Live 04 & 05 are better","review":"this game isnt good at all... there isnt any defrent from last years. the grapichs the trailer and the comericals look way better than wat they really look like.. if u a big time NBA fan go ahead and get it it but i suggest renting it first"},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent reviewer","review":"This game is very average. I have gotten every EA Sports game for the past 5 years. I have always been happy except for the NBA series which i felt has been the same year after year. So instead of shelling out 40 bucks this year to buy the game i rented it hoping for something good. It was average exactly like the 05 version. I decided not to buy it. I read all the reviews and NBA 2k6 seemed like it was great game. I went out and bought it for 25 bucks and boy am i happy. It is 10x better the Live with better graphics and presentation. It is extremly realistic. Buy IT Not NBA LIVE"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 pointer!!!!","review":"Hello, I no say good English. I from Africa. I play this game at friend house. This game no fun.

The graphics are blurry, and the gameplay is a little bit choppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Basketball Game Ever!","review":"First of all, this games graphics are not much to write home about. And secondly, the gameplay is horrible. There are a few realistic movements, such as when you're in the post, but it is impossible to shake a defender. When you crossover and shake the defender and try to pull up and shoot, the defender has somehow made it back to his feet and in the air to defend your shot before you can get it off. I have been purchasing EA sports games since I was a kid on Sega Genesis. I think that this game is probably their worst game they have ever made period, all sport games included. I have also played the xbox 360 version, graphics are amazing, especially on an hdtv plasma, but the gameplay is just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT","review":"i own nba live 03 and it is 100 times better than nba live 06 because of the horible grafics in nba live 06. ps1 games have better grafics! here is my advice to youDO NOT BUY THE GAME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I thought NBA Live was gonna be great! but turns out i was ok. i mean ya it's got pretty good graphics and the dunks are nasty!.

Either this got forced out of the door too early by EA, or there was a manufacturing flaw; a friend picked this up last night, we played one game, and it was pretty fun; nice, crisp graphics, too.Went to play a second game, and it froze the PS2. Like a hard freeze, where you have to hold the button down for a few seconds to reboot the PS2 (not just a gentle \\"tap reset\\"). Figured it was just bad luck, until it happened the next time we tried to play two games in a row, as well.A fun game, if you only want to play one game of ball. Otherwise, that glitch makes for a very sour experience. If you're going to buy it anyway, you might want to pick it up from a local store so you can easily return it, multiple times if need be."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks","review":"just read through the reviews and you will learn all you need to about this game (aside from every 6th or 7th person who says its the best game ever made). defensive abilities are very limited. you can pretty much score at will from 15 feet or closer to the basket. mediocre players on other teams will torch you for 40 plus points. game play absolutely sucks, the set up of the dynasty mode sucks. the music and the announcers suck. don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"They get worse every year","review":"EA sports are going in reverse. The 99 version on playstation one was better. The graphics on this one haven't improved for 5 years, the camera angles aren't helpful and gameplay is unrealistic. I still own the playstation version from years ago and would rather play that. At least until a worthy substitute comes along. The only positive of this one is the career mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a phrasebook, not language instruction","review":"There's no guided language instruction here. It's just a collection of phrases that you may or may not find useful in certain situations. These are organized within a phrasebook, and the CDs contain audio recordings of native speakers saying the phrases so you can follow along. If you're going to Brazil, and you just want to memorize some canned phrases to use at the restaurant or the airport or while shopping, this book may be helpful for you. But if you're looking for more of a guided-instruction language learning resource, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davis has painted a vibrant and luminous picture!","review":"As an artist and a art historian, I was very pleased to get new insight into the story behind the painting Madame X and the people and places that surrounded her creation. As in The DaVinci Code, many mysteries were uncovered in an intriquing way (but without all of the running around). Bravo for writing a book that is accessible to artists and laypeople alike. Davis has painted a picture of the process the artist goes through when making decisions that remain on the canvas years after the artist and model are long gone. Worth taking the time to read the story and to see the beautiful reproductions of Sargent's paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Strapless is easy to read but contains too many detailed accounts which don't lend to the story. Is this a story of Virginie, the woman in the portrait, as one would assume from the beginning of the book? Or is it an account of John Singer Sargent's career, as told in the second half of the book? Neither story-line seems to take hold. No doubt that Sargent was extremely talented and now I do know the story behind the portrait as well as a picture of how Americans and artists lived in France during that period in history. But nearly all the characters in the book were shallow and uninteresting. I rushed through the book, wishing for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good start on a good subject, but lacking in many regards","review":"Overall, Davis is a competent writer, however, she lacks the imagination, orginality and insight of more established writers of non fiction or those newer nonfiction writers with a unique voice. The author has found herself a good subject with Madame X, but I was sorry that the story was not told by someone with a bit more insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sargent","review":"I thought this book was very well researched, however, I was disappointed to see that 30 pages are notes and bibliography in a book that is 310 pages in length. This book could also use another good edit for several 'snags' that I encountered. Otherwise it is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"After years of staring at Madame X and other Sargents at the Met and elsewhere, I realized I knew nothing of the people inside the portraits. This book brings the subjects of numerous pictures to life in a new and fascinating way. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Image","review":"When I was younger, I saw this image in an art book and, without reading anything about it, decided that it was a fasion plate from the 1950's. I picked this book up because I instantly remembered the white shoulder. Davis's book puts the painting in a cultural context that greately helped me understand it. There is a black and white print of people at an outdoor cafe on the day of the Salon in which Madame X appeared. The women are covered in bustles, multiple skirts, gloves and hats. I now understand what that audience found so dangerous about her wayward strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"One little strap! Love this true story!","review":"This is a wonderful 'history' book and very informative. A pleasure to read. It was interesting to learn about the 'politics' of getting work chosen for review or sale. The controversy this simple painting caused with one strap was significant and hypocritical to me, given it was well known men and women were 'visiting' each other in the late afternoon, enough so the corset makers eventually had to invent hooks and do away with the ribbons so that the women could re-dress faster after an afternoon 'visit!' The Minneapolis Institute of Art has some of Sanger's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tube blew upon inflation","review":"I was eagerly awaiting this purchase to get back on the road with my bike, so when the UPS man arrived, I immediately installed the tube.

Well written; especially like the prologue delivery and in-between scenes comments. Series highlights prison issues that cause concern. Enjoyed the moral stance interplay between the characters. Acting is terrific. Violent scenes cause some \\"I-can't- watch- this- moments\\".Sound quality at times difficult to understand dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Closed Captions.","review":"The description says Closed Captioning. The box has a CC emblem. The box says \\"Bonus Material is not rated or Closed Captioned\\". Actually, nothing is Closed Captioned. Tried several DVD players.

I paid $17. \\"Used - Like New\\" is selling for $10 with shipping, so I might get $7 back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Show","review":"This is one tough nail of a show -- it clearly shows that prison life is no picnic in the park. It's violent and has a lot of coarse language. Yet, it's also intelligent. It does make to walk the straight line so you don't end up like these guys. My only dislike is the character telling us very 15 minutes or so what we are looking at and what the moral of each story -- I think viewers are intelligent enough to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal, Graphic, Excellent","review":"Oz, HBO's first hour-long drama, tends to not get a lot of attention, mostly because of the wild success of \\"the Sopranos\\" and \\"Six Feet Under\\". But it is an excellent series. Prison really is the perfect place to set a drama series, because there's just so much drama inherent in the situation: violence, sexual abuse, mental illness, guilt, shame, redemption ... the list goes on and on. The writers and actors of \\"Oz\\" make excellent use of all the opportunities to explore the darker sides of human life. Aside from being an engrossing drama, \\"Oz\\" also serves as an excellent public service announcement, in a way ... because after watching a few episodes, a person would probably think twice about doing anything that could possibly put them in such a horrific situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maimum Entertainment","review":"I always thought it was hilarious when the guy who play Schillinger said in an interview that it's a little unsettling to hear himself described as the guy who plays the bad guy in a show set in a prison. I mean, aren't they all bad guys? But he does play a bad guy- the worst guy- and he plays him well.OZ is scary. Oz is uncompomising. And Oz is unstoppable. WHo'd have believed this show would last more than one season? It's a soap opera set in prison. Pretty near unresistable.The best part of this set is the unfolding of the Beecher Saga. And with voice-over from Lee, you get insight as to how the charactarization took form.You won't watch this just once."},{"rating":"2","title":"OZ-riffic","review":"Revolutionary, groundbreaking, intense drama. HBO proves, once again, it has the guts to provide an amazing quality of television for adults.Oz is a maximum security unit with an amazing cast of characters, all acting and interacting with each other to provide many, many, tense moments. Everyone absolutely shines in their roles, both convicts and officers, and the story never lets down for a moment. Lee Turgesen is amazing as a newbie prisoner, thrown into the hell his life will become, and arcs from victim to victimizer. Each character has an equally remarkable span, until the amazing ending that both is realisitic, and horrifying.Rent the DVDs, buy them, if you want to watch television story telling at it's finest. If only the networks had the chutzpah to broadcast this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A++++++++++++","review":"I just wanted to rate this high and remind everyone what a great price this now is. The purchase is so worth it - trust me. I would recommend purchasing the seasons two by two.

It is very graphic, but a very good show. This and The Wire were the only reasons I had HBO. One down side is that this season is only eight episodes. One of the best things about this series was the character development. Only gave four stars becasue of the length of the season, would have loved to see this one last a lot longer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series........","review":"Oz Season 1 was the first \\"season\\" of a tv show I ever owned.The show is amazing, the characters are very believable.

They made sure that the item would not be damaged.The movie was good shape, didn't skipp,or stop. However, the movie was edited. I was looking for the actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"To me, this is the least successful of the HBO series. There is admittedly a \\"can't watch just one\\" vibe to it, but more in a junkfood/beachbook kind of way. There doesn't seem to be much substance beneath the macho swagger and need to shock. Some of its concepts (like the Mafia element) are done better elsewhere (like the Sopranos). While 90% of the performances are admirable (with the unfortunate exception of a worthless Ernie Hudson) the writing is often clunky and cliched. And the \\"street philosophy from a guy in a wheelchair spinning in a glass cube\\" bits are painful. I wanted to like this show, really. I just couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared Straight for Adults","review":"Seasons 1 and 2 were the absolute best. This show is really scared straight for adults. I can only hope HBO releases seasons 2-4 (let's pretend 5 never happened) and revives the show with season 6.Great overall DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a wonderful show!","review":"I own and have watched every episode of OZ ranging from season 1-6. The story is compelling and very deep and of course for adult audiences only. I love how the characters unfold and progressively become more complex. This series portrays prison life as very brutal and unforgiving, but there is always a subtle reminder that these convicts are still humans with feelings and a heart. Season one starts off with a bang, and some of the annoyances are cleared up by season two. Save yourself the trouble and buy all the seasons when they are on sale through amazon. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Hearing Problem..... disappointment","review":"Im only writing this to warn anyone who has a problem hearing and needs closed caption.....

From the introduction of the naive lawyer Tobias Beecher (the magnificent Lee Tergesen), who is sent to Oz for vehicular manslaughter, to the transformation of Jefferson Keane from killer to faithful Muslim, Oz never fails to capture and captivate. The characters are fascinating. The storylines tight and riveting. Tom Fontana takes us on a wild ride and somehow manages to make us care about the criminals in this prison. It's storytelling at its best. The commentary provided by Tergesen and Fontana for the first two episodes gives insight to some of the behind-the-scenes decisions and is fascinating to listen to. For episode one, Tergesen and Fontana focus on individual scenes and characters, commenting and explaining each one. For episode two, they tend to ramble more generally and it's quite humorous and entertaining. Highly recommnded."},{"rating":"2","title":"OZ - A great series to have on DVD","review":"This HBO series is so addicting! The characters are original, and the stories and writing are unique and interesting. It's a very gripping show. There's not much on TV these days that I like, so having this on DVD is great.

She goes around saying that she is a Supreme. Give me a break! They have talent, but they are making a living out of a legacy that does not belong to them, especially Freddi. It rightfully belongs to Mary Wilson, an ORIGINAL Supreme, and the only one that cared about the group. Florence Ballard unfortunately is gone, and Diana Ross doesn't give a rat's behind about the Supremes. If it wasn't for Mary, Lynda (of all people) and Scherrie wouldn't be going around making money out of songs that rightfully belongs to and were recorded by Diana, Mary and Flo.

It heats up so fast - about a minute to its highest setting. It's very comfortable to use, comes with a custom funnel to put the water in the iron, and the steam function is great. I tried using the self-cleaning function, but I pressed the button and nothing happened, maybe I did something wrong, I didn't feel like reading the manual.

Being the two premier players of the American League all during this time, with DiMaggio getting the upper hand on Williams for most of the decade, would've loved to have seen how each one of them fed off of each other with regards to individual and team accomplishments. And given the \\"Red Sox\\" connection with him and Ted Williams, would've liked to have seen how this played out with his brother Dom (who was a great outfielder with the BoSox during this decade as well).

Not only that but I was surprised to read well known and basic information about foods, herbs and exercises. I expected something really new and hard to find for such a steep price but that's not the case. The \\"natural\\" ways for enlargement of your manliness include the widely popular stretching and jelking exercises that can easily damage your body. Moreover, there are numerous grammar and spelling mistakes all over the text. Over all I was very disappointed and it seems that the \\"real people\\" give this \\"book\\" not more than 2 stars. I strongly advise you to consider a more valuable, professionally made and properly priced book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of money","review":"Got this book shipped to me because I was curious. Most of the content looks like they have been compiled from the internet and it is shodilly manufactured and comes in a 3 ring binder. Not worth your money. It is a rip off"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Rip","review":"Please take my advice and avoid this text. It's a binder with shoddy printed pages that's chock-full of vague information. There is absolutely nothing in here that you can't find on the internet. Also, it's absolutely full of grammatical errors, type-os, etc. Why trust your sexual well being to a text that's blatantly erroneous?

When you go to a doctor does he tell you that you should feel ashamed from your problem?! I bought the book anyway only to discover the same milking techniques from the penis enlargement sites. OK, I started them and after 1 week I got some kind of red spot on my penis's head. Of course, I immediately discontinued the massages and consulted with my doctor. Hopefully I was very reserved and practiced the techniques only few times so the damage was not permanent. The doctor told me that the penis is not a muscle which can be exercised or mechanically stretched without damaging/breaking it. I do NOT recommend using these techniques as the only result can be as serious problem as impotence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous recommendations!","review":"I just wanted to inform you that the anonymous author of this book recommends jelqing, vacuum pumps, etc. proven dangerous techniques and exercises. The information regarding health problems is very basic and easily available for free online.

There is simply no way anyone can be satisfied with such an imitation of a book especially when there are other books at acceptable price which are a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a fraud!!!!!","review":"First of all, I'd like to thank Amazon! I had never imagined that my package would be delivered so fast!!!Talking about the \\"book\\", I can say that after opening it,the main feeling that ocurred to me was frustration. I can't consider this \\"thing\\" as a book. It looks like a young-boy homework... It's terrible. The printing is so bad that you think it was printed by those cheap ink jet printers... The paper of the \\"book\\" goes the same way. Poor, poor quality. I would forget all these problems if the contents were valuable, but it's pure nonsense! Every single word can be found on those internet penis enlargement sites... There isn't a single picture and the explanations are vague.If you take care of your money, don't be deceived. Don't buy this \\"book\\". Now, I think to myself how I could be so stupid on buying this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No pumps, no pills\\"- just the opposite","review":"I was shocked. I don't know who the author is but he has many and very good reasons to hide his name. The main point is that the book offers \\"new\\" information BUT he does recommend many pills and even vacuum pumps, which are notorious. Otherwise, it is the old jelq and stretch, which is also well known that it is not an effective approach but in some cases causes damages to the delicate penile tissue. He must be kidding given the 40 bucks and 100 pages of actual content, which is well known information, and at least half of it is available online for free, while the rest is at best neutral but can be harmful. Given also the poor quality of the book itself I am very disappointed. I expected at least a decent book with at least something new in it but I should have guessed that I cannot expect detailed, valuable and new health-related information from someone who doesn't even mention his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the other reviews...","review":"Those who gave the book the most stars wrote short, contrite, cliche\` comments which, like the book, have spelling and grammatical errors.

You could read everything about the products recommended from the advertisements for them in the back of men's magazines, or hear it on the late night infomercials.Instead of this one, I would recommend:Anytime...for as Long as You Want: Strength, Genius, Libido & Erection by Integrative Sex Transmutation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you so much!","review":"I stopped going out to the bar, I stopped going out anywhere!

As the story continues we race through the pages trying to discover will Mary give everything up for love."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not live up to hype","review":"I must admit I am only halfway through this book, but it is such a chore after the moving experience of Birdsong. The characters remind me of the paper dolls I played with as a child. They belonged to an older cousin, and all came with 1955 era paper clothes. I know exactly what the characters in this novel are wearing: Mary's dresses and sweaters, Franks hats and shoes. But as with the paper dolls, if I am to get through this book, I am going to have to flesh them out myself, as Faulks does not seem to be able to do it for me. This is an overresearched, underwritten book, and yes, Sebastian, you've learned just what New York was like in 1959. Now give us a plot and some characters to go with it. That said, the character of Charlie has some heart, but even in Birdsong, Faulks's female characters were two-dimensional. I haven't given up on it, though. I pray for a twist ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This It?","review":"Whatever the setting, whatever the personalities involved, whatever the class/background/idiosyncrasies of those involved, what this book does is confront sensitively and passionately the theme of 'Is This It??' The theme which happily-married-with-children couples are wont to consider when they achieve their social, familial and professional ambitions.What Faulks does supremely well is make Mary a sympathetic character, despite 'having it all' and wanting more.She invents passion for someone she hardly knows because she can't bear to accept that her life is settled and comfortable and she will never again know the excitement of discovery. All 40+ women who read this will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On Green D0olphin Street","review":"What a shocker. This book had to be the most boring book I have read in years. There are so many issues Faulks could have pursued yet he left every one of the hanging. What about alcoholism, diplomacy, politics, adultery, etc. This is certainly not up to par with past endeavor. It is nothing more than a trite love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"I REALLY wanted to like Shooter Jennings' music, but try as I might, I can't. It's so forgettable and tired. Hank III is so much cooler, fresher, and not to mention, better looking. And Joe Buck rocks, too! Skip this crap--even if you love Waylon as much as I do. Buy Hank III or Wayne the Train instead. Besides, what kind of outlaw drives a Cadillac Escalade?? A poser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting the 'O' back in Offull","review":"Wow, this guys is nothing like his daddy. Its like really bad rock and really bad pop country went to dinner and later went home and pooped out Shooter Jennings. This is really really bad. This is as far away from outlaw country as you can get. Stay away from this album like it's the plague. If you want to here a real Outlaw country album, try some Wayne the Train or some Hank III, or go back to the classics, and get some old George Jones, Lefty Frizzell, Dave Dudley, Del Reeves, Hank Sr, Ernest Tubb. But stay away from this. When You can play Shooter on a station that you can also play Celine Dion & Justin Timberlake on, you know its pure crap. I would rate it a 0 star if I could"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star Because 0 is Not An Option","review":"The old saying \\"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree\\" does not apply here. In the case of Shooter Jennings the apple fell off the tree rolled down the hill...rotted...rolled into a stream...and fell off from a waterfall. This very well may be one of the worst cd's ever as far as lyrics are Concerned. It has some of the lamest lines to any songs and it seems to me as if he tried to bring in all of his Daddy's friends to show off his \\"connections\\". They make fun of his stuff on the cd and it is supposed to be like a joke, only I KNOW these guys were not kidding. This crap sucks. The music is not all bad but a lot of the songs have lines that just seem too long and he has to stumble around to make all the lines fit...which they still do not. Waylon Jennings was a master, his son is a disaster. don't buy this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad and very dissapointing","review":"I was hoping for a whole lot more. Very bad, not recomended. I don't care who your daddy is, crappy music is crappy music.Save your time and money and go buy a Hank Williams SR, JR or, more importantly, III album (February 28th H Williams III album comes out, Straight To Hell, much recomended by me).Shooter tries and fails to be a Southern Rock Outlaw tough buy. It just doesn't work.

Call Shooter a baby Waylon, whatever,I call him bandwagon. This CD is like listening to paint dry. Hank III is playin real country like his grand-dad did 50 something years ago. Pick up Lovesick Broke & Driftin'by III or better yet, Straight to Hell and have a nice day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin'","review":"Wow--What a great freshman effort by Waylon's kid. Distinctivly Shooter w/ subtle influences of his father, Cash and Hank...this one delivers. Favorites are: 4th of July, Sweet Savannah and Lonesome Blues.

It is a country album and a rock 'n' roll album at the same time. That's fine with me since I like both genres, but don't get the idea that it sounds like Waylon, because it doesn't. This guy's doing his own thing, and I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shooter Jennings","review":"I am enjoying the music from this CD.

GREAT BUY, its a \\"gotta have\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If not for '4th of July' it would not be worth 1 star","review":"CMT's play of '4th of July' really had me exited about this album. I bought this album with reasonable expectations as it is a debut album, but I was not prepared at all for the absolutly horrible album. The writing is subpar, there are no catchy hooks (except for the aforementioned '4th'. The 'outlaw' factor seems very contrived and is just not believable. I loved Waylon's music and what he stood for, but the reason we remember him is because his music was different and not in the mold. Shooter is trying to fit and 'outlaw mold' and the result is just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPY POP COUNTRY","review":"This cd is horrible. Please don't buy it. The music is very average Nashville garbage. It sounds no different than the crap you will hear on country radio. How can Shooter say that he is trying to \\"put the O back in country\\" and tour with Toby Keith? If you want to hear real country please check out Hank III's Lovesick, Broke and Driftin."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap stay away from this album!!","review":"Shooter Ain't a pimple on his Daddys ass. This Album sucks. Crappy songs crappy music. I love the outlaws and I am a huge Ragweed fan but its just another case of a guy treading around in music on his fathers name and reputation.

I thought tracks 2, 3, and 6 were really excellent. (I don't know who that chick Savannah is but she obviously tore somebody's heart clean apart.) All other tracks range from average to pretty good, which is not too shabby for a breakout album (or, for that matter, any other album these days). In fact, I'd say this is an unusual case these days where buying the album is a better option than buying individual tracks from iTunes.

Let me say that he does not dissappoint. The strongest track on the album is \\"4th of July\\" and you'll be singing it after listening to it just 2 or 3 times. Shooter brings a fresh, raw, wonderful sound to country that only suggest that we can expect great things from. Pick this album up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Country from a Real Artist","review":"This is an unbelievable debut by Shooter! If country radio didn't have record companies' money determining what gets airplay, Shooter could pick up where his daddy left off.

But when I saw it for the first time, I thought it was a good movie, but why name it Cannibal Apocalypse? There were a few scenes that showed the infected soldiers bite people, but they mostly used their hands or weapons to kill people. Other than that, it was a good movie. Also, it is worth it checking the extras that come along with the movie, especially Cannibal Apocalypse Redux. It interviews two of the stars and the director about how the movie was handled and so forth, especially the part that Quentin Tarantino thinks of this as one of his favorite movies ever. Also, it shows an alternate version of the movie that was edited on video here in the US. However, if you want the check out the Butchering of Cannibal Apocalypse option, you might want to come closer to read the text because of its small print. Other than that, good movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear!!truly corny!!","review":"back in the 80's here in england before video censorship this was one of the \\"video nasties\\" i didn't get to see:still banned in the u.k and i have to ask \\"why?\\"!!!some average acting,weak on the story dept(were you expecting one though?),and distinctly lacking in the horror dept:by todays standards the gore factor is low,hey!if you like blood,guts and horror watch private ryan,we were soldiers,band of brothers.this film,like a lot of these type of films,is only interesting if you want to re-live your youth,and catch up with what scared you way back when!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was cannibal holocaust","review":"This movie was kinda boring.

The features on this DVD alone make it worth buying, but the film isn't half bad either. It's a zombie/cannibal film that follows your typical outbreak scenario. Saxon is good as usual. There is an infamous sewer splatter sequence that is supposed to MAKE the film, but was sadly cut from all previous Amercian releases. This is kind of a take on DOTD, but don't expect much.

Many different fragrances. And it was less than ten dollars for 18 oz. Top quality. Find a friend who lives near a TJ and have them ship you one of each scent. I got the Tangerine, as the Lavendar was too strongly scented. They don't sell it on the internet.* One Minute Manicure. The classic, original best scrub there is.

I don't like the way it is organized, and it does not really give any exceptional insights into the concept of teaching beyond what is contained in my other textbooks. I will more than likely keep it on my self, but I don't think it will be one of my go-to reference books."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Fan Movie Review","review":"If you are looking for a video that has a ton of great songs and a lot of behind the scenes talks with the Gallagher brothers, I strongly suggest this video.

I recomend this movie to anyone who wants a good music selection and interviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Oasis at their peak!","review":"Oasis have been around for 14+ years now, but by far their best stuff was released between 1994 and 1996, the double-shot genius of \\"definitely maybe\\" and \\"morning glory\\", plus all the great b-sides in between. IMO, at that time comparisons with the Beatles were well-earned: No act since the Fab Four had released so many good songs in so short a period of time.Thus, this DVD, recorded in 1996, captures the band at their absolute commercial and artistic peak. All the great songs from the first two records are here, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound is perfect.No rock and roll fan should be without this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this video!","review":"Oasis should be even more popular than they already are.

I did not get to see their English shows, but did catch them stateside, and what an amazing thing it was to see this band, five guys on a stage, with guitars, no ridiculous special effects (a la Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd) - just playing brilliant music with brilliant attitude. This film, capturing two English performances from the era, is a time capsule of what Oasis' early brilliance and what made us love them before they went a bit crazy. Never have they sounded better live than the Maine Road performance captured here. To be honest, I do not think I have ever heard better live rock and roll than the Maine Road show. Highly recommended, even to non-Oasis fans, for the exhibition of the rock show as power musical performance, rather than effects-laden side show. Absolutely brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story!","review":"When I bought this book, I didn't know how touching it would truly be. The main characters; Sarabeth, Leo, Pepper, Cynthia, Billy, Jane Silver, and many more, really get to you whether or not you can empatize with their pain. It's one of those situations where you think the main role in the story has been through enough already, maybe too much. But of course, the author has to give an upgrade on the suffering. Who would suspect a 29 year old mother to die of a heart attack? The sudden death changes Sarabeth's entire heart and soul, but she finds that everything happens for a reason, and maybe the truth of tragedy can shine through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Schaum's COLLEGE Chemistry instead","review":"I bought this and the Schaum's \\"College Chemistry\\" to get my HS son up to speed for his HS Honors Chemistry course.

You cant get your horse to halt right away and so you lose points right at the beginning. The cross country course was okay and so was the showjumping.

While the accompanying cd does include a full color version of the book which I originally expected to be the print version, now if I want a color, printed copy, I will have to take the cd to a printer and probably pay another 35 or 40 bucks to have it printed. It does state in the description of the book that it is printed in black and white and I foolishly didn't read that far down before I bought it. So buyers, read the description carefully and be aware that the printed copy you will receive is in BLACK AND WHITE.

With many Christian authors, you know pretty much what to expect; you can place them in neatly-defined categories. Not so with Capon; he is a maverick free-thinker which means he's going to challenge the reader with his unique perspective. Here's my theory on Capon: no one reading him will agree with everything he says (there's bound to be something to bother you), and no one reading him will walk away un-blessed. Genesis:the Movie is a fine example of his fresh approach. And who said theology had to be stuffy? The scholarship is all there, but RFC's books read like an engaging discussion in a coffee-shop. They are full of life! I so appreciated his well-reasoned thoughts on this \\"book of beginnings\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typically unconventional ride","review":"Robert Capon's \\"Genesis: the movie\\" is a typically unconventional Capon ride. What makes the book most interesting (and this is true of his work generally)is that for all of its \\"unconventionality,\\" it is born of a deep and foundational theological orthodoxy; I can't think of the last time I read a new book that worked so extensively with Augustine! Even the sections that might make some self-proclaimed orthodox readers shudder (and here I would highlight his idea of God's \\"ecology of good and evil\\")are rooted in a wrestling with the deep traditions of Jewish and Christian biblical interpretation. Besides, I know of few theological writers who have so much fun doing theology, and that has to be worth a great deal in a discipline that can easily become dry and dusty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from his best","review":"I have read virtually everything Capon has written starting with Supper of the Lamb 25+ years ago and would rate most 4-5 stars.

I need not have worried. It falls into the great SF tradition of novels that do not sacrifice emotional depth or plot complexity merely because the hero is not yet full-grown. While the book does indeed qualify as a \\"coming of age\\" novel, it is not written simplisticly, nor is the young protagonist portrayed as a fool--he knows how much he doesn't know, and when he makes mistakes, he does so intelligently. The story is enriched by a number of mysteries, only some of which are resolved by the end. I am hoping that this is not stand-alone, and that there will be follow-up novels in this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite read that leaves you wanting more","review":"If you enjoy reading coming of age novels then this book in the Liaden Universe is for you.

I kept checking the cover to see if it was really by my favorite authors. I thought the plot was slow and simple, and without any real dynamic thrust. It had almost no tension to speak of, and although the characters were likeable, a novel really does require more than that. I was terribly disappointed and wondered what the authors were thinking when they cranked out this manuscript, or if their editors had any ideas other than just getting another book on the shelf.

It will go right on the bookshelf next to the others.Unlike the Tomorrow Log, whose main characters I found completely unlikeable, Master Trader Van Deelin, Jethri, and the young dramliza twins held my interest, from the beginning of the read on Saturday night to its close on Sunday afternoon.To anyone who was disappointed by the Tomorrow Log, or Low Port, I say: come back and read this, the facinating and honorable characters that Sharon Lee and Stephen Miller created before have been delightfully added to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and outdated","review":"This book's lodging listings are so inaccurate as to be a serious potential inconvenience for the traveler.

She can play with it over and over, since it doesn't stick to surfaces. And if the colors all get mixed together it's like a big ball of candy sprinkles. Looks very pretty, instead of looking like some ugly mess that you get with play dough or other playing compounds. She wanted Floam, but that is a gooey sticky mess so her mom said no. I found this and it was even better! It kind of reminds me of rice crispy treats, how the marshmallows kind of string away as you break them into pieces, only not so sticky.

If some is left on the floor or couch, it will stick to whatever it touches although you can easily get it off. It doesn't stick to things and not come off. It really is great. You cannot mold this and expect it to stay in one shape like clay.

I couldn't have been more wrong. The packaging makes it look like you can mold all these amazing shapes with it. I guess if you spent hours upon hours you could make that happen...but a 4 year old won't stick around long enough for that (and neither would I).

The queen of Mars has usurped the throne and turned her enemies into \\"clay men.\\" But behind it all is Ming the Merciless. Lots of fun! But remember, with all these serials, the viewer had better not ask questions (like how is it everyone speaks English, or why can you fly from planet to planet and never worry about Oxygen or temperature).

Luckily, friends talked me into reconsidering, and I ended up having the procedure. I went from 20/400 to 20/15, better than perfect! This book really traumatized me.

I thought it had many good ideas for inspiring writing and getting the creative process flowing; however, I found none of them novel. I am not only a voracious reader but also avid attender of writing classes and workshops. I earmarked this book at the top of my list because I thought that the reviews were great and the title was clever. I was immediately inspired and excited to get into the book. Once I started the book, I realized that I would have preferred to read a bit more before I stopped to workshop. For me, the exercises became tedious and it was difficult to continue my flow from book to paper. I suppose for the beginning writer who has never taken a workshop, this book may be a great introduction and very helpful. If you have taken many workshops you may find the process cumbersome if not remedial. I was too frustrated to finish the book and am taking another writing workshop class instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An innovative book for writing ideas","review":"I have been writing off and on for years and taken writing workshops. The format I am sure is useful to beginning writers, but I found her writing suggestions to be novel and really got the creative juices flowing once again. The great thing about the assignments was that the writing went a totally different direction then what I thought it might do at the beginning. There were even times I thought, 'I can't do this,' but somehow deep within myself I found ideas I didn't know existed with true feelings. I have used several of her techniques to give a rewrite some new oomph. The writing truly took over and you got into a \\"zone.\\" The only thing better than this book is taking the internet class with Ms. Ayers and getting wonderful insight and feedback from her and classmates.

Apparently, \\"tragic\\" is a politically correct, so she will consider him that, but not \\"sociopathic\\" which was Bill O'Reilly's opinion of a man so abandons his child.

He was a womanizer, a polygamist and an alcoholic. He was not only a misogynist, he was also a misanthrope. He had tremendous intelligence and talent which he allowed to go completely to waste. Stanley Ann Durham was just a casualty along the way, and the President himself was just one of a total of eight children that Barack Obama Sr. fathered but took no part in raising. The President has expressed regret that the first book he wrote was a memoir of the parent who abandoned him and not a celebration of the parent who raised him.

Maybe a smile occasionally, but no laughs certainly. I kept wondering, what on earth is this book about?? When I was nearing the finish (a mighty 600 pages), I rushed to see what the main point was, but as I half-heartedly predicted, there was no answer. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY enjoyed this story! I was frequently flabbergasted by the strange, surreal, quirky happenings! There seemed to be meanings in everything, but not without taking some time to think about it, for the meanings weren't thrown in your face. So much went on that I feel as though I've read five books! I CAN say that this book is the life story of a man named Herbert Badgery. You will not soon forget this name, nor the abundance of bizarre characters in \\"Illywhacker\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"lyrically, weirdly composed","review":"I love this book. (I love Peter Carey generally, and especially here.)Many of the reviewers have confessed a certain bafflement when confronted with Carey, both in this novel and elsewhere. This is not, I think, because his prose is stylistically off-putting, or his themes too profound or personal.Rather, Carey's novels are constructed in an unconventional manner, and that novelty, I think, confuses: each of his many chapters serves as a floating, almost separate episode. The cumulative effect is less that of linked stories than linked prose poems. The reader does not feel caught up in a forward moving narrative, but instead awash, for lack of a better word. Sort of like Bruno Schulz.Beautiful, beautiful, haunting, haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thematically brilliant but poorly written.","review":"Illywhacker is an almost surreal novel and therefore has both strong and weak points. This 600-page decription of the Badgery clan is peopled by extraordinary, larger-than-life characters and touches onto very real themes and ideas - from the opening (\\"my name is Herbert Badgery and I am a liar\\") to the bizarre but poignant conclusion, Carey explores dozens of fascinating themes.The only disappointment is the writing itself. Sometimes painfully difficult to read, it is mundane and long-winded, full of unnecessary passages and incidents. None of the characters are highly sympathetic, and the reader never feels involved in their lives. And while the themes concerned are almost all interesting, he dwells relentlessly on many of them and they lose their novelty.A book not for the easily frustrated, it is so weakly-written and mundane that it is easy to lose sight of the originality and insight that lies beneath the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Geography of the Great War","review":"An excellent introduction to the geography of the Great War. Until reading Back to the Front, I hadn't had a good mind-picture of the countryside that formed the stage for WW I. Whether reading fictional accounts or the occasional history, I found myself quite familiar with the names but not the spatial relationships of one great battle to the next. By actually walking the Western Front, O'Shea becomes a human reference point: his simple walking pace brought Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge, Messines and all those familiar names into proportion. For example, Passchendaele is withing walking distance of Ypres; maybe 10 km away.The passage of time also is quite interesting. O'Shea walked and visited the Western Front some 70 to 80 years after. The Essex Farm Cemetery where McCrae was inspired to write \\"In Flanders Fields\\" is \\"almost in the shadow of a traffic cloverleaf.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Of The Year","review":"This book has been selected by our panel of scholars as one of the three best First World One works of the year. Highly Recommended. First World War Orde"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Hiker","review":"At least on the book jacket the publishers had the accuracy of noting that the author is a pacifist. His leftist arrogance is astounding, with his condescending views of those who are interested in history (geeks). His sneering little commentaries, including that regarding United States Veterans objections to the apologetic Smithsonean exhibit on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, demonstrate a typically adolescent and shallow-minded view of actual historical facts. I'm sure he his anti-military colleagues are quite thrilled with this volume. He needs to grow up, leave behind his 1960's emotionally-laden logic, and examine actual facts. And because you had a couple of great uncles who made a great sacrifice during the Great War, does not place you in any sort of elevated position in which to judge the military with 20-20 hindsight. I'm glad he found a reason to justify his hiking trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A maudlin ant-war editorial.","review":"Mr. O'Shea starts with a wonderful concept - to walk the line of trenches from WWI and describe their location, history and present condition. Unfortunately, the book quickly degenerates into an ever-lengthening editorial against war and history's war leaders. With the clear view of hindsight - which he spends a page justifying - the author judges the generals of 1916 by the standards and knowledge of 1996. His pontificating becomes boring.Unforgivably, he also expresses his contempt and disdain for the amateur historians who purchase his book and line his pockets. Fortunately, this is partly compensated for by the inclusion of a list of references that far better meet the needs of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great subject but no sense of time, place or history","review":"The other two negative reviews have hit the nail perfectly on the head.

O'Shea makes no claim that he is an historian but his sense of humanity and compassion make this book worthy of a place alongside the finest of Great War historical studies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixture of profundity and arrogance","review":"The author of this book understands--or at least grew to understand--the power of places. And he conveys that power thoughtfully and with occasionally wonderful prose. For these reasons, you should read this book. The problem with this book is that the author writes as though he alone possesses the wisdom and experience to divine the significance and meaning of these places. The characters (more properly charicatures) who dash across his pages--fishermen (\\"psychotic\\" onces, of course), familiies, students of history, tourists, locals--all seem to possess some psychological or emotional disability that (to the author) renders their interaction with the battlefields somehow trivial, or even comical. By book's end, therefore, the only character left standing who can fathom the depth and meaning of the places is the author. It is an astonishingly arrogant chronicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, full of personal biases, little value","review":"I thought this might be an excellent companion while touring the sites where brave men died for their respective countries. Instead it was full of personal left-wing biases, that made the book hard to read. Had I been able to read the book deeper prior to purchase, I would not have waisted my money. Sgt York a hick? That comment of his boggles one's mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased waste of time","review":"O'Shea takes an opportunity to write a useful traveler's guide to the Western Front and completely blows it by spewing a volume of drivel that maligns anyone and everyone who ever wore a uniform. His pacifist leanings may have been tolerable if they had been left on the sidelines, but instead they pollute every page, preaching rather than informing.What can be gained by calling Sgt Alvin York a \\"yokel\\" and \\"hick\\"? By calling 1917's mass mutinies the French Army's \\"finest hour\\"? The answer is the same as what can be gained by reading this book - absolutely nothing.As a previous reviewer stated, the only part of this book that is worth the paper it is printed on, hence a generous two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a wretched book!","review":"Travel commentaries are great, usually, and this one was a great idea as he started out to honor his grandfathers who fought in WWI. However, instead of honoring history he ended up maligning his grandfather's generation. This is no history! This is just uncontrollable anger. I have never in my life found one who doesn't have a good word for Sergeant Alvin York but O'Shea can't find even one. But ... soldiers have fought and died for centuries so that O'Shea can write whatever he wants.I, for one, don't even want his book on my shelf. If anybody wants my copy, let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author lacks the compassion for the veterans.","review":"O'Shea is more interested in making glib comments and sarcastic insights than in detailing the trenches of today with the history and death that they saw. It is easy for any of us to say what was useless and unnecessary and to view those who laid down their lives with contempt. It is harder to break the war down to its human element...each man who fought. If one is looking for a narrative on this war without the intellectual haughtiness of one who has never enlisted in the military then avoid this book and pray O'Shea is not in your regiment in case of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is DEFINITELY NOT a historian!","review":"I purchased this book with the idea that I might get some more insight into the tragedy of WW1. While O'Shea DID grant me some new insights, I was extremely put off by his attacks on all miltary (professional soldiers are all idiots), historians (geeks), etc. Also, (and to some this may seem petty) his factual errors on minor areas (eg, he says Rickenbacker had 23 kills) and comparing Little Big Horn to My Lai, lead to question what other statements of fact he makes may also be questionable. I feel that overall I wasted my money on this purchase. Those who MAY enjoy the book would include pseudo-intellectual leftists who still think this is the 1960's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boomer blows it","review":"This is a reductionist view of WW I seen through the eyes of a smug baby boomer who by his own admission has just discovered history. O'Shea has reduced this complex and horrific war--and its major actors--to a simple morality play. The prose is often purple and the tone of the book is self-righteous and contemptuous. I would agree with O'Shea that war is bad, and WW I was especially so, but this book offers no insights beyond these platitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful trek across the Western Front","review":"Mr O'Shea's epic trek across the western front, from Nieport to the last battered cement blockhouse on the Swiss border is a treat to read as we follow his 600 mile journey. This young Canadian's unique style of detailing the once terrible battles and the current condition of the scores of villages, towns and earthworks captures his own thoughts and that of history.An excellent means of learning more about the battles and the men who endured the worst war in history. Plenty of humor and some rather sad comments on some of his observations. I wish I had the time to follow in his footsteps for this would be a journey of a lifetime.The only regret I have is that there were no photographs, which would have enriched this book.Worth reading and learning from, a great treat for a rainy weekend or a long holiday or flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accidental Historian?","review":"Accidental yes.

Hoping to enjoy a leisurely vacation, they go camping with friends. Their fun is interrupted by escaped convicts, Russians, bad weather, and near misses. The majority of the book takes place over about 24 hours and this reader's legs had sympathy pains for Dez as she ran non-stop to find Jay.Typical of Lake's other books, this one was very well written and drew me in. The only reason I gave it 4 stars insead of 5 is I prefer books that lean more on the romance than the action. If you like action, this book's for you.

How could they possibly screw that up? Well, apparently they found a way. The first few minutes did an excellent job of setting the tone, but unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. Cheesy acting, horrible effects, and a head-desk-inducing plot ruined what could've been a great movie. Heck, even the Cthulhu couldn't save this movie!I picked this up really looking forward to it, but I was disappointed beyond belief. A horror movie designed around a funeral home should be easy to write. Instead they went in some weird directions that made no sense. Now I know why it was so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low blow","review":"A noisy, shabby attempt at horror, if Tobe Hooper's name wasn't attached to it would anyone give it a second glance?The humor doesn't work, that minimal cast doesn't help, the plot doesn't amount to anything fresh or new. When things finally begin to happen there's just a lot of screaming and running amuck in dark chambers. This doesn't automatically translate into scares. And let's not forget that cheat of an ending, when the dead aren't really dead (as a matter of convention and convenience). Not worth the five bucks I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribable","review":"I like Tobe Hooper films. This one was good but far from great. I'm not sure if this is suppose to be a zombie movie or what? People are walking around like they are dead. Maybe the word reanimated is better than zombie. Denise Crosby stars in it.

That's tough because you get the high profile ones (which are few)and the low budget ones that you never have heard of; there are lots of these. There wee about 5 or 6 to choose from but I chose this one becaue of Tobe Hooper (may his career rest in piece) and because of Denise Crosby. Why I don't know since she hasn't done anything good since she thought she was moving on to big and better things by leaving Star Trek The Next Generation.About ten minutes in, I knew I had made a bad choice.

There are old coffins in the livingroom, bars on the windows, a graveyard for a lawn, and an ultra-fast growing black fungus on the walls! Things quickly go south as mum sets up shop in the basement morgue. You see, the fungal growth isn't just mold, it's smart and eeevil! It also has the ability to re-animate the dead! I'm sure you can imagine the problems this may cause once the town's cadavers start arriving for preparation. I enjoyed most of this movie, though some of the stuff near the end was goofy.

This movie and many like it these days are just not scary.Sometimes with very bad films, they are so bad they are funny, which is worth the time to watch just for that. Not so here.The problem is that the storyline is so far out that there is no feeling that this could ever happen to anyone. The gratuitous gore and muck only solidify this opinion.Whatever happened to less is more?The acting is fine if you discount the ridiculous laughing man and the silly sheriff, but the best acting in history could not overcome this storyline.I often wonder with very bad movies what the people who do the final editing and review think about before they release something like this. Can they actually believe it is good? More likely they are stuck and have to get whatever money they can out of it. Too bad for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty quirky and fun","review":"Tobe Hooper has always done his films how he wanted...and it shows here. Although most of the reviewers here would have you believe this film is terrible, it really is not. It isn't a masterpiece, but it does ddeliver black comedy and some thrills along the way.If you liked The Covenant with Addrienne Barbeau, you'll like this off the wall entry.

His improvisational skills are by far technically and melodically unmatched by anyone I've heard, whether it be Greg Phillinganes, George Duke, Herbie Hancock, Dave Grusin, Chick Corea, etc. Although this CD (along with the last couple) is off his beaten path of synthesizers and samplers, which has made him a \\"Jazz Fusion\\" artist, it's definitely a welcomed change.

I will probably order ANOTHER copy of the book (this time through amazon.com) and hope that this copy isn't defective. Because of the difficulty in getting a response from the publisher, I recommend ordering through a reputable retailer like amazon.com (which focuses on customer service as a priority)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eargasm","review":"Wow, Wow, and... Wow.This album is legend. An absolute must have for any true trance fan. Nu NRG explodes into the music scene with unheard of potency. I would pay a hundred bucks for this CD any day, and I've never said that about an album before. I don't see how anyone of any musical taste could not take at least some pleasure from this album, and if you love trance, especially instrumental melodic trance, this is IT. This is without a doubt my favorite electronic artist album of all time, not to mention one of the best albums ever made. Nu NRG is just that: Nu NRG. unique, powerful, beautiful, melodic, driving...EARGASMIC. They are number one on my list of artists i hope to see live, and if i have to go to Italy to do so i will. Freefall builds up with beautiful ambiance to a force of trance only hinted at in the past. Its very difficult to try to use words to explain the musical genius that is Nu NRG, so all i can say is that if you only buy one CD this year, make it Freefall."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Quality tools, prompt delivery, works as advertised.

Getting them apart again is difficult if you don't have great hand strength and impossible once the bars begin to rust. Ours went to the trash totally intact after 1 month because we couldn't get it apart again. And we stored it in the garage after each use outside.

This book not only failed to mention some of the most famous ghosts (and minimized even the Jersey Devil!!) but it included some information that was outright wrong. It also included stories that aren't even about ghosts, some aren't even about New Jersey!!

This one did not disppoint me--very action packed! It was set in Pierce Brosnan's native Ireland. Here he plays Mark Taffin a rather hardcore debt collector, that gets the job done. He is a loner with a conscience and heart, though. Taffin gets himself involved with the town's people because of these abilities and they need a person who could go to bat for them against a big business that was going to destroy their beloved sportsfield to make way for a harmful chemical plant. Pierce was at his best in this action movie. A great, but obscure movie for Pierce and just plain good entertainment.

It's pretty much the same as 05. The gameplay, the graphics, the players, the features (well some). Now the one feature that impressed me was the freestyle players. You got Power (Shaq), Shooter (Dirk), Scorer (T Mac), Stopper (Ben Wallace) and of course Highflyer (Vince Carter). There are a number of players who have these specialties and they can be very useful during a game. If you have these five specialties, then you're unstoppable. But that would be cheating.As for those people who are new to these games, I'll just get to the point. The controls are simple and easy to get used to, the graphics are awesome and it's actually realistic (most of the time).Overall, if you're a NBA or basketball fan or just like sports, then I suggest that you buy this game.

With her music, Ms. Harjo makes a beautiful bridge between the very old and traditional and the new and modern- a sax moaning three-o-clock-in-the-morning sounds, \\"I Release You\\" with a hip-hop feel.

This means that an entire section of knowledge is crammed into two pages. Add in that half of a page is usually used for a picture and you end up with a book full of theorems but lacking in substance. These aren't even formulas per say but instead are chapters filled with starting points.

As I get deeper into the illustrated history of the Tower and read the souvenir guide book, I'm sure that I will learn a lot from its bloody past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I owned this camera for maybe a year before the battery compartment cover broke.After that I used a piece of electrical tape to secure the compartment since it wouldn't stay shut and kept dropping the batteries out from the bottom.After about another year and a half,the whole camera became useless.Everytime I go to take a picture,it shows nothing but black on the display.I have tried changing every setting I possibly could and went to the Kodak troubleshooting info. on their site and it told me there was nothing else I could do but send it in for repair.For a 2 Mega pixel camera with 2x zoom it's not even worth paying for the repair because nowadays you can get much more for less money.It's now useless.I'm very disappointed and won't buy a Kodak camera again."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-413f5b60"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/28.md","filePath":"sponsor/28.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/28.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
