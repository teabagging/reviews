The first reason why I like this book is because of how Maniac did all kinds of crazy things to get Russell and Piper to go to school. The reason I like this part is because the crazy things he does no one else would ever try or do like going into Finsterwalds backyard and ring his doorbell. My second reason why I like this book is because Maniac taught John Mcnab the \\"stopball\\". The reason why I like this part is because Maniac shows him so his brothers would not make fun of him and Maniac pretended to strike out. My third reason why I like this book is because when Maniac taught Grayson to read. The reason why I like this is because he wanted to learn to read. The book was enjoyable to read I liked it a lot it was very suspensful and also entertaining to read I reccomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Not A Maniac About Maniac Magee","review":"The book Maniac Magee was very different from any other book that I have read. It wasn't that great. In some parts it got confusing. In the iginning Maniac was running all over the place for days straight. He must be some kind of superhuman and that is weird. I also think that the story was confusing at the end. First Mars asked Maniac if he wanted to stay with him and then Amanda asked Maniac the same thing. I still think that Maniac should have gone and stayed at Mars Bar's house. One other thing that I didn't like about this book was how Maniac was living with about four families. Those are the reasons why I disliked the book Maniac Magee."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first book by Jerry Spinelli","review":"This was the first book by this author that I have read.

I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not.-Bastion T.

If it wasn't for the school requirements I would never had read it.First, it's pretty slow starting. Also the actions that happen in the book are really boring or stupid.Some parts of the book were so boring I had to read them more than 3 times.Also the setting I really did not care for.It's about a poor orphaned boy who runs away and ends up in a town called Two Mills that is seperated into two sections-- one for blacks and the other for whites.After he is there for a while, strange things start to happen.It depends what kinds of books you like to read also.

I don't like how he makes the chapters only two pages. Jerry Spinelli has too many things going on at once. I don't like hjow he puts black an white people in together. I think he should focus on one color in each book. I dislike how Jerry Spinelli make up the names like Mars Bar, The cobras, and Graeson. I don't like how he comes up with those sayings because i think they are pretty bad. I didlike how in tghe beginning his parents die. I think Jerry Spinelli should have had them in the story a little more. Well i disliked this book. I suggest not to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plain old story that ends regulary.","review":"I think Jerry uses strong words but I like his informal language. I think Maniac is a weird kid to tell you the truth. He is a nice kid but he does some stupid things like running away. Running away doesn't solve the problem. If I had to choose this book from 1-5 I would choose 0 but up their where you choose a star, I had to choose 1. Polpe think he is so AMAZING but he isn't, just a regular kid that ran away,made some enemies, had no home or family but got some friends and a home to stay with.This story is just a regular story like all authors do.I like his sayings like, \\"Don't trip over your tongue\\" something like that.

Warning: If you're looking for plot summary, read the standard amazon review, 'cause I don't want to repeat it.It's amazing how Spinelli has managed to take an issue as touchy as racial prejudice and managed to present it in a way that is not only understandable, but very realistic...Spinelli writes with a style that not only tells the story of a poor orphaned kid with famous - nay, legendary - abilities, but also provokes thought on many other issues, including racism, death, seperation, and many other scary but real issues in the lives of America's youth.I've read this book numerous times over the course of my life, and as I've gotten older (6 years or so have passed since I first read it), I still appreciate the message and story told by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finsterwallie Don't Scare Maniac","review":"Today I will tell you about Maniac Magiee.

The feats that Maniac achieves lead the people in the community to call him a hero. Even though Maniac does not have a normal, practical family, many people care about him. Not only do they allow him to stay in their homes, but they worry about him when he is gone.

Young readers will be able to relate to the adventures Maniac gets into and they will learn a lesson of bravery and trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"student","review":"Maniac Magee is a fantastic book.

On the west side, there's John McNabb and the whites and John McNabb is the leader of the gang the Cobras. Maniac also meets some nice people like Amanda Beale and her mother Mrs. beale.

She found that he had no place to live. So he lived with them for a little while. It caused to many problems because he was white and they were black so he decided to leave without telling them where he went. Then he lived with a guy in a shed.

Read the book to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't crazy over Maniac Magee","review":"The book Maniac was okay, although it was confusing. This was because the book would start to talk about the Pickwells then skip right over to the Beales. Also because there were so many charecters I couldn't keep track of them all. I thuoght Maniac Magee was boring. This is that it always led from one problem to the next. For example, first Russel and Piper are stealing then he beats Mars Bar in a race. There is never a time with no problems for Maniac. This book was good because it left you thinking what was going to happen next. But it gave you an idea of what would happen. It was almost like a cliff hanger, but it would come back to the problem later on in the book. That is what I think of the book Maniac Magee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maniac Magee","review":"I did not like this story at all there was too much detail. i really do not care about all the things the writer tried to explain to you.

Then when he left the Beales it was weird because I thought he liked the Beales. that was also a good thing because then he meets Grayson, but Grayson dies. I thought that was sad because it was five days after Christmas. The only part that I liked was at the end, because MarsBar meets the Pickwells and the McNabs.

Only drawback is that this book is made mainly for Windows and all the how-to's are based on Windows. Provides common sense explanations for confusing topics and buzzwords.

I fell in love with this movie when it first came out, and revisiting it nearly 40 years later is like heaven. The black & white print here is flawless, and the fantasy scenes mixing Tarzan footage, period nature films and Morgan's reveries are clever beyond their time. Jazz legend Johnny Dankworth provides an unusual soundtrack of woodwinds in a very Guiffresque style which has worn the years well. The movie contains several of the most memorable scenes ever committed to film, and the artful blending of fantasy and reality leads to an ending which is completely open to interpretation.The heart wants what the heart wants.

PGR is much more fun as is Forza."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is with the \\"YO YO YO HOMIE\\"?","review":"Simply put I do not enjoy playing this game and it is now collecting dust. The \\"DJ\\" at the racedays, with his \\"YO YO HOMIE\\" would be laughable if it wasn't so irritating. Drag racing? Why? News flash! A drag racing video game is boring....It is probably a hoot in real life but to hit the gas and drive straight is, well, lame. But it is part of the game for some reason. I have tried to like this game but its so hard. The cars slide off the road at 30mph. I know you start with a basic car but a 1975 VW bus handles better. Rent it, maybe you will like it. But please do not buy it without trying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripped off the street...","review":"Free roam, gone.First choice for car, gone.Fine tuning most aspects of the engine, yeah it's gone.

Yes, the riceboi take on it was weak, but all in all it was some good, goofy fun. NFS: Carbon which followed was something of a disappointment, though not exactly bad. But Pro Street was crap.The storyline was weak to the point of being nonexistent, the racing was awkward much of the time, the selection of cars was shamefully small, and the rules for what cars could participate in what events was, frankly, nonsensical.If you want a proper racing game for the 360, get Forza Motorsport 2. It lacks a storyline (which is actually less of an insult than Pro Street's vestigial story), but has dozens of tracks, hundreds of cars, and just takes itself a lot more seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game, not so good packaging?","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas & it was loose in the case. I was worried that when he opened it for Christmas, that it would have been all scratched up, but it wasn't.

I would have been happy with good personal anecdotes, art history, art criticism or just some good writing, but none of the above was to be found. I'm a Willem de Kooning fan and have read a bit about him and Jackson Pollack too. This book starts off with boring historical stuff about Long Island which I skimmed and then the parts about de Kooning and Pollack are rehashes about well known topics. The writing isn't very interesting and there isn't much about the artwork. The third person writing format is awkward too; lots of \\"he's\\" where it's hard to tell who \\"he\\" is. I'd say anyone who's interested in de Kooning should get \\"de Kooning : An American Master\\" by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan, which is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars just for the Gun Club cover of SEX BEAT!","review":"Honestly, I haven't heard the whole album yet but I got the single for their cool electro-gothic remake of THE GUN CLUB's classic early 80s swamp-rockabilly stomp SEX BEAT - a likely candidate for my favorite song EVER! While not reaching the brilliance of the original (how could you?), the Swordsmen don't try to copy the song - instead, they invest it with an astmopheric, almost menacing electro-tech vibe, coupled with Bauhaus-type vocals and a rumbling deep bass below - it works a charm, and makes me want to hear the rest.

There is common sense step by step guides to multiple sleep situations, and sensible case studies that one can easily relate too and follow the advice for their own situation. My baby is 7 months and happily sleeps from 6.45pm to when I wake her at 7.30ish the next morning. Based on Gina's advice, my husband and I have our evenings together, and a happy contented baby during the day. Perfect! This book helped iron out the kinks in our schedule and I am sure it will be a handy reference guide for the future if any other sleep situations arise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to CLB","review":"I was already a CLB fan before purchasing this book. Thanks to Gina's routines, I haven't needed the information supplied in this book about 'solutions for sleepless nights'. However,if you're new to CLB and having trouble getting your little one to sleep through the night,this book will prove VERY useful.Meanwhile, I found the chapters relating to babies' different sleep needs at each age and the troubles which may evolve during each stage very interesting. I also enjoyed the case studies; I picked up tips I hadn't previously discovered despite owning the collection of CLB books and being a CLB website member.If you've already got a CLB household, you may or may not value the extra tips this books offers. It could prove a 'take it or leave it' book for you.

Still I want some new perspective to go with it. I checked MacArthur Study Bible at the Borders and it seemed to be pretty good to me at the first look.Then, I decided to check John MacArthur himself since the note of the Study Bible is done by himself and himself alone. I'd like to know the person behind the book.I have found that John MacArthur is absoluetely not my kind of preacher. He and James Kennedy is one of the kind. They are exact kind of preacher who turned me away from the Church and God. Preachers who preach fear and hate, not love.I won't read any book written by such a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"MacArthur's Opinionated Bible","review":"The NASB Bible text is great, but MacArthur's opinions are not. He leans so far into \\"performance\\" Christianity that it has become legalism. And, apparently, he considers himself the judge of just how much performance is required to be saved. MacArthur's brand of of law-keeping brings death, just like the Bible says it does. It is no wonder that the BBN stopped broadcasting his show. I have been saved for many years. I have had mountain-top times and some valleys. I am not proud of the times when I was less full of faith, but I'm sure glad that I did not fall under John MacArthur's eye then...or I would have been declared unsaved! But, Christ is faithful. He has brought me back into a closer walk. Stay away from MacArthur's legalism, \\"For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\\" Stick with Ryrie's NASB study Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible Filled with Bias and Anti Pentecostal Views","review":"This bible is full of bias and misleads believers making them feel that they have no authority over demons. It denies the fact that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. MacArthurs commentary denies the power of the blood of Jesus. He is blatent about his belief that the gifts of the Spirit are not for today. This bible is very misleading and is a way of MacArthur to further propogate that Christians are powerless over the enemy and are expected to be downtrodden and not live in true victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Study Bible","review":"This is an outstanding study Bible with updated study notes.

I would not be without it. John MacArthur does a great job putting notes where they need to be. All notes are helpful.

He does a good job giving references from one passage to another; moreover, the additional teaching notes are helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't disappoint like some other study Bibles","review":"What is the primary purpose you buy a study Bible? To get the expert theologian/commentator's insight on a particular verse and/or passage, correct? I have a number of study Bibles, but none of them come close to providing the amount of commentary or the depth of details and insight MacArthur does. The man's love of God's Word and his gift of teaching from God comes through in this Bible. I honestly don't know of anything that matches it (the ESV study Bible comes the the closest).You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is one of the best study bibles available. The NASB is a very good translation, remaining as true as possible to the original language. Combine that with John's study notes and you get an invaluable resource for understanding God's word. I would particularly recommend this study bible for anyone who can't afford to buy a series of commentaries because John MacArthur has put a lot of time and effort into studying the Scriptures, and has extensive knowledge of the Greek language especially. In my opinion, his commentary is very trustworthy. If you're serious about bible study get a copy of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good study Bible","review":"This is a very good study Bible and one I use a lot. It provides excellent notes on every book of the Bible in a readable and easy to understand format. MacArthur is a Calvinist, so his notes come from that prespective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This is as close to perfect as a (NASB) study Bible gets. Among my 15 or so Bibles, it's my favorite both for the in-depth no-nonsense tough commentary by John MacArthur (reformed), and for the extras like maps, cross-references, center column, thumb indexes, easy-find bottom of page \\"BOLD\\" print verse headers, etc.The only thing that keeps this from 5 stars is its weak concordance. For the casual Bible-user, it will be fine, but for the serious Bible student/teacher/researcher, the concordance is just too weak. I find I must keep a Strong's concordance handy in addition to this Bible. All things considered, though. it's an excellent Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book","review":"This Bible is quite possibly the best reference/study Bible I have encountered...I am a big fan of McArthur, and in this commentary I enjoy his insight and especially his lack of opinion in most cases. He primarily states fact and cross-references it to other scripture. I would recommend this to anyone who is young in the faith like myself and wants some guidance to the scripture while you read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MacArthur Study Bible Excellent","review":"John MacArthur is an excellent Bible Scholar and his notes are clear, complete and understandable.

McCarthur is very diligent in studying the Bible and all types of resources surrounding it such as history, Greek, Hebrew, other Christian works, secular works, etc. Not a big fan of NASB or NKJV of the Bible, though many prefer them. In some cases the reading is more difficult. For example (NASB then KJV) magi-wise men, dissipation-riot, sordid-filthy, diadems-crowns. Obviously there are examples where the opposite is true also. Another place to look at some NASB changes is hissheep.org. A good, understandable KJV non-study Bible is the Defined King James Bible by Bibles for Today. Hardcovers are reasonably priced. Anyway the McCarthur Bible is a good and informative study Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVEN STUDY GUIDE","review":"I believe that the Study Guide will be a good explanation of certain passages in the book HEAVEN.

The leather binder is the best because this study Bible is thick because you get a lot of information to assist you in studying God's Word! I bought it as a gift for someone who does not have a lot of strength in her hands. I have one just like this one and I find it easy to carry and grab. If I had bought her the text-book style/hard cover, they tend to be slippery. Spending the extra money is worth it. It's worth saving your money or put it on your wedding gift list or for your birthday or Christmas wish list. You won't regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Study Bible","review":"The Bible itself is good, easy to read, the only two things I believe should be fixed are to make it easier to navigate from one passage to another book chapter verse somewhere else. This one is a little cumbersome. The only other thing that would be nice, would be to allow the users to link verses together. We can highlight verses, and put notes on them, but it would be a nice feature to be able to set up say 10 verses for a study and link them together to facilitate quick navigation through them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite study bible","review":"MacArthur study bible has been my fav!

It is poetic-prose, and the colorful, succinct language truly captures the essence of the mystery of God and Man. A unique perspective is revealed, as most people do not consider what Jesus went through as he began to realize his Self and his mission. The true power of this book lies in its ability to open one's mind to the possibility of recognizing God's call in our own lives. The book is relatively short, easy to read, and hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone, believers and non-believers alike; I think it is an exquisite work of art to be shared with all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Press up ear","review":"Moe helped keep jam-band studio output compelling after Phish's late output started mellowing out.

I began reading them in high school some 19 years ago. I have just recently begun re-reading the series and it's like visiting old friends. Texas, picks up two years after the settling of Oregon and we find the United States in the process of annexing Texas into the Union. Soon old characters like Whip Holt and Lee Blake are back in the saddle doing what they do best, helping our country expand, with selfless dedication. We are introduced to new friends who display the same attributes of the earlier settlers in the Oregon series. Overall, the book is quite enjoyable, and it is almost imposssible to put down. The reader is transported to the old West, and can develop a sense of pride and understanding for those brave men and women who were the trailblazers of our American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to admit att WW's get 5 stars from me...","review":"This is Book #5 of the Wagon's West Series and just as good as the previous ones.This one deals with the war between Texas and Mexico as well as how Texas becomes a state.A lot of our favorite characters are back and in this one Danny Taylor and Chet Harris are not only forced to make choices that will affect their lives but they also grow up rather quickly.

I was misled by positive reviews for this movie. The thought of calling adultery carried out in front of one's children \\"an easy to take comedy\\" like Leonard Maltin stated is baloney. I didn't like any of the actors nor their characters and neither of the two main leads were very attractive.

In this novel, ADA Joanne Kuhlman finds herself sympathetic to one of her trial defendant after reading background information about him.

Her background in the court system helped render an authenticity to her story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rich and real legal drama","review":"There's not just one conflict of interest in this legal drama, but several, as families and colleagues of the prosecuting protagonist sort out their lives while sorting out a complex couple of murders. Families are torn, and healing takes place in unexpected ways. Teens rebel, then rather quickly find their center of maturity. Lawyers on opposite sides of a case find an unlikely romance, and a detective's mysterious background makes him a valuable asset in solving other mysteries. An excellent light read, with enough character development to maintain interest, as well as the requisite pleasant surprises at the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haphazard","review":"The author doesn't stay true to her characters.

I LOVED the first two books in this series, and rushed out to buy the third one as soon as it hit the shelves.......and boy was I disappointed. The book is four college years crammed into one, so obviously we only get fragmented glimpses into Jessica's life. The story lacks a good plotline, and I dont think anything of any substance happens between the first five chapters and the last five chapters. The character of Jessica does not seem the same, and sure people change once they graduate from high school, but with her it seems like we're reading about two totally different people. My advice: read the first two books, and stop there; leave the rest to your own imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Irritating","review":"**spoiler alert** Yes I finished this one and I have never been so disappointed in a character before. Jessica has turned into a slutty, annoying, obnoxious nitwit. Not only does she cheat on Marcus, but she devirginizes Len on the couch of an ice cream shop WTH?? She has sunk sooo low in my opinion. I just don't understand where the Jessica Darling of Sloppy Firsts went! This whole book is devoted to her college years and all she learns is that she wanted to sleep with her married TA, emo guys aren't great sex buddies, and she has spent 4 years earning a degree that she doesn't even want. UGG what a waste of time! I know I did it to myself so i have no one else to blame, but I will not punish myself any further. Good bye Jessica Darling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best coming of age story","review":"Any girl who has lived through four years of college will fall in love with this novel. I've never read another story about the experience of a young woman at this age and time in her life that comes so close to the real experience. Jessica is smart and funny and brave and true. Ever since I first read stories like Goodbye, Columbus and Catcher in the Rye, I've always wished for a really talented female writer to capture those years and all the uncertainty, laughter, love, freedom, and soul-seaching that comes at that age. This one is a classic. I cannot wait to read McCafferty's first two novels now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings. I hated Charmed Thirds.This book failed. It failed to move me. It failed to say anything new. It failed to develop new characters, the author simply \\"threw in\\" characters from the first two books for no reason. It all seemed contrived. She almost seemed to be trying to just \\"placate/please the fans.\\"Like other reviewers have said: too much of the author's personal negative feelings came out-about politics and family. Too the point where I just said: \\"Wow. If you wanted to write a book about your views on the government, why didn't you just write one.\\"The whole book was sad, vulgar, abrasive, contrived, and was a downright waste of my time.THE FIRST TWO BOOKS ARE SIMPLY WONDERFUL/A JOY TO READ. STICK TO THOSE AND DON'T BUY CHARMED THIRDS UNTIL YOU'VE READ THIS GOD-AWEFUL MESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still more trash","review":"I looked through this book and the others in the series at the store the other day. Seems to be total trash, and not suited for teens at all.I don't know how publishers who put out this kind of crap sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let your daughter read this!!!","review":"A trashy novel that teaches young girls to have low standards and be promiscuous. Such books are lauded as being true and realistic, and while I don't doubt that it is an accurate account of the sadly low standards of people of college age, the consequences and long-term effects of reckless choices are not accurately portrayed.I discovered my daughter had borrowed this book--from a friend who is entering 9th grade and is expecting a child. No surprise there, thanks to Megan and similar authors, girls are being taught to disrespect themselves at a young age and further the unwed teenage pregnancy problem in this country. Consider my rating zero stars for absolutely no redeeming value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but long","review":"I never write reviews, but this book kept me thinking and hoping for more. Jessica has become a nymphomanic. Marcus continues to be well...Marcus. She alway's talks about sex, from hookups to breakups. With that said, I truly did love this book; it's worth reading because its gives you hope to all the \\"what if\\"'s in her life. I Only hope that you read the other two first. It will be interesting to see what will happen if the author continues with another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth your time","review":"Your usual teen-girl book series usually jumps the shark by the third installment; not so with McCafferty's creation, which makes sense, because the Jessica Darling books are SO not your usual pretween trash. Charmed Thirds might be the best book yet, if only for the transition from unflinching caustic wit to relentlessly heavy introspection and self-doubt. As Jessica's life grows more tangled and (it must be said) depressing, she realizes everything she believes to be true could be wrong. And that is a theme worth spending $20 on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first two","review":"\\"Charmed Thirds\\" is even better than the first two Jessica Darling books. Jessica is older, a little wiser, and definitely funnier than ever before. If you liked \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" and \\"Second Helpings\\", you will LOVE this book. I couldn't put it down, and laughed out loud many times. Buy this book NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best...","review":"yeah... one of the worst books ive ever read. the plot is so farfetched its as if the author ran out of ideas. and good god, why is jessica darling suddenly the horniest woman alive? i dont want to read about how she wants to jump every guy she meets. The first one was so good, and then the second, so so. Basically, the books in this series get gradually worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Charmed Thirds","review":"I must say that I loved loved loved the first 2 books and loved Jessica (including all her faults.) We waited forever for this third book, and now I feel like the author should not have even bothered with this one. I agree with one of the earlier reviews...this one totally \\"jumped the shark.\\" Very disappointing! I was also turned off by the unneccessary vulgar language. It seemed like the author just threw it in for no real purpose except shock value. I guess I just don't like hearing one of my favorite characters talking about how she wants to f*&$ her boyfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed once again by Mccafferty","review":"While I was nearly dissuaded by some negative reviews claiming Charmed Thirds paled in comparison to Mccafferty's previous two novels, Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings, I bought it anyway. Moral of my experience: don't buy into negative hype. Charmed Thirds was every bit as good, real and addictive as Mccafferty's earlier masterpieces. Some readers may have been put off by Jessica's coming of age college experiences. However, I had the opposite reaction - I think the evolution of her character for better and worse just strengthened by admiration for Mccafferty as a writer. Had Jessica remained the same as she was in high school, the story would have become stagnate and fairy tale like. We cannot impose idealistic qualities on Jessica and neither should Mccafferty. Let's not pick up Mccafferty's fourth Jessica Darling story expecting to read exactly what we want to happen - let's let Jessica tell us what's going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darling, Jessica...Keeps getting better with age!","review":"I won't be wordy or lengthy with my review. Megan Mccafferty just keeps getting better with each book. Keep up the good fight and I look forward to reading about Jess, Hope, Marcus, Bridget, Pepe, Marian, Bethany, G-Money..and the rest of gang for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's finally real!","review":"I loved this book because I felt like Jessica had finally reached a point in her life that she was touchable. With the other two books, I was almost intimidated by her perfection and suaveness as a high school student--things worked out just a little TOO perfectly. In this book Jessica makes the transformation from child to adult a believable transition. I liked that it moved so fast through her college years because it shows that change really doesn't happen overnight and that little choices affect your life for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Daughters Away","review":"J. Darling is not a peer that you want your daughter to model her behavior after. Jessica's decision to lose her virginity to sexual player and drug user Marcus in Second Helpings spoke volumes about her(and McCafferty's)values and good sense judgement. Predictably, now that liberal do-gooder McCafferty has gotten your daughter to hang with Jessica by reading Sloppy Firsts,then Seconds, we find her masterpiece Charmed Thirds extolling a lifestyle filled with drunkenness,cursing,and casual sex.Darling indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion on Charmed Thirds.","review":"I've been following the series since I first read Sloppy Firsts. I couldnt put it down. Same with Second Helpings.I also couldnt put Charmed Thirds down. It was so real. Jessica, Marcus, and all the rest of the characters all came to life. They were people that you could relate to in certain ways.I like how things didnt always go smoothly and it wasnt predictable. I've read books where I was figuring things out before anything happend. With this book, it kept me guessing and wanting more.I cant wait to see what happends in Jessia Darlings life and how things work out. =]I gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Darling grows up...","review":"Though filled with an increased number of expletives and sexual references-- the book is in keeping with the character. Jessica grows up and goes through 3 and a half years of college in Charmed Thirds.Although a number of characters make their cameos, my only reservation in this novel is that there's wasn't a constant character with Jessica throughout. No Marcus, no Bridget, not even Hope. I liked her interaction with these characters in the first two books. But still a great read and a great addition to the Jessica Darling series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I've lost a friend","review":"As far as I'm concerned, Jessica's story ended with Second Helpings. The first two books were so deeply beautiful, moving, and true. They made me laugh and smile and weep, especially at the end of the second book. Charmed Thirds was a HUGE disappointment! The main character I once loved has turned into someone vulgar and annoying. Far from the intelligent young woman she was in the first two books, she is now a cliche: a drunken, promiscuous, directionless bubblehead of a college coed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as the First 2!","review":"This addition was not even close to the stellar writing of the first two in the series. I bought this in advance and was sorely dissappointed when I got into this book. It seems like Megan (the author) was just trying TOO hard. I would reccommend getting this from the library instead of buying it! Hopefully the next one is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stayin' \\"True\\"","review":"The third of the Jessica Darling novels leaves me wanting more, more, more. Jessica's journal is still brutally honest, sometimes unstable, and always addictive. This book depicts college life at its truest, with references to Facebook, dorm life, and long distance out-of-high-school relationships. Like the first two books, this one made me laugh out loud many a time. Also like the first two, I couldn't put this book down for a second. This book is for teens and adults alike, as Jessica's wit is at it's sharpest, and pretty much everyone can appreciate college life, whether they've been there, are currently living it, or awaiting it.Fine, there is less Marcus... and yes, we all love Marcus, but this is depicting real life, so a picture perfect relationship would go against the point. Just read the book, skeptics, and hope to hear about him more in book four..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...as always...","review":"So yes, I also have read both of her other books. She is a fantastic writer and this book is no exception. It is funny but darker than the rest of her other books. Of course, some may not have enjoyed that...but me being a sophomore almost junior in college can totally relate. High School is not as serious, College, if you're not like every other person kind of puts a damper on your mood. At least, that how i felt.Anyways, i also would have liked more Marcus. However, it's something that every girl needs to learn...your boyfriend, no matter how great, is not always going to be there.This book was filled with great insight into the life of a college student. It was witty, smart, and depressing...it was Jessica Darling."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to skip.","review":"I am probably the only person to read this without having read the first two books in the series. I think books, even in series, need to be capable of standing alone. This one does not measure up to that standard.I didn't have any trouble following the action. I just thought the book was extremely boring and the MC unlikeable. I also didn't like her boyfriend Marcus, at least as portrayed in this novel.I read the whole thing, only because I'd heard praise for Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings. This novel has turned me off so that I'm unlikely now to find out why the first two books earned that praise.I'd suggest if you haven't read the first books, try them. They have to be better than this. And I'd recommend skipping this. There was nothing redeemable in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh..","review":"It is nothing like the first or second! It took me forever to finish and im not even picky, ill read just about anything. At times it is really distasteful. And I felt like she was very out of character. I wish i hadn't bought it, i guess i'll sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Topaz a Hit!","review":"It's always scary to buy presents on-line, especially jewelery, but these were a hit with my wife. The earrings aren't too heavy but certainly look substantial and have a nice color. Nice quality especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Topaz and sterling earrings","review":"I am so pleased with my purchase. The earrings are of fine quality, and the price was just right for my budget. I know I will receive many years of pleasure and hopefully pass them down to my granddaughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful - Reviews may not be as they appear","review":"The earrings look OK - certainly not like the picture, but they seem nice enough. I don't have a great eye for this sort of thing, so we'll see how it goes. She could love them.The big problem I have is that I selected these in part because of the quantity/quality of positive reviews but there is another reason they are there: Inside the packaging, it says if you review your purchase here on Amazon, you'll be entered in a once a month drawing for diamonds.That's some BS. Very easy/scummy way to get people to write positive reviews, whether justified or not. I guarantee some of these 5* ratings come from people who are just doing so for the shot at free diamonds.It might still be a good purchase, but be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now What I expected but Close enough","review":"When I ordered this item my initial use was to use it to go hunting and camping because I thought the material was a little softer like an ordinary shirt, but when I received it I got something totally different, the material is rough and thick and almost heavy on wearing which is fine by me because it could also be used as a coat my only problem with this item and the reason i didn't rate it a 5 was because even though I'm at 6'3 190 pounds and this item sized at medium it is still a little to big! So choose your sizes carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime Song","review":"I loved this anime and this song it definitely gets your adrenaline pumping and its great to listen as your working out, or going jogging or listen to when your driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopin or Lang Lang?","review":"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just \\"a little slow\\" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and \\"deep\\", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever tacky?","review":"Contrary to the concert of praise surrounding Lang's virtuosity, these memories have little to do with music. Is fingerbreaking pace, music? The scherzo of Chopin third sonata says it all: it's all about how fast Lang can play, not at all about what Chopin's music means. The score -written by the decidely stubborn Chopin- doesn't acknowledge Lang's change of tempo: there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle. Once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype, marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats. I'll take the impetuous Argerich over this anytime: at least she is genuine. Her scherzo is organic, fluid. A recent CD by pianist Svetlana Ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as Lang is in the sun, she follows Chopin's score in a meaningful and sensitive way. Check the soundclip on her website [...], compare with others on amazon, listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing with odd temp","review":"Lang Lang's powerful and fast fingers just do not work for Chopin. Chopin's music is as dedicated as \\"dancing with soul\\" for every note. Lang Lang's fingers are just too rude to interpret these subtle notes. For Mazart Concerto, if you have listened to Horowitz, you will be disappointed with Lang Lang's recording too. I don't even want to mention the rest recordings. As I know Lang Lang performs over 120 shows a year. He is talented and successful at his age. Yet he should spend more time on music itself and understand the virtue of difference. Beyond technical fast fingers, expression is all counts at last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Long","review":"Chopin' Sonata slow movement is played sooooo slow, I thought there was something wrong with my player. My opinion? Great composers' music should be played more and interpreted less.This is an unfortunate aberration in an otherwise wonderful program, and beautifully recorded.Lang Lang has a wonderful tone but his intellectualism becomes a mannerism. Yeah, it seems to happen with prodigies."},{"rating":"1","title":"music without a soul","review":"I dislike the way lang lang plays the piano--it is simply showing off his technical skills but definitely without a soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has ADD?","review":"The book over explains the simple and skips the intermediate to go right for the difficult. The topics were all over the place. It was like reading a book written by a child suffering from A.D.D. Myself, as well as 14 of my classmates, deem this book responsible for countless wasted hours of unnecessary studying of basic programming. Our time would have been better spent taking turns kicking each other!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I smell a rat","review":"I am suspicous of all these wonderful reviews for what is essentially a by-the-numbers, cluttered text, which often explains in three pages what can be said in a paragraph. This book came out only a few weeks ago and it is over 1000 pages long, yet it has miraculously garnered 16 five-star reviews (so far). So many devoted readers? I doubt it. I smell a rat - perhaps from someone's Marketing Department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Camel and Llama","review":"I bought the camel, llama, and perl cookbook and this book. This one actualy teaches you how to program perl! Well structured and the examples are relevant and useful. I have written three perl scripts by using examples from this book and the help of on-line forums that get some pretty niffty things done at work! Perl is easy to use (relatively) and powerful. I can do more with the \\"foreach\\" loop and \\"next if\\" statement than I can with 20 lines of shell scripting. A guy at work who is a little more advanced at perl than me was borrowing it all the time. He ordered it after a few days of that!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perl - How To Program","review":"I like software program book written by Dietel. It has an excellence of illustration and easy to understand step-by-step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say that just one more time, in English though.","review":"One simple example will give you some insight into the authors approach when it comes to this book. I suggest that you look up just the \\"qw\\" function in the text. Not once does it even mention what the \\"qw\\" stands for (it stands for \\"quote words\\" by the way). The function is used to automatically quote words in a list and gives the list of quoted words as it's output. While the explanation of what the \\"qw\\" does is decent, it doesn't even get that part fully correct because the text shows \\"qw\\" working like single quoted strings on one page and double quoted strings on the very next. Well, which is it?I have to agree with other writers here that the text at times looks like it was authored by someone with a serious case of A.D.D.Not all of the book is bad though. It does offer a much broader view of perl than the O'Reilly Learning Perl books, but fequently the quality of the explanations seems a little lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book's easy, setup impossible","review":"I think this book is probably a good book for those new to programming in Perl NOT for those new to programming period. I'll never know, because after a month of trying to set up the programs on the CD that comes with it, and others you must download off the 'net, I have to admit defeat. Every program needed has an online text bigger than the book itself, that have obviously been writen for I.T. proffessionals. I'm not stupid, and I tried very hard to get this up and running. To bad, because the book itself seemed easy to understand and well laid out. Just don't begin here.

Maybe I'm not used to his style: Bland worlds and prose, and excessive exposition. But I find it difficult to believe that there are actual fans of this guy. His writing is awful. I'm taking a decade hiatus from the fantasy genre, because the quality of writers and their fans have plummeted since the 90s.I'd give it a 0 star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the first one","review":"I made the mistake of ordering this book along with the prequel instead of one by one. After struggling through Tyranny of the Night, I decided that I might as well give this one a chance, since I had already paid for it and everything. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this book isn't quite as bad as its prequel. The lack of an editor isn't quite as apparent, and while the characters remain one dimensional and the writing style (or lack thereof) still somehow reminded me of sawdust (the dryness maybe?), on the whole this book was overall just a little bit less bad than the first one--I gave the first book two stars and I'd give this one two and a half if I could. Still, do yourself a favor and don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Pleasing","review":"Thankfully Cook's publishers have allowed him to step away from his proven intellectual properties of the Black Company and Garrett. I thoroughly enjoy those series, but it is amazing to see how witty and how imaginative this man is. I agree with an earlier reviewer that a few \\"out of time\\" dialogs exist, but they should not detract from the brilliantly woven story.Cook's character development is as good as anyone writing. His pacing and style create a fast-paced imagery and identifiable characters.

I purchased it after recently re-reading all of the Fleming novels. I now realize how much detail went straight over my head. The chronology alone is impressive, and the maps are great fun. It would be interesting to see a follow-up for the John Gardner and Ray Benson novels (and even Colonel Sun), although this would disrupt the chronology since a 70-year-old Bond running around the later novels would seem absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!

The tragedy is that Fear sounded like they had enough talent and ideas to overcome whatever punk stereotyping the record industry insisted on manifesting. THE RECORD starts out promising enough with Let's Have A War, Beef Baloney, and Camarillo but then descends into brainless, potty mouth hackery that gave this music a bad name.

The technical support team is terrible, and won't help unless you give them your credit card so they can charge you for help. I told the technician that my router was only 2 days old, so how could my free technical help have expired? She wasn't the least bit interested in helping me. She only wanted to get me off the phone.

After 2 hours getting to an actual human (in Karachi), determining that the router was in fact dead, I was informed that they would send me a REFURBISHED replacement in about TWO WEEKS OR I could elect to pay them to replace it in a week... all the while sympathizing with me off of cue cards and refusing to actually solve the problem.

It was very easy to set up but I personally would forgo that for a constantly working router. After 2 years in my home, the router failed to work completely. I had my sister call netgear to see why it decided not to work since we had our internet company come and check out our failed internet (modem was working perfectly fine thus leading to our router as the problem). They informed us that we did not have an \\"account\\" with them therefore the root of our no-internet-problem. Well problem solved, right?

This router worked reasonably well--no major complaints--for about 4 yrs. Then just suddenly died one day. Won't power up. I'm not sure what the average lifespan of a wireless router should be. I've got electronic components that are much more sophisticated that are 20 yrs old and still working fine. So, to me, 4 yrs seems like too short of a lifespan to expect for $130.To be fair, however, I've replaced many a router in my lifetime. A couple of years seems to be all one can expect from the typical router. I guess the figure that if they make them crappy enough and keep changing the broadcast standards, we'll just keep buying new ones every couple of years. What I'm looking for--what I think most people are looking for--is a router with fewer superfluous bells and whistles, a better range, and a higher level of reliability.

Hale's introduction of her protagonist, Leda March, describes an alienated young girl walking in the woods, experiencing a moment of ecstasy, and being teased by boys. I can't give side-by-side examples without copying out both chapters-check The Prodigal Women out of your local library stacks and see for yourself. After discovering this, I surfed the Internet and read Emily Toth's biography to see if Metalious had ever been accused of plagairism and saw nothing. Readers, the publisher, and future biographers should be aware of the fact that Grace Metalious was a fraud. It makes me wonder if she crazy-quilted the whole book out of various lesser-known novels.

The characters are very believable and the incidents of growing up, falling in love, incest and murder hit very close to life.

Sadly Metalious' fame brought her eventual alcoholic ruin after novels like \\"Return to Peyton Place\\" \\"The Tight White Collar\\" and her last work \\"No Adam in Eden\\".

One may wonder why Korolev has never been a household name like Gagarin, and how come the American is the first one landed on the moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"So that is what happened","review":"I began to read as the space race started and I saw and heard stories about failed and lost Russian space flights. Now that the Soviet archives are so open it is wonderful that all of this information is gather in one book so I can see what is true and what is rumor and where so many of these stories came from. This book clarified so much of what I heard during the 1960s. I see an unflattering review here from The NY Times Review of Books by Alex Roland with a remark about information available from other sources. What a snob! First, I keep my eye out for technical books aimed at the general public I don't know of any other book that collects so much relevent information and also tracks down rumors (without getting into unfounded x-file-ish theories). Yes, if I'd made it my career to study aeronautics then this Korolev book might not so special. What might I read? Oh, here's a book \\"Atmospheric Flight..\\" by Mr. Roland. What a snort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book on Korolev is good, but it is rather slow at times. It is interesting how he pushed the Soviet program to beat the Americans at the space race, yet he had no ill feelings towards the US. He drive was pure science. Once Korolev died, the Soviets had no hope of getting to the moon first."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a thoughtful view of the other side....","review":"I strongly recommend Contest for the Heavens, by Claus Jensen - The Road to the Challenger Disaster. This is gave me a fascinating perspective from the other side - i.e. what was happening in the USA in reaction to what Korolev was doing in Russia. And where those events would lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful & Intriguing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Watched it on a rainy day and it was the perfect movie for the mood.

NOT! Even the base unit was filled with static even 20 feet from the base! When I returned it, the clerk mentioned that her last uniden did not work either--too much static and she could not even make calls with it, so she threw it away.Uniden used to be great, but not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be zero stars.","review":"I wish reviews had been posted here before I bought mine. They were on super-clearance mark-down at a brick and mortar store so I should have known better.The worst reception of any cordless phone I have owned over the last 20 years.

Across the house and it dropped a call. We are going to return it right now save your reciept."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is terrible!","review":"This phone is a piece of garbage. The most important aspect of a phone is its clarity during conversations. This phone has loud persistent static even when near the base station that makes conversing on it irritating and unenjoyable. All the other features on this phone are moot considering the terrible static. I will be smashing the phone to pieces once I get my new Panasonic 6.0 DECT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one handset at a time, and poor range","review":"The other reviewers are correct that the range is very poor with lots of static. Also, only one handset can be used at a time, which limits the usefulness of having multiple handsets. Calls can be transferred from one handset to another, but you cannot use more than one handset at any time to talk.This phone was cheap for a reason, and it does a disservice to the Uniden name."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 pages?

Because of the finish they can go from office to an evening out. Will look great even with say a black cocktail dreses. The only difficulty is with sizing. I am a size 12 with this brand and ordered a 13 because I know that with shoe fronts like this I need more. The 13 is a bit too much but the 12 would not have done. All you need however are some simple inserts and you are good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I am a fan of upbeat and inspiring music and this album is great! Helena Paparizou is a greek pop singer who has done albums in english and greek. Great singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Bauhaus.","review":"Lots of people say this album is the worst Bauhaus album, possibly because they play it once and then throw it away. The first time I heard this, I did not like it. I listened to it a few more times, and realized this album is spectacular. This is definately one of their weirder releases, lyrically and musically. Songs like \\"All we ever wanted was everything,\\" and \\"Spirit\\" are very melodic with Peter Murphy's famous vocals on top of accoustic guitars and soft drums. Other ones like \\"In the Night,\\" and \\"Third Uncle,\\" are faster and more \\"out of control\\". It's too bad not everyone realizes just how great this album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts....","review":"Maybe you have to be part fo the scene to get this, or maybe on the same drugs(kidding), but I found this excruciating to listen to.It was too repetitive. I swear they played one chord for whole songs, while screaming.I'm the first to admit I'm no expert on goth music, but this sounds more like 'Mike Kollers,' A song my friend recorded in eighth grade with a fisher price tape recorder and an epiphone guitar and practice amp. The biggest difference is there's a distinguishable chourus in 'Mike Kollers.'I adore Siters of Mercy, I adore The Cure, MLWTKK(only the early stuff is goth, but I love it all), and numerous other goth bands, but I just don't get this.When I listened to it, my first impulse was to throw it out of the car window at 60 MPH(I did this with the recent Venom albums), but my friend decided to give it to her sister instead.We hate her sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look like the picture","review":"This product works well with the mini habitrail, but doesn't look the same. I did not like the looks, it is wider then the original from OVO and it looks like was made for the regulas hamster habitat, not for the dwarf. I just noticed that it does not look like the picture, I feel like they have sent me the wrong one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superior Film - Inferior DVD","review":"Fish Story is a great, unique film not to be missed.However, you should avoid this particular DVD issue.Why?1. This dvd is NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN. That is unacceptable.2. This dvd does not contain extras (like 35min making of documentary) that other releases do.3. The subtitles are off during the final sequence of the film. This is not absolutely crucial for enjoying this great film but the timing of what should be subtitled (no spoilers here) during this sequence hugely contributes to what the film is all about thematically.I suggest you either:1. What for a better Region 1 release (Blu-ray)2. Get the Region 2 UK version (which I own) that is superior to this one3. Stream it from Netflix (which is anamorphic and has correct subtitles)Don't get me wrong. Even if you are stuck with this inferior dvd, you will be satisfied. The film is that good.But as I stated above, you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get The Blue Notes","review":"These Italian versions of the Cafe Bohemia recordings contain the exact same music as the Blue Note CDs The Jazz Messengers' \\"Live At The Cafe Bohemia, Volumes 1 & 2.\\" (I have reviewed Volume 2 of the Blue Note CD if you would like to get some album specifics). My understanding is that for some reason Blue Note/Capitol/EMI does not have jurisdiction over this music in Italy, therefore allowing Giants of Jazz to issue these sessions. It is cheaper to buy these than the Blue Notes, but you get what you pay for. I sure did, I originally got these years ago thinking I'd save a few bucks, and what I got was poor sound, poor quality, and no session information other than the track listing. Stick to the original Blue Notes, and you'll get the original album art and liner notes to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"These granules work and are sooo easy!","review":"We live in FL and seem to have an even worse problem than a lot of our neighbors. I have a pond, birdbaths and a LOT of potted plants (these hold water which are mosquito breeding grounds). These granules have virtually eliminated our mosquito problem! As long as I stay on top of keeping these in the potted plants (which seems to be our biggest issue) we have NO mosquitoes!! I am never interested in pesticides and have tried EVERYthing natural under the sun and this is what has finally worked!Before we were using them we got several mosquitoes in the house each night especially during the rainy, hot months. The dunk (rings) work well too, but these are easy to sprinkle in small places. If you have the dunks just break them up. My organic lawn maintenance company taught me that trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I found this book of no value.

He has a lot of good topics but does a poor job addressing them in detail. A bulk of the book gives very scant information with very little coherence in the process and explanation.

This is Mediterranean food according to Joanne Weir (not a person who grew up with Med food) who obviously has a very shallow understanding of the food of the region. This book proves that breezing through these countries as a tourist can not turn you into a serious cookbook author, or even a half-way decent one. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to travel around the Mediterranean and eat!","review":"I had a 30th birthday party and prepared several tapas to meze dishes for my guests! Everyone raved about them and then went out and bought the book themselves!

The Italian, Spanish, and French dishes are spot on. The Greek, Middle East and Turkish fantastic. I love to mix the salads from Eastern Mediterranean with main dishes from the Western Mediterranean. Joanne gives precise instructions and I have gotten a lot of mileage out of the techniques I've learned from this book. If you get a chance catch her show on PBS (www.weircooking.com) or a class with her at 'Sur La Table' (www.surlatable.com.) She's a joy to learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cookbook has the best flavors imaginable!!","review":"If you like Mediterranean food, you NEED THIS BOOK! Joanne has written an incredible cookbook filled with delicious and easy recipes. The food is filled with flavor, and I keep reaching for this book and reaching again. It has food all over it, is a mess, and I would never buy a new one, because I love the old one too much. JUST BUY THIS BOOK!!! TRUST ME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I nominate this title for the worst cookbook ever title","review":"I believe those who rated this book well are not familiar with the region. Joanne Weir makes so many mistakes that I am shocked this cookbook was approved by a publisher. (Pstt, the publisher had no idea about Mediterranean cooking either). If you are interested in mezes try Joyce Goldstein's Taverna book which is much more reliable. (Tavernas are about mezes, and tapas kind of food). If you want even a more detailed book on Med cooking in general, then try Clifford Wright's phenomenal \\"Mediterranean Feast\\", a James Beard Award winning title."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Entertainment Purposes Only","review":"I suggest reading this book ONLY if you would like to know the specifications of certain mentor bots as well as some of the basic components of autonomous robots. There blatantly ovbious errors in the book, I believe it should have been edited more carefully. I recommend reading it ONLY for a very basic basis of A.I and mentor bot composition.I disliked the fact that there was a large amount of the author's personal opinion written into the book, especially during his conclusion. I do not feel it is fitting to include personal opinion in a published work that is written from a technical (even if in layman's terms) standpoint.Secondly, there are instances of debasing statements and prejudice towards mentor bots that the author deems as inferior to other bots.Again, I would only recommend this book for entertainment or for basic understanding purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many projects to choose from","review":"Best thing ever. Well, if you love building fun items. It has a built in retro feel to some of the projects. If you are doing it by hand or using a CNC this is a great book to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scariest thing is HE could be your neighbor.","review":"I just finished reading THE RIVERMAN and I was mesmerized by Robert D. Keppel's tale of lust, depravation and sexual deviation killers. The most haunting thing is that it's true. We are in a world were this kind of monsters are growing in numbers. It helps us not to be the next victim of one of this criminals. We participated in Keppel's triumphs and losses. We experienced his amazement and his repulsion. Keppel's understanding of Bundy's personality is unique. Thru his eyes we saw Bundy's strenghts, weaknesses, failures, and compulsion to enter a world were only he knew how malevolent he was. For anyone who's interested in Ted Bundy, this book is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bundy sells another book","review":"I have to admit, I bought this book to read about Bundy, not the Green River Killer. And Keppel does not disappoint: he got confessions out of Bundy that probably no one else could, things Bundy himself admitted he never intended to tell anyone. I skipped over the Green River Killer parts, and I think Keppel might have been better off writing separate books about his Green River experiences and his experiences with Bundy (which would make a fascinating book in their own right)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bundy's words are enlightening, the authors are not.","review":"The main problem here is Keppel's massive ego and it appears not to have recovered from the beating it took from Bundy. To think someone who gives expert opinions in court can get so many things wrong, and potentially convict people based on nothing more than a hunch and his 'superior' deduction makes Keppel almost as scary as Bundy.From the first page 'Bundy probably couldn't reach orgasm unless the victim was dead or unconscious' Keppel's credibility falls flat on its face, since I don't think Bundy's wife was either when he impregnated her during a prison visit.In short, Keppel's not a smart guy and his conclusions are often tainted by his own emotional needs.Putting all that aside, Bundy's words are enlightening and make the book worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for those with special interest in Ted Bundy","review":"This book sure offered me additional information about Bundy, even after reading several other books about him.Very well and modestly written by Bob Keppel, the investigator who did the famous Bundy-interviews days before Bundies electrocution in 1989.Only disappointing thing to mention is the fact that Bundy didn't speak about lots of unsolved cases. However, that also makes part of the most touching theme of the book: the enormous frustation of the investigator about unsolving both many Bundy-cases and the Green River murders.Don't expect a random (dramatized) detective-story. It's mainly a fine book for people with special interest in Ted Bundy or Green River murders"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Story!","review":"This book is so much more than Ted Bundy, it is the evolution of detectives and investigations into serial crime. It reminds us without Ted Bundy we could never have learned as much about serial crime as fast as we did. The book teaches things we can all use to relate in everyday life; it is not only about death and the mind of a true genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is the only thing interesting about the book","review":"This book was a grave disappointment. I opened the book expecting to read about Ted Bundy's view of the Green River Murders. I only read 3-4 chapters in which Bundy described the Green River Killer, the majority of the book was how Keppel viewed Bundy (seems he felt Ted got to him mentally),everything about Keppel's career, and all about VICAP and HITS. The book was filled with useless and unrelated material that made it quite boring and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over-Hyped!","review":"Keppel has a hard time telling this story. In fact, I'm not too sure what story he's telling. Is this a story about Bundy, about the Green River Killer, or about Keppel. On all fronts, it falls far short, is very fragmented and hard to follow. Worst of all, it left me unsatisfied--I still don't know anymore about Ted Bundy than when I first started the book. I would hardly say that Bundy reveals his secrets in this book. I would say instead, that Bundy takes Keppel on a boring self-absorbed ride through his own speculations about getting into the mind of the Green River Killer. What you do see is Ted Bundy as a bloated pontificator of the worst kind! Keppel fails to get from Bundy what he promises and as a result I feel the book did not deliver! Save your money, there are better true crime novels about Bundy than this--I hope!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a lame attempt to jump on the GRK publicity bandwagon","review":"in reality, keppel was at best tangential to the hunt for the green river killer. this book comes across as nothing more than a self-aggrandizing attempt to milk some personal publicity out of a horrific murder case. those expecting for details about the search that ultimately led to the arrest of gary ridgway will likely be disappointed. those interested in ted bundy or bob keppel will fare better. sadly, i was not one of those readers. the title is misleading, and i was one of those suckered in. oh well. one star it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I kept saying \\"get to the point!\\". I'm used to Ann Rule's writing and this was just not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!","review":"I read another reviewer point out that the title of the book should be\\"How I tried to outwit Bundy, and lost\\". in my opinion, there couldn't be a better title. There are so many logical fallacies in the book that it really makes Keppel look quite unprofessional. He makes assertions and states as fact, information that is nothing more than suspicion speculation. Some of the information in this book has been proven completely inaccurate since its publishing date. All I ask is that a non-fiction writer present me with a review of the FACTS...NOT long winded, delusional, self promotion. One of the last things Robert Keppel writes is something about Ted being a truly insignicant creature. Well, the fact that you've written books about the guy would indicate otherwise, BOB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a few good chapters","review":"This book has about 24 chapters I believe and only about 4 good ones but the good ones are worth it.

You can only follow him if you know a lot about contracts and then you don't need the CDs anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Whaley","review":"The tapes are very helpful if you have done the basic reading.

He skips about, and does not stay on point.If you are able to find another source for Contracts, do so. This was required by my law school.

Besides other issues I have with the characters, the heroine couldn't seem to make up her mind whether she was staying in the past or going back to her time.

It has a great plot with descriptive characters whom you want to meet in person, and great setting and also the forgiveness of God in the bad things they do. I identify with alot of the character's feelings and wishes. Mrs. Blackwell did a wonderful job of weaving all the characters' lives together in one book. This is one of Mrs. Lawana's best!!!

I also found in it a great insight in Christian living. I gained a lot by reading this book.there is a lot of romance going on in this book and a lot of funny, or rather humourous situations. you are kept guessing about who will win Lydia's heart and how, until the end. wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, yet has moments of suspense","review":"This book is full of newlyweds, including Andrew and Julia Phelps, and their daughter Elizabeth is married to schoolmaster John and they are expecting their first child. The title character, Lydia Clark, was previously teaching school in Scotland but has come home to Gresham and lives with her parents, and is now in charge of an advanced school for children who are too old for the regular village school. Archeologist Jacob Pitney wants to learn about poetry to impress another lady, and asks Lydia to help him, with surprising results. The ending is great for most characters in the book, but I felt that there was more to be learned about a few characters, and it doesn't appear that a fourth book is in the works so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READ","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS A BOOK TO READ SLOWLY & TO SAVOR. THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WAS GOOD, I WOULD NOT CLASSIFY IT AS EXCELLENT. IT ENCOURAGES US TO EXAMINE CHOICES WE HAVE MADE IN OUR LIVES. IT INVITES US TO REVIEW OUR FAITH, TO ASK OURSELVES \\"AM I REALLY LIVING MY FAITH FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT?\\" FAITH IS SOMETHING WE LIVE, NOT SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT ONCE IN WHILE SUCH AS IN CHURCH.

The Orka glove is large, unwiedly and cumbersome, but that thing will withstand HOT temperatures. With these, I can feel the heat very quickly, almost as soon as with cloth gloves. I'm not impressed. I'd rather use one Orka than this pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of these!","review":"We have had these for a few months now and must say BEWARE!!!They are not really comfortable and seem to transmit too much heat thru for my liking. But the worst is that there is a magnet at the wrist area to hang them up with on a metal surface. Seems convenient but on the other side of the glove opposite the magnet is an elliptical hole. My wife who is LEFT HANDED had the hole in the glove right next to her wrist and severely burnt that area of her palm near her wrist. This is a severe design flaw.DO not get these if you are left handed and I don't recommend anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"you still feel the heat","review":"I was so excited about these mitts, but upon their first use, it was evident that the heat transfers through to your hands from the time it takes to carry a cookie sheet from the oven to a counter about 10 feet away. I'm not saying you'll get burned, but you'll be uncomfortably hot! I'd expected this innovative material to be better than thick cotton padding with a teflon liner, but it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, my burning hands!","review":"I would avoid these mitts. They really don't protect your hands for very long. I have almost dropped several hot dishes before I could get them from the oven to a safe place on the counter because the heat just came through. In fact, the mitts themselves get hot enough that it's painful after you put the hot pot down! While the magnet is somewhat handy, I find myself wishing I hadn't thrown away my old cloth oven mitts."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge let down","review":"I had read an excerpt of Pears' \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" a while back. It intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book. While I have still not read that book, when I saw this one for a dollar at my local Half Price books, I decided I would give Pears a try. I found this book to be severely lacking in character development and found the plot to be thin. I now understand why they had the book priced at a dollar. The book tries to cover too much, which is evident in the subplot of the book involving the conflict between the aging detective and the scrappy new detective. This sub plot is tedious and detracts from the main mystery of the book. Overall the story line is weak, there is too much detracting from the main plot, and the character development leaves much desired. I do still want to read \\"Instance\\", but it will be a while before I pick up any other Pears book again. Don't waste your time and energy on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shallow Read","review":"I have lived in Italy for over 20 years during the Summers. I had recently bought CITY SECRETS ROME. An excellent guide book. The recommended reading in this book listed Iain Pears mysteries set in Italy. I bought GIOTTO'S HAND and THE RAPHAEL AFFAIR. I found them both extremely disappointing. If the previous reders found the books filled with the cultural and sights of Italy perhaps they might like a trip to San Jose. I am at a complete loss as to why authors of CITY SECRETS ROME thought visitors to the city would benefit from Giotto's Hand and The Raphael Affair. They won't in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art History in an easy-to-swallow size","review":"Yes, I am a Pears fan, strating with \\"An Instance Of The Fingerpost\\". I really like these art history mysteries of his. They always have some quirky characters, interesting settings, and very little bloodshed. So I get my armchair travel nicely wrapped in a whodoneit. But I especially like to learn something along the way. Each of these show me something of an art world I will never live in - so I get a double-dip of tourism. This story, set in both Italy and England also throws in a little of Miss Marple's small village life as well. An easy read, not too long - I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"Maybe the foodies in my house don't have sophisticated enough palates to appreciate this.

His life and experiences were so diverse that everything could not be addressed.

Everything is set to music. But the girls always have on bikinis or bathing suits and they never show anything. The video has no dialogue and no plot. Just girls standing around. And the girls are featured one at a time, so there is no interaction between any of them. If you want to see something that is arousing and entertaining, you would be much better off getting a \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" DVD. As my title says, this DVD is uninteresting and boring.

I looked in an older copy of Think and Grow Rich and discovered that the parts that I didn't agree with (from a moral and business standpoint) were the lines that Arthur Pell added. The up-to-date examples were ok, it was the changes to the original core values that I just couldn't tolerate. Get the original or another version that has high reviews. I give this version 5 stars for the Napoleon Hill part, -3 stars for Dr. Arthur's input, for a total of 2 stars. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF A TRUE CLASSIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Not the original author's version.","review":"This is a classic (pun intended) example of what's happening with books that many of us read in the \`60's and \`70's. The books were written in the \`20's, \`30's, and even earlier. The Secret, which was no secret, was based on these authors' books. I ordered two of Dr. Joseph Murphy's books to replace ones I had given away only to find out they had been \\"revised.\\" I was so disgusted I gave them away. Genevieve Behrend's books have been taken over by Joe Vitale. His name even appears first on the covers. The description for one of them starts out with, \\"Fiery Texas author breathes life into dead woman.\\" If you really want to know what Napoleon Hill had to say, get the original version. The book stands on its own merit without any \\"help\\" from people who have no new ideas of their own and are just seeking to make money from someone else's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a confusing read","review":"This version of Think and Grow Rich is a major disappointment. The beauty of Napoleon Hill's original book is that it is seamless -- you almost can't wait to get to the next page, the next idea. But in this book the editors stick in huge sections of italicized material every few pages that have little or nothing to do with Hill's ideas at that point in the text. It's almost as if he is constantly being interrupted. All that italics material just gets in the way when you're trying to absorb Hill's ideas, which are themselves wonderful. I am not certain what the editors were trying to do here, but they completely succeeded in messing up a great book, which I have read perhaps fifteen times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book purports to contain all of the text from the original edition, published by Napoleon Hill in the 1930's. However, I have a 1940 edition in my library, and I have compared this new version with it. This new one doesn;t come close to containing everything that was in the original.

The small nuggets of additional material by Dr. Arthur Pell (an expert on Dale Carnegie) are helpful -- and they are also set off at the end of each chapter so readers can decide for themselves if they want to read the updated material.

It just doesn't have the same energy level or spiritual vibration. As far as the added content, that also is weak.

I think I'll be using this for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"Scent is like art and in this case smell is in the nose of the beholder. The product description -- floral and citrus leaves with mid notes of cedar and spice, and low notes of vetiver and musk -- is pretty accurate, and I would emphasize \\"cedar and spice, and musk\\". I don't wear it every day (tacky in an office setting) but I do get some compliments when I wear it going out to dinner functions. But best of all I like the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Scent!","review":"Burberry Touch for men smells incredible. It opens with strong notes of violet, then transforms into a pepper and oakmoss scent. Then it dries down into a white musk and tonka bean heaven. It is definitely one of Burbery's top scents and I highly recommend it. People will compliment you on how good you smell when you wear this. On top of that, the bottle is very elegant with a rosewood top. Amazon also offers this a lot cheaper than most department stores, where they usually sell it for around $67."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells good but wish it reached out further.","review":"The smell is good and lasts longer than you think, but the problem is no one will notice really since it doesn't go further than your clothes. It does make my shirts smell great for days even after once. If you already have a women who comes up close, then it's great but for a bachelor, you need another perfume to lure women in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and outlasts my other fragrances","review":"I've never been much of a cologne wearer until recently. This was a recommendation by a colleague. I liked the smell immediatley...subtle and masculine which is exactly my style. I was also suprised at how long it lasts. I workout during my lunch breat at work and I can still smell it after running three miles and showering (and i do not spray it on my clothing).Overall, this is now my favorite fragerance."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't know what you are missing !!","review":"A friend gave me this aftershave balm because he didnt like it. I think he made a BIG mistake. I love! Burberry Touch aftershave balm so much because I get the greatest compliments from the ladies. Just one or two drops on your skin and the fun begins. Its got the coolest scent ever. Its indescribable. What i like about it the best is even if you sweat thats when the scent kicks in a notch. I dont think i can use any other aftershave balm."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE FAKE FAKE","review":"I happened to know about colognes a great deal,... and I have conducted a teston this item and it proved to be fake,.... the odor does not last long (not enough oil base), in fact it smells even differenti bought the original one from the mall and you can't compare both; the one from the mall has a scent that lasts much much longer and is very strong, this product has watery texture.

It is definitely one of my favorite fragrances but on my skin it does not last very long. Some colognes I can get away with only 2 or 3 sprays to last the day but with this one apply 5 sprays and usually do not get a full 8 hours. That being said I do give this 4 stars because the fragrance is simply amazing. I do not have a very fine tuned sense of smell but whatever is in this I find very appealing; I just wish it lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like a scented maxi pad.","review":"I've had 3 different girls tell me this smells just like a scented maxi pad. I'm not convinced this is flattering."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"First, believe it or not, a little background:Back in the mid '70s, someone was trying to get me to sell a \\"health food\\" popular at the time. I did a little research and found that at the time anyway, health food had the highest markup of anything on the market except \\"cosmetics.\\" And I think this product would fall into that category.In my younger days, I used witch hazel as aftershave. It worked as an astringent, didn't cost me an arm and a leg. Then, while dealing with the public, someone suggested quality cologne. I used a few different kinds, paying a lot for it. But this is the first one that people actually noticed!What else can one say about it? People notice it, and remember you for the scent??What's more, it was much less expensive here on Amazon.com than the same thing would have been at a department store.Yep, this stuff's the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite masculine","review":"I know this product is really well-reviewed, so when I got it I was a bit surprised at the smell.It's actually a very nice scent. It has more complexity than you might expect, and a good whiff doesn't kill your nostrils.It also lasts a decent amount of time, and it's definitely a scent you can wear in everyday environments, such as at work.My problem with it is that it's quite a flowery scent. It's something you might smell on an older woman, like your Mom. Still a very nice smell, just not for a man in my opinion.Maybe that's why there are so many good reviews, is because women might like the smell of it, so the guys get good responses, and therefore write good reviews?And yes my bottle was sealed and says FOR MEN on the bottle. Too bad I can't return it, maybe I'll give it to my Mom for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only problem was the deliver","review":"Is a great purchase, the smell is pretty good and perdurable trough the time but the perfume wasn\`t on time it\`s tree day out of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A NICE SMELLING FRAGRANCE","review":"I do like most of Burberry's line of colognes but I found this one to have a sour smell to it. I'm very surprised most people liked the cologne. I've been wearing cologne for over 20 years and have had dozens of different bottles and this one was definitely up there for the worst. I know colognes may vary from one person to the next but this one had a salty and sour fragrance to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic","review":"I'm overlooking the fact that the product I received was obviously a previously returned item (the box was beat up and torn and I had one full ounce less product than marked on the bottle). The smell of this product, while not offensive, is almost nauseating because it's so overpowering. I put a dab on and my unsuspecting wife thought I was painting something with oil-based paints. Also, the ingredient list cold be considered a compendium of bad chemicals. Surprised by all the glowing reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"After doing a lot of research on 2-3 new colognes I wanted to buy, the name Burberry was recommended to me by a friend, who said he tried it and that it drove the ladies wild. I debated between this and Burberry London and finally caved on this cent. After wearing it for just four days I can definitely say this stuff lasts ALL DAY! I do a spray on each wrist and rub on each side of my neck, and a small spray on my chest and I'm good for 8-12 hours. As far as appeal goes, I have four different women in the first day smell me and go \\"What are you wearing?!\\" So yeah...TOP buy guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Great and One Of the best of Burberry","review":"Imo Burberry Touch is one of the best fragrances from Burberry house.

It is one of these fragrances that you will never regret to purchase. It is perfect as gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless, Rich & Clean","review":"This is probably my favorite scent in my whole collection. I am a cologne junkie, and have really been looking for my 'signature scent.' This is it; it's very hard to explain, just buy it! It's clean, rich, sexy, alluring and not over-powering or musky like many other mens colognes. I have used Armani Code, L'homme Yves Saint Laurent, Armani Attitude, Kenzo Toyko and I find that they just sit in the back of shelf now! I find that this is a great cologne for those in their early twenties. L'homme Yves Saint Laurent and Armani Code have that usual 'musk' that is not very youthful and not what I am looking for.I get complimented and have girls coming up to me asking what I am wearing ALL the time, nearly every time I go out, it's a lovely experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice scent for young men","review":"I bought this for my college age son as a stocking stuffer at Christmas.

I know I haven't since the days of having to worry about 4:3 versus 16:9. I only did this time because I couldn't understand why it wouldn't play on my computer.

Also, if you have never read the Ray Bradbury book definitely check it out. Get your copy while it lasts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks among the best!","review":"This movie encapsulates the experience of Halloween! Watch it. Be skeptical. Be critical of it.

But this film can take you back for a while.I wish this movie was available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay I found it!!","review":"I have been trying to remember the name of this movie for about 7 years and about 10 minutes ago my mom urged me to search for it online...

I'm just so excited to find this movie again, because it is wonderful!!

I was very excited to see that The Halloween Tree had become available on DVD format! I'm not quite sure if it is remastered or not, but the video is pretty good considering how old it is. My only personal qualms is that my individual copy stutters a bit at a few parts. Not sure if it's my DVD player or the product itself? If so, it may just be my copy.

I watch all of my movies on my laptop, as do a lot of my friends. So even though there was a warning that this probably wouldn't play on a computer, I had to try. My laptop will play the crappiest (probably bootleg) dvds from China but wont play a dvd I bought from Amazon. MADE by Amazon. Terrible.I have some other dvds from Amazon that were made by them but I bought them years ago when I had a dvd player. It's a shame that Amazon is selling mediocre products. I ended up finding a guy in California who sent me a copy of The Halloween Tree for free, so I got really lucky and have since returned my copy from Amazon. The dvd this guy sent me looks like a bootleg but at least it plays on my laptop.Maybe Amazon will one day make better dvds. Until then, I wont be buying any of their made-on-demand dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but...","review":"There is no comparison between this film and the book.

I am watching it as I type this. I was a little worried ordering this because it came from Media Asia, but nothing to worry about. It is in English. It is a little grainy, kinda looks like something out of the 80's, recorded off TV and put on DVD, but I can live with it. It works on my DVD player, which is a Vizio.I paid a high price for it. Almost $30.00, but again, I wanted this movie in DVD.This is a great movie for the kids on Halloween, I am very happy with my order and if you want this movie, get it. It may be a while before it comes out on DVD here in America.If it would come out on Blue Ray here in America, I would probably buy the newer copy, but again, who knows when that will happen.

We study Medieval Europe and this is the perfect way to talk about how all these different cultures contribute to Halloween as we now practice it. Ray Bradbury is my favorite author, so we read some of the book and the movie is narrated by him so you can use this to teach similes and metaphors. Great learning tool! But I wish it was on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trick or Treat","review":"This story is absolutely wonderful for children who are old enough to sit still through a 1 hour movie. I remember watching this on television as a child and I never forgot it.

His works as a whole offer thoughtful Christians a richness of insight and spiritual development comparable to the greatest religious texts of Eastern religions, like the Bhagavad Gita, the Yogasutras, the Dhammapada. These short works on faith, spiritual life, sacred scripture and the Lord show the reader some of what Swedenborg's longer works offer - a thorough renewal and revaluation of Christianity, focusing on revelation, doctrine and charity. As with all spiritual texts, these give the reader back many times the value he or she puts into working with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The promising start dwindles away","review":"I don't know what happened to John Ney Rieber... after his promising start on The Books of Magic, his stories slowly started to lose that magic. These stories fall at the end of Rieber's run at the title, and they're mighty thin gruel compared to what came before.It may be the fact that any elements of light or real humor have been vacuumed from the book. Molly, a fantastic creation, isn't very much in evidence here and Tim Hunter's incessant whining simply becomes too much. Artist Gross took over the book after this series and made some improvements, but it was too late and the book ended. Rieber did a Books of Faerie with Molly that showed the man had lost his way: It shared much with this volume in the incomprehensible storytelling and not-very-interesting characterizations.So, for completists only, and only for those completists willing to have their fond memories of the series in its heyday sullied by this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"an underrated class","review":"If you like slapstick comedy this movie is a must see, I'm thrilled that the DVD is finaly coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"As always, I was very satisfied with my order.

Its too bad that this movie isn't very well known, but finally gets the DVD treatment. The wit, the slapstick, the humor all flows naturally. John Murray is so amazing that you don't care that he's in his brother's shadow (although he would have been great if he could have been Steve Zissou's brother) yes, this one is much more worthy of my elite radar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass ware","review":"Broken and chipped glasses in one box and a missing glace in the second box.

Half of the glasses have broken in the dishwasher. I have other glasses that have held up in the dishwasher for 15 years without breaking.

Actually, it wasn't as good as I had recalled. Jane Fonda gives a better performance in Klute and other films. Still the dvd was nice to have. It's not a movie that I would watch over and over and I believe my memory of it was better than the actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Premise","review":"This was an exciting premise, and when I saw Fonda, Bridges, and Lumet's name attached I watched this thinking it would be a forgotten gem. It starts off promisingly...Fonda wakes up next to a man with a knife in his chest. But it's downhill from there. Instead of a taught thriller, the movie digresses into far too much about the two main characters and becomes more of a character drama. It's not even interesting and completely loses focus. The things that happen (and far too few things happen) are unrealistic and disjointed. The plot developments (who is the killer) come way to late in the movie to be compelling in any way. Characters are introduced in the final act that really should have entered sooner to develop any real sense of surprise or suspense. The tone is uneven, even comical at times, which isn't helped by the inappropriate score. Strong performances don't save this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treat","review":"Really impressed with Jane Fonda's portrayal of an over-the-hill actress.

She wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she can't remember what happened the night before. Then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by Jeff Bridges.Unlike Hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something VERY BAD is going to happen. The violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens. I figured out \\"Whodunnit\\" in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if Fonda's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde?I give this movie 5 stars because I liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break","review":"Jane Fonda is a drunk down-and-out actress who wakes up one morning in bed next to a man with a knife sticking out of him.

I know biographies should show both dark and light times of its subject but this one delved too far. With respect to Robert Johnson too, the author Charles Murray seemed to enjoy perceiving these two icons as doomed demons. It told too much about his own perception of Jimi and it does not honor Jimi enough. It is very detailed about the history of rock and roll and this does give the book some credibility yet for me, it was a difficult and unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bio, a mildly interesting musical commentary","review":"I got this book because it was one recommended in a list of Hendrix bios by someone, and was mostly disappointed. Only the second and third -- out of around 11 -- chapters cover Hendrix's life. Those chapters were well written and facinating although they just skimmed the surface.The other chapters are commentaries on the sixties, blues music, soul music, that are tangentially related to Hendrix's life and music. The commentaries were the kind that I find very boring and dated. Long discussions about how white America can or can't relate to the blues, whether Hendrix was a black musician crossing over or defined a whole new genre, etc. I tend to find such writing boring so I can't really judge it very objectively. If unlike me you like that kind of stuff you might like this book. However, if you are looking for a bio about Hendrix and his music there must be better ones around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far inferior to the Rough Guide to iPods & iTunes.","review":"The iPod and iTunes Starter Kit by Tim Robertson is quite disappointing. While it is very long, it is far from exhaustive because of the superficial level its coverage of many important topics. The Rough Guide to iPods & iTunes is about a third of the price ($8.09 versus $23.09), but its treatment of such matters as compression codecs (MP3, AAC,and the like) is lucid, informative, and quite easy for a non-expert to follow.

This one is solid brass. If you have hard water you can remove the entire shower head, soak it in CLR or vinegar to dissolve the mineral deposits, and the shower head is like new again. If you do that with a plastic shower head the metalized paint finish will flake off. I've had one that has lasted 10 years, these are great.Another thing to note is from the photo it may appear that you will only get 7 streams of water. That is not the case the actual streams project from the outer ring. So you get just as many streams as a normal shower head.Hope that helps.Style 4 (nothing special, it just blends in)Durability 55 stars overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent it back","review":"it looked like it would have a narrow powerful water stream.

The first half of the book was better than average pulp adventure. Here, the pace moved quickly; the story's main conflicts emerged in the midst of Burrough's evocative depictions of the threatening and unknown regions of the African jungle. However, towards the end, the tension bogs down into a series of relentless and wild action sequences where cliffhanger follows upon cliffhanger, stretching the bounds of plausibility, even for a Tarzan story."},{"rating":"1","title":"no educational information","review":"I was very disappointed with this product.I was hoping to replace my President's placemat that was worn out. my old one had lots of useful info on the back side that corresponded to all the president's photos on he front.This one gives you very abbreviated notes about the Presidents -Only written below the photo.too bad.

He does a great job of explaining grace, faith, & works, and how they are related. He covers all the angles including those that do not agree with Biblical teaching. Also goes in depth into such topics as baptism, tongues, and Christian living. Some won't agree, but many don't agree with the Bible, and Bernards book is good sound Bible teaching.

This is a major hermeneutical blunder. Moreover, he doesn't analyze Scripture with enough depth. I don't believe this gentlemen is purposely trying to deceive, but I do believe that he makes many assumptions and exegetical fallacies. A much more balanced book to read from another Oneness Pentecostal is \\"Speaking in Tongues\\", subtitled \\"A Scholarly Defense\\" by Barnett. Unfortunately the logical conclusion of Bernard's book is that the rest of Christianity is unsaved - this is an absurd conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oneness private interpretation","review":"Readers will find that this book reflects the private interpretation of Oneness Pentecostal groups such as the United Pentecostal Church which is the largest of these groups. Sadly, most Oneness believers are not aware that Bernard's position that water baptism in Jesus' name and the baptism of the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues are required for salvation and therefore constitute the new birth, was NOT believed by MANY prominent Oneness pioneers. Howard A. Goss was the first General Superintendant of the UPC which was formed by the merger of two Oneness Pentecostal groups in 1945. Goss taught, as did a very large percentage if the ministerial body of the UPC, that one was saved by faith and repentance BEFORE water baptism and the baptism of the Spirit with tongues. In agreement with Goss were Oneness Pentecostal pioneers Andrew Urshan, G.T. Haywood, John Paterson, and C.H. Yadon just to name a few.

A radical teaching not found anywhere in scripture. This also has never been taught by any Christian in history (even among Charismatics) until the rise of the so-called \\"Oneness Pentecostals\\" in the U.S., circa 1914/1915. Charismatic Scholar David Reed considers this extremist teaching puts Oneness Pentecostals in the realm of the cultic. I agree.

He appeared on barn dances in the South, like Chicago, Ohio, Indiana, Nebraska. He played hardcore Country, like polkas, big-band sounds, hoedowns. He gave first breaks to Eddy Arnold, Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl. He doesn't brag, but tells the truth about his own accomplishments.And if all this authenticity stuff compares the \\"business\\" of Nashville now to the nostalgic \\"hillbilly\\" past, Pee Wee lets us know it was a business then just as it is now -- and they did what they had to do to make money.The more things change ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your brain for breakfast?

Nothing fancy or virtuostic, Clarence & Curtis Butler played deeply soulful but basic original material on their two JSP albums released in the mid '90's. Most of the tunes are mid-tempo shuffles. Clarence offered some powerful rhythm and riffs on electric guitar, with his brother adding Chicago-style harp. They later cut a fine live LP,(\\"The Butlers' Boogie\\") on an independent label, consisting mainly of blues standards.

It had a simple, very catchy formula, and I naturally prefer music with a folky feel these days. If simplicity is what you are looking for in an album, this is right up your alley. From the lyrics, to the music, to the harmonies themselves, sometimes you don't have to have all the \\"bells and whistles\\" to get an album right. It is clean, fresh, and pleasant to the ear. It's also pretty versatile. It's understated enough to not distract you as a background music, but catchy enough to keep your attention in regular rotation. Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, but if you want some folkish rock with a little \\"swagger,\\" I'd suggest Iron and Wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold In The Air Of Summer","review":"Kings of Convenience do something amazing on this record. They have managed to take a path that few others have done in the past few decades; stripping down to the barest elements, on some songs to as little as vocals and guitar. What you come away with is something beautiful and pure, renaissance in feel, a vibe that can transport you to another time or place.My only regret is that I did not discover this album until 2007. For the past 5+ years it has constantly stayed in my listening rotation, all 12 tracks. Every time I listen I am still awed by the magnificence of every nuance. I believe it will stand the test of time for as long as I, or anyone else shall live.

Not a 5 (this is no White Album or Purple Rain), but certainly a 4. The lyrics are better crafted. The use of bossanova sounds and upbeat rhythms add a fun layer to their style. The two seem more comfortable with writing songs in English.Having Leslie Feist was a brilliant idea to contribute to \\"Know How\\". The three voices blend so well in the song, you'd think they've been singing together for ages. Other standouts are \\"Homesick\\", \\"Misread\\", \\"Love is No Big Truth\\", and \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\" (a song I didn't like at first, but gets better with each listen).One big criticism: I could have done without the trumpet in the end of \\"Sorry or Please\\".

I bought this game because of the good reviews it had gotten and how it was much related to Diablo II: LOD. I used to play Diablo II when I was about 10 so I decided to buy the game. I wouldn't be able to relate Sacred to Diablo II in anyway. I only played single player so I am not sure about the multiplayer game play for Sacred, but after playing the single player I don't think I would want to anyway.

Sacred is still one of my favorite games of the Action RPG genre. The game can be a bit 'buggy' at times, but the characters are quirky and the world is both huge and intriguing.Since there have been many great reviews regarding the overall experience of this game, I will only point out two things for the would-be buyer.1 - Yes, this game will run on Windows Vista 32 bit only, but NOT on 64 bit.2 - In order to run the game on Windows Vista, the latest patch will be required to fix one error that prevents the game starting. However, this patch can be rather difficult to find because the game is old. (Even the manufacturer's website does not make it easy.)

Maybe I've been spoiled by games such as Divine Divinity and Neverwinter Nights where once these things are bearten they stay beaten. I,ve heard that they are releasing a new updated version on DVD that supposed to be more balanced.

Sacred Gold has the original Sacred plus the Underworld part.You have several characters to choose from: the vampiress, wood elf, dark elf, deamon (my personal fav), dwarf, battle mage, gladiator, and seraphim. The game gives you a main mission and you can accept small missions from villagers as you go along. You can choose the skills you would like as you level up. You also have combat arts that are specific to each character. You can collect/buy potions, weapons, armor, and special items that will help you on your journey. Watch out for green colored items!

In about year or so it suddenly died without any warnings. Just like many reviewers I had the same problem. It shows reading the disc then displays the message it cannot read, and changes over to the next disc only to repeat the same problem, then cycles endlessly. At this state of the quality that this product represents, shouldn't cost more than $45. $380 for one year is too mulch money to waste when it almost guarantees that it will die in one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storage Bin, very Pretty.","review":"Its not worth the space it occupies,unless you are a Sony yung electronic engineer!

It's essentially a large \\"jukebox\\" and it has a device that grabs or selects your disk. In doing so it grips the disk to place it in a slot for playing and in doing so leaves a deep mark on it. Eventually the marks get larger and some of the disks become unplayable until you have to resurface or repair them.Save yourself a great deal of trouble and aggravation and get a regular carousel type player. Sony needs to re-engineer this device and perfect it before I ever buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good So Far","review":"I bought this several weeks ago and has worked really good.

This unit definately accomplished that goal. While it can be a long process loading the DVD player (I would recommend loading them all at once rather than doing a few here and a few there, because the machine takes awhile to read new DVD's because it reads all existing ones at the same time) once that is done the DVD player is fairly easy to use. It does take awhile to load your selection once you choose a DVD to play, but less than it would take for you to get up, choose the DVD off a rack, take it out of the case, put it into a DVD player, etc.If you are looking for a unit to store all of your DVD players, and browse the instructions before loading, I don't think you'll be disappointed at all with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a home for my 400 disc's, now what to do with the 401st..","review":"Pros:- 400 disc's- Sorting discs by name, category, etc- No reason to ever leave the couch- Good quality pictureCons:- Labeling discs is a pain!!- DVD changes are a little slowConclusion:This DVD player changed our lives.

I only wish the DVD labeling was faster and could work with a wireless keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"$300 / Year","review":"This product is a fine product, a dream come true, until one of two things happen:*All Titles Dissappear - Yes thats right, after spending hours entering all your DVD titles into the system, you will lose all that data. Not a question of if, only when. Fortunately, if you are willing to give up a Saturday every couple of months, thats not too terrible.*Eventually Stops Reading All DVDs - Yes this is the killer, the death rattle. This will happen, again not a matter of if, only when. So far I've owned two of these, (and two is enough for me) each time, months out of the year warranty, they simply stopped reading DVDs. This will happen and you will have to replace the product.Bottom Line - Holds a ton of DVDs and displays titles which is wonderful. However you have to basically pay $300 / yr to operate this thing because you will have to replace it just about every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony DVPCX995V 400 DVD Changer","review":"So far I am happy with the performance of the DVPCX995. It is a bit of a technological nightmare, but works very well. It is a matter of figuring out the menus, entering titles, etc. However, it simply takes some patients and the manual. It is slow to change when set on shuffle ALL DISCS, but obviously it is searching through 400 discs times 15 to 20 tracks. The last thing I will mention, is that you must have it plugged into a tv to operate it properly. You cannot just use it as a cd player without hooking it to a TV, as the only way to access the menu is on screen. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, and I would recomend this product to anyone who who like to have 400 cds available at the push of a button.

The best feature strangely enough is the price and the Player works great with my 62\\" DLP HD television. I am using the HDMI hookup and the picture is fabulous with the 1080 upconvert. Using the Player is quite easy if, as I was warned by other reviewers, you don't get hung up with some of \\"convenience\\" features. I am still inputing the titles, etc. But in the meantime my \\"non-digital\\" handwritten matrix works well. Not surprisingly the Player's \\"turntable changer\\" results in a unit that is quite deep-front to back...Not a problem in my setup but would be for someone with narrow shelving or a shallow media center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!!","review":"This unit was one of the worst DVD players I have ever owned.1. The machine is very slow.2. The machine jams very often.3. The remote is worthless.4.

If I want to watch the DVD in the number 100 slot, you can't just press 100 on the remote.To sum this machine up:Sony put this machine out to fast.

Buy a cheap key board to enter info to the DVD text entering & searching is primitive. Create a document on your computer to keep track of title & location.

I found some online forums and others are having the same issue. Something about the laser only lasting so many hrs and also a diode that goes out. Sony is no help big phone bank of \\"tech\\" people that read from a list of suggestions and then when they finally are convinced your unit can't be reset they offer you an exchange for $275 you pay shipping one way,and a 90 day warranty. refurbished, not new. The phone calls took hrs. I paid $300 new in Feb 08 for this,the price is up over $400 so I think I will go back to a single unit good quality (not Sony) unit.

I have has mine for a year and a half and suddenly after starting to read a DVD it failed and tried to read each subsequent DVD in turn and failing with each until I powered it off. When I moved the DVDs to a second and older changer, Sony's 875P, they all played with no problem. The problem does not appear to be mechanical or due to dust/dirt but rather a failure in the electronics. Eighteen month to failure is very short considering Sony's reputation. Of course the warrantee is one year and the cost of the exchange program is almost as much as buying a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with all DVDs","review":"The specs for this machine say that it is compatible with DVD-RW/-R/+Rs and so on.

Their only advice was to return it to Amazon.

As soon as the warranty expired it starting freezing before loading the DVD menu and when the menu came on all my DVD's were listed as question marks.

Now about a month and a half later, we go to watch a movie and the player goes to the first movie, says reading, then says cannot play and goes to the next movie with the same results. Basically I paid $300 for a DVD player that worked for a year. And the Sony DVD copywrite problem is true, it happened on mine too. Sony's answer to my problem of it not being able to play?

After having one of these babies in the living room for about 18 months now (Hooked up to my Sony KDS-60A3000 Display) I bought one for my daughters room. Like almost everything, there are limitations. Nothing is perfect or pretends to be. I agree it is a bit slow, entering disc data is slow and tedious, and when you remove a disc to play on another DVD player or lend it to a friend the disc data is erased when you turn off the player. The reasons I was attracted to this unit was because it upgrades to 1080i through the HDMI connection (On my TV And My Daughters) and it stores and organizes a large amout of DVD's (Over 700) in one area without ever having to touch the discs. To me the picture quality is excellent on mine and my daughters TV (Toshiba Regza 42in LCD) but we have them both hooked up through the HDMI connections.

The 301 version had the best functionality - compact design and it flipped the disc for you (this was great when you have a double-sided disc). However, this model had a notorious history of misfeeding and even jamming. The 985 model is great (but no flipping). The 995 model is extremely slow.

Calling it a control/command structure is much too complimentary a description of its use of 'logic'. It is clunky and annoying to use from both the unit and the remote. PC keyboard input of disc information is frustrating and the machine dumps the entry if you remove a disc. The 'logic' feels like it was developed 15 years ago.Update almost 4 years later: This one continues to function fine mechanically and has never damaged a disc. It will occasionally lose the title of a disc. The control electronics are gruesomely primitive and an Excel spreadsheet of your collection is well worth the effort.

The damage is caused in the form of arcs across the face of the disk and is caused from stress generated when the carousel motor tries to turn but another internal part is in the way. Rather than shutting down, the carousel pushes to the point of bending the disks and creating stress fractures.I thought this problem was a fluke incident the week I purchased.

I called for technical help and after 10 minutes of phone menu runaround, I ended up with a person unable to articulate in english and from Pakistan living in the Phillipines. The concept is fantastic, but they need to work on this to be a viable product. Glad to deal with Amazon and able to get a refund on a product not worthy of working at all. If you buy this unit I wish you all the best in getting it to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I own for DVD playback","review":"I suppose I'll start with the badnews first. Its a pain typing in your dvds so they can be filed in explorer menus.. But then again, I'd rather make my own titles. The ones that load from disc are all caps and its not the title I want to put. And it can't be changed. And some of the titles seem to disappear over time. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the memory that remembers the name has a glitch.The best thing about this is the picture quality.. darn near HD with 1080i.I used a 4 quick menu to classify my dvd's into drama, sci f- comics, love n war, and action. Easy to look up what dvd I want to play. Sure beats cable.I liked this so much I decided to get another.Sony put out a new blue ray 400 disc that is $1800. No way!!!! Too rich for my blood to be paying $30 a pop a movie.Make sure you set your remotes if you have more than one of these otherwise you will turn them both on at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed My Mind","review":"Wow I really wanted to buy this product but after reading the reviews I will not.Sony take note!

She is a great writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I expected better from Ellerbee, having enjoyed \\"Move On\\" and her television work. But while this memoir has moments that are delightful, too much is tedious, overwritten, a lot of detail that never gets anywhere, and seemingly endless \\"He did this and I did that and how funny/silly/clever we were.\\" Overall it reads like a pastiche slapped together just to get a book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious must read!","review":"Ellerbee's escapades as she dines her way around the world is hysterically funny. It is a laugh-out-loud read about the life of one of Amercia's great journalists and greater writer.

Excellent production. The concert was performed as a wish for all the mankind: The peace. During the concert, Nana Mouskouri sings in Latin, English, French and Spanish. Don't miss it if you are a very true fan of Nana Mouskouri because we can see her at one of her most beautiful performances, with her unique voice. It would be so good to have this product in a new release, I mean, in a DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful...if you were the son of John Ames","review":"This book would be a great read if you were actually the son of John Ames and were reading about your own father's history since it would at least bear personal relevance. For the general public, however, this book is incredibly boring and lacks basic continuity.I'd have put the book down after the first 30 pages only it was a book club book and I felt obligated to put myself through the misery of actually reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"I rate this one star only because there are not negative stars. As another reviewer said there is no beginning, no middle, and no end. It is simply a rambling monologue with no plot or purpose; except to make money for the author. This was a gift so at least I did not spend the money; but it is a shame anyone did. I read it all the way through (which makes me more stupid than those that quit at half way), thinking it would get better; it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth one star.","review":"I read a lot and enjoy most everything I read, but not this book. I kept reading it thinking it had to get better, had to have some redeeming value. No. It doesn't. I finally quit half way through and I'm so glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This book is boring!!! I am the type of person who reads to be enthralled, not bored. Interested, not confused. This book is short but a very hard read. Something I would expect to encounter in a college class, not something to read for fun. It took me a month to finish this book, and I am a fast reader. This year I am reading through the past pulitzer winners, and this has been the worst so far. My favorite \\"Empire Falls\\". I finished that book in 2 days. If you want a well written and interesting read, I would recommend that book. Dont read this unless you want to fall asleep or spend 10 minutes on a well-written but confusing sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Pulitizer!","review":"And shame on the editors!A mediocre short story at best.There was enough repeating drivel in this book to earn syndication royalties.For all the endless blabbering the narrator does about his wife, we are told next to nothing about her. \\"I have no family\\", she says, and that's it....247 pages, that's inexcusable.Most importantly for me, the preacher himself was mind numbingly boring, bland and indecisive. To what good is this preacher as an example, if he is so overwrought with selfdoubt?At 77 years old, if this is the \\"life/legacy letter\\" this preacher feels so compelled to leave to his young son then someone should phone the child protection agency. Sheeze! That's just plain cruel to leave that mess to a child.I tried repeatedly to find at least one passage to \\"hightlight\\" as inspiring. Never found one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it...","review":"I did not get past the first fifty pages. The lack of plot and structure did not appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religious philosophizing","review":"I am on the side of those who feel this book was a big bore and not really a novel. All the religious stuff bored me to death.AND - I am a college graduate who has read many classics, plus much modern literature. Why are there sentences in this book that I cannot understand despite re-reading them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as her first","review":"I know its always a mistake to anticipate, but after reading Housekeeping and thinking it was one of the best books I ever read, I ordered this before it even came out. It was written beautifully, as was her first book, but I agree with the reader who said it was harder to follow, it jumped around too much. Its worth a read fo people who loved Housekeeping, but I'd have to give it one star less."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift","review":"Some books we search for, others come to us at a time in our lives when we can best understand it or need it. GILEAD is such a book for me. How anyone with any accumulation of life experiences could rate this book a one is in comprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful bedtime reading - puts me to sleep everytime.","review":"I keep this book by my bed as a sleep aid. Even if I am not feeling overly tired, I read a few pages and I can't keep my eyes open. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with insomnia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilead","review":"I am very surprised and puzzled over all the praise that has been given this book. I found it to be turgid, slow moving and rather dull. Even though I am close to the age of the Minister and grew up in the same era as he did, I could not relate to him nor Gilead,Iowa at all. In fact I found him quite a wimp!! As for his so-called \\"wisdom\\",that,too,struck a wrong note with me. His philosophy is very simplistic; anyone with a knowlege of religion and/or philosophy will be quite impatient with the musings of our Minister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needing balm for Gilead","review":"Because I loved Marilynne Robinson's \\"Housekeeping\\" I really looked forward to devouring \\"Gilead\\". So far, I'm disappointed. One reviewer called the book \\"demanding\\". I would call it tedious in the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn stifling meanderings","review":"While the author has a talent for making simple words seem lyrical, this so-called \\"letter\\" could have been half as long and therefore half as BORING. Didn't identify with the setting, the over the hill preacher or any of the tiny little everyday details of his life - past or present. Is this really how he wants his son to see him? Why do people try to justify books like this just because they have \\"Pulitizer Prize\\" attached? I'm beginning to think the group that awards the prizes must also lead very BORING lives and therefore don't know any better. Whatever happened to dynamic, thought-provoking story-telling with good character development, settings that jump off the pages rich in description, and succinct language that tells it all in a minimum of words, but the right ones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel?...Very Long Essay!","review":"I was memsmerized by Robinson's HOUSEKEEPING but bored by GILEAD because I expected a novel...maybe the technique of a long letter to a son or grandson (or whomever an author chooses) has been overused or maybe the characters did not present as real or maybe it was the lack of plot...whatever the reason I was bored. I am pretty objective in regard to religous opinion (biblical), so agreeing to an author's point of view is not enough to make gripping fiction...I skimmed...Its interesting to see the books that are bestsellers and win awards. Maybe that aspect makes it worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Day Classic","review":"I first heard about this book from a TV interview with Laura Bush promoting a National Book festival in Washington, DC. A reporter asked her what her favorite book was and being a former librarian she said that was a hard decision but she picked Gilead. I ordered it and read it and I absolutely loved it. It is destined to become a classic like those that were required reading when I was in school many years ago. It is a book that I will keep and read again and again because it teaches lessons about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond belief","review":"I really don't get why people seem to love this book so much. I got the themes -- the meditations on the relationships between fathers and sons, for example -- but overall this book didn't strike me as tightly written. It felt more like Robinson jotted down miscellaneous thoughts, realized she couldn't figure out a way to use them in a conventionally structured novel, and decided to use the epistlatory form as an easy out. Robinson can write -- there are paragraphs here and there throughout the book that are beautifully crafted -- but the book as a whole is disappointing.In short, overall Gilead seemed very contrived and unnatural. The passing references to John Brown appeared poorly researched, and even Robinson's geography is messed up. She keeps describing Kansas as though it's right next to Iowa, and it definitely is not. Would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"..sigh..","review":"What's awesome about this book isn't the plot; it's the divine writing. The flow of Robinson's words are comparable to the calm of a quiet bath. Really, I can't say enough about it. To sum up this book, I would call it *lovely*, absolutely and utterly *lovely*. I beleive that this book requires a reader whom is able to just be still and find comfort in the unbeleivable imagery that they will find themselves in."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must for anybody feeling Wanted to be Loved.","review":"I think that this is one of these books which leaves you feeling fulfilled at the end. You don't *have* to be affiliated with a particular religion to derive meaning from the father's words for his son. Simplicity is emphasized thoroughout this novel (I was about to type short; you feel that way because of the author's style of writing, but it's actually over 100 pages long). I like how the author brings in various touches of reality (such as the Athiest Intellectual, baseball games heard over the radio, starvation) and interwines them with timeless life lessons that really can only be passed down through the generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over sentimental","review":"Excellent prose, almost poetical writing. Theres no doubt the writer has a gift for such. I'm not so sure of the content though. Mrs Robinson's main protagonist was less than convincing as a MALE pastor.I read three quarters of the book and had to put it down unfortunately out of severe boredom. Perhaps I shouldn't be reviewing it because it appears much of the \\"good stuff\\" was nearer the end. I didn't have the strength to make it that far, wading throught the mawkish over sentimentality withered me down.I've been hearing that \\"life is beautiful\\" phrase all too often lately and its becoming cliche. If you you want to read a book of substance with some interesting observations and messages about life (which is what I thought the Pulitzer prize was about) then this is not the book for you.If you want a book about the wonderousness of life, melodramatically embroidered love and all things nice and squidgy then by all means buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilead makes me want to speak to my grown sons","review":"This is a book that is beautifully written. Some passages were so touching that I wanted to read them over and savor them. You would miss a lot if you try to speed read this beautiful book. I felt like I knew all the characters as intiment friends.PAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book, well written","review":"I had my doubts about this one when I first started to read it, but soon my doubts were gone because this book is so sweet.It begins as a father recounting memorable events from his life, but then it evolves into some profound insights into human behavior. The book ends with the minister father, John Ames, and his name sake son understanding each other, after many years of not knowing each other.I marveled at the use of language in this book. It is told with an educated language, and it is so smooth: like a symphony.I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Small Wonder","review":"That a novel about a pastor from a small town in Iowa won the Pulitzer Prize is a small wonder. That the novel doesn't present the hero has a mere caricature is a minor miracle. Christan fiction, if that is what Gilead is, has never been noted for its depth of characterization--at least in its more modern manifestations. The message in most of the Christian fiction that is currently popular points to the Gospel, it preaches. Gilead reveals a man who has faith. But the miracle that Marilynne Robinson has created is of a faith that is revealed not in preaching, but in a life well lived by a man that I would love to spend a day with; a man that I would love to while away some hours talking about faith, life, and perhaps who is playing second base for our favorite baseball teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass it On!","review":"I read Gilead on loan from the library. I was so moved by the lyricism and depth of the writing that I knew that I needed the book on my shelf to read and re-read and to give as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with literature","review":"This book illustrates the issue I have with contemporary American literature, flat, uninviting and has very little bearing on modern life or concerns. A disjointed story that for me contained no focus or reason to really care about the subject matter. Very tepid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching but occassionally boring","review":"The narrator, John Ames, is 76 and a preacher who has lived almost all of his life in Gilead, Iowa. He is writing a letter to his almost seven-year-old son from his second marriage. The letter is a consideration of John's life containing touching reminiscences and meditations on fathers and children, particularly on sons, on faith, and on the imperfectability of man. All the critics loved this one. I found it moving and thought-provoking generally but also a bit boring. I think my lack of full appreciation could be because I do not have any children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"...and stupid. Full of wonder for the creation and blah blah blah. No character is likeable in this book or even remotely interesting. I can imagine having to be in their company and going out of my mind with boredom, talking about beautiful phrases as the twinkling of an eye and the infinite goodness of the Lord and incorruptibility. I wonder how many people it has driven off religion once and for all. And I know marriage is supposed to be a mystery and has to be consumated, but frankly I find quite disgusting the idea of a seventy year old man consumating with a thirty year old woman. Also if I had a son I wouldn't be comforted with the thought that he died of the Spanish influenza and so didn't have to kill anyone. He is so satisfied with himself with this explanation, that I'd like to hit him and wake him up. I wouldn't give this book to my worse enemy. The Pulitzer Committee obviously had been out on a binge the night before giving it the prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"In going through all of the reviews, I was amused by all of the attempts to praise this book, with many reviewers finally reluctantly admitting that they found the book boring or tedious. Let's be honest. This is a plotless, boring, meandering, pretentious book that doesn't come close to living up to the hype that surrounded its publication. I suppose the author is capable of putting together \\"beautiful\\" language. But when it doesn't add up to anything, when there is no story, when characters are poorly developed or not developed at all, when points are made by telling you (over and over) what the author is trying to say, rather than demonstrating them through development of a story, it's a bad book. And, notwithstanding the critical praise and the prizes, this is a bad book. Now, was that so difficult to say? Not at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"The \\"build up\\" on the fly and back cover of this book would lead you to believe that it is more than it is. I found it hard to follow for the first 100 pages, lost interest, kept reading for a book group and finally finished it, otherwise I would not have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful literate letter of an old man's existential crisis","review":"John Ames, a 76 year old preacher from Iowa, is dying. This book is his letter to his 7 year old son. An amazing exploration of father/son relationships and one preacher's existential crisis.This is *not* a \\"spiritual\\" book reserved for religious minded people; any parent, any adult, anyone interested in the human condition will find this a wonderful book.I read in one review that the book teaches you how to read it; and that is a terrific insight. The pace is more measured, but it is not slow, and there is treasure on every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but slow","review":"I enjoyed this novel, but the pace is slow and the story line does not compell you to read keeping reading, so I ut it down for days at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilead","review":"This gentle, beautiful novel was one of the most delightful and charming books I have read in years.

The main character recounts the events of his life and portions of his family history for his son when he is gone. This book is not as much action or event driven as it is almost a poem as a novel. The story is touching at times but at the same time gets somewhat repetitive regarding the relationship between the main character and his namesake. Worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow","review":"Beautifully written, but very, very slow. One of the 'longest' short novels I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"We read this book for our book club. It is a tender book, one that pulls you in. The narrative is not straightforward, but more like peeling the layers of an onion. It is ultimately a story of love and forgiveness, without being at all puerile or sugarcoated. This is a great example of literature that is well written and uplifting, without your having to be embarrassed by any of the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Wait to Finish...","review":"I found this book dissapointing. I see from many other reviews, and from the Pulitzer Board, that I am in the minority. We all have our own tastes. There are plenty of Pulitzer Prize winning novels that I read and wonder \\"What am I missing here?\\" This is just one more in that category. The story is slow. The characters are only slightly interesting, but not enough to grab my attention for long. I forced myself to pick up the book at night, counting how many pages until the ending. I skimmed pages at a time when the writing became tedious. I gave the book away. Try \\"Angle of Repose\\" by Stegner for an incredible Pulitzer Prize read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Best of Modern American Literature","review":"I am not usually one for slow paced novels. Especially ones about the trials and tribulations of a small town mid-western preacher. But Gilead is different. This is one of the best constructed and most beautifully written novels I have ever read. Characters come into focus through small details and moments that make up everyday life, and by the end, I was reading this like a page turning thriller; staying up late into the night to find out what happens to the characters.If you want to see the best that modern American fiction has to offer, I highly recommend Robinson and Gilead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly beautiful masterpiece","review":"I write this review after reading Gilead for the second time. Over the summer, this novel was my solace through an especially rough stretch. I ended the book in tears.I decided to read it once again, under slightly different circumstances, and I found the brilliant insights and beautiful language just as heartbreakingly masterful as before. Robinson writes in a deliberate and thoughtful manner, knitting together many pieces of American history and human nature. An instant classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This was the most unbelievably boring and pointless book that I have read in a long time. The words are nicely strung together but the author has absolutely nothing to say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless, Pointless, Pretentious","review":"Lengthy, rambling dissertations on theology, the Bible, and sermons. Purportedly from an elderly minister who finds nothing strange about the fact that he has married a bride so young, he will not live to see his child reach teenage. Very reminiscent to me of sermons and lectures given by people who loved to hear the sound of their own voices. Bla bla bla with no plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and monotonous","review":"I did not like this book. It was very hard to finish because it was so boring. People who like things to happen in novels and not just simple descriptions and dialogue should not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Through It","review":"It put me to sleep. I just couldn't finish it. There's no story and it just goes on...and on... and on... Oops! Falling asleep again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I've liked or loved all of the Pulitzer winners I've read. I bought this book because it won the prize and expected to at the very least -- like it. Sadly, I didn't like it and had to force myself to finish it. I hung on only because I knew it had to get better. And, it finally it in the last 20%. But, not enough to redeem the first 80%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful","review":"I usually fly through novels, but this one forced me to slow down and appreciate it. I have not yet read Robinson's signature work, \\"Housekeeping,\\" but she wowed me here. She writes like no one else I've read, in a way that seems utterly simple and plain and clear, yet containts a certain kind of Midwest lyricism, full of poetry and profundity.Many readers will likely be put off by the slow pace, especially of the book's seemingly rambly backstory in the first half. Although the entire book is written through the voice of a dying octogenarian writing a novel-length missive to his elementary-age son, it does contain plot developments, drama, a bit of mystery and even suspense, albeit in Robinson's own quiet way. I found the novel, once I slowed down to absorb it, utterly beautiful and captivating. It's one of the few modern novels I've read that I think could be discussed on many levels as a work of literature in a college English class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing to read","review":"In this amazingly beautiful work of fiction, Robinson manages to capture the beauty, pathos, and miracles of everyday life. I walked away with two primary impressions: First, how absolutely breathtaking is the voice of Rev. John Ames. For one squaring off against his own mortality, he has an amazingly refreshing outlook on life. Secondly, it has been a long while since I've seen quite a colorful character as Ames' grandfather: a kleptomaniac, one-eyed, vision-led prophet that fought against slavery with a Bible in one hand and a pistol in the other. It is not a stretch to say that this book had echoes of Faulkner, Steinbeck, with as compelling a narrator as To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot","review":"This is not the type of book I enjoy reading. I had read other reviews that sang the praises of Gilead, so I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. When I started reading, I kept thinking of the reviews that noted that as the story progressed, the book got better . I kept waiting for the book to get \\"interesting\\" and, in my view, it just never improved. I got bogged down in the slow, steady rendition of the life story of the author. There is no plot to drive the book forward. It is a book that can easily be put down and not be picked up again for days. If you just need a time filler, this is the book to choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Poetry in this book","review":"Just a short qoute from this book will give you an idea of why it is a gem: \\"I lived on the prairie all my life, so a line of oak trees can still astonish me.\\" This book of writing about existence on this earth, nature, and self reflection is for all those who have a poetic sensibility. It's clear observations are themselves astonishing. It is not off-putting, as it could be, if it were written from the viewpoint of a self-righteous preacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and meandering","review":"I loved \\"Housekeeping\\", both the book and movie. Gilead was hard for me to stay with to the end.As I age, I have given myself permission to not finish a book which holds little or no interest for me. I started this book three times and now it is on my shelf waiting for me to pass it on to a friend or a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm tired of reading \\"also ran\\" Pulitzer books","review":"Aside from a few charming anecdotes and a little well crafted use of archaic phrasing, this book was a total snooze to me. I love beautiful writing but this book has very little story, and the first person narrative of the boring, but well intentioned minister gets old VERY quickly.Thank goodness Jack comes along in the second half of the book to add some interest...but my attention was lost by then.Robinson also has a habit of repeating previously presented information over and over...if I had to read one more time about how the church ladies would come into the reverend's house to clean or to leave dinner...If you're looking for advice on future book purchases from competition winners, look to the National Book Award winners and Whitbread Winners. I should have learned my lesson with \\"A Frolic of His Own\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, pretentious and self indulgent","review":"\\"Mesmerising\\" is a word i've seen several times by critics describing this novel but i'm not sure that they don't really mean \\"soporific\\".I don't buy the premise of this novel for a start. The idea of an aging man writing this dull treatise to his young son just doesn't seem plausible to me. Its clearly just a device for the author to hold forth with her musings on life the universe and everything in it and that's a bit like listening to someone describing their dreams. You might be attentive for the first 30 seconds but after that its all you can do to stifle the yawns. The maudlin ramblings of the Rev Ames failed to interest me in the slightest. There's no doubt that Marilynne Robinson can write beautiful prose but its a shame she doen't have anything interesting to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilead","review":"This book was received promptly and even though a paperback it was in excellent, like-new condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"excruciating for some, love affair for others","review":"This book seems to have a very specific group of readers who really love it. I'm not one of them. It took me over 50 pages to even get into the odd rhythm of the prose. I stuck it out for another 50 pages because it was the book for my literature group and they all get 100 pages before I give up. By that point, I still hadn't found anything appealing about it and I quit. Of my book group 2 women adored it and 1 other couldn't stand it. This is a book for the abstract person, not for very literal thinkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"Gilead is an exquisite novel. It is beautiful and satisfying. In this powerful story, an Iowa preacher who is sick with heart disease is trying to make sense of his life and his family history for the young son he will not live to raise.The main character has experienced losses and reconciliations. The tableau of his larger family includes the rifting effect of slavery on his father and grandfather - each of whom dealt with that evil in a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story","review":"This story captures the hopes and wants of a father for his son mixed with the need for that same father to be remember by this earth. The themes are universal - seeing his own time on earth drawing nigh, the idea of leaving without everything \\"being in order\\" draws the father (written as the father by the talented Robinson) to write this series of essays that make up the novel. Anyone mortal can relate to the human rawness of emotion and hope for the world to be better than it is. I couldn't put it down and I wanted it to keep going when it finished. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy and dishonest","review":"This is the kind of novel a novelist writes when she can't figure out what kind of novel to write so decides to write a letter. A long letter. This decision absolves her from the responsibility to create plot and structure and to provide continuity and chronology. Open up this book at random and find sections or paragraphs beginning: \\"I will tell you some more old stories.\\" \\"Once, I went out with Glory...\\" \\"Having looked over these thoughts I set down last night...\\" \\"But I have strayed a little from my subject...\\" \\"Another morning, thank the Lord.\\" With the next paragraph beginning--and here is where this letter becomes more a diary--\\"Last night I finished THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE.\\" \\"This is an important thing, which I have told many people...\\"The important thing about this novel is that it's not: not a novel, not a good book, not an honest aesthetic effort. It's a lazy effort by someone who should have known better and probably does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer Prize?","review":"I read everything. Trash to classics. This is a terrible book. I will quote Kurt Vonnegut:When asked for advise on writing from a group of fledgling young authors, Vonnegut said, \\"If it doesn't advance the plot or build character development....throw it out.

This was definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. Essentially, it is an old man's final rambling letter to his young son. There is little point to what he has to say to his son. The book is boring and drags on and on. I just wanted it to be over. I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent, virtuoso performance by a contemporary master!","review":"Known for rich and poetic prose, Robinson's Housekeeping won her a PEN/Hemingway award and became a modern classic. Her second novel, Gilead, written some 23 years later, deeply questioned the quick or glibly transactional conception of Christianity proffered by American media during the intensified debate over morality in the contemporary political scene. This story of the elegant sacredness of the illumined mind in the context of transcendent love garnered the Pulitzer Prize and helped restore our understanding of the nature of faith and dignity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilead","review":"Sorry, this may have won a pulizer prize, but I found it boring. The only reason I finished it beacause it was my book club book. When the characters were expanded it was interesting, but that was not often, most of the characters were flat and uninteresting. I found myself thinking was this the kind of history I would leave to my child - I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Mini--Essays","review":"This is a novel only in the barest sense. There is little plot, and what plot there is, is so mundane and pedestrian as to smack of a first year literature student stuggling to piece together various story lines from past read works. Gilead is really the musings and sometimes arcane philosophy of Ms. Robinson, written in various letters by an underachieving preacher. The book is a tedious read, and after the first few pages, one reluctantly treads on, hoping for some epiphany, or at least a surprise along the way. It never comes, and after a while the reader only wants to finish the boring treatise."},{"rating":"1","title":"An old man droning on and on","review":"Well, most people would describe me as able to read anything. I am transfixed by 1000 pages of Russian sagas. I am commuting and listening to books on tape. Have found some really marvelous ones. This one is like a sad old, uninteresting old man droning on and on and on. I really wanted to like it, but after 2 CDs gave it up. This wasn't a person who had held a spellbinding life droning on about the excitements of life--it was a boring minister in the middle of some mid-western state talking about his sermons that he saved. And the only one he threw out. Not much of a plot. I couldn't find enough potentially redeeming plot after 2 CDs to listen any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Approach","review":"This thoughtful book is meant for a quiet read. A father's love, often NOT the subject of books, is infused in these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary - A classic","review":"Reading Gilead is a unique and beautiful experience. It surprises in it's apparent simplicity-allowing the reader to enter into the protagonist's mind, heart and soul. You forget you are actually reading an author's imaginary tale; this character is real as he struggles to tell his young son some of the important aspects of a life that is lived with a belief in God and prayer. Yet the book is not \\"preachy\\" in tone. The author has hit on issues relevant now in our own time while telling a story with history, culture, religion, spirituality, and good old fashioned love and forgiveness. Anyone interested in leading a reflected life in a world not so easy to understand will appreciate this book. I will read it over and over again.I highly recommend this book to all readers who want more depth and soul in a book. Kudo's to Marilynne Robinson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Haven't read the book in full yet.

Waited a couple years to read it and do not intend to finish it. Would like to send it back to you. Life is too short to waste time with this rambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artful work","review":"This book is a record of a meandering stream of feelings of a heartland preacher. The author did an amazing job of painting a picture of a lost soul -- one who is at once enmired in self and still is bent on intruding into the lives of others. It is on the whole a sad story, the story of an unhappy man who loves to muse on things but lacks a solid philosophical foundation on which to moor his thoughts. The author has captured this unhappiness in a powerful way. As a consequence, although the book is neither uplifting nor edifying, one turns the last page with a profound respect for the artistry of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent story, but not much else.","review":"I was interested in the idea of the book, had a good premise.

I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked. There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward. It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.

No plot to speak of, albiet some beautiful phrasing but borrrrrring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tender, reflective work","review":"Gilead: A Novel, by Marilynne Robinson, is a tender, reflective book that brought tears to my eyes several times as I read it. It is a journal account -- some might say a letter -- of a Congregationalist minister's life, written so that his 7 year old son might \\"know him\\" once he dies.Initially this book was difficult for me to get into, as there are no chapters or plot changes to mark beginnings and ending. However, once I slowed down and read it in snippets, like one might read old letters or journals I found myself entranced by the author's deft and terribly beautiful prose. Her descriptions of rural life shone with the frayed-edged simplicity of everyday living, and the theological musings on life, death, grace, pacifism, war, and blessing are grounded first and foremost in relationships with others, both dear friends and beloved family.I have a feeling that I will be returning to this book in the future for a second read. One time through just doesn't do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of book","review":"Gilead: a Novel: This was just not my type of book. I'm reading it because it was picked by the book club I belong to. Could not get into it. No easy to follow. Too much of the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book too slow and religious","review":"Could not wait for the book to end. Some interesting moments in book to conemplate but all in all too slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemplative and Thoughtful","review":"Reading Gilead is a bit like being swept down a slow moving stream. Robinson so effectively becomes the 76 year-old narrator, that as I read, I often forgot it was written by a woman. The narrator is convincing, believable, and flawed. He has wisdom, but at the same time he makes mistakes in judgement and possesses very human characteristics like jealousy. This book might be tagged as Christian or moral, but I think that those labels sell it short. Any variety of reader, Christian or atheist, can gain depth and understanding of life from the insights in this book. Robinson states things so eloquently that I found myself reading and re-reading passages so that I might remember them better. This book is not a page-turner, not filled with excitement on every page. However, while reading it, I felt like I was privy to see inside a life that held special meaning and insight...and I am better for having read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet wonder","review":"Marilynne Robinson is a truly gifted writer. I read many books but this one touched me in a way not many others have. This is a quiet thought provoking book. If you're in the mood for some light, entertaining, escapist reading-this is not the book. I read the book in small chunks, marveling at the writers ability to get the voice of this 76 year old preacher. Her prose is spare, lyrical and dead on. The layers of the story had me reading quickly to get more detail yet wanting to go slower so the story would not end. I am most definately going to go find a copy of her previous book, Housekeeping. I hope to read more from Marilynne Robinson in the not to distant future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was eager to read \\"Gilead\\" based on the positive reviews and the Pulitizer Prize. Admittedly, the writing is beautiful, and there are some profound thoughts the author shares. But the book is boring, lacks plot, and for all the writing, lacks important characterization. For example, it is obvious that Ames' wife is younger and uneducated. But we don't know where she is from, or how she got to Gilead. Rather than leaving the reader hungry for more, the slo-o-ow pace and lack of pertinent information about the characters just left me frustrated. The author also over-used some of the better images, such as the \\"communion\\" that Ames received from his father. The image was interesting the first time, but Ames then references it again-and again-and again. It was less a novel than the musings of the character. A disappointment from what is obviously a good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemplative novel","review":"Summary, no spoilers:John Ames, a 76 year old minister from Iowa, is in failing health. He decides to write down his family history, and his thoughts about life, for the benefit of his young 6 year old son.John's remembrances go back and forth in time, and often read like diary entries. We learn about John's father and grandfather, also both ministers...although each with very different personalities.This is a very quiet book. It's beautifully written, and and filled with profound revelations and thoughts about the meaning of our lives.I think one really needs to be in a certain mood to read Gilead, almost a meditative state. There is very little \\"action\\" in this book, and yet it is expansive in it's reach.Recommended, but best be in the right mood to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only finished it because my book club was reading it","review":"This one was really hard to get through. It was slow and contemplative to the edge of comatose. I stuck with it to the end because I was determined to piece together a definable plot and/or message. Finally, in the last thirty pages of the book, something came together. But I would not recommend this book...for the Pulitzer or for a book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilead","review":"** As an old preacher nears the end of his life, he comes to the realization that he will not be there to see his seven year old grow to manhood. Therefore, before he passes from this world, he writes a letter, taking his son back in time with his words, explaining how the preacher became the man he now is in hopes of influencing the boy, despite being departed. Sprinkled through the meandering recollections are Biblical truths, metamorphasizing memories into parables. Much like Patterson's Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, in form, if not content, this has true wisdom conveyed in a style that will require the reader to cultivate patience. If you are hoping for a compelling plot or dynamic characters, you may wish to look elsewhere. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth the hype","review":"Using the format of a long letter (or series of letters?) to a seven-year-old boy from his elderly and dying father, Robinson has written a novel that draws in the battles over slavery in antebellum Kansas, along with more mundane daily life in small town Iowa during the first half of the 20th century. I know that Gilead has received accolades and even the Pulitzer, but I found it less than inspiring. I was able to finish it only because the story and quality of writing were so lightweight it could be finished quickly and I could go on to even better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So incredibly BORING","review":"This book is written from the perspective of Reverend John Ames who is nearing the end of his life and has decided to write down his life's thoughts for his young son. He married and conceived a child late in life and is afraid that his son will never really know him. This narrative is an effort to leave something behind for his son to read and discover. He writes of his parents and family, how he met his wife, and the daily goings on as he writes the memoir.This book is incredibly slow and dull. I am amazed by all of the reviews that talk of the exquisite writing and masterful storytelling. It took me over a month to plow through 247 pages. There is nothing interesting about the story and the good Reverand just seems to like the idea of his own thoughts. In many ways, instead of being insightful and touching, it is selfish and indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"I took me several attempts to get through it because it was possibly the most boring book I have ever read. It is written completely in the first person and the narrator drones on and on reminiscing over his boring life for over 300 pages. It was unbearable. I was initially drawn to it because it is a Pulitzer Prize winner and I am attempting to read more widely recognized/award-winning books. However, I am also looking for entertainment and a compelling plot. This book contains neither. It should be most-likely reserved for other writers or intellectuals who can take the time to analyze the nuances of every line of prose. Just a warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with this one...builds slowly, richly, in layers","review":"Don't be put off by the plain prose or the seemingly slow pace at the start of this book. You might wonder, as I first did: Where's the story? Then I saw, as I kept going, that I was experiencing the richness of one man's life, built layer by layer, revelation by revelation.It waws a bit like meeting someone, not getting a strong first impression and then realizing that the person is deeper than you ever expected, surprising you with new perceptions and insignts, revealing a richness of spirit you hadn't foreseen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"There's loads of reviews on this book so I won't duplicate explanations. However, I must say I fell into the category of those readers that just didn't care for this book. Yes, it has a quiet, gentle, reflective theme, but I admit to being just plain bored stiff.Sometimes after I've started a book that I just can't get into, I come to Amazon and read the reviews of others to see if I'm just totally off base. Then, I restart the book with a different attitude and try to envision what it was that others saw. For me, I never could capture the feelings of those readers who gave \\"Gilead\\" a 5 star rating. There were pages and pages that I read and reread time and again just trying to get something out of it. I didn't really become interested in this book at all until about page 220 when Jack Boughton reveals his reasons for returning home.This is not to diminish other reviews as we all certainly get something different out of the books we read. For me, however, it was just a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"most engrossing novel I have read this year","review":"Not much to add after 97 (so far) reviews.Beautifully written, theologically rich, full of history, and love and pain and disappointments.I read about a book a week, and never before have I done this: I read this entire book out loud. It is so lovely that way. It was so conversational in tone that to me it seemed written for the ear as much as the eye.Utterly enobliing. I connected with the narrator instantly, and it left me longing to be a person more like him. I may disagree with some of his theology, but his sensitive heart, his love of his God, his regrets and passion -- at times it was all just overwhelming. I couldn't read more than 10-20 pages at a time.After the first day I bought a second copy to give as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"The long version of the bible.","review":"I continued reading thinking to myself there must be more to this book or perhaps the ending makes it all worth while. However, this was not the case at all after I labored through the entire book. It was incredibly boring unless you really like reading the bible and someone's interpretation of the meaning. There were parts that were nice, but it just went on and on and on.

But, unless you are particularly interested in musing on the nature of spiritual faith, it's not likely you'll find this book compelling in the way her novel HOUSEKEEPING was. I'm not religious, and I'm not particularly interested in religion as a subject of a novel as opposed to religion used to define a character in a novel.

Nothing of any consequence happens in this book, nothing at all. No difference was made. No revelations. Imagine never leaving your small town then writing about it.

Ross is an American, desparate to return to America after obtaining his youngest brother from an English bording school. He agrees to marry Taylor for the money to get his brother home.Along the way, the story picks up many different characters, and has an added bonus of a side romance story.

There is nothing original in this story. The characters are trite, especially the well-groomed and gregarious title character. The writing is mediocre at best, and the proofreading of the finished copy leaves much to be desired.

Fantasy is a difficult genre, because it takes some budget to pay for the costumes and special effects. BUt with a good script a good director can make a good fantasy movie on a low budget. Unfortunately, \\"Dragon Hunter\\" doesn't have a good script and obviously wasn't made by a good director (the same person who wrote the script). The plot is totally uninteresting and moves at a snail's pace. The cast don't help either; I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances in low budget movies but this movie has some of the most wooden dialogue and acting I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of bad movies). It's slightly amusing to watch for about two minutes but the movie goes on for 90 very slow, very boring minutes. \\"Dragon Hunter\\" isn't worth spending money or even time on.

The book suggests to \\"use rope instead of cord for extra strength\\" (p. 114) and the ocean plait on p. 233 is presented in white cord, making it extremely difficult to follow. I'm pretty sure the final result is wrong, too. The round mat on p. 228 is recommended for use as a coaster for hot pans, but is presented in synthetic line.

We thought it would be better to put headers on rather than use the old exhaust manifolds after fixing a couple of broken exhaust studs. The headers are poorly designed, and after many tries to get the exhaust leak stopped, we finally found out that the drivers side needed an area ground down so it would seal completely. After having them off and on many times because the U pipe wouldn't seal, we found that the oil filter would be next to impossible to get off. We fought these crappy things for a couple months before we got it done. If you're determined to buy them anyway, be sure to invest in good header gaskets from Nissan, and also an oil filter relocation kit, as well as some header wrap and hose clamps to keep the U pipe from leaking.

At this point I can honestly say, that I have always found the information I needed in less than 4 minutes. Exact, detailed information.The only area that I found the book lacking in, is the exclusion of European standards. For instance DIN reference numbers, but as the world is heading toward ISO9000 the old reference numbers are becoming obsolete in any case.It's price of $80.00 may seem steep, but in comparison to the other works out there, it is reasonable.

Bush. Bruni covered the Bush Campaign for the New York Times. In this book, he reveals the real George Bush and the close election of 2000. There were lots of colorful insight and also jokes played during this campaign. What this book revealed was an uncomplicated man who was seeking the presidency. Bush also could laugh at himself, including his fumbling of the English language. The Presidency was not his all consuming passion as it was for Al Gore. This knowledge validated my vote for Bush.Bruni covers only the campaign and the aftermath of the election. There is only a little background history of Bush before his presidential run. There are no photos in this book. The book is strictly a look at Bush's run for the White House in 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow &#65533;journalism.&#65533;","review":"Frank Bruni's book is indicative of where \`journalism' is heading these days. Short on real analysis of the issues and more inclined to view elections as mere \`beauty contests,' Bruni's book is long of fluff and short on depth. This book is a must to avoid but could be of interest for journalism's students who wish to see how awful mainstream journalism has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambling into history","review":"The author began with a pre-conceived opinion of George W. Bush. The book is supposed to be the results of his clinical, fair, and unbiased judgement of Bush, as he plumbed Bush's character during the campaign. The author managed to find a few good traits and glimpses of the real Mr. Bush, which he reluctantly revealed. The part I found most interesting was Bruni's frank admissions about the manner in which reporters provoked confrontations between the candidates, and used a mob mentality to set up a construct of the campaigns just to have news items. Not a surprise - this type of media reporting has long been obvious to anyone who watches news with any regularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Bruni is such an inimitably marvelous writer that I'd happily read a laundry list if he had written it. His stories in the Times are always delectable, and now his fans get a whole book to enjoy.

This book is not about George W. Bush: it's about what it felt to be a moderately sophisticated political reporter following Dubya's 2000 campaign. It was, would you believe it, exhausting! Reporters didn't get enough sleep and ate too much! The candidate wasn't always available! He repeated the same speech stop after stop! Are you fascinated yet?Frank Bruni covered the campaign for the New York Times, a good paper where reporters aren't supposed to put themselves at the center of the stories they report. This must have chafed: here no happening is too trivial (Bruni breaking his laptop, Bruni dashing to the mall to buy a new pair of pants) to be included.What about Bush? will you ask. Nothing that you won't find, a hundred times better written and observed, in Bill Minutaglio's remarkable \\"First Son\\". That book also has an index, something Frank Bruni dispenses with altogether. Give \\"Ambling into History\\" a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambling is nonsense","review":"I found Ambling so typical of the political reporting today. Mr. Bruni decries the pagentry and staged photo opps that candidates engage in, but does not acknowledge that the reason they do so many photo ooops, etc., is that the media gives only superficial coverage to the candidates' views. He admits they set up fake confrontations between candidates in order to have \\"something\\" new and different to write about. Mr. Bruni is a terminal cynic. He exhibits some of the worst traits of journalists. They are judgemental and never satisfied. Don't bother reading this book. I had to opportunity to meet George W. Bush on the tarmac of a small airpost in northwest Iowa in September of l999. The description by Mr. Bruni of how he interacted with the crowds is misleading. We spent 45 minutes in his company. Yes, he signed autographs, but also talked about sustantively issues. He answered the concerns of farmers as well as the businessmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Look at Who Dubya Really Is","review":"I have had full faith in President George W.

President Bush is not only dedicated to catching those responsiable for the attacks, but also for protecting the nation in which he leads with dignity and grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viewing George W. with a slightly jaundiced eye","review":"This portrait of Bush from the primaries to the presidency is a good read, not only for his intimate view of Bush as a political animal, but also for its insight on what it's like to be a reporter following him. (If this aspect appeals to you, have a look at another book, \\"The Boys on the Bus\\" by Timothy Crouse. It's a classic account of reporters following the 1972 presidential campaign trail.)Bruni's observations about Bush tend to be tart and somewhat cynical at times, which is why I gave it only four stars. Overall, though, it's excellent reporting, and will be an important part of the historical record of the Bush presidency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambling into History","review":"As I mentioned in an earlier review... Frank Bruni has written a trivial book... mostly about himself on Air Force One.How easy it is to diminish a well-known person and find plaudits and kudos from those readers who want their views re-inforced. Thanks to those reviewers who got it right: \\"The book is biased.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A reporter seduced","review":"Bruni's book is noteworthy for its unwitting chronicle of this political reporter's seduction by his subject: George W. Bush. Bruni got considerable \\"face-time\\" with Bush the Candidate, and found him to be an amusing \\"regular guy.\\" Bruni gives Bush considerable credit for this achievement. Was Bruni so cowed by the WASP oligarchy that \\"they're just people too\\" was a revelation to him? Did the nerdy and skeptical Bruni doubt his own ability to pass for a \\"regular guy?\\"Bill Clinton possessed an impressive ability to befriend and manipulate reporters who covered him.

Hits WAY closer to the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appropriately Non-Issue Portrait of a Campaign","review":"Frank Bruni's Ambling into History (The Unlikely Odyssey of George W. Bush) is a fun read. It is shallow in its portrayal of the the campaign to make George Bush president as well the boys on the bus who followed him around. But, in this case, it is an appropriate approach as the author makes it clear the reporters cared as little about the issues as the candidate himself did. This book, instead, focuses on the look and manner of the man and in that respect presents many telling, often humourous details. This examination makes a good companian piece to Alexandra Pelosi's documentary while providing an even broader perspective, giving glimpses into the personalities of Laura and the elder Bushes and continuing the coverage into the (often too fawning) first year of the presidency. It is more a glimpse of reporters covering the man than the actual man himself. But in that narrow framework, the book is entertaining enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a wonderful resource for Vonnegut fans and students.","review":"This compilation of interviews with Kurt Vonnegut covers 1969 through 1987. Vonnegut fans may recognize some of the conversations from amongst the known corpous (i.e. the Playboy interview from Foma, Wampeters, and Granfalloons) but by and large these come from quirky sources out of the main stream. The wonderfully casual Robert Scholes interview from 1973 is a delight. Also of interest is the 1974 Greg Mitchell piece written in the manner of Kilgore Trout. By all mean secure yourself a copy of this work. One flaw needs to be noted: With Vonnegut married to the skillful photographer Jill Kremetz, why put a pedestrian AP photo on the cover?Chris Huber"},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable resource for studying Vonnegut","review":"I am currently in the process of writing my thesis on Kurt Vonnegut, and this book is a fantastic resource.

The child could easily have a hearing handicap or a language handicap.The illustrator does a really powerful job of making us feel the sadness, isolation, and confusion of the child but the text shows no sensitivity to the child's feelings.

You can see all her experience at The New Yorker. Nonetheless, this book's lack of an interest story just throws that away. The most interesting character, Flo, appears in few occasions, while Rose is sometimes a very flat character. Probably the book doesn't deepen much in her other than her relationships with men.

The main lady characters are done very well and it is really fun seeing them renovate a house on their own (mostly). What I did find odd is that 2 of the husbands didn't want to be involved and both were retired and one seemed lost and without purpose. I'm glad the ladies did the work but since the one guy was grumpy about nothing to do he could have helped! All the characters lives (ladies) do change from start of movie to end.

So, I only have myself to blame. Anyhow, the bark collar isnt as effective as one would expect. My dog is normally quiet unless someone approaches the house, rings the bell or knocks on the door. It worked at first. Day 1 barking, caused a response from the collar and the dog yelped. Not sure if it was very painful or the dog was just surprised. However, by week two, he still barks whenever he feels like, albeit, less often.

This collar worked for her barking, but the fit was terrible. The collar is made of a stiff rubber and is all one piece, so it cannot be put on a more flexible collar. When it is adjusted to her small size, the buckle and barking device make the collar an odd shape, so the barking device does not stay by her throat unless it is adjusted so tightly that the prongs on the device press too hard into her throat.

High pitched whining is not detected. They get shocked very infrequently, if at all. The device itself is not inexpensive and the proprietary batteries are a rip-off at ten dol*ars each - requiring replacement monthly.

The collar's plastic is too rigid for a 6lb dog's neck. If you keep it tight, it only shifts around to the side of their neck. I've had this for almost a year and it's only worked a handful of times. Do not waste your money. I spent the extra money on this model because I thought that it was more humane - now I'm just a moron that's out $80."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money - would not recommend","review":"This collar spins around our dog's neck (9lb dog) and fails to measure vibration of the constant bark and therefore no correction. The collar is plastic and unable to be fastened tightly enough to stay in place and keep the mechanism at the throat. It is useless by design and ineffective at giving a correction. We would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I thought I was getting something else....","review":"The description didn't mention the use of static as a correction technique, but I guess that was my fault for not asking. I didn't want a shock collar. It was a bit dirty, but otherwise it appears to be working well, the one time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PetSafe Little Dog Bark Collar","review":"This product simply did not work on our Welsh Corgi. No matter how tight the collar was, or how short I shaved her neck, she rarely recieved any correction. As stated in other reviews, the collar moves too easily and unless it is perfectly positioned, on practically bare skin, at all times, you won't get consistent results. Customer support said the probes can't be longer because of the design. I think that says it all...poor design for the money. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this for little dogs!","review":"I bought this collar over a year ago for my min pin and it simply does not work. It has to stay directly on the front of the throat very tightly for it to work and this is impossible on a little dog. Even when put on very tightly, the collar shifts to the side so that the sensor is no longer directly on my dog's throat and will not be able to detects his barks. It's worked before for a minute or two but then shifts to the side and dog just barks away. Don't waste your money on this very expensive collar that does not work. I am going to try a citronella spray collar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"I had the misfortune of purchasing this collar. This collar is a disaster for a few reasons. First, the collar does not stay in place over the voice box. Because of the rigidity and shape of the collar and the fact that the heavy buckle is on the side of the collar, the collar will ride up and sit on the side of the dogs neck rendering it useless. Second, even when it is positioned correctly, it doesn't work. Perhaps it is the battery (which I replaced twice) or internally it is broken. Either way, stay away from this mess of a product. Petsafe should be ashamed of the poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zap","review":"It doesn't zap the yap of our newly adopted Pomeranian mix. Although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it, but it didn't slow her down much. We did everything according to directions, and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact. We have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well. I'm disappointed with this bark collar though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big waste of money for a product that doesn't work!","review":"I should have heeded the other reviewers. At first it did not work because the sensor part would not stay under his chin..ever. So my husband devised a way to solve that problem. Then the little battery case with the battery and the on/off button fell out! Our yard is too big to ever hope to find it. So Spike continues to bark his little head off. I am thoroughly disgusted and VERY disappointed. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! DOES NOT WORK!","review":"Before I bought this collar, I was attracted to it because it is small and made for small dogs. I have a 11 lb. havanese so I thought a small collar would be best. I read the reviews, most of which seemed to indicate that the collar didn't work, but I still bought the collar because I was hoping it would work for me. Unfortunately, the collar worked only 1 time. One single shock and it never worked again. I followed all the directions exactly and even shaved a bunch of the fur around my dog's neck but it still didn't work. Please heed my warning and do not purchase this collar. Fortunately, I was able to get a full refund from Amazon. Hopefully Petsafe realizes what a crap product they made and make significant improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Bought this after using a similar model some years ago. The problem with this one is both the sound and vibration have to be at the right \\"frequency\\" to illicit a shock. It has never worked. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"We've had several bark collars over the years for our dogs. After a year, and trying it on two dogs, this is by far the worst purchase ever! Collar itself is poorly designed; an overly complicated buckle AND quick release set up made with cheap, stiff plastic that does not conform to a \\"little dog's\\" neck at all. Being stiff, the overly-light sensor is easily rubbed off the dog's throat (my dogs are not stupid!) where it doesn't give any correction. After all, the dog needs to be able to breathe -- how tight can a collar be? The only thing the special, expensive battery does is power the flashing \\"on\\" light - constantly. At least I can find my Cairn Terrier in the dark - that is, if she isn't already out there barking. Phooey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"Bought two. Didn't work for either dog. Followed the directions to the 't' but it never deterred even one bark. Huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"First I do want to thank Petsafe for excellent customer service in quickly replacing my deluxe little dog bark collar. When I first received my 2nd collar I was excited as it worked right away. Unfortunately in the next five days it only worked once. It is very difficult to keep the part on the throat and I do not know if that is the problem. Unfortunately there are a lot of reviews saying the same thing. I am very frustrated with this product not working and am wondering what kind of testing your company does, as there are many bad reviews. It is a big decision to buy this item, not to mention the cost and then not have it work. I hope you can take this make to testing so others do not have to experience the same frustration.Petsafe has redesigned this collar and is suppose to have the new one available soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!","review":"This collar is poorly made, the plastic strap is inflexible and won't stay over my dogs throat. If I could give it zero stars I would. The green light blinks like it is working but never delivers a shock. Also, the batteries don't last more than a couple of days, and at around $10.00 a battery it adds up quickly. The manufacturer should be embarrassed of this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I have purchased this collar twice. Both times my Beagle wasn't eveb phased. She would continue to bark even with the collar on and working.She was also able to shake and roll on the grass enough to get it turn around so it would even work.It never worked either time and it was a complete waste of money and it isn't a cheap collar either. I would not try this one again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I have three small dogs, two of which are problem barkers. The problem is that the collar isn't very good at detecting a bark. The packaging states that it isn't supposed to shock them for every bark, which makes plenty of sense, but the problem is that it almost never \\"fires\\" at all.It partly works on our Jack Russel, which has a relatively deep-toned bark. When he wears the collar he does reduce his barking after it shocks him a few times, but mostly he changes how he barks in a way that doesn't set off the collar.On our Chihuahua, which is the worst barker, it apparently can't detect his annoying high-pitched yapping at all. I have never seen it actually shock him. I suppose I'll switch to a remote control system.I was surprised at how poorly this works -- the PetSafe invisible fence products are great (although they're all insanely overpriced and the one company has bought up all the others to completely control the market)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS COLLAR!","review":"This collar did not work very long, at all! I, too, kept buying the expensive batteries & it would only work for a week or two... I just fianlly threw it away! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I am low income, so this feels a lot like a HUGE RIP-OFF! SHAME ON YOU, PET SAFE! Why not just make a decent collar that actually works? If you rip-off enough of us, you'll eventually get a very bad reputation. I guess you'll make plenty of money from idiots like me before that happens though. Thanx for nothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good for my chihuahua","review":"The only thing i dont like about this collar is if you buy it for a chihuahua the collar dosent fit him well. It gose small enough but the rubber collar dosent stay in place.It gose to the side. So the only way to make it stay in place is to put it on to tight or to lose. But if he barks loud enough it will shock even if the collar is to the side alittle. But it is better than the other collars because the are all to big for a chihuahua's. This collar is small and light perfect for my dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well on 7 lb dogs","review":"Got this for our 6 1/2 lb Papillon, who barks at everything. The only way I can keep the prongs right on her throat is by making it really tight. I don't feel comfortable (her neither I'm sure) having it that tight on her throat for any length of time. If it was lighter weight it might work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collar not replaceable","review":"Don't buy this. Yes it works good. But if your dog managed to chew the collar or you break the collar, there isNO replacement collar for this model. Choose one that you can get a replacement collar for, it's a bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don,t waste your money","review":"This unit was used on a 7 pound poodle. Who ever designed this item did a horrible job. The collar is heavy stiff rubber and does not swivel at the connections to the unit. the result is the collar stands out away from the dogs neck and will not stay centered. The unit has three projections that are supposed to touch the dogs neck. The way it is designed one of the end contacts is always held away from neck. We clipped the hair down to the skin and the result was still a failure. My dog has worn this all day for quite a few days and never once has there been a correction. This is a piece of junk! Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This collar was a complete waste of money. It looks to be very well made and effective, but looks can be very deceiving. While this collar may be effective if it stays properly positioned on the dog's neck, I wouldn't know because the collar always rotates so that the device is on the side of the dog's neck, not under the neck where it should be. I could not make the collar fit any tighter without closing off the dog's airway. Don't waste your money on this product because you will have to buy another collar once you see that this one is ineffective. In the garbage it goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return 2 collars, did not work at all","review":"I purchased two of these collars and had to return both. They were working fine but had no effect on the barking. I would assume the self adjusting correction feature sets itself at a very low stimulation level and there is no way to manually turn up the correction. My 2 barkers went off barking like usual, and other than noticing a slight correction from the collar, kept on barking. The collars also have an automatic shut off, so the dogs simply learned to bark till they shut the collars off, then kept on barking. A design flaw also forces the box on the collar to constantly slide onto the side of the neck, so it does not pick up any vibration from barking. No matter how you adjust it, the box slide back to the side within minutes. Biggest waste of money ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"got him to stop barking excessively","review":"our dog would bark at strangers & friends when we would let them into the house to drop off a package or just to hang out, even after we told him it was okay and to be nice. So a friend recommended this collar & it's been the best thing ever. He learned his lesson when we had our couches delivered and wouldn't stop barking at the delivery men. Definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review 1 of 2","review":"I haven't had a chance to review this yet because it arrived with a virtually dead battery. The only positive thing I can say is there was enough charge in the battery to provide a red blinking light enough times to indicate it was dead (rathe than the device was totally defective).Note it's virtually impossible on Amazon to contact the vendor to get a replacement battery. It's return it or nothing. So beware of ordering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shifts easily and stops working","review":"I have a 10 lb. Shih Tzu/Maltese mix who barks through the night. Bought this collar without checking reviews. Big mistake! This collar doesn't fit the contours of a small dogs round neck well. One small shake of his head or scratch from a hind leg and the collar moves to one side or the other of his neck and no longer works. No amount of adjusting, tightening, etc. has corrected the problem. I've also tried shaving his fur and tightening the collar to the point that I'm certain it's actually too tight. It still slides to one side or the other and stops working. Now, when I'm up all night listening to my dog bark, I get to think about all the money I threw out the window on this collar, too. I think this collar has actually been more stressful to me than the barking."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of money!","review":"it doesn't work at all!

Collar worked fine for about a week, then he started barking again, replaced the battery that cost $10.00, I figured we had a defective battery. Same thing, worked for a week and then the barking started again. Not sure what the problem is, but it seems like the battery only lasts a short time, the dog is not barking when the collar is working so he is not what is causing the battery to run down. Will be returning collar to place of purchase (not amazon) and will buy a different brand, such as Innotek. E-mailed Petsafe without any response."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless collar","review":"I bought this collar for my small dog, she's only 6 lbs, the collar is so unflexible because its all plastic the anti bark prongs end up on the back of her neck everytime she shakes her head. I cant make it any tighter or she would for sure stop barking, as well as breathing...so I'm out 70 bucks and I still have a non stop barking dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Idea, bad design!!!","review":"The one piece, hard plastic collar, for small dogs, is the worse possible idea for a bark collar. It easily rotates around the dog's neck, won't stay in place, and does not make proper contact in order for it to work. Even when I tightened the collar to where it nearly choked him, my dog barked all he wanted.Petsafe has other bark collars that work just fine on small dogs, for the same price or less. Just be sure it has a flexible, fabric collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work consistently","review":"I really dislike this collar. I bought it for my very barky little dachshund. I have watched this thing a million times and it never consistently goes off when he barks. But the real problem and reason here is probably b/c it won't stay in place. The plastic buckle on the side is so heavy that it swings down and the shocker ends up o the side of his neck. I removed the metal part of the buckle and rigged it close. NO luck. I weighted it with all kinds of stuff on the front. NO luck. I have tried everything. Worst $ spent. I would highly recommend a different collar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporadic Functionality","review":"The collar worked well the first couple days then virtually stopped working.

Plenty of code samples to get started with SWT - which is why I'm keeping the book.

There are actually a couple male characters that are wound into the story, all who adore her. The sheik prince is a man ladies. Yes, the rape scenes were hard, but back in the day, that was the way.

While I'm sure that for some of LP's audience knowing which nightclubs is the best may be essential information, that's not me. And the air of contempt with which the author talked about the sights I was interested in was a real turn off. The \\"local perspective\\" sections seemed negative and condescending. And, after a while, I got tired of the repeated references to dog poop. BTW I was in Vienna for 10 days and only saw one pile. This book seemed designed to discourage me from visiting.

I was surprised at his honesty in relating some of the stories about his personal life. He's also doesn't pull any punches when talking about his peers and senior leadership at that time.

One would thing the nose of these two great aircraft was the only difference, but findout that is the most \\"similar\\" part of these two look-a-like birds. Also, Ed Rasimus gives the uninformed such as myself a education on when the USAF started using navigators instead of pilots in the rear seat of the Phantom; I never knew why and when this changed happened even though I served in the USAF in a Phantom unit in the mid to late 1960s.

He tells it from a personal point of view and really gets the reader involved in what he was going through at the time. If you are looking for a in depth book about the F-4 Phantom, this is not the book for you.

First of all, the multiple storylines are introduced haphazardly, and are so jumbled and lacking development that it is hard to follow the plot. Dozens of characters are introduced randomly and many are not even necessary to the plot.

Soon, the score turns tense and demonic, much like Jerry Goldsmith's later horror attempt, \\"The Omen\\". \\"What Have You Done To It's Eyes!\\" is a great track, capturing all of Rosemary's horror at what she has discovered about her baby.

Few academics today will tell you that the Bible is infallible, and even fewer will point to statements from the Bible as proof.Also, a lot of statements in the book were made without adequate factual backing. Most of the opinions expressed were supported only by rhetoric, making me even more wary of a book that is already questionable. Refutations of common beliefs in Biblical scholarship, including multiple authorship of the Old Testament, were dismissed with cursory arguments that lacked real depth.Overall, \\"The Origin of the Bible\\" failed to be convincing.

He tells the intriguing tales of how the FBI was able to crack some of the most mysterious, diabolically clever, grisliest crimes it ever sought to crack and how it infiltrated some of the most heineous underground organizations ever launched in our country. The frames of the reels are filled with not one story, but several different cases and stories, and these are woven into the fabric of his pressure-cooker personal and family life.

To his credit, J. Edgar Hoover did introduce modern scientific method to the practice of criminology, but activities of the FBI's field agents have been a fiasco from the word go. Unintentionally, from the producers standpoint, you get some sense of the FBI's relentless bungling in this film, a dramatized \\"history\\" of the agency, in which the Bureau is usually a day late and a dollar short, crossing wires with local law enforcement officers at every turn and making big noises about very small accomplishments.

BUT loved Stewart and Miles, and the jungle scenes were absolutely breathtaking and unexpected! Knowing J Edgar has such a bad rap, it was fair to at least hear his side of the story and that he made certain, what a hero!! ;} Look forward to the Leonardo film."},{"rating":"1","title":"An appeal to the baser sorts","review":"The play, when properly done, is hilarious! The playwright uses allusions to nudity to masterfully create tension and thus provide a necessary situation element for farce. The nudity is not, however, the controlling element. The producers of this film have made the false assumption that the success of the farce is directly proportional to the amount of nudity, resulting in just another \\"T & A\\" movie.Having read the play, this film was a very great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Revision","review":"Another excellent revision on a accounting textbook that continues to set academic and professional standards for the systematic leaning of accounting principles in a clear, concise and relevant manner.Thank you Mr. Skousen and Associates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to a reader from Houston","review":"I am an accounting Professor. I am also an accountant. I am so surprised that you thought people became accountants because they failed from something else. It is totally wrong. I am so pround of it. I am 27 year old. I have a good car, have a good house (no debt at all; I just repaid all my mortgage recently.) I do not think that people who are in the field from which you mentioned they failed can make money and have good reputation like I do. Do you know that an auditor money as much as a lawyer (I am a good auditor; please do not talk about other case)For this book, I found it is very good. I used Prof Skousen's textbook in first accounting class as well as intermediate. My students like them so much. However, they give a little bit too much detail. A professor should adapt it when using in class. This book is a excellent alternative to another book published by Wiley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loss for Words","review":"Unfortunately, this book ranks with the worst books I ever tried to read. How someone in college could understand anything written here is beyond me.I'm not sure if it just because the book is poorly written or what, but I would have to re-read paragraphs over and over again and I still had no idea what they were trying to say.I skipped to various chapters and it was all the same.My education goes beyone college and graduate school and I thought this book could add to my thinking process and make me a \\"smarter\\" person. If I could get only positive thing from a bokk, then it would all be worth it. I got absolutely nothing from this book. What is worse, is that it is the only book I ever read that was just incomprehensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious","review":"If you love noir fantasy, ala Steven Brust, Simon Green, and others, you will love this series. First, it is well written; second, the stories hang together. Looking back, at the end of the book, you can see that the clues were all there to figure out \\"whodunnit.\\" I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last, and as you might guess it has to do with a beautiful woman . . . but don't they all. Just ask his girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a bombshell","review":"OK, there's a decent plot, and it follows the basic rules of science fiction mysteries: create a world and then live within its rules. But the silly language gets in the way and makes it hard to read, and the action really doesn't get off the ground. Good effort, but not too many points."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sci-Fi Neo-Noir Adventure","review":"This story is much better than a holodeck adventure from Star Trek. In this retro future the last private detective on earth bumbles his way across a case he can't solve.This book is like reading an updated version of a pulp novel. If you like the old Doc Savage and adventure stories with a twist; this one is for you. As the first reviewer said, the computer and the detective are just like the famous team of Abbott and Costello.Lots of pop culture references. Fun to read and hopefully there will be a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Great read for Dallas Cowboy fans and football fans in general. The book reveals Landry's character and you realize why he acted the way he did . I have to admit I got a little teary eyed during several portions of the book. Tom Landry was indeed a shining example of a great role model we are lacking in today's world , not just the athletic world either. He was not selfish , nor greedy or craved the spotlight as Jerry Jones does to this day. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Landry - A huge disappointment!","review":"It was with eager anticipation that i awaited receipt of what i thought would be a biography of a football legend. On its arrival i hurriedly opened the first page and started to read.Landry starts with the great mans death and reads like a lengthy obituary column with eulogy after eulogy after eulogy.There is NO balanced perspective, it is the sort of book that only a doting daughter/son or parent could write.For all that, i suppose it is well written, just don't buy it if you are looking for an informative biography!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These authors are stuck in a 1940's time warp","review":"Maybe these rules were the way back in the day of Father Knows Best, but times have changed since then-- there's been this concept known as womens lib! Seriously, I opened the book and scanned down the shortened versions of the rules and just laughed out loud-- even showed the hubby, who decided he 'liked this book!' because everything in it is about giving him his way and bending to him and caving to him. I read the whole book, just because I spent the money-- but I could not relate or agree to hardly any of it. What about marriage being an equal partnership? And what about both of you being responsible for making the relationship work? This book tries to tell you it's okay to be the ultimate doormat. Hated this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Inaccurate Rules","review":"There are many rules to follow in this book. Many of them were ridiculous however, a few were very true. Particularly the rule that says never criticize or say anything negative about his parents. He will always defend them.I only agreed with a select few rules in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 5 stars","review":"Incredible that a publisher would agree to print this junk. Only in America. I'm satisfied with being in good company with the rest of the reviews. No need to beat a dead horse.

They're sitting back counting their money, having a good chuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was by far the worse book I have read on marital harmony","review":"If I followed the advice in this book, I would no longer have an opinion, have a voice, or have a life. According to the authors, \\"...the women must do most of the emotional work in the relationship....these ideas are based on human nature, and like it or not, they work.\\" This book was horrible and I would only recommend it to women who suffer from Stockholm Syndrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIVORCED women trying to make money off of you...","review":"I picked up this book for a friend of mine who is getting married. Luckily I sat down in the store's cafe to look it over before actually buying it. It's a silly and condesending book with rules like \\"Let him win\\" to have a successful marriage.I have been happily married for over 25 years, and while I can't say what would work for you - I can say what worked for me. It started with love, honesty, and compassion - and we just took it from there day to day.If someone like me - successful at marriage - can't say what would work for YOU, how can these DIVORCED women? Every couple is different and they are simply trying to scam you out of your money. Please, take my advice and do not buy this book. Spend your money on dinner with your spouse to TALK about what would make your marriage a success instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPOCRACY--ARE YOU REALLY THAT DESPERATE?","review":"WHY GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THESE WOMEN WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT KEEPING A MAN?THEY KNOW HOW TO GET ONE BY USING CONNIVING TRICKS BUT THIS BOOK WILL NOT SHOW YOU HOW TO KEEP ONE, AT LEAST NOT A GOOD ONE.

The book itself is really short--not even 200 pages, so thankfully there are not a lot of rules that could lead to divorce.

I did the Rules and my life changed and I'm married to the most amazing, caring, handsome man in the world! I was always an attractive sweet girl yet I just didn't get how to date. Many guys were interested however they would lose interest quickly and I never really understood why. Anyways, the Rules for Marriage are very disappointing. There is nothing in this book that isn't common sense.In my honest opinion, as a total Rules girl, I would tell other readers not to waste money.

That's about how long one of the authors, Ellen Fein, stayed married to her husband. Now ehe's divorcing him and yet she's co-author of this book. Hmmm...makes one wonder just how \\"time-tested\\" these secrets are...and by whom....and how well they work on certain marriages. Call me a cynic if you want but I do think a book lacks credibility if one of the authors is no longer in a long-term (and lasting) marriage herself. And yes, I read the books. And yes, I hated it - even BEFORE I heard of the divorce. Let's just say I'm not surprised. The rules? Hogwash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't let anyone RULE you.......","review":"Yeah, maybe you could also make a t-shirt that says WELCOME and then lie down in front of your door.

Yeah, take your thoughts and dreams and desires and bottle them up to make someone else happy. Well if he truly loves you, he wouldn't want you to that and if does want you to live to please him, then you deserve much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on...","review":"From one point of view, guys should be foisting this on every woman in sight. Except that the women in our worlds would then be so much less interesting and fun to be with. Along with being irritating this book left me feeling insulted. If men are so easily manipulable then how could you ever respect a guy who falls for the Rules in the first place? Try these instead:Rule #1: You don't need a man to make you happy.Rule #2: If you've got this far, you haven't finished learning Rule #1. Go back and start again.There must be better ways to build respect for yourself and the guys around you. A waste of time and money. And no mention that the authors have both divorced since writing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a self-esteem booster like The Rules I and II","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. I thought the Rules I and II (for dating) were pro-women and really gave women a confidence boost. This book should've been entitled How to Be a Doormat. Several parts of this book gave advice that really could be damaging to a woman's self esteem: always let him win an argument, go on vacation anywhere he wants to go, have sex even if you don't want to, don't bother him with your problems (call your girlfriends instead) just to cite a few examples. The addition to the book that says the one author is going through a divorce was appreciated. But the part about \\"now she follows the Rules more than ever\\" doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"This cd player skips so easily it's incredible.

The back side of the placemat has the problems without the answers, so we give him a dry-erase marker and have him fill it in. It's working and he is able to get more problems correct each time. It's also fun for him to try and complete all the problems before dinner makes it to the table.I took off one star for durability. If bent, these mats will crease.

Like the other WW books, its an engaging read. My quabbles with the book is its time frame; how much time passes in this book is beyond me. A few months? 4 years? I also do not like how Elisabeta had such an ignoble end. Still, this is the novel to read for inspiration on the Gold Rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable/a nice read","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

But a moment's concentration reveals that they passed beyond that limited genre thanks to their personal commitment to the songs and their technical prowess. These were no ordinary singers; all four were absolute masters of their domain. They were witty when wit is called for, perfectly produced at any tempo, and passionate at all times. As gospel was taking over commercial church music, they easily straddled both that genre and the older spirituals they were weaned on. Their oeuvre amply rewards repeated listening; I can't imagine myself growing tired of it (thank goodness they recorded a lot of it!). This is indeed the greatest of all American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romatic at Heart","review":"We have here another Canadian movie.

We were reading this at a depression glass show and caused most of the passing dealers to stop to ask how to buy one. The photography is beautiful and will be a big help in identifying odd pieces not chronicled in the usual DG and Elegant books. However, the editing is a bit haphazard and following the narrative time lines can be difficult.

(Phil Stewart was allowed to sing lead on two songs on this album.) Regardless of all that, this is a fun album that features the early-'60s California sound. Bruce & Terry didn't write too many original songs for the album, relying mostly on covers of Fantastic Baggys and Jan & Dean songs. (The hit single \\"Three Window Coupe\\" was, in fact, originally a Jan & Dean song.) The CD adds three bonus tracks, including the Rip Chords last chart single, \\"One Piece Topless Bathing Suit\\".

It is somewhat entertaining but has gaps in the story line and problems with believing it. Special effects aren't bad. Most of the story is borrowed from other movies such as the Mummy as well as a small protion from Tombstone, and the Matrix. The actors did a great job considering the budget and the fact that it is far from scary or even cursed. It is difficult to believe that this is a Hallmark production; perhaps it was over edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"It got here pretty quick.I ordered a movie and got a movie.They did a good job I guess.I ordered a movie and got a movie,what more can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"A feel-good movie that has never gotten stale or dated. Remake it without John Denver's haircut and the '70s vehicles, and the exact same script would seem just as fresh today. You may not belly-laugh, but you'll smile throughout and consider it a well-spent hour and a half. Religious beliefs not required to appreciate this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Film!","review":"I gave this film this rating because it is so timeless. The lines are so perfect, and Burns delivers them impeccably. I think that anyone who enjoys George Burns' films will definitely like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Burns is God","review":"George Burns as God was a great casting move. It was great to finally find it on DVD. I remember when I saw it in the movie theater, no one said a word as we all left. John Denver was great in his roll of trying to get the world to listen to him about Gods message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination","review":"Maybe it is because I am a big John Denver fan, but I can watch this movie over and over again and still love it. It is very entertaining, funny, and the story is great. The ending is great. In some way it resembles \\"My Cousin Vinny\\", but with a better story line and even a better ending that is very emotional. But then again, remember, I am a John Denver fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film","review":"this film was a trip when it first came out.very cleaver film.George Burns turned it out.his style&laidbackness helped make an Ordinary film something of a must see.but the formula only worked once."},{"rating":"2","title":"great religious movie","review":"and thats what it is a religious movie up there with the ten commandments, the robe, ect. stands the tests of time after all these years. definately sends the message to me, and lets me know that there is HOPE for all of us. hits home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh God","review":"I thought it was the lighter side of God and it made me laugh.

The animation is done by the Hanna-Barbera studios of my childhood. The video contains 5 or so stories about Dink and his friends' adventures as little dinosaurs. The stories teach simple lessons about helping others and the dangers of practical jokes. Although, I basically think this video is fine, I would have preferred something less intense. That's not to say my son would prefer that though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes apart when you change settings","review":"Try changing settings on this one and you will have the shower-head on your head. Had to run behind springs in the midst of a shower to stop them from going down the drain.As long as it does not come apart, it works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy !","review":"The water pressure is so low, it is pratically useless. It does not perform as advertised. I threw the Pollenex shower head in the trash. By chance, I found a simpler show head (3 settings) from Walmart for $5.99 and it works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got your number...","review":"I bought this a while back, and just found it buried in my iTunes. The guy at the record store said it is Radiohead without the paranoia. I thought that was funny.It's good stuff. Mellow, interesting tunes. It grew on me the more I listened to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite for 2003","review":"Cast Of Thousands is my favorite album of 2003. Number 2 would be Think Tank followed by Hail To The Thief. This second album shows the potential Elbow has. Switching Off and Not A Job, in my opinion, are the best songs on this album. Both are beautiful. Unlike the first album, this one is a little bit more mellow than Asleep In The Back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great band, bad album","review":"I'm not sure how anyone who has listened to this band's debut, \\"Asleep at the Back,\\" could give \\"Cast of Thousands\\" five stars. Elbow have taken a decidely different direction with their second album, and that's all well and good. The music, however, is not.There is nothing on this record that even comes close to the musical, lyrical and ethereal qualities of songs like \\"Newborn\\" that made the first album so engaging.There are a few songs on Cast of Thousands (Ribcage, Not a Job) that merit repeated listens. The rest is simply boring.\\"Fugitive Motel\\" might have great production, but what good is that if the song doesn't go anywhere?Experimenting is one thing. But making something out of that experiment is something entirely different. I think Elbow have really missed the mark this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for habitrail tubular cages","review":"Not for tubular habitrail cages. I tried using it with my hamsters but it doesn't have a good size to fit the cage well and the pet use it to sleep, a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too hot to handle!","review":"I received these for Christmas and loved the look. However, when I went to use them to grab a pan from the oven (nothing crazy hot - 350 degrees) the mitts got *HOT* within about 2 seconds (no exaggeration here). I asked several other people in the household to test them out, just to make sure I wasn't being hyper-sensitive, and they each reported the same thing. Those tougher folks out there with already-callused hands may find these useable (they do look nice afterall) but I'm trying to figure out what to do with these to salvage the gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for quick use","review":"It's a good thing this ships with 2 mitts. I end having to go back forth between the two because they get hot way too fast. As long as you're using them to go quickly from the oven to a counter top nearby, they're almost OK. Otherwise, it would be better to use something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless product","review":"This is the worst product we ever purchased at Amazon.The main reason for these oven mitts are use to carry our stoneware baker from 350F oven.You can feel the heat transferring from the baker to your hands right the way, and within 5 seconds we can't no longer withstand the heat.Once again, this is one of THE worst product we ever purchased at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique mitts","review":"great deal because u get two. they're different to get used to since they're not cloth but they're waterproof for spills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully poetic self esteem booster!","review":"Terrific book with a wonderful message.

All of them are linked with a way of traveling. I think its a good scenario pack, although some of the adventures are hard to play. No, i dont mean they're difficult, i mean it is hard to think of some good reason for Investigators to travel to India, Syberia or Irak. In my opinion the best adventure in this pack is \\"Fear of Flying\\". It was the first scenario we ever played in Call of Cthulhu and from that time we play CoC regulary. All in all Fearful Passages is an amusing adventure pack and a good way to spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worthless - to me, anyway","review":"I have had this book for years, and have yet to use it a single time. It has about 10 or so \\"mini-scenarios\\" or interludes, a few of which are a bit longer. They are intended for insertion into an ongoing campaign. My main problem with the book is that many of them are set in way out-of-the-way places, like Siberia and India, and the 3 or 4 that aren't are short and not very good. This is definitely the worst Call of Cthulhu supplement I own. Although I should add that most of the ones I own are absolutely excellent, so perhaps my expectations for a CoC book are a bit higher than for most RPGs."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCCK","review":"If the British think this is comedy, I would hate to see their drama. Looks to me to be a treatise on city life in Liverpool. Buildings are boarded up. Everything is in ruin. Trash and abandoned vehicles everywhere. Young punks roaming the streets mugging people. Even the people scurry around like rats. What a bunch of derelicts. The movie is depressing. I bought the movie to watch Joanne Whalley. I can't believe she would lend her talents to such a film. This certainly is not their finest hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gambling times guide to harness racing","review":"A terrible and very disappointing book,not even sutible for a beginner.

I bought them because the adjustable ear hook looked like it would be great for jogging. It was, briefly. After almost a month of use, the ear hook broke. I handled them carefully - never sat on, stepped on, jammed into my pocket, etc. I started to place it in my ear one morning and the hook just fell off and landed in my lap. The plastic that holds the pivot screw in place just broke in half.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointed","review":"The earhooks, although flexible, will not stay on my ears.

When that happened, I took a close look at them and found that the palstic on both ear phones was split in several places. I too was extremely careful with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much useless","review":"These are probably the most useless and uncomfortable pieces of dirt I've ever bought. And I paid the full 30 bucks for them at a NIke Store. They don't fit, there is no tension control, so they just flop around and I'm not sure who's ears they designed them to fit in, but they don't fit in mine or any one of my three friends that I had try them on. I sold them on ebay for 10 bucks to recoupe part of my cost. Lesson learned, NEVER buy headphones w/o trying them on first. The iPod ear buds, while pretty much useless also, are 100 percent better than these. DO NOT BUY these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel to other worlds with Magma","review":"Well, I heard that Magma had some pretty good music that was different. I was sure in for a surprize! Was it ever different. This album is only for those with an open mind for music, but if you accually found this album you probably know you're in for a good ride. This album sounds like one long song, with lots of words that are not words at all, just random singing.Lots of chiming sounds and steady saxophone madness along with almost constant singing and lots of other instruments I cannot identify, I have to tell you, the only way to experience this album is to listen to it yourself!

It was so riveting, eerie, haunting, yet it made no sense to me, maybe some will call it silly and unrealistic and review it poorly. I cant answer that. I couldn't relate or understand the male or female motives but nonetheless even though I kept asking why, why are they doing this, I couldn't stop watching. I have no idea but I give it four stars for confusing a movie vet and making me wonder if this was some HBO 12 episode run if it could have been fleshed out into something astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"This movie is simply a waste of time.

The students thought it was horrible and these are kids that would rather watch a movie than do ANYTHING.

What a bummer of a movie! Didn't care for this one at all. This had nothing to do with the actors & actresses, who performed their roles just fine. It had everything to do with the subject matter of the film. Everyone in the film is distressed and depressed, which is exactly how you will feel after watching it. Don't like feeling happy? Need something to bring your spirits down? This movie will do the trick for you. To everyone else: avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIDDEN IN THE LIBRARY","review":"I found it by chance at the back of a dusty shelf in my village library. Hadnt been read for a long time.It was surprisingly well written: a clear, uncomplicated and crisp style. It told the story in an economical way which but a little wooden. One reviewer compared it unfavourably to a John Grisham, but it was BETTER than that! This had a lot of interesting twists and turns which were too far fetched, but hey...it's only a story.I did enjoy the cod philosophy and it set me thinking about the issues.The characters were well rounded and beleivable.The ending came too suddenly and because of this it lost its effect.Overall...I would recomend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and realistic","review":"If you read this book you will find that the author leaves out boring areas between events. You will find a fast paced book that will keep you entertained. Realistic portrayol of society today... where everyone is more concerned with winning and money then doing what is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, ridiculously predictable \\"conclusion.\\"","review":"I ordered this book on the advice of the mystery book reviewer for Amazon.com. Not only does this tome sprawl needlessly over an extended timeframe, but the outcome is telegraphed well before the midpoint of the novel is reached. It was a major effort to summon the requisite strength to finish it! I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can a book get a minus number of stars?","review":"The thought that this might not be the worst book I will ever read terrifies me. The mangled threads of a story dribble out from page after page of endless pontification, only to end - or should I say fail to end? - too obviously for any shred of satisfaction to be drawn from the drivel.I can't tell you how many times I just wanted to scream at the author to get on with it; good, bad or indifferent, tell the story! As it turns out, it was bad, very bad. I know, I know - you're thinking I should just get it off my chest and say what I really think of the book.I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected.....","review":"This is Buffa's first work and his first book that I have read. (In fairness I will read \\"Prosecution\\" to see if I am judging him too hastily.) Instead of being about one case, it is about a series of seemingly unconnected felony trials handled by defense attorney Joe Antonelli. I have been a trial attorney practicing law in a metro area for over 25 years now and I find Antonelli to be, well, just not believeable. He certainly is unlike any attorney I have ever encountered. Too slick, too rich, too successful. The story line of the book was weak and easy to figure out. Don't waste your time on this guy. Stick with Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Well written. Buffa appealed to my 'problem solving' side. I think we should be so lucky like the reader from Mt.

Even if you use other media other than oil, much of his guidance and tips with color and brush stroke apply universaly. He is a fountain of information and anyone who remembers this kind and gentle individual; who uses a mixture of teaching and storytelling to infuse confidence to pickup a brush into his audience/pupils should spend the time and money on his dvd. I have only positive praise for this dvd and Bob Ross himself who; like many, had left this world too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy for Bob!","review":"Having only seen Bob Ross's 30 minute TV shows, I found this instructional video even more effective, as he demonstrates the various techniques, side by side, in a more detailed fashion without time constraints.

I have not yet viewed \\"Firecreek\\". I did watch CSC the other night and I was a little disappointed with the video quality. The quality was only fair, and not near the quality of most DVDs that I buy. I believe one reason for this is despite what the description says, this is not a 2-disc set, these movies are on a single, 2-sided disc. I always avoid these because of all the problems with 2-sided discs. This is not the first time that Amazon has inaccurately described a listing, and they need to do better. Buyers beware... if you're expecting 2 discs with this set, you'll be disappointed. This review is for the quality of the video and Amazon's misleading description.

They seem to never capture the woman; the authors tend to rehash old news clippings, or scandal sheet gossip.In doing this, the authors never do this woman justice. Not only is Elizabeth an icon of our time, but she has become one of countries greatest AIDS activists.This in itself took tremendous courage! There is more to this woman than celluloid, and ex-husbands. Face it, she's one great dame!

The author, though perhaps not intending to--make Maggie and Elizabeth almost interchangable. As a woman starved for love,she mistakes lust,pity,histrionic behavior,and melodramatic outcomes for the real..hum-drum..thing and in doing so sacrifices a great talent In a dizzying round of affairs, marriages, drugs, drink, food,and mores the pity-bad movies, the glamour that was Elizabeth Taylor quickly turns to squalor. The biggest surprise for me then, was that I finished this book actually liking this woman..alot. The author gets a bit too hung up on the gender preferences of Taylor's many men but on the whole, its a rounded, solid and human portrayal of a World Class Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Destroy The Validity of One's Writing","review":"[seemingly w]ritten for obvious exploitive reasons, the author has done a greatdeal of research and twisted facts to fit the author's purposes.

Seems sad and pathetic at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid entry","review":"This was the book recommended by my instructor. I had an older book that focused more on the basic five finger approach withour much moving around. This one makes you stretch out a little more, so to speak, but the pace is pretty good, though the difficulty level fluctuates sometimes from very difficult to way too easy. The final pieces at the end were quite difficult, very different than the prices before, and requires a lot of practice to become proficient at them. The song selection is good, with a good mix of classical and more folkish songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"For older beginners (not elementary age)","review":"This course starts off with simpler pieces and exercises, and gradually gets more advanced. You will learn to play chords with the left hand in the C, F, and G position. You will learn the simpler time signatures. Our high school teacher uses this book to teach his beginning piano class.

First off, Warren is not a competent enough actress to pull off any lead role. So, when a producer and/or director cast an 'actress' like that, you can usually expect a run of the mill script, chainsaw editing, highly unbelievable situations, and/or poorly developed characters. This movie manages all of that.Just another trite, overdone, weak attempt at romantic comedy.

I recorded much of them on VHS which unfortunatly did not survive over the years. I was happy to see this DVD of my old favorites, which are less good in retrospect then the Fleicher ones but are still fun to watch. My question is why only 8 of them have been released?

It is the struggle between good & evil men & each of their own conscience's on what's right & wrong. Stewart struggles with the task of bringing in a killer for the money to make his life right again after being wronged emotionally & financially. Robert Ryan makes a conniving evil presence. My favorite line is when the prospecter partner of Stewart's tells Ryan, \\"I was thinkin.\\" & Ryan replies \\"Jesse that always was your weak spot.\\" The struggle to bring Ryan in for the bounty & how to divide it while Ryan divides the partners plays out against some of the most beautiful Western scenery you will every see. To use the cliche a must have Western."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of Petrarca's Work","review":"The complete edition of something called the 'Il Canzoniere' is very rare. Even though it is the most successful book of love poetry ever to be made, it is mostly available in the shortened form, where usually about 50 poems are included. If you are looking for the complete edition of over 300 poems, this is the book to go for. It has a comprehensive introduction, with biographical data and literary criticism of Petrarch's work. Most poems are provided with more translations, giving you the sense of what can hide behind the 14th century verses. All in all, this is definitely a good choice for people with affinity towards Petrarch's work. The only bad side of this book is that poems are presented without pauses (empty rows) between quatrains and terzets, giving a rather confusing visual look and loosing some of the sense if not understood correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sonnets","review":"This text is not the sonnets.

Typical of this kind of item, it was shipped in the box that the Chinese manufacturer originally packed it in. UPS wasn't kind and the unit was shredded upon delivery to my home. The corners of the shelves were bent and dented. Given I didn't want the hassle of returning the item (and it's a welding cart afterall), I straightened the metal and put the cart together. The quality of the painted finish is poor (flaking off in certain areas) and it was clear the underlying sheet metal was rusted in certain areas prior to application of the finish. If I were to do this again, I would just spend the additional $30 and get the Lincoln cart versus the \\"no-name\\" Chinese manufactured cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much on sheet metal from China","review":"As other reviews have already stated, there was damage on the carton when it arrived and had missing hardware.

Great band","review":"I bought this one first and then bought their first two releases together. I think we often like what we find first best. But over time the band and its entire catalogue grew on me. I came to like all of their music for what it was when written. For instance, I just got their new release for X-mas past and it hasn't warmed to me yet, but I know it will.I had the good pleasure of seeing them at All Points West last year.Buy this CD today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the roots of good indie rock","review":"Listening to good pop rock is not as it used to be years ago. I was still sticking to the oldies as my interest has faded in newly released rock music (in general) until I heard KoL's Because of the Times album. The songs that are uniquely played are \\"Knocked Up\\", \\"Ragoo\\" and \\"The Runner\\". & the best are the awesome \\"On Call\\" and \\"Fans\\" 2 really great rock/indie-rock songs.I have to skip some of the other songs on the LP; otherwise it would have definitely been a 5-stars' album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary - As Good As It Gets","review":"I think I came across Kings of Leon when browsing the top \\"Southern Rock\\" albums on Amazon list. They were #5 with \\"Because of the Times\\". I decided to give it a shot even though I knew next to nothing about them.Knowing that I'm not a rabid fan, nor a chronic hater, and have hundreds of albums from almost all genres of music I can say with all honesty this album is amazing. People have described the album pretty well so I won't repeat what's already been said - but if you don't own this album and really enjoy a great rock album, pick this up. Their music is very creative, with excellent vocals, songwriting, and arrangements. Take my word for it, pick this album up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, just wow","review":"This is a completely unapolegetically terrible album.How people are even comparing this to KoL's previous albums is beyond me. I had to play this for friends just to show them how terrible it is. Everything from the uninspired music, lyrics, to the painfully annoying recurring scream in \\"Charmer\\" serve to make this one of the single most dissapointing, badly executed excuses for music I have ever heard.What were they thinking? It's sad to see the band is depending on their established following to blindly love any album they produce. I hope they can recover from this and I shudder at the thought of the music collection and taste of anyone who gave this album more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened","review":"The first album being amazing rock and roll, the second being a little less rock and roll and more indie, but still amazing writing. This one though is crap. The band lost its rock and roll root entirely, and now are trying to be an alternative indie band. Though there are a few decent tracks on here, most of it is a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile Rubbish","review":"\\"Because of the Times\\" is not the worst album I've ever heard - but it's close. It has decent drumming and occasionally interesting guitar phrases, but they're small punctuations between puerile, sometimes painfully banal lyrics that lack metre and use the most cringe-worthy rhymes. The 'singing' is harsh and tries to overcome lack of any real emotion with shrieks and howls. The occasional background vocals are off key and tuneless.Kings of Leon, on the strength of this album, need years and years more practice. If this album has any message, it's 'save your money - give this a wide berth'."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Aha Shake Heartbreak you will hate this.","review":"This was a total let down. Their last album was one of my favorites and I was physced for this to come out. Gone is the original sounding Dixie fried garage rock sound that put them on the map. They totally changed. Sounds like they put a lot of money into it. They also said they were drunk the whole time recording this one unlike their past albums. Sounds like it's not working for them.Their album after this one \\"Only By The Night\\", from what I've heard of it so far, seems like their making this new sound work for them. But do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experiments are for Labs","review":"Plainly stated: if you liked Youth and Young Manhood, you won't like this one. The first time I heard the aforementioned album, I fell in love, and I thought it one of the best records ever. The critics say this is KOL's best record yet, but in my humble opinion, compared to Y & YM, it blows. When I first heard them, I instantly thought: second coming of Bon Scott's AC/DC, but that idea is dead. Every AC/DC record, especially with Scott, rocked hard. 'Because of the Times' was some sort of test-tube contrivance which left me ill and irritated. I understand not wanting to be pigeonholed, and the desire to try new things, but just like Jim Carrey doing drama, I just don't like it. I say if you're the best at something, as KOL was at the type of rock on Y & YM, stick to it, damn it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Because of the Times","review":"Sorry, I didn't like the music. I thought I'd previewed all the song, but I guess I was wrong. I love their 4th album but didn't like any song on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because of Something.....this one stinks","review":"Let me start off by saying I love the Kings of Leon. In fact they are my favorite band. Their first two albums rocked. Both are 5 stars in my book. In addition, in concert these guys take it to another level. For those reasons this reveiw hurts. Because of the Times is a giant disappointment. I am not sure what album some of the reveiwers listened to but this album is nowhere near 5 stars. Apparently Ethan Johns or one of the boys discovered the reverb machine recently because overproduced echoes litter each song. The first 4 songs are almost unlistenable--for some reason the Kings added high pitched guitars or screeches to some otherwise decent tunes. I keep hoping the Kings will break into the big time but this album wont do it. If youre going to emulate U2 atleast make it early U2 and not songs like \\"Lemon\\". Kings please lose the pretension and come back to Rock for your next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this was a meal on a chinese menu...Pu-Pu platter","review":"JUNK, I love the first 2 and turned so many people onto them.

Boring, annoying, no catch, simply JUNK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, Horrible sonics","review":"I really enjoyed the music on this Lp..but, the whole reason for purchasing an Lp was for better sonics... which, on this \\"red\\" colored album, are horrible...the background noise drowns out any low level music...A \\"re-issue\\" should be done for customers who have recieved the bad vinyl...Rick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, incredibly compressed recording","review":"The LP version and most likely the CD version of the same album suffers from a fatal flaw, horrible compression, that makes you wonder why you even bothered to get a nice turntable and expensive cartridge. Someone needs to do something about this soon, as if will really give a terrible name to all other records that the band might produce."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?","review":"After falling in love with their first two albums and praising them among all my friends and family and taking the time to learn their songs by ear on my guitar, I couldn't have been more excited to listen to buy their third album. However, once I did, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The great bands find a way to naturally evolve their sound and conquer new ground without losing their identity or their \\"soul,\\" so to speak. But where Kings of Leon went to and why is a mystery. Their grit, simplicity, and soul is gone. No more driving beats or bluesy riffs or plain old rock 'n roll passion. The music seems more processed and belaboured and washed out. There's nothing to tap my feet to, and certainly no great riffs that'll make me learn these tracks on my guitar. If this is the way Kings of Leon is headed, I certainly won't be following them. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing comeback","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I haven't been able to get into this. I loved their first album, thought their second one was okay, but this one may be worse than the last one. I can't really give too thorough of a review since I didn't get past the fourth song on the first listen, and haven't listened to it since, even seriously considered trading it in.I got this CD after reading a stellar review by Q Magazine appauding it. Needless to say, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"blows","review":"direction is all lost, hype went to their heads along with all the riches and fame... what else is new with bands that this happens to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounds from a great band","review":"I loved their first two albums more but this album, the guys from Kings of Leon show they are growing up. Great tracks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of Music","review":"Each KOL album thus far has had its own unique feel, and Because of the Times is no exception. I admit to skipping over a couple of tracks, but the number of songs I listen to on repeat is significantly higher.

If you like emotionally charged lyrics and mind-blowing drum riffs, this is your cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"???Regression...sounds like they're going backward","review":"I felt a progression of solid music up until this album. I don't get it. Yes darker but boring. This sounds like it could have been any band in any bar on any given night. I don't hear maturity or complexity. I hear stripped down uninteresting background guitars over a unique voice. Feels more like filler, forced not inviting or heartfelt. I listened to the preview before I purchased. I think the short clips sounded great. But that's as good as ever gets. Some clips sounded like the were leading up to something. But they do not, that's it. Hey, I am disappointed. This album actually killed me wanting to go see them. Hey different strokes right.To me music is emotion. I felt nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of Leon-Because of the Times","review":"Great album. Songs 1,5, and 6 are killer. If you are a kings of leon fan I would highly recommend picking up this album. This album I bought used and it had no flaws in it what so ever. Highly Recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album.","review":"I got this without listening to it first, but I really liked it.

It was written by the Union General, Lew Wallace, in 1880 and has never been out of print since that time. Unlike the Heston movie, the book dwells less on the flashy parts of the story--sea battle and chariot race--and more on Christ and his effects on those around him. Wallace must have been a deeply religious man, and it shows through his story. The book also gives a better portrayal of Ben-Hur as a young man, who first seeks understanding, when older revenge, and finally as a mature man, he achieves redemption and peace. A great read--read the kindle edition--in every way and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous!","review":"As soon as I saw the movie, I had to read the book! It isn't a whole lot like the movie, but it is still really good. If you get bored reading hard-to-read books, read the children's version! If you like adventure, you'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story, but a little slow","review":"This book is written in a scholarly way that sort of meanders through the plot. It most likely will not hold the interest of someone who demands fast-paced, modern-style reading material. But for anyone who enjoys a more classical style, this book will probably be one of their favorites. It has action, intrigue, romance and a powerful message about Jesus Christ. I don't like the way Wallcae pictures Christ--he seems to picture Him as woman-like and almost weak. But other than that, I have no complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic novel about a man who finds Christ","review":"Gen Lew Wallace originally set about to dispel the myth of Christian belief in the Savior but, in the process, became converted himself to the sacredness of His role. A monumental epic story of Judah Ben-Hur who, falsely accused of having caused the death of the governor of Jersusalem, is sentenced to several years as a slave on Roman galley slaves by his former boyhood friend, Messala, which friend has vowed an unbreakable loyalty to his emperor. Now a classic, it endures well today and provides hope and inspiration for those seeking freedom and peace of soul"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for the story!","review":"Although subtitled \\"A Tale of the Christ,\\" fewer than 100 of the 558 pages actually portray Jesus. Instead, this is a far-ranging story of Ben-Hur, whose life seems to combine terrible bad fortune--galley slave by way of a broken roof tile, leprosy for loved ones--and incredible (in its former meaning of \\"unbelievable\\") good fortune--inheriting loyal servants (and one beautiful one!), impressing a powerful Roman with his own beauty, seeing Jesus heal many people. It's an entertaining story, only feel free to allow yourself to skim the extensive descriptions if you wish. It's not illegal! After all, in what other book will you read words like \\"superexcellent\\" and \\"ikh\\"? Be patient, acknowledge that when Wallace wrote the book, life moved at a slower pace and people weren't in a rush to finish everything. Allow the story to weave its web and you'll be caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film was good, the book is great.","review":"Everyone has seen the film, but the book is even better. There are few books that bring history alive quite like this. The only other that I happen to have recently read is the wonderful \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\" in which the spaces left out in Wallace's book are powerfully filled in. Perhaps these two books should be sold as a companion set since both characters easily mesh in the most convincing manner and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was good, but as always the book outshines it!","review":"The movie Ben-Hur left out so much from the book, it was a wonderful read to re-discover the \\"Real Ben-Hur\\". Its a fantastic read! Lots of things going on. Lewis Wallace definately has/had a definate flair for writing! Very well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever written","review":"\\"Ben_Hur, a Tale of THE CHRIST\\" is in my opinion one of the best books ever written (and so much better than the movie). It deals with the most important question presented to humanity: \\"Who was Jesus Christ?\\" Lew Wallace spent much of his early life ambivalent to that question, and thus understands that getting the answer right isn't necessarily an easy process. Read the book and it will help you answer the question for yourself.Then read Robinson Crusoe, an equally beautiful rendition of a difficult faith walk.In both you will end with this fact, both Wallace and Defoe believed that \\"The Lord Jesus Christ is who He says He is in the Bible....He is the God who saves\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies Cut to the Chase","review":"What in the world possessed me to try to read this novel after I saw the movie? A big mistake. This is a well-plotted book, peopled with characters in conflict. But the Victorian writing, the long, meandering sentences, the for-no-purpose descriptions -- they made it impossible for me to do more than skim the book. I was in my teens at the time, so maybe I would be more patient as an adult reader . . . but with this book, I don't think so. See the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but way to wordy with extension descriptions","review":"See the movie. The book is very difficult reading, wordy with references not explained of religious history, ancient place names, and Roman and Jewish customs of the time. In all the rambling a beautiful story is told of Ben Hur, a Jewish prince, whose family is destroyed by the Romans and whose redemption is had at the hands of Christ. The movie cuts to the chase and therefore is much better. And rarely do I find a movie better than the book it was based on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is a very basic book and does not go into any detail. Might be okay for a 7 or 8 year old that knows nothing about golf. There is a very short chapter that touches on the rules of golf and also one on etiquette but these barely scratch the surface. The book is not for a child that has already started playing golf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known what I was getting into, but...","review":"I abhor the death penalty, but I don't want to read about it as a plot device in a romance. I admit I was too influenced by the positive reviews, and didn't pay enough attention to the plot outline, but for me this book was both unpleasant and disappointing. Too dark and threatening to be enjoyable. Still, this may be a good writing team with a theme that I just didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Grow Non-native WEEDS","review":"The title of the book is so great! Who wouldn't want to grow Wildly Successful Plants? However most of the plants listed in the book are non-native and the author does caution against planting the ones that are invasive. Sometimes a plant that is so successful that it grows everywhere and takes over is really a weed. This is a fine book as long as one takes precautions against letting the invasive plants take over."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T JUDGE THE BOOK BY THE TITLE","review":"THIS BOOK HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR PROMOTING THE PLANTING OF INVASIVE PLANTS.

When I attempted to make a 10 cup batch, the coffee and grounds overflowed and ran onto the counter. The one asset for this machine-it does make coffee in approximately three minutes. I believe that the reason for the tasteless coffee is in the design. The water flows over the grounds so fast there isn't time to extract all the coffee flavor from the grounds. I would not recommend this unit to anyone who enjoys the full flavor of coffee. This is unfortunate as I had used commercial versions with good results.

Approximately 2 years ago I purchased another Bunn brewer which only worked 20 months before it began leaking. I have been using the third brewer for 2 months and now it is leaking.

Then numerous times when I would wipe down the sprinkler head area to clean off any coffee grounds, the sprinkler head came off very easily. On my old Bunn coffee maker I never had this happen. This one came off repeatedly and then finally it must have fallen off without me realizing it and apparently when I emptied the coffee filter and grounds at some point I threw the sprinkler head away.

I have seen these coffee makers used in restaurants all over the country. I got the thing home and it definitely has some cool features, one of which is that it always keeps a pot of water at temperature so as soon as you close the lid, it begins brewing - FAST! The downside is that the unit would overflow while brewing if you used more than 6 scoops of grounds. This makes for kind of a weak brew, which I don't like. Every time I've tried to experiment with adding more grounds, it overflows and I spend the next 10 minutes having to clean up the mess.

I have no problems or complaints with my Bunn."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of disappointed now...","review":"I bought the BUNN GRB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black at walmart two weeks ago for the same price here of $99.00. At first i was happy with it from all the raving reviews here at Amazon I couldnt go wrong... But after two weeks i kind of wish i had gotten something else...The coffee tastes great could be a little warmer though..i just checked the water temp of a pot and it was at 178 degrees and it advertises 200. Also there is a burning smell like of wire coming from the water lid area that kind of makes me nervous about leaving it on all the time. I researched the smell and came across this site of complaints [...] I wish i was aware of all this before.. It looks like Bunn has dropped the ball on their manufacturing of home coffee makers..

In fact, they probably use a Bunn.The design is utilitarian-not decoration, and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd known the details","review":"When I purchased this coffeemaker, I didn't understand that the Bunn kept a hot reservoir of water all the time and had to left plugged in continuously.

I really loved that one and in contrast, this one presented by Soundstage is a good production but didn't catch my heart the way Josh In Concert did. It took some looking to find it, cost more for less time and less quality but overall, Soundstage didn't have the energy and personal touch that Josh In Concert brought to vivid life, didn't have the emotional impact. This is in direct contrast to one of the reviews I read about the Soundstage concert where the reviewer said it offered a more intimate and emotionally touching experience. I like Groban so much that I find it difficult to give it less than four stars but I am being generous and will anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I'm from NYC, so of course I love Luscious. This is their best album. The songs have this nervous energy, with great tunes -- and imaginative production -- and lyrics which show the bandmembers are involved with their subjects. I like \\"Fall of my angel\\" the best but there are many other great ones. The album is divided into two to mimic an LP.Luscious is really caught up in early 90s feminism (not that feminism is dead, but there's an angry early 90s tone to their feminism) and some of it gets ugly. For example, the song \\"It takes a strong man (to stand next to a strong woman)\\" is just dishonest (it should be: \\"It takes a strong man (to date a total bitch)\\"). But that doesn't take away from the songs -- and the performance -- which are just great.Go out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have in any kitchen!","review":"This is the best quality chopping block for the price.

I am not convinced, so I am returning this. I have decided to try a teak cutting board which is a completely renewable resource as well and which naturally repels water. Teak is used in boat making. Check out a review for the proteak 20x 14 board with the bowl cut out.

I have taken it on one trip flying coach. This bag doesn't fit under the seat in front of me very well.

Rock, funk, soul, instrumental, show tunes, western, you get the point. But the best thing is that they're all good, if not great. I guess that's the genius of \\"Ween\\".

There is nothing better than Morcheeba & Pot, except for this album and any narcotic of choice.

This ain't no novelty.","review":"Well here's the deal. This album really covers the spectrum from goofy-silly cacophonous warped stabs like \\"Candi\\" to the smooth soul of \\"Freedom of '76\\". The opening track \\"Take Me Away\\" sounds like ZZ Top and Sinatra had a crack baby...and that's a good thing! Disturbing yet catchy jams like \\"Spinal Meningitis(Got me Down)\\" will have you wondering just how in the hell something so twisted could be this enjoyable.\\"Voodoo Lady\\" shimmies to to a swampy groove and just ends with everyone sticky all over. \\"Baby Bitch\\" and \\"What Deaner Was Talkin' About\\" are heartfelt yet also humorous. These dudes prove that just cuz something is funny, doesn't mean it can't be taken seriously. Trust me, if you have never checked out the boys from New Hope, this is the perfect introduction.

The songs all have the same weird sound effects and computerized voices, but they're also a lot more pleasing to listen to than some previous Ween CD's, like Pure Guava or God Ween Satan. A lot of people that I've introduced to Ween did not like them, saying that the songs weren't pleasant to listen to and that is was \\"bad music\\". Although I personally really like them, I can undestand why they might have that opinion. This CD proves to them that Ween really does know how to make good music, that you can enjoy listening to. \\"A tear for Eddie\\" is a beautiful song. I would reccomend this CD to any Ween fan or anyone that hasn't heard Ween yet, this is a great example of Ween's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"It re-aligned my whole perception on life","review":"this album is like a peice of pumpkin pie, it's delicious, and nutricious! the music it self, at face value, is very good enjoyable music, but then you realize what ween's real intentions are...I garuantee hours of laughter for the whole family! except the children, and anyone elso who could be offended...anyways...excellant music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a beatiful CD.","review":"I must begin by saying this album does have a few weak spots, such as Beunos Tardes Amigo and Candi, but the rest of this album is a veritable masterpiece.

Luckily, they remind us exactly who they are with tracks that feature the trademark Ween high-pitched voices, out-of-tune guitars, outrageous lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny at first...","review":"I use to laugh hysterically at this album. \\"Freedom of '76\\" and \\"The HIV Song\\" were, to me, hilarious; I was practically rolling on the floor. When I listened to the song, \\"Buenos Tardes Amigo\\" I didn't laugh. I did, however, really enjoy it. I happened to be walking to a store, and the seriousness of the song made buying stamps that much more of a purpose; mailing will never be the same. Also, \\"Spinal Meningitus (got me down)\\" is starting to grow on me as a cool song.My point in all this is that I used to listen to this band as a novelty, but I have found that they are somewhat respectable musicians, and I have to give them props."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Stars","review":"What strange world do we live in where someone could give this CD 1 star, they are either playing a cruel joke or are one.

I have news for you: the Phish cover is infinitely better than the original. I absolutely detested this album! I listened to it once, and tossed it in the trash can (literally; it's in with the vegetable peeings and coffee grounds until the city hauls it away). Ween are moderately accomplished musicians, able to offer a variety of pastiches, but that isn't so much to write home about. Most Bar Mitzvah bands can cover a comparable range of styles. What got me were the lyrics, which were sickening. Ween seem to revel the disturbing and grotesque, and because they offer it up deadpan, their fans assume that it is hip or sardonically cool. Not for the faint of heart or for those with even a modicum of good taste. I'd avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I'm not buying this CD","review":"I love the song Liberty Bell, so I was getting the details before requesting that my local library buy it.However I'm so sick of album covers that exploit women.

Definately more interesting than the stupid ghost tours.......read what actually happened, instead of made up drivel. So very interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly anything on the Tu-4!","review":"I was very disappointed with the lack of info on the Tu-4. While the book is comprehensive, it lacks detail on the plane that the Soviets used to literally springboard their aviation industry forward in design and manufacturing. Considering that many of the aircraft covered in the book didn't even appear in the form of a flying prototype, while the Tu-4 was a production aircraft, I consider this a glaring omission! Merely referring to another book in the series that covers the Bull in greater detail struck me as either lazy, smug, or deceptive. Perhaps all three. I can't and won't recommend this book to my fellow aviation buffs. Sorry, close but no cigar..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A suprisingly accuarate title","review":"There is one rule of thumb in buying Beasite Boys records, and if your new to the Beastie's camp, then you need to know this: avoid anything that is predominatly hardcore.Sure, there is some hardcore stuff on both \\"Check Your Head\\" and \\"Ill Communication\\", but there's also really cool jazz and rap songs on those.\\"Some Old Bulls**t\\" compiles two early seven inchs from the Beasties sub-par Minor Threat days, as well as the \\"Cookie Puss E.P.\\", their first foray into hip-hop, which is little more than the Beastie's making prank phone calls over a mediocre tape loop.Sure, fans may get a laugh out of this, but not even they should want to keep this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this cd about 6 years ago mainly to complete my Beastie Boys collection. It's made up of stuff that they recorded before they were signed to Def Jam, meaning that it's mostly punk. If anything, it is kind of interesting to hear where they were back in the day, but the music isn't very good. You can hear the beginnings of hip-hop in their music in \\"Cooky Puss\\" in the fact that it had a beat and some amateur scratching, but the song is really just a series of prank calls to Baskin Robbins. If you buy it, don't expect to actually be listening to it much."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: VERY UNLIKE THEIR LATER STUFF!","review":"Nothing like anything on Hello nasty, and completely different from all their other stuff.

Sorry beasties but I really disliked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the worst hardcore ever made","review":"I like a lot of musical genres. I love both hardcore and hip-hop. The Beastie Boys are a much better hip-hop group than a hardcore band. In fact, as a hardcore band they were just downright awful.

THIS COLLECTION IS JUST A BUNCH OF RARE AND VERY OLD BEASTIE BOYS SONGS. MUCH OF THESE SONGS ARE NOT EVEN HIP HOP SONGS, BUT ROCK SONGS.

I just hope there is a sequel. I really enjoy all of Tim LaHaye's works of fiction. I LOVE Christian Fiction and it is close enough to the word of God to make it enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Tim Lahaye is supposed to be a bible scolar. Well He thinks Jesus was born in Palastine. My Bible says Jesus was born in ISRAEL and Grew up in ISRAEL and taught in ISRAEL and JUDEA. I think LaHaye has been listening to too much Arab TV This story has not held my attention at all. I will not be buying any more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Read if Your a Christian","review":"I am a picky reader, and when i picked this book up i couldn't put it down.This book was oddly satisfying for about a day, and then you realize how much the author preached to you, because he is like a priest or something. There are some action scenes, but it is a wannabe copy of the Da Vinci Code. If you liked the Da Vinci Code this is a good way to spend time waiting for the Code's sequel. But don't buy it, you'll never think of it again. Again this book has so much preaching its so annoying, which is why you should read it if your a Christian. All the preaching made the book bad, im sorry to say.Here's some good stuff:Suspense, charactersAction, scenesTraveling, interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentalist nonsense","review":"I trapped myself into this thoroughly silly book by checking it out from my public library, having forgotten who Lahaye was. I won't reprise here what other reviewers have said about the preposterous Noah's Arc premise. Suffice it to say that Lahaye's tiresome advocacy of creationism, which I infer stems from his belief that Every Word in the Bible is Literally True, has no place in a work of modern fiction, it seems to me.Unless you are a deeply committed fundamentalist Christian, I suggest you stay far, far away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AND THE GOOD BOOKS KEEP ON COMING!!","review":"TIM LAHAYE IS THE BEST WRITER OF CHRISTIAN FICTION THAT I EVER HAVE READ. BABYLON RISING IS THE BEST YET, AND NEXT COMES THE LEFT BEHIND BOOKS,AND YES I'VE READ ALL TWELVE BOOKS TOO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible Thumping Nonsense","review":"In this latest piece of tripe, Lahaye uses a thin plot as a pulpit for his evangelical crusade. If you don't have time to go to church, this will certainly fill the gap. However, if you are looking for a read that doesn't insult your intelligence with its contrived plot, stiff dialogue and ubiquitous attempts to bring the reader around to the \\"right\\" way of thinking, you should buy something else; anything will do. An absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Steps Down From The Original","review":"The first book in this series was awesome, but this one took forever to get started. For the first couple hundred pages the story is slooooooow, then all of a sudden it's like Lahaye realizes that the due date of the book is approaching and he quickly rushes to make his story complete. Maybe next time Lahaye will not procrastinate until the last minute as it seems as if he has done here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babylon Rising; The Secret on Ararat","review":"I cannot wait to get the next installment even tho I have not finished this one..Lahaye is a great writer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the first three in this series","review":"I have read the first three books in the Babylon Rising series and found this to be the best so far. I don't particularly care for all the murder that goes on in this series but the intrigue, discovery, and biblical tie ins are what keep me reading these books. In the Secret on Ararat the authors attention to details regarding what the Ark might look like are very intriguing. I almost felt like I was there seeing what they were describing.

I've tried but I can't get past the inanity of the first few pages. Firstly Murphy's fighting for his life in an underground river and he stops to help 2 little puppies Awwwww. Whay a guy. Next he's using his enormous lung capacity (over 2 minutes we're told he can hold his breath) to enter the freezing water to save the drowning puppies. Awwww. What a guy. Of course he saves them. Just. He's nearly out of breath and he's in the first stages of hypothermia. But what are we told the puppies are doing at this stage? Happily playing! Not drowned or hypothermic themselves. They are happily playing. Finally in total darkness his hand brushes a piece of wood. Most of us would think 'it's piece of wood' Not Murphy... he just knows it's an historical treasure!

They're very thick and soft, but everytime I use them, even a year later, they feel cold when you wrap yourself in them. They don't feel absorbent. It's very disappointing on a cold day to step out of your shower and feel chillier when you wrap the towel around you. My wife can't stand them despite their thickness and size.

No disrespect whatsoever to the boys from Kentucky, but nothing can top \\"Watermelon, Chicken, and Gritz\\". There are some good tracks on this cd, but not nearly as many as on their \\"debut\\". They didn't use hardly as many distinguished and catchy beats on this album, and really that was the first thing i was looking for. A few songs show their old style, but not many at all. \\"Nappy Roots Day\\", \\"Lac Dogs & Hogs\\", \\"Roun' The Globe\\", \\"What Cha Gon Do\\", and \\"Roun The Globe (Collipark RMX)\\" are the best songs on the cd. \\"Twang\\", an amazing track, will catch your attention if you are looking for the kind of stuff from their first album.

I thought it was a brilliant album. This album is pure crap. You can tell they had some deadline to meet and completely rushed this album (probably to try to cash into their limited success). You can picture them sitting in the studio discussing what to write a tune about. \\"Uh...maybe cadillacs, yeah a whole song.\\" Cool guys... \\"Oh and let's mention Kentucky 30 times per song, maybe that's part of the formula.\\" Worst album since Cris Robinson's (Black Crowes) solo effort.

It's short, to the point, and hits you in the head like Mark McGwire smashes a baseball. Remember this in not a hip hop album, it's a hardcore EP. Although it's not as good as say, Minor Threat or the \\"Damaged\\" days of Black Flag, it's still good hardcore music, better than almost anything that passes for punk these days (hey Green Day, Offspring, or any of you other Southern California \\"power pop\\" bands take a listen, you might learn something). If you don't like your music hard, buy another B-Boy album. But if you yearn for early 1980s hardcore music, this is worth the 4 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite EP of all time!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite Beastie Boys albums.

However, Aglio E Olio doesn't express their true talents. Sure, they have come out with some nice little hard rocker songs such as \\"Time for Livin',\\" where they turn the bass and everything up to full blast. It has become a side trade mark for them, but it is not their cliche. To any Beastie Boys fan, they might as well pick this album up, just to say they have the album in their collection. However, it is not a true demonstration of their talents. If there was less rock and more hip hop, 40 additional minutes, record scratching, and slower tempo rapping, Aglio E Olio would be a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gosh darn it, could they get any worse?","review":"These guys suck.

The film sadly in many ways is a modern day latino incantation of the Blaxploitation genre of film of the 1970's. Noble and heroic latino/hispanic people unite and trimumph over the evil anglo/white people. The film is loaded with false stereotypes many young and often uneducated urban latinos have of anglo whites.

I actually really liked it, and as far as sci-fi goes this was a fun book with an interesting premise, quirky-acting characters, and a mostly unpredictable plot. Best of all, the story involved the pleasant twists one would expect from a good story about time travel. I generally don't comment on other's reviews, but one reviewer noted somewhat oddly that the story's characters could not likely have covered as much ground during their travels as portrayed in the story, and I will second on this slightly odd observation. Summary: Read it if you enjoy time travel stories. Lastly, be sure to check out \\"Venus on the Half Shell\\", my favorite by this same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Tell, No Show","review":"I picked this up the other day, not expecting too much, but hoping that, considering the fame of the author, it would be a decent read.Woe upon me! This book is hardly printworthy. I would give it 0 stars, if I could.While the premise of the story is quite interesting, it is exceedingly poorly written. Perhaps this book was meant as an outline for a longer, fleshed out work, and someone accidentally forwarded to the printers. The prose is sloppy and nondescript, the characters are paper-thin, and the dialogue - though there is plenty of opportunity for it - is sparse and uninspiring, and what was no doubt meant as a surprise at the end was neither surprising nor particularly original. As the title of this review indicates, in this book, Farmer is all tell and no show.Not recommended except as an example of how NOT to write fiction for writing teachers to give their students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cisco needs to put this book in every router box!","review":"This book saved me a router upgrade.

Good choice for people looking to become familiar with terms, techniques and process of ALM.It's a little out of date if you ask me.

As so, it's not the best book to buy but quite good choice to start with ALM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Cat is ALL THAT","review":"Bad Cat is a tremendously fun book. The text is bouncy and fun, and the illustrations are colorful and complex. Like other reviewers, my family and I have made a game out of trying to find all the places in the book where particular characters show up (e.g. in the opening collage, and at the big block party at the end).More generally I really appreciate its artistic elements and wit - because Good Lord do I spend a lot of time reading this book. It's my daughter's favorite, and if it was something really simplistic I'd probably be out of my mind by now. We read it multiple times a day unless I hide it. ;) Can't wait to get the followup to this first Bad Cat book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fun Book","review":"My 5 year old daughter has demanded I read this book to her over and over.

I'm a 40 year old woman and I like \\"chick flicks\\" when they are good. I loved \\"You've got mail\\". But this? This was just drivel. Badly written, formulaic boring plot, and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends.You want to watch funny interactions between the sexes, watch Friends or BBC's coupling.You want to watch Charisma ACT?

I jogged for a 1/4 mile with it and turned around and went home to look into returning it. Mine does not stay completely locked into position while it's open. It is off balance and wobbles terribly. My husband adjusted the front wheel several times and it finally alligned straight, but you cannot ajust the back wheels. Both the front wheel and back right wheel started to buldge durning my short run. There is about 10 inches worth of storage space behind the seat. It was big enough for me to only put my dog's leash in it. I would definitely invest in a better brand if you are really planning on jogging with a stroller. Walking and park trips with this stroller would probably be fine, but I do not reccomend it to actually jog with. On the plus side, I do like the colors! They are not as bright as I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to push, rough to ride in","review":"The suspension and brake make this seem nice for parents, but look closely at the seat.

The latch on one side would not release. My wife runs mostly from the house and this stroller had been folded less than 10 times.The side latch that broke is inside the frame and cannot be repaired even by the bike store (this was confirmed by customer service). Unfortunately the stroller was six months out of warranty and instep will do nothing to help. I called and the bike store called and the company says no warranty no luck.This part is innacessible to replace and as I said the stroller had been folded so few times I am very very disapointed with the product and this company and will never buy from them again. For such an integral part to fail is a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me or my child","review":"This stroller is not for little toddlers and definitely not for babies in arms. It swam around my daughter when we got it at 6 months and it was only after she turned one we could use it at all. The shoulder harnesses don't hold her in now that she's grown more, and they're adjusted so she's pinned against the back of the stroller. She just slips her arms out the sides. The lap harness is hard to fasten. You HAVE to raise the front tire if you want to turn, and the front wheel has always seemed a little off balance, no matter what I try. I would not recommend this stroller at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one use","review":"This stroller was cute and cheap, so I bought it. Not being a serious runner, I didn't want to spend the money for a high tech jogging stroller. However, this stroller broke after one use! It still rides fine, but it won't collapse at all. Also even when it did fold up, there's no latch to keep it closed. The rubber grip on the handrail ripped after one use as well. This stroller is very poorly made.

Andrews book a try, seeing as how my friend is so obsessed with them. Well, Runaways seemed like a catchy title so I gave it a try. Let me just say, OHMYGOD!! Obviously this author does not 'write what she knows' because she has a totally warped view of the foster care system. I know people in foster care and this book is so far from the truth. Just for an example, the Tooey's house seems to house about 15 kids, when the legal max is six.Also, how dumb does the author think 17-year-old girls are? A bunch of bikers tell a bunch of defenseless girls to go off on a deserted road and they happily oblige? Yeah, right!All I can say is, if you don't care what the REAL world is like, go ahead and read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too unrealistic","review":"I must admit that many parts of this book were quit entertaining, while others were just corny and just plainly stupid. Like one part, Crystal, an orphan suffering often from some kind of nervous breakdown, the friends get together in a circle and recite some chant to get her out of her trance saying stuff like \\"we are sisters, we can do this, your problem is all our problems\\" and so forth. I also found that the orphans were to different to realistically be that good of friends with eachother, each one had nothing in common. I also thought that they just did not reflect enough on the average foster child.

Andrews Runaways is the best book that I have ever read. It is about four girls Brooke, Raven, Crystal, and Butterfly (Janet). Raven hoped to be a singer, Crystal planned to go to college to be a doctor, Butterfly a dancer, and Brooke secretly hoped to find her mother in California. They lived in New York at a foster home called the Lakewood House, which was owned by Gordon Tooey and his wife Louise. The four girls runaway to California, borrowing Gordon's car. During their trip a lot of mishaps had happened. Making their journey much more difficult. There were almost times where they wanted to give up. This book I thought was very exciting. It has so much suspense and drama. When you read it everything is described so perfect, it is almost as if you were there. If you want to know how these brave young girls lived the rest of their lives you should read the book. I guarantee that this book is one of them books you don't want to put down and you can't wait until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was abosolutly awsome and I have read that whole series .","review":"When this series came out I read all of them as soon as they came out. I had to have them and find out what happened to each girl. It was a powerful series that let me discover a whole new type of writting. It wasn't your typical teenage romance or you have problems and by the end of the book she has her perfect life back. It was awsome and I'm glad she is writting The Wildflowers now. It is just as good as her first series and not as descriptive and mature as her other books. They are absolutly perfect reading material for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in plot and presentation","review":"I had hoped this book would be done in alternating points of view from all four girls (like If There Be Thorns). Instead, Brooke is our narrator, and the reader is limited to her perceptions. The other three girls become typecast by their personalities (the wimp, the brain, the troublemaker) and we lose the intimacy we had with them in their books. Also, I hope the plot was meant to show that runaways are on a one-way street to nowhere, because that's how I felt while reading it. Not the thrilling finale I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the first four!","review":"Okay, this one isn't too bad, still doesn't read anything like a V. C.

This story of the Orphans was a mildly interesting read, more for teens, and not a good representation of the VCA name. The ending also felt rather rushed together, and the novel overall was very, very cheesy, especially with the hippie character. The Orphans series certainly didn't represent Mr. Neiderman's best work and we had hoped it was temporary, but sadly, the VCA name would NEVER be the same again... and it's even more evident 10 years later. :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome to Use","review":"I used this book for my second course in fluid mechanics, and I thought it was terrible.

I was fortunate enough to catch the show, and to this day it is the most fun and memorable concert experience I've had. Spliff is a talented band that subsequently released a number of heavy rock albums with German lyrics and a wacky German sound. Radio Show was done in English, and it chronicled the rise, fall, and rebirth of a mythical rock star. Each song tells the story of a step on the way. The music is purposely derivitive of various 70s styles, yet is clearly unique to Spliff. I personally give it five stars, but that's because I have the memory of the concert (and the general fun I was having at the time). By today's standards the production values are a little weak, and the sound is a tad dated.

I made 3 pots to clean out the unit and 1 brewed pot. NO hot spots on the counter although the heating plate area did get hot. (normal---it's a hot plate). When filled to the glass rim of the pot with water it made 12 6oz cups (always some water left in the grinds). I USE A 9 oz cup and I drink it black so I usually only get 7 cups. The -1 has a electronic type clock and is not back lit. (Could use the back lite as it's difficult to see from afar). Buzzer at end of cycle a nice touch. Brew time is normal and seems to work ok. I'll wait a few months as revisit...Tom..PS The -1 has a gold tone basket, I usually get one of these since I don't like the paper filters. It also comes with a water filter system that fits on top of the grind filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy","review":"I'm on my third coffee pot in one year of this model. The First two were exchanged. This one will be going into the trash. Received as a wedding gift. Returned the first on because it didn't keep coffee hot, the second one over heated and damaged the base of the pot. NOW THIS ONE, shuts off after making one cup and does not continue to make any more coffee. I have to shut it off and restart it 8 times before it will make 10 cups of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Coffee Ignores Design Flaws","review":"This Coffeemaker was sent to me as a replacement after the first Mr. Coffee maker with steel closed-style carafe leaked coffee all over my brand new wood floor during its first week. I insisted on this version because i assumed I wouldn't have problems with a more simple carafe. Not true! As others state, this carafe leaks water and coffee from the simple act of pouring. Pour as slow as you want and it will still dribble down because of the way they designed the plastic ring at the top. Also, this plastic ring has a channel between it and the glass that you can't get to in order to clean, but water/coffee/soap can get in there and never fully dry. This means whatever bacteria that builds up in there can end up in your cup. I can't believe this is still on the market. There is no way they don't know about this problem, but continue to send them off. Have a little integrity Mr. Coffee and fix the problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying piece of junk","review":"Heated water goes into basket faster than it runs out into the carafe.

The device that lets you remove the carafe while brewing stopped working after I removed the basket to clean it. A few months later, the water pump broke.Since the carafe was still usable, I decided to buy the FTX45-1, it being similar to the old one. (The old carafe would be a spare should this one's break.)After just two weeks of using the pot to brew only water, the pump broke. The same problem the other reviewers have mentioned. The water gets hot, a tiny bit spurts out, and the pot dings that all is done. Even restarting the machine and letting it run for an hour produces no better results.It's bad enough having to buy a new coffee maker every year or so because of poor workmanship. It's another to pay $50 for one that breaks in just a couple of weeks. I agree with the reviewer who said the product needs to be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"We have had nothing but trouble with this pot since it entered our house 6 months ago.

I would not recommend this pot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad check valve in Mr Coffee FTX45-1. Stops making coffee.","review":"I have the answer why the FTX45-1 stops brewing before it is done! The check valve in the hose is bad. It's the lump at the end of the hose that connects to the water tank. It does not let the water flow properly into the heating element and the water steams furiously and the thermostat shuts off the coffee maker. And yes I cleaned it over and over! Mr. Coffee needs to do a RECALL to repair them all!!! Better yet an exchange program where Mr Coffee is sold! I emailed them and told them. I would be happy just to get a new improved check valve.

The coffeee maker does not do well with batches over 6 cups. It overflows in the basket. In the last week it doesn't always finish the brew cycle.

I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Mr. Coffee","review":"I was always loyal to Mr. Coffee but after three of these coffee makers it's time to move on. The first one I owned the warmer stopped working. So I bought another one without the adjustable warmer setting(I like the features). This unit leaked all over and about a year later just stopped working. The third unit lasted about 8 months steams a lot and now the lights flash.

I'm posting this review to warn others so they don't waste their money on it.The water hose inside my machine spontaneously disconnected; water ran all over the counter, of course. Took off the bottom, put the hose back together. It fell off again. Bought a small screw-down tubing clamp at the hardware store, fixed that for good. A month later, it just stops in the middle of the brewing cycle, and you have to take the pot out and put it back and jiggle it to start the brew cycle again. The little rubber \\"feet\\" on the bottom of the coffee maker fall out whenever it's moved.If you're tall like me, the LCD clock display is unreadable unless you crouch down and get on eye level with it.I tossed it in the trash.

The book is about a speech teacher trying to teacher a deaf person to speek and lip read. The topic is really interesting, because I haven't really read a lot of plays about the deaf, and the struggles that they go through. There is also a big romance in the book, but I think that the romance moves a little too quickly, and in that way is unrealistic. The play is in 2 short acts. I really liked the notes from the author in the beginning about the struggle to write this play because of a deaf friend, and about how it was put on in a small theater and then moved to broadway, and then it won a tony for best actress & actor, and best play!

As for the songs: they are somewhat amusing at first (especially \\"I Wish I Was Him\\", a tribute to Evan Dando of the Lemonheads), but they are nothing out of the ordinary, and Ben Lee and his friends can't sing or play their instruments. Oh yeah, I would stay away from Ben Lee's \\"critically-acclaimed\\" follow-up (\\"Grandpaw Would\\") as well. I've only seen the video for \\"Away With The Pixies\\" once, but it didn't seem like Ben's guitar-playing/singing/song-writing had improved at all.

This time they pick some lesser known nuggets, but again exceed expectations by making these songs their own and yet not changing anything. If you love Zeppelin, you will love this band as they manage to be cool by simply playing exceptional versions of songs their heroes created. The Ocean was my personal favorite but all on this disc are worthy. What makes a great tribute? How about one that makes you re-discover a classic artist all over again for the genius they possessed.

It is an easy read, with several enjoyable episodes, and one could simply take it on that surface level. It also, however, gives great insight into the conditions that Basques had to deal with living in Nevada.

I wouldn't even put it in my top 25, and I love the B-Boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd sucks","review":"for fanatical star struck beastie fans only. this cd really sucks. on check your head the beastie boys main assette LYRICS went belly up. on this cd the beasties prove that they suck musically as well. i would fully recommend the beasties first two CDs. I would half heartedly recomend the beasties third cd. but ILL COMMUNICATIONS really really sucks. its too bad they didnt retire. there is nothing influential innovative interesting or entertaining about this CD whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every cd gets worse","review":"This cd is a rip off I bought it on sale for $8.99, and it was still too much. Sabatoge is a great song, and that is about it for this cd. Since Licensed to ILL each album has gotten a little worse. Hello Nasty (I heard at a friends) is worth a half star. Maybe the band sucks now, or has too many activities to make good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fall of the beastie boys!","review":"this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Beastie Boys record?","review":"\\"Ill Communication\\" was the Beastie Boys' breakthrough record. The boys moved from just making straight forward hip hop records to records that had a bit of everything. \\"Ill Communication\\" has all forms of hip hop, hardcore punk, funk, lots of interesting samples, and even Tibetan monk chants on it. This is probably the most accessible Beasties record because it has such a wide range of genres mixed in it. My favorite Beastie Boys record changes but I think overall I would have to pick \\"Ill Communication\\" as my favorite because out of all their records, I've listened to this the most and as far as achievement goes, it is their best and will be hard to top. \\"Ill Communication\\" goes to show that hip hop can go further and that you don't have to act like a hardcore gangster to rap and most important, how to chill out."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite album","review":"Ill communications stands out as landmark album from the 90s. The entire album was really well written and helped to set the stage for the beastie boys becoming one of the biggest bands of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"hip hop pioneers","review":"Beastie boys come off clean and correct with original and crazy phat lyrics and beats that show age comes with better expeience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beasties Bridge The Gap!","review":"The Beasties are without a doubt one of the premiere groups of the past 20 years. Truly, all people can get down to this music---it has something for everyone, unless you have no sense of humor. Uptight people should stay away, but if you like hip-hop, rock, rap, and attitude, this is a good place to get it. The Beastie Boys latest, and one of their greatest..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The is the Beasties best album, for sure!","review":"All I can say is that this is my favorite Beasties album. My fav. song is \\"Get it Together\\" Kewl! This is a really swinging hip-hop, rapping treat CD. I would give this album a 5, but there are not enough songs on the album I like, to support it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Check Your Head","review":"Up until this point, Beastie Boys albums were groundbreaking events-the metal-rap hybrid License to Ill, the collage spectacular Paul's Boutique, and the live instrument anchored Check Your Head. Here is where the Beasties began to falter-this is nothing more than a complete retread of Head, with the same ratio of rap to punk to instrumentals. Only this time, the music is weaker, the raps less satisfying, the instrumentals more boring. (Even the cover art seems rehashed). The lyrics are different, but now the Boys are far more preachy and sanctimonious. Apart from \\"Sabotage\\" (which really isn't as good without the clever video) this record is forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"Immediately after placing my order I received an email to confirm the order was received and that it would be shipped immediately. Excellent communication from seller:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bonus Songs Please","review":"The Beastie Boys have been holding back the unreleased songs on their recent series of album reissues. I know there is a lot more unreleased material available from this time period that could have easily fit on disc 2 of this set. Where's the original version of \\"Intergalactic\\"? What about songs like \\"Dejembe\\", \\"The Hurricane Freestyle\\", \\"Triphammer\\", \\"Screaming at a Wall\\" or \\"Conga + Bass\\" from the old Sabotage VHS? Instead we get an underwhelming recording of the Beasties playing basketball... and I'm assuming this counts as one of the 2 unreleased songs that is promised on the album cover? I also have the Paul's Boutique and Check Your Head reissues and they are equally disappointing when it comes to the bonus songs, in fact the former has none. If you already own these albums I wouldn't waste your money on the reissues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb and innovative album","review":"This album is very special. There is a return here to the Beastie Boys hardcore roots, as well as an exploration of live instruments mixed with rapping. There is also a mellow and even mystical side to band that is exposed here, they have flute samples and my favourite is the Tibetan throat singing. I can hardly believe it but despite all the styles involved in this album it still flows and is listenable all the way throughout. I found the production of this album great, you can tell that the Boys had a lot of creative control on the album and really demonstrated their mastery of music. I love albums like this that break people's preconceptions of music and styles.This album let the world know that the Beastie Boys are unclassifiable and can do whatever they want and make it musical. This is a must have for anyone that can appreciate rapping along side other styles of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beasties Can't Seem To Fail...","review":"Again, the Beastie Boys, modern histories greatest thinkers/rappers/punk rockers strike gold with a deliciously ecclectic record in \\"Ill Communication\\". This album starts off strong with \\"Sure Shot\\", a funked out classic. Root Down, Sabotage, and Get It Together are the big tracks on this CD, but the real pleasure of this album are the punk and instrumental tracks slipped between witty, jazzy rap tracks.The Beasties truly have their own style, and its hard to argue against it... Its that CD that you listen to over and over again on a roadtrip, rhyming along with the 3 MCs.If you liked Paul's Boutique (an absolute triumph) then pick up this record, the more you hear from the beasties, the more you'll like them.Long story short, its a classic gem that leaves no track unlistenable... When it comes to the B-Boys, you can't seem to go wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one of the best cds in the world","review":"i love all beastie boys cds, but this one is great because they returned to their punk rock more in this cd.

It was kinda childish to me. I would have liked a more adult version of the story. I felt that it was written more for the teenage crowd than the adult. With that said, it was an ok read for me.

It could have been thicker with details but the plot is solid and the books to follow are fantastic. The plot is solid SF fare with a political twist.

Now I can get brewed cold iced tea in just a few short minutes. Sure, you can get iced tea using instant tea mixes, but they just don't taste as good as brewed iced tea. But when you brew tea to make iced tea it takes a ton of ice to cool it down quickly, which totally waters down the tea.Not any more!!! Now with these cold brew tea bags it is a snap to make iced tea. The Lemon flavored tea is the best tasting to us since we prefer regular tea over fruit flavored teas, and we always add lemon. So this lemon flavor is just like the taste of the standard iced tea we used to make.The way I make this tea is use cold tap water, brew the tea for 10 minutes, then pour over ice.

USB peripherals have the more boxy B connector with lopped-off corners. Thus you can't plug this dock into your computer with a regular USB cable. It's not just baffling that a blunder like this would make it out the door, but that it persists in multiple generations of Insten products. INEXCUSABLE.Second, some of the pins on Insten's dock connector aren't connected as required to make this peripheral work with iPhones.

I have since washed it three more times and the smell is pretty much gone. It's an okay pad that you can get to fit the Graco P&P; if you really try, but it doesn't exactly fit like a glove.

It reads like the author just cribbed from other film books, having no insights of his own. In addition, the author only seems to have an interest in films made in the past ten years - anything before 1960 is given only the most cursory mention - and many filmmakers and films not mentioned at all! To leave out most of the silent era and German expressionism in particular is stupidity of the highest order. (not a mention of Pabst, for example, or his Pandora's Box or Threepenny Opera). Instead he blathers on about the most obscure independent films by bad American filmmakers that were done in the past five years - this book is little more than a laundry list of directors that can be garnered from any history of film book.

I never got the impression that she placed any importance on working -- if I met her today, I'd probably tell her that if she would give some thought to what she wanted to be when she grew up, and then take some concrete steps toward achieving some goal, any goal, her life just might lift out of the morass it currently seems to be in.As a recently separated woman, I read this book thinking that it might give me some insight, but I really wasn't able to glean enough information about Lamott's protagonist to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Lamott should be Anne Lament","review":"Anne Lamott's name should be Anne Lament because that's all her characters ever do. We enjoy reading about flawed characters because it reaffirms our own imperfections in life, however I can't stand whiny characters that never do anything positive to change their life's negative direction. Anne Lament's newly divorced main character makes a choice to fall for a MARRIED man while continuing to SLEEP with her newly MARRIED ex-husband. Hello, don't you have enough wobegone misery in your life already? Make some smart choices, don't get emotionally involved with married men, and don't read this book. It is horribly written.

In the lead, is Mattie. A milk toast of a woman living a gray life as a victim. Her divorce is boring, her affairs are dull, her parenting weak bordering on bad. There are no lessons learned or insights found in the draining excuse of an existence Ms. Lamott created for her. Peel me a grape...and please do yourself a favor and pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always loved Lamott's writings, and consider Crooked Little Heart to be one of my favorite books of all time. Unfortunately Blue Shoe didn't live up to my expectations, coming from such a great writer. I alternated between feeling pity for and frustrated with Mattie, but never got around to actually liking her. Her \\"Christianity\\" was also disappointing - she went to church every Sunday and prayed, but she was almost always praying for help for herself. Except for her one instance of foot washing, I did not see any other Christian qualities in Mattie. Skip this book and return to Lamott's classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing read","review":"I love Anne Lamott's non-fiction so I was hoping to enjoy her fiction as well but this book wasn't for me.

I hope the new paper gets a better story printed on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Disappointed","review":"Anne Lamott is an established maestro of the writing craft. I have always delighted in her books. What happened? This story is a meandering weave of mishmash. It wanders here, wanders there, but doesn't go anywhere.

Too bad I didn't buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I am a big Anne fan, have read and bought all her books. However, this one won't make it to my personal library- I tried to like it, I really did, but it just doesn't come up to par with her other work. I was confused about what was happening for most of the book and more importantly, why any of it was happening. I never did understand why that one character (can't recall her name) lived in a run-down house on the beach with no electricity and acted crazy. There was not much of a plot, which is okay as long as character development is strong but we don't get that in here either. There was so much potential because all the characters appeared in-depth and complicated and interesting but we never get told why any of them act the way they do! I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this book and can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me, or....","review":"...is every single book Anne Lamott writes about herself and her family and friends? I LOVE her non-fiction, but the same people show up again and again in her novels, often quoting things she has already written in her memoirs. I have to wonder if Lamott is capable of writing any characters that aren't thinly disguised versions of people in her life, or of setting her novels anywhere but Marin County. She has taken \\"write what you know\\" to an extreme. A very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad","review":"This book reads like notes for a novel that could have become good with a lot of work, but the work wasn't done. How could she have let this get out when it was so bad? Is she that callous about her reputation that she doesn't care how badly it is tainted by the truly awful writing in this book? The writing is disjointed, muddled, and awkward. The characters are boring and whine too much. There are some cute lines from the Harry character. I suspect those lines were all she really had in mind when she started writing. But all writers know that you don't just spew out words and then you're finished!This never would have been accepted by a publisher if it weren't by Anne Lamott who has otherwise written all marvelous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woe is me!","review":"If only her fiction could be as interesting as her non-fiction!

It was a piece of her past that she needed for comfort.She led a very complicated life, which I think she made more complicated herself with some of the choices she made.I intend to read all the books this author has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As an Anne Lamott fan, I was very disappointed in this book.Her earlier ones were better. There was no mounting tension to hold the story together, and the main characters were people I didn't respect or even like: professional victims with no compelling goals. The people were like cartoon-characters from AA or Born Again-types-preaching to the reader. This was a novel that needed a good editor and a longer gestation period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"If you've read Bird by Bird, Operating Instructions or Traveling Mercies, don't bother with this one.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"I listened to about half of the audiotape, waiting for something, anything to happen, aside from a bunch of whining and meandering dialog. While \\"slice of life\\" novels can be great, this one just had nothing to give it forward momentum. Sometimes, things were too ordinary, and other times, too hard to believe, such as that a 7-year-old would become practically suicidal because his dad's girlfriend was expecting. Halfway through this long slog, I was just so bored, I gave up. Overall, a mess of a novel. I expected more from Anne Lamott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a huge fan of Anne, but this one lost me. Four years of self-centered whining? Missed the insight.

I was disappointed from the beginning, but stuck with it because I couldn't imagine it wouldn't get better. But it didn't! The story was predictable, the characters uneven and uninteresting, and the preachy comments annoying. She communicated her christian faith in \\"Traveling Mercies\\" with wit, finese, and grace, but none of this transpired in the pages of her current novel. I felt the characters were shallow and much of the content of the book read like a dime store romance novel rather that what her readers have come to expect from such a talented writer.I am still an Anne fan, but this one I won't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Shoe","review":"This is the first book of hers I have read - I was not impressed; read halfway through and took it back to the library.

I can honestly say this is about the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. Half-way through the book I found myself asking -- what is the point? where is the story? I plodded thru Lamott's ramblings about Mattie and her other uninteresting characters that were peppered with her preachy and cheesy religious references and wondered how this book made it to print. If it is true that the author uses her own life as her inspiration, she needs to get over herself and find something more interesting/compelling and important to write about. Needless to say, I do not recommend this book to anyone!

There has only been one book that I have put down: Pride and Prejudice. Blue Shoe is a bit more interesting, yet still boring. I randomly picked it up at a bookstore, since the \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" at the top caught my eye. Bestseller? This book barely kept me awake. There is no point to it. It's predictable, and even the family secret is ho-hum. There are a few funny instances in the novel, but the rest is pitiful. Poor kids, their mother is a bad parent. Seems to be more interested in men than in her children. Don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"jealousy is just so sad....","review":"i thoroughly enjoyed Blue Shoe, as I have enjoyed all of Annie Lamott's work in the past. there is no question htat she is one of the most gifted and popular writers living today - her record speaks for itself. what i do not understand is the venomous sacs of spider puke that seem to be hurled around on this one. could it be that there is a backlash to being famous and loved and gifted? oh, yes. i forgot. people who are suffering need to spread that around. well, I doubt that we would fling this kind of abuse if we were face to face with a person. cowardly, i call it. why not stick to talking about the book and not crucifying this woman who gives of herself unflinchingly and without guile? listen - it;s a novel, not a billboard. you donthave to read it or buy it. but if you do, listen to Jimmy Stewart: Always be a little but kinder than you have to be.Annie, you're the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree, not her best","review":"I am a big fan of Anne Lamott, but this book was not very good. It seemed to be much the same as the Rosie books, but with different characters with different problems and none of the magic. There are lots and lots of seemingly extra characters who aren't developed. The plot is pretty sketchy and it didn't seem to pick up until the last 85 pages. My favorite works of hers are Rosie, Crooked Little Heart and Traveling Mercies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is she kidding?","review":"Who is she--by this I mean both Anne Lamott and her central character Mattie--kidding? Mattie is a mess, no matter how \\"endearingly,\\" who at the end has little to redeem her--her selfishness and blindness are overwhelming. She's sleeping with her ex-husband, who has re-married and whose new wife is expecting. And she is coveting another woman's husband. No matter how disagreeable the \\"other women\\" may be, there is no excuse for Mattie's behavior, nor her lack of honesty and candor. And she seems incapable of doing anything short of praying--and I'm a great believer in prayer. I usually enjoy Anne Lamott tremendously, and her characters equally--especially because of their flaws and their faith. But I found Blue Shoe to ask too much, even of Lamott's faithful."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing journey","review":"Blue Shoe was a miserable ride from begining to end. I loved Bird By Bird, also by Anne Lamott, but Blue Shoe was completely horrible. I kept waiting for some lessons to be learned, maybe some hope to be found for the obviously fragile children. Nothing. I can appreciate struggle and grief and mental instability as much as anyone, but frankly I just didn't care about any of the characters in this book. I had to force myself to pick it up every night all the while hoping that the ending would make the read worthwhile, but I had no such luck. Sorry Anne, but Blue Shoe was just too blue for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment....Kick This Shoe to the Curb","review":"This book was terrible. There are no other words to describe it. The plot was vapid and boring, the characters were weak and flimsy, and I finished this book thinking that I just wasted several hours of my life reading it. I have never read this author before, but I can assure the general public I will never read her works again. I just wish I could get my money back, but unfortunately it isn't even worth the time to try and sell it for .78 cents on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamott needs to leave the autobigraphical novel behind","review":"Anne Lamott is one of my favorite authors but she's never been able to pull off fiction in the same brilliant way she's mastered nonfiction. (Although \\"Rosie\\" came very close.) This is sadly evident in the \\"The Blue Shoe' which is boring and forgettable.I still have hope for Anne. If she would just get out of her own head and create characters that are completely different from herself and the witty gang she hangs out with, I believe she'd have fiction worthy of celebration. (As long as she also included a liitle bit of plot in the mix as well.) The first rule most fiction authors learn is to leave the emotional, obviously autobiographical opuses behind. Lamott would do well to heed that advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and 1/2 Stars","review":"I've heard a lot of good things about Anne Lamott. This is the first book I've read by her and it was okay but not great. She has a rather rambling style of writing and as she meanders about, seems to have some keen insights. I did grow weary of the main character's complaining but she did bring out observations about the human dilemma of caring for our children and our aging parents. I had problems with her rationalization of the main character's moral behavior as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"As my mama would say, \\"What a hoot!\\"","review":"I am so glad the recommendations section at Amazon brought this book to my attention!!

I have run across the author's name occasionaly since then in this or that newspaper (at least often enough to remember that he likes to refer to Henry David as the 'other' Thoreau). But then I read that his recent memoir skewers a good writer, VS Naipaul. Seems Naipaul let Theroux down somehow. From what I can remember of CHICAGO LOOP, cultivating his talent may have been Naipaul's unforgivable sin. This thing is awful. To be avoided at all costs.

I think the facts are astounding enough and the reader should make up their own mind without the hyperbole.Also, the much alluded to picture of LHO with Dave Ferrie is now posted on wikipedia. Too bad the author did not already have this since much is devoted to whether or not the picture even exist.All knit picking aside, I would still recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough color.","review":"This book contained mostly black and white photos.

An exciting book in the Jedi Apprentice series, The Captive Temple is the type of book you won't want to put down or miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Captive Audience","review":"Jedi Apprentice #7, the Captive Temple, is just as endearing,captivating,fascinating and frustrating as the other six. Incredibly well written, and not just for a childrens book, this one is filled with non-stop action from the first page to the last, with lightsaber action sequences that will leave you breathless. We begin to see an aspect of Qui-Gons personality emerge-his devotion and affection for the underdog, who just happens to be Obi-Wan in this case. This book holds true to all its predecessors in that it leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books reveal the hearts of Obi Wan and Qui Gon...","review":"I am 40 years old and I LOVE, LOVE this whole series of books!

These books get into the hearts and minds of Obi Wan and Qui Gon, and it will get into yours too, whatever your age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really interesting book...","review":"The Captive Temple is a really good book. While not terribly suspenseful, it has good action, good interaction, and it's fun to read. There are a couple of downpoints, however. First, I wish the authors of SW books would do their homework better. Ki-Adi-Mundi should not have been in this book, as he won't be introduced into the Jedi Council for another 12 years or so. Also, there is no real sense of closure in this book, but it's not really a cliffhanger ending either. It just kind of ends. Still, it's enjoyable, and we get to see some new Jedi and some more of the Temple. I'm interested in seeing how this series will end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best yet!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Captive Temple, although I agree with some other reviews here--it was far too short! I wanted more! What a neat little series this is!

It is helpful, but not at all necessary, to have some familiarity with modal logic. Readers without the technical background will still be able to follow most of Prof. Gale's arguments.The virtues of this book are numerous. When it comes to the issues of whether \\"God\\" is a self-consistent concept, whether the universe requires an explanation, whether the argument from evil is defeated by appeal to free will, and whether religious experience provides a rational basis for religious belief, there are simply no comparable treatments available. Gale's treatments are far and away the most comprehensive and sophisticated available.

The first half of The Sound and the Fury is especially difficult, but hang in there because it is a great story. Light in August is Faulkner at his best attempting to explicate incredibly complex issues of race. These books are a good start to his literature, but by no means a complete sampling. He does stereotype his black characters but he is also doing more than that with them (so I encourage you to read the characters closely); his black characters are also a progression in his literature which shows his growth as a writer and observer of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"As I lay Dying","review":"I was hoping for a summer of fun reading.

Even though it is difficult, I don't think it's quite as hard as some other reviewers have made out. It does take a couple of reads perhaps, but it is a short novel at a touch under 200 pages.And to address any possible labels of literary snobbery, I'm also reading some Batman comics, Neal Stephenson, and Carl Hiassen.

Oh lord.... Why does she always pick such depressing books? We had to read As I Lay Dying and other of Faulkner's books (I remember Absalom, Absalom very well) in high school. They were depressing then, and they are depressing (and boring) now. I don't know why English teachers and that whole establishment keep shoving them down our throats. The way As I Lay Dying is organized makes it frustrating to read. In school, teachers would excuse that and say that the difficulty was one of Faulkner's \\"devices,\\" but heaven help us students if what we wrote for class wasn't absolutely clearly organized.

I don't think I've ever seen such poor writing; there were times when sentences didn't even make sense. Add to that the poor punctuation, grammar and syntax, and the piece became almost impossible to read. I eventually managed to skim through the story to at least find out what happens to the two main characters, but since that outcome was predictable (I felt like I was back in high school, reading about the innane relationship issues from my teen years!), I'm not sure it was even worth the time I spent reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Heroes","review":"A fascinating character study of how an outstanding soldier and true leader comes to grips with the realization that the war he has been thrust into is far less than the \\"noble conflict\\" our leaders have led us to believe. \\"El Tee\\"'s devotion to his men and his country make him a true hero in my mind.

I personally hear a passion in his playing you either hear or you don't. For those who know what I'm talking about, there is no way you can walk away from this album disappointed. Granted it is a bit overwelming at first, but every track has something unique to offer; All of Paul's trademark shredding and odd timing remain in fine form, while tracks like 'Marine Layer' offer a nice surprise. 'Haydn Symphony No. 88 Finale' is worth the price of the disc alone, and there are really only 2 tracks on this CD I didn't warm up to right away(and even those had some incredible guitar 'nuggets' here and there).

It is silly when it isn't supposed to be.Horowitz exaggerates some of the nastier aspects of Elizabethan society to the point of caricature, but it doesn't work -- he presents nothing truly horrifying. Despite the best efforts of the author, \\"The Devil and His Boy\\" seems very modern. I was suprised to find out how much of the story Horowitz claims he \\"based on fact.\\"The characters aren't well-developed, and the book treats the themes of morality and honesty very lightly. The choices that the main character makes seem too easy. He refuses to turn to crime, but this comes off as unrealistic and sanctimonious, not heroic. The ending of the book is not a surprise at all.If you're looking for a good YA book on plays and Elizabethan England, try Susan Cooper'sKing of Shadowsinstead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopping for Sutras","review":"The reader from Novato complains that he got too little bang for his buck. I sympathize, but if he had done his homework he would have been much better off. For one thing, the book is readily available from its publisher for $5.95. For another, the book is not a translation of whole sutras, rather it translates in paraphrase various liturgical texts of the Shin tradition. A little more homework and he would have found this out, as well as finding much of the book's content already online and for free.The rendering into colloquial English of these essential Shin texts, therein referred to (with some license) as sutras, has given many English-speaking Shin Buddhists a much needed resource for devotion. I highly recommend this book (with the above-mentioned shopping caveats)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised and Touched","review":"I received this book as a gift and was ready to read it out of morbid curiosity then scoff at it, knowing who the famous Lover is that the author refers to. Instead, in a bout of insomnia, I read the book through to the end in the early hours of the morning. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a tale of love, loneliness, yearning, need, and loss, with all the details and small obsessions ringing true. Rather than completely malign his ex-love Martin chose the better part and gave a ruthlessly honest portrayal of a relationship in which both sides are flawed, real people, and both sides also have love and kindness in them. It's a fragile little story that anyone who has ever fantasized about having a passionate affair with a famous person, can identify with. My main concern is that now that he has 'spilled the beans' will his former Lover still mail him new sheets?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzled by a sparkly, whizzy little firework","review":"We've all read a million coming of age novels, and gay ones tend to be of the corniest I-love-my-hustler-room-mate variety, but to read this one is to remember how you truly felt as a nervous adolescent, confused and uncomfortable in your own skin.I guess that everyone will major on the Famous Rock Star angle of the book, which is undoubtedly fascinating, but this love letter is much more than just a scurrilous thrill. It's written in a terse, poetic, dreamy style that would be familiar to readers of the marvellous Jim Lewis, and it speaks of recognisable emotions in a fresh and sparkly way.Well worth reading and thinking on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwelmed and Curious","review":"This book was fascinating.

Some of the other reviews report it as being very slow, and it is, but it's not unbearable. The biggest sluggishness this player has is it's bootup, which takes mine about 20-30 seconds. The only other real slowness i've noticed is on some blu-ray discs -- and that has little or nothing to do with the player. For example, Spider Man 3 takes almost 3 minutes to load up to the main menu... with you waiting through several load screens. I chalk that up to the company that produced the disc, however, and not this player.As far as picture and quality, it looks very very good with HDMI output on my 32\\" flat screen LCD. All of my old DVD's look about 40% sharper with better color contrasting as a result of the upscaling this player has.I do recommend you get the firmware update as it helps improve load times and the overall stability of this unit.All in all, i'm quite satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - don't buy","review":"Do not buy a Samsung Player.

The CD won't eject, the player won't boot and after calling Samsung level 1 and level 2 tech support they tell me there's nothing I can do other than send it back.Now I have to find a box, fill out the paperwork, send it back and go through all the hassle of getting it repaired not to mention that I now have to go through the holiday season without being able to enjoy a movie.This is the first Samsung product I've bought and at this rate, it will be the last.

Standard DVDs work fine, but the Blu-Ray movies just give me the same message. Samsung's tech support could only offer the firmware solution (which I've already tried), and told me to call back to \\"Level 2\\" tech support. Anyone else have similar issues?

It is called \\"En Concert\\", however, you get a ton of black and white film footage of a camera man filming country side images from the car window as they drive past and images of the band surfing with some clips of live shows. I am a fan of Jack Johnson but this is not worth the money...buy the cd for the live music only."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you get it, you get it. These 1 star fellows do not!","review":"Obviously these 1 star voters have NEVER seen Jack's surf movies.

No tripods or fancy flying boom shots. No CG or fancy costumes. It's upclose and personal, not gimmicky and glossy - just like Jack's music!Is it a BluRay to put on to wow your neighbors with your 70\\" 1080 plasma? No. BUT the DTS-MA is ASTOUNDING. Pure audio bliss! So those who \\"get it\\" will love it. Everyone else is welcome to their unfortunate opinion about filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not have been released as Blu-ray","review":"The five star raters are correct in one sense. It is a raw look at Jack and his tour. That concept is great, but the way it was filmed is basically a blu-ray oxymoron. If you would like to see grain well-defined on your screen, then pick this up. I am wondering if the classic style DVD may actually play better. Long story short, if you have to decide between the blu-ray and the CD, get the CD. ***Most important point is the style. If you are looking for the beautiful crisp Dave and Tim style Blu-Ray then pass on this one***"},{"rating":"1","title":"En Concert","review":"I was really looking forward to this blu ray dvd.

Yes, there are the abductions, the mutilations, and those wondrous killing contraptions! However, this time out, we get a social / moral message that re-invigorates the whole wicked series. It's ALWAYS nice to see the return of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), even in ghostly flashback sequences. Also, whereas 4 and 5 seemed pointless and overly convoluted, SAW 6 is a true return to form w/ a hint of conscience thrown into it's meatgrinder of retribution.

The films are consistently clever, but often ultimately disappointing. \\"Saw 6\\" was however one of the best in the series, as it maintains its integrity to the early entries while creating a convincing healthcare themed story that is both twisted and relevant. Don't expect the increase in quality to mean a decrease in gore - as this has its fair share of squint-n-squirm moments, but hey - you go to a \\"Saw\\" movie, you cannot be angry when the blood starts to run. If you like any of the other ones - even if you've been disappointed in the franchise lately, give this one a try. You won't be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Now","review":"I love the Saw movies, but enough with the flashbacks.

For all the acid munching wastrels that enjoy Pink Floyd so much, buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live at Pompeii - Classic, Vintage Floyd","review":"I am glad I now own this DVD. It gives me the best of both worlds: the Director's Cut together with the Original film. Both of them have features I enjoy. The new animation added in the director's cut enhances the experience, especially in songs like 'Set the Controls' where it takes you on that solar trip we Floyd fans have imagined for as long as we can remember. In the original (and complete) footage of Echoes Part 1, when the camera zooms in ever so slowly into the band playing Pompeii's ancient and empty coliseum, you are witnessing a young Floyd on the cusp of true greatness. If you are a Floyd fan, you will not--repeat--not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The entire DVD is the wrong pitch!","review":"Length:: 2:11 MinsThis compares the pitch of echoes between Meddle, and two releases of Live At Pompeii.

This release is a double edged sword. Yes the extra interviews that are added and bonus features are great (Especially the original release). The problem is what we are missing by having the new footage added into the excellent original cut. And what is that? The band playing in Pompeii! The thing that the whole movie was originally about. The shots of dave and Nick doing their vocals in the studio could have been extra features. Or maybe, include the original cut as a bonus. Also, what's up with those 3rd rate computer graphics? Did the director do those at home? It's great to finally get this on DVD, but it's not what we've all been waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play in any DVD Player.","review":"I received this video wife out of town going to watch concert.

Most of the interviews did not really get to the meaning behind the group. The whole DVD was sloppy. Added to that, the DVD skipped many times during play."},{"rating":"1","title":"inspired parts of \\"Spinal Tap\\"","review":"When Johnny Rotten wore a T-shirt saying \\"I hate Pink Floyd,\\" this is probably the sort of fare he had in mind, not \\"Arnold Lane\\" or even \\"Green is the Color.\\" This project boils all of the humor and verbal elegance out of a band that at its best unites cool melodies and compelling lyrics. But in this desolate if beautiful locale, the Floyd plays ponderous, predictable instrumentals that can't compete with contemporary efforts by Crimson or Yes, and two of these stodgy, interminable pieces make useless and unfunny references to murder in their titles. This is a slog fest musically with banal if well-shot visual poetry about volcanoes and ruins larded in. This obviously gave the makers of \\"Spinal Tap\\" grist for making fun of prog rock's prententious attempts to cathect to archetypal histories and energies while ironically making dull music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and Gentlemen - The NICK MASON BAND!!!","review":"Apparently, Pink Floyd should have renamed themselves the Nick Mason Band because the director was certainly infatuated with the drummer!!! Occasionally we get a passing glance (and I mean \\"passing\\", because the camera moves right past them) at Gilmour, Waters, and Wright(about all we see of Wright is an extreme close up of his hands in the closing part of \\"Echoes\\"). This was frustating, because the Meddle album was one of my favorites. Except for a brief Dark Side of the Moon session, this baby is for friends of the director only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am a Pink Floyd fan. There are at least three phases to PF's evolution. This DVD focuses mostly on the earliest phase and my least favorite. I enjoy the latter two phases and the tail-end of the first phase. This DVD is not \\"live\\" in the sense of live music -- some of it is recorded outdoors and \\"live\\", but a real stretch of the term. If you are used to productions like PULSE, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are used to watching some poor VHS transfers of concerts, this is an improvement. To make it look better, though, many \\"modern day\\" items are mixed in. Having listened to PF albums hundreds of times, I was really disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent Waste of Time","review":"This DVD would be good for real hard core fans for historical purposes. It is not a concert. Most of it is filmed in the studio while workinjg on an album. The guys don't know what to do or say. You see them smoking cigarettes and eating. A total diappointment to me. A rip off if you expect music."},{"rating":"1","title":"done peaking yet?","review":"Look, I'm a Pink Floyd fan. But, all of you who thought the original was much better than the new cut, I've got news for you. That's because, when you watched the original in 1972, you were tripping. If the new one looks fake, that's because the original was fake, too. As more than one reviewer above pointed out, the music is studio-produced and put to footage of Floyd pretending to play. Guess what-that's true of most other \\"live\\" rock films, too. Nick's beard comes and goes because footage of Floyd lip-synching in Pompeii is intercut with blue-screen shots of them lip-synching on a sound stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"Being a large Pink Floyd fan, I went out and bought this dvd before renting it, that is the biggest mistake I ever made.I own all their other dvds, but this has hit in all time low in my whole dvd collection.First of all it is not even a concert (lame), it is a all day live recording in the ampitheater. The cut away images are realy stupid. There is no good guitar playing, just alot of noisey slide work. Mostly drums. Way to much high pitched noise. Most of the time it seemed as though were just trying to make as much noise as possible. In one song they even have a dog singing. This dvd does not sound anything like the Pink Floyd I love (including Syd). It is just a disgrace, echoes is the only half way decent thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live concert without audience","review":"Although the director's effort is fairly allright the DVD does not have certain features of a live show.1.No crowd at all (most important)2.Few tracks (dissapointing)Much appreciate if Amazon.com could add \\"Pink Floyd - Live in Venice\\" DVD into the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I wish we could return this DVD.

Very artistic and well made. However, in this new version they have added video and photographs in places that interfere with the whole feel of the show. The slow zooms in and out at the beginning and end of the film are interrupted with added clips of space scenes. There is even some computer animation thrown in somewhere of what appears to be a model of what Pompeii may have looked like before its destruction. While all this is fine and dandy, I think they ruined the whole feel of the film by trying to modernize it. Masterpieces should be left alone! Buy the original, not the \\"Director's Cut\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Movies for the Price of One","review":"One evening in 1973 I was watching reruns of 'Night Gallery' on my 10 inch black and white TV and I began flipping channels during the commercial to see what else was on. On PBS I couldn't believe what I was seeing, PINK FLOYD! I looked at the TV Guide and saw it Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii. Needless to say, I did not go back to my other show and I looked in vain for years for a repeat of the show. Well, now it is on DVD in color on my big screen TV and is an instant nostalgia device. One thing I don't understand though is why everyone complains about the director's cut. I agree that it isn't necessary since it detracts from the power of the original which launches right into the music without the 'fan club sentimentalities' and dressings of the director's cut. But BOTH VERSIONS are on the disk, so watch the ORIGINAL CONCERT MOVIE first if you just want the simple truth and later watch the DIRECTOR'S CUT if you want more, but please don't whine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words Cannot Express","review":"So happy to have seen this. I write for a living but, for me, the experience of seeing Pink Floyd create is beyond words. Those of you who have similar experiences will know that I mean I listened and looked in awe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie of Pink Floyd at their peak","review":"I'll keep this review short as many have already expressed the incredible historical content of the group and this fabulous movie. The segment/song \\"Echoes\\" is worth buying alone, as the lead part is not recorded for the CD/record and only exists in this movie. It's an amazing lead guitar part that must be heard and seen to really enjoy. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright are interviewed and express their emotions and insight on writing or approaching their song writing.The best part is a small glimpse into the pre-Dark Side of The Moon synth-music that Roger showcases in this movie.This is a perfect \\"10\\" out of 5 stars! Enjoy this wonderful movie and event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Firstly, given the scope and breadth of the Floyd's highly touted aural experience, why even bother to rerelease this without doing in 5.1. It's the industry standard, particularly among the classic-rock behemoth bands that are still actively making tons of money. Take the time and care and get it done. There's only one audio option and it sounds flat and bassy..The director's interview only scratches the surface of the process of filmmaking and how this shoot came to be. A commentary track would have been nice. And the subtitles only cover the interview banter and not the song lyrics, And I wasn't blown away by Maben's added footage. They are visually inconsistent, out of context and wholly detractory from the original atmosphere set by the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DONT UNDERSTAND THE HIGH PRAISE OF OTHERS","review":"Nobody loves Pink Floyd more than I do. But to me this is one of those I might like to see on MTV or HBO once a year or so. Wish I would have saved my money. I was prepared to sit back and watch a live concert of sorts I guess. I used to watch my old Distant Thunder (VHS) over and over again, but since I dont have VHS anymore and cant seem to find it on DVD, I guess Im out of luck. I really miss that one. Anyway, this DVD Live at Pompeii, was just OK for me. It was interesting to see the band members in their younger years behind the scenes. But I dont care to really add this one to my DVD collection because it will only collect dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pompeya, excelente","review":"Este DVD es simplemente excelente a pesar que algunos critican la inclusión de nuevas escenas.

The original release of Pink Floyd At Pompeii is amazing. Legendary. What's been done in the name of a \\"Director's Cut\\" is nothing short of blasphemy. Lousy, pointless 80's style graphics and some innocuous interview material that should have been added as an extra - not part of the movie. (In the original release there were some behind-the-scenes footage of the band recording Dark Side Of The Moon --- that material worked well in the context of the film.) Oh and don't even get me started about the cropping of the material from 1.33:1 to 16:9. Just Plain Awful!If the original cut had been released I would have given it FIVE stars - even with 2.0 sound. To make matters worse, the description makes it sound as though the original release is included as an extra but it's not the original release - just the original 'concert' footage.

The singular important point is that Floyd was not quite yet Floyd...until Meddle was released. Insights and historical notes are tremendously interesting to we fans. Meddle was my first exposure to The Floyd, prior to the fantastic \\"theme\\" album, Dark Side. Meddle shows their range, and what Floyd really is. Gilmour and Roger Waters, though estranged, are still out there doing fantastic shows all over the planet.

I love them both actually with the scale tilting towards, \\"The director's cut\\". It breaks up the drone and adds some spice. In Pink Floyd history, this is basically it for that era. To add is to delight! A \\"Then & Later\\" (so to speak.) Plus the history itself of Pompeii as a historical place, crumbling as time goes on, is an added attraction. In the world of Pink Floyd, as with the newly released Immersion sets, more is simply better.

It was ill paced, and under researched. It goes back and forth between Anne's diary and Elisabeth during her first year as Queen. Anne's diary is just boring and for anyone who has read another book on Queen Anne, you have a hard time picturing her actually writing or thinking these things. As for Elisabeth's part it's very sloppy and just no fun to read. I would recommend \\"A murder most royal\\" as a better read on Anne. Also, Robin Maxwell's other book on Anne's early life in France \\"Mademoiselle Boleyn\\" is such a better book that I can't believe that it's the same author or about the same subject.

This novel, which portrays itself as the long hidden journal of Anne Boleyn, tracing her from her early years at court, through her tumultuous years as Henry's virgin mistress, to her tragic years as his queen until days before her death. Quite a lot of the story seems to be based on historic facts (though I don't claim to have studied the period, and could have been deceived by this well-written, acurate sounding fiction).Not only is Anne's story compelling, as told through her diary entries, but we are reading along with her daughter Queen Elizabeth during the early years of her reign. We witness Elizabeth's shifting attitude toward her mother as she gains insight into her life through the journal. The novel does as much to illuminate Elizabeth's character as it does to illustrate Anne's.I really enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise that fails to deliver","review":"Even though the author claims to be a student of Tudor England's history, the book's many inaccuracies and her portrayal of Anne lead me to believe that her knowledge of this era is, at best, superficial.The novel is only romance pulp disquised as historical fiction. Mildly entertaining and not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"The back cover copy does not do this book justice--it is NOT the trashy romance novel described. Instead it is a powerful novel that acts first as a biography of Anne Boleyn, and secondly, a portrait of how Elizabeth I might have come to terms with her mother's life and death. Don't read this book if you want a textbook interpretation of Tudor England. But if you've always wondered if or how Elizabeth was influenced by her mother's life and death, read this book for a very interesting interpretation! I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressed","review":"This was a selection for my book club, and it was a struggle to read it. It was a bodice-ripper cleverly disguised as historical fiction, and tended to bog down in places with too much information about the activities of too many characters, without any background information regarding their motivations. There are other fictional books on the same subject that do a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Suffering Bodice-ripper","review":"Historical fiction this is not. Historical fiction comes from folks like Mary Renault, in my opinion. But if your definition of historical fiction includes romance novel authors such as diana gabaldon, then perhaps, this, too is historical fiction. These days the label \\"historical fiction\\" seems to be tossed about to enhance the dignity of low-brow sex-thrillers. This is a syrupy fantasy novel that falls flat even in the romantic sequences that are the focus of the book. Wooden characters and equally stiff interactions. Yes, this is a harsh criticism and it's my true appraisal of the book. Without negative or luke-warm reviews such as this and others here, we'd have a collection of 5-star reviews where apparently every book on Amazon was \\"the best I've ever read!\\" Not too informative, eh? I read these reviews before I purchase books or check-out from library. Hence, it's nice to see honest critiques of books as opposed to hyberbole. My recommendation is to skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I love fiction and nonfiction books about Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, and their century. But this was a real disappointment. It didn't offer any new understanding of the time period or of Elizabeth or Anne's characters. The love scenes were awkward and embarrasing. They seemed gratuitous and out of place. Thank goodness there are other good books about this period out there. Check out Alison Weir, Reay Tannahill or Patricia Finney for good books set in 16th century England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing bodice-ripper lacks Fabio on the cover","review":"This poor book has a wonderful premise but it turns out to be standard romance pulp. The author seems unable to discard a single notecard so the research ends up sounding like a termpaper for \\"Intro to Tudor England.\\" The characters are flat, save for perky alabaster bosoms everywhere you turn. Anne Boleyn's diary is totally unconvincing with its polished 2000 word entries, pages of perfectly remembered dialog, and a prescience that would put Nostradamus into a jealous funk. Elizabeth rides around saving England and the Reformation and setting her older and wiser advisors straight like Batgirl bailing out Gotham and bawling out Commissioner Gordon. Barbara Cartland has done this kind of stuff hundreds of times without the phony erudition."},{"rating":"1","title":"not to good","review":"this book goes from elizabeth I to Anne Boleyn's life. It was an ok book but doesn't tell a lot of either. I wouldn't recommend this book for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"A good mix of history and fiction. Very enjoyable - would recommend for over 13 years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but I had to wonder....","review":"I loved this book. It was well written and a very enjoyable read. It truly brought the characters to life, and left me feeling quite intimate with these royal women who lived over 3 cencuries ago. Another thing I appreciated about the book was that unlike many period novels, the author did not dwell on uneccesary details about the food the characters ate or the clothing they wore. The only complaint I would have about it (and this is to no fault of the book or the author really) is that since I do not know the true historical details of the period I finished the book desperately wanting to know what was fact and what was fiction. I highly recommend it, but be prepared to wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible and disappointing","review":"As stated in my title, this book was absolutely horrible and disappointing. I can't say much for the factual accuracy of events, however, the style of writing of this book was an injustice to the subject matteres of Queen Elizabeth and Anne Boyeln. Myself and other avid readers agreed that the book was confusing on referencing the past or the present. This book also had the same stylistics of trashy romance novels, quickly put together for a fast sale. Some of the passionate references were irrelevant to establishing the mood or characters. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the reviews first.","review":"Painful said it all. I got to page four and quit - sorely disappointed. I am becoming an addict for the royals, actually biographies in general. And I enjoy a story-telling as much as anyone else. But it was unnecessary to promote gratuitous sex, and more especially to do so at such an early turn. I was looking forward to reading the book after I had read that the writer had spent twelve years researching, etc. Those years and that effort cannot be recovered: the product sadly doesn't reflect the real cost of the author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominal","review":"This book is outrageous and not in a good way. I put it down only just a way into the second chapter. I found [certain] scenes offensive and totally unescessary. I don't recommend this to anyone at all. ...

The characters are shallow and repetitive - how many times did she work in Anne Boleyn's sixth finger?!

Someone else should write what this book could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"History\\" in a Harlequin Romance format","review":"If Barbara Cartland is your idea of a great novelist, please, buy this book. All other individuals with any vague knowledge of the Tudor family will find this book painful. It reeks of bad dime-store romance prose. Search for a history book instead. ANY history book on the Tudors will suffice. It will be far more interesting and much less irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a great fan of this period of history and a great admirer of Anne, but this book does not live up to it's promise. It is a fair enough read, but towards the end I found the endless angst a little grinding. I also found the ending and the way it attempts to relate to Elizabeth's reign quite unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly flat for a book focused on sex and religion","review":"This book is a very traditional treatment of Tudor history. No social context, no real understanding of the politics or restraints women like Anne lived within. The author makes Anne the central figure -- the reformation in England occurs at her instigation. While trying to correct the traditional oversight of female figures in Tudor history, the author overcompensates by making Anne the absolute center. While this is a diary, and such a focus is therefore understandable, the book does not read as such, but as a flat recounting of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book","review":"This is a great book. It is professionally translated and the words flow naturally. The introduction is powerful and it has a lot of useful information about the book content and the spiritual life of Rumi. The illustrations are carefully chosen and relevantly placed giving you a persian medeivial aura. Rumi was a great sufi poet who lived in the golden age of the Islamic civilization. His poetry is a guide to spirituality and wisdom. It is deep,simply-written and interesting. Anyone who reads this book will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul's Poetry","review":"The Sufis understand the human heart to be the macrocosm, not just the microcosm, of the universe. Whatever is in your heart is everywhere. If you have anger in your heart, you will experience anger from others, if hate, you shall be hated; if love, you shall be loved. By knowing the mystery of your own heart, you begin to resonate with the mysteries of existence.A beautiful book of word, image and revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete guide to sporting collectibles","review":"First of all the word complete does not belong on the cover of this book. I think that this book is a perfect example of someone trying to do everything but ends up not doing anything well. There are books dedicated to subjects such as guns, knives and decoys, which could have been left out of this book. I think chapter 14 is a good example this chapter tries to cover cartridges, shotshells,and powder cans and kegs. There no descriptions, or pictures and it barely touches on each subject. If i had to describe this book in one word it would be disappointing, I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not fit 12\\" PowerBook G4","review":"The housing that comes with the unit is made of plastic instead of the original metal housing.

The book refers the reader to the Microsoft DDK for software help. A major portion of the book also lists commercially available PC cards and the drivers for them, but this is of little use to someone trying to design PC Card software.

The first Like Mike was an enjoyable movie. My 11 year old nephew rents movies when visiting and he lost interest in the movie halfway through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets Behind A Small Town","review":"King's Row starts off with a view of a sign that announces that the town of King's Row is a great place to live and have a family. The rest of the movie shows you just how untrue that sign was. The film turns the romantic view of life in a small town upside down, exposing a lot of vices and prejudices. The performances are a mixed bag. Ann Sheridan gives one of her best performances as the girl from the wrong side of the tracks (literally), and Ronald Reagan surprises with an effective job as the victim of a sadistic doctor. But Robert Cummings is sometimes laughable as the very idealistic young doctor and Betty Field is over the top as his troubled girlfriend. The supporting cast is generally fine, with an especially fine performance by Nancy Coleman, who should have become a star but didn't. The movie is both dramatic and entertaining, and if you like stories about small towns like I do, then don't miss this one. It's an eye-opener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Drama","review":"My husband saw this movie before I did and was so intrigued by it that I couldn't pass it up. Ronald Reagan at his best. This isn't a typical black & white that puts you to sleep. You'll be on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"creaky soap opera","review":"Maybe Vincent Minnelli could have helped this movie. At least he would have given the movie some style, and energy. The first half of the movie is similar to GREAT EXPECTATIONS, though David Lean's movie is a lot better. The first half drags; the second half is a bit better.The cast, especially Ronald Reagan, seems even more out of place than James Cagney in THE OKLAHOMA KID. The acting brings to mind the deliberately bad acting for the silent movie scenes in SINGING IN THE RAIN.And then there's the same bit of music played through out the movie. And the characters give high minded speeches or talk in flowery nonsense, or say \\"get a hold of yourself, kid\\" for victorian times.william cameron menzies worked on this and GONE WITH THE WIND---a couple minutes of exteriors in the first half seem like GONE WITH THE WIND shots.It's nice that small town, olde time, america is shown as a sham, but it's not enough to make this movie work."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll want to watch it over and over...","review":"After watching this movie, I had to go find my husband.He asked, \\"was the movie good?\\" and then glanced at my face and said, \\"the movie was very good!\\" I don't know if it was the smile or the tears that gave him the clue, but what a super way to spend the evening! Ronald Reagan was one sexy guy, and the story really hit home that even in 1900, even in small town America, suicide, murder, sadistic doctors, scandalous women, overbearing fathers, and financial woes existed. Definitely not a light love story as the cover would make you believe.By the way, don't blink... Natalie Wood is there for a quiet moment near the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a warm pink.","review":"There just didn't seem to be any substance to this story. Neither character had any idea of what romance is and after skimming through the first few \\"erotic\\" scenes with a yawn. I didn't feel any emotion or depth to Chloe and Rocco's love scenes. The whole story revolved around sex and that definitely wasn't enough to save the nonexistent plot. The climax just never seemed to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Pink","review":"terrible !!!!!!!!! this book was based on sex and more meaningless sex ... it had no story line , no romance just hot steamy sex .. the heroine just slept around , while the hero chased her like a dog in heat ... sorry but it was like reading porno ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Pink","review":"I love everything that Susan Johnson has wrote & if you like erotic romance you will too!

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid","review":"After reading several of Susan Johnson's previous books, I find it hard to believe she wrote this one. The writing is TERRIBLE. The sex scenes are flat but she uses all the course words and the dialog is just painful. At one point, the guy (named Rocco of all things) wonders what his girl is doing. Susan Johnson actually writes \\"Here's what happened...\\" I have read college papers that were better than this book!!! Please save your money and by something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frigid Pink...","review":"I so did not feel this novel. Hot Pink fizzles out before the heat even begins. Character and story development are wooden, the dialogue is corny, the romance is absent and the so-called erotic scenes lack realism and depth. Chloe and Rocco are two of the most annoying protagonists ever written. It would've been interesting and steamy to read about the relationship between an eccentric, pink-haired graphic designer and her engaged lover, but the story falls short in so many levels. Rocco's relationship with his fiancee is ridiculous. I marveled at the aforementioned subplot's banality. This novel should've been titled Frigid Pink. Susan Johnson should stick to writing historical romance novels. I strongly suggest you skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Hot!","review":"Just finished reading this novel. I am a great Susan Johnson fan and this was a new type of contemporary novel for Johnson. It was extremely hot! Extremely Steamy! And funny. It was a different change for Johnson and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2* Cool off","review":"Susan Johnson's sophomore take on chick literature turns out disappointingly cliche with a lack of emotional core in both of her protagonists, web-designer Chloe Chisolm and aspiring entrepreneur Rocco Vinelli. Johnson's trademark sensual scenes burn and smolder but do not quite attain the erotic virtuosity as in her historical novels like Sinful and Brazen. Chloe, along with her friends, ponder whether their happy ending exists when relationships go turbulent. The most devastating of all is when Chloe had a one-night stand with Rocco and discovers later that he is \\"engaged\\" to a malicious, wilful brat Amy whose father is the determining factor to his success in his nascent business operations. Clearly unfocused, Johnson adds in dramatic antics and a new lover boy to spice things up. Unfortunately, Hot Pink doesn't live up to its hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.. thats all I can say....","review":"Okay, so I read reviews of the book and how it wasn't her usual flair of erotic and plot book. But I just couldn't listen... I got the book and THEY WERE RIGHT!!!!!!!!! There was like two sex scenes that were okay and thats putting it mildly. The plot completely stunk. If you like the author, then by all means, get the book and add it to your collection. However, if you want a good book with a good plot mixed with eroticism look at her earlier books. For example, Outlaw, Tempting, Sinful, Siezed by love, Pure Sin, Brazen, Wicked or Taboo. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fangoria - Hombres!","review":"This is a great CD.

I think not.","review":"This was a tedious and frustrating read. Bradshaw's arguments were poorly developed and poorly supported (if at all).Aside from a plethora of statements that made the reader wonder what version of the Bible he was using, Bradshaw presented a concept of missions that left God in the background. If his ideas were the standard, missions would be nothing more than a cross cultural relief effort carried out by an elite few with a highly specific education in conducting foreign relations and interpreting cultural narratives. This is not missions. Missions is about God working his power through ordinary, broken people to show his love and his truth to people of all nations regardless of cultural barriers. God is the change agent and people are one medium through which change occurs, not the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movies","review":"I am an old movie buff, will not watch anything rated above a PG rating,I love collecting the oldies, have favorite leading stars, Doris Day, Cary Grant, Debbie Reynolds, James Garner, Gary Cooper (the collection now offered does not have of my favorite movies.)

In their place are useful and fun diagrams, storylines, interesting examples and even some dry humor (which I rather enjoyed).I'm not a stranger to design patterns, but reading this book was both entertaining and informative (I learned a thing or two).

I think the best take away with this book is noticing when to use a particular pattern and then referencing the Gang of Four book as a catalog. I like that they caution the reader to make sure that not everything looks like a design pattern after reading this book (Typical hammer scenario, where everything looks like a nail).

Lot of examples which has used in the real life. so that easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid book for stupid people.","review":"This is by far the most stupid book ever written on the subject of design patterns. If you enjoyed this book, or if you found its style to be useful in learning, then you have no right working in the software development field. This book is written by dummies for dummies. Period!Sure, you may learn a few things about design patterns, but you did it using child like learning methods. That should raise some red flags about your ability to understand complex technical subjects like a grown adult. If you cannot learn from real sources, then please, please, please, stay away from any sort of programming career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, complete satisfaction","review":"For me, this is better than the Go4.Easy to understand, this is what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, exasperating","review":"Indeed, repetition and elaboration are the two pillars for memorizing. But distraction is not. Silly, unhelpful graphics, the obsession with pizza and coffee, the pre-teen jokes, and not least all the spelling errors just distract too much.All I could think of during the first one hundred pages, before I gave up, was \\"GET ON WITH IT!\\" Did the repetition at least help me memorize the first patterns? No. But I now know there is a difference between Chicago and NY pizzas.Already had the Design Patterns book by the Gang-of-four and was hoping this tome might indeed help call up the necessary patterns during programming, but I'll just go through the GoF book again.Two stars for trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense Patterns","review":"An excellent common sense view of practical patterns for programming.

This is why started buying head-first books! I'm also going to start searching by the authors for more of their work! I had been programming for about 7 years and this book gave me some great new ideas. Perfect book for teaching old dogs new tricks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid oriented","review":"This book is oriented for pre-teenagers. It explains in 10 pages a subject which content could fit in a single page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish, obtuse, and 10x longer than it needed to be.","review":"This book contains so many comics, cartoonish diagrams, and lame jokes it's impossible to learn from it efficiently.The highly acclaimed \\"Design Patterns\\" by Gamma et al is only half as long and three times more informative.I suppose I would still recommend Head First to someone who was taking a programming course involuntarily and would rather be watching MTV, but not to someone with an actual need for knowledge in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice for professional developers","review":"At first I was digging this book, towards the middle I ripped it up into shreads (just like the OOA/D book by head first) and threw it away. As a matter of fact, it's sitting in my trash can as I'm writing this. If you're looking for a book explaining design patterns, like many of the cartoons within it, this book's a joke. They could have reduced this book to a fifth of it's size. Instead, you get a load of childish and repetitive fluff. You'll feel like you're getting introduced to design patterns by the dumb jocks who used to beat you up in high school. For goodness sake, we're software engineers not cheerleaders. People, get a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"I bought the book on the strength of the Amazon reviews.Unfortunately, the book is written to the level of a child ... or perhaps to someone who has ADHD. I found the style very tedious, pompous, and excessively expressive.This is quite possible the worst book I've ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronising, but readable","review":"This book is a bit of a mixed bag; there are some good examples in it and it is easy to understand, but you do have to wade through a huge amount of rubbish to find the useful information. I'd say that about 80% of this book is filler and you can skip it, the problem with that of course is that you get into the habit of skipping so much that you might end up missing the few things of value. The exercises are very very basic, so if you have been programming for any length of time you will find them quite insulting. Actually I found most of the book quite insulting.It is very java centric, so they make quite a lot of reference to the java api, but if you know another OO language well this isn't really a problem. For all my griping I would say that it is worth a look if you don't know anything about design patterns because pretty quickly you will get the idea that most of \\"design patterns\\" is about stating the obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"As another reviewer put it: \\"tedious\\"","review":"If you enjoy being treated like a 5 year old, you'll love this book. They take 50 pages of goofy cartoons and scenarios to demonstrate patterns that could be explained in 10 pages. I kept thinking to myself, \\"Get to the point!\\" It's like that windbag professor you had in college who taught to the lowest common denominator of the class.It also would have been nice if they had code examples in languages other than Java. I'd love to see how functional programming could use the patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely efficient","review":"Fast delivery... actually shorter (1 week) then 'standard' delivery time (3-5 weeks)came in as good as a brand new book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely a first step","review":"This is great book very easy to understand, besides, it's only suitable for starters because it just have a small collection of the most common patterns.Once you had read it, you'll have to research other sources of information, for deep knowledge and for more patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Never thought I would understand design patterns until I read this book. This book does an excellent job explaining a difficult topic with language that most people understand. I tried to read two other patterns book prior to this one. However, I never finished them. I even had to take a DP class at my university; it was required for the CS program there. I still didn't fully understood DP after the semester. With this HF book, I'd say that I now understand DP and OO concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for those wanting to learn Design Patterns","review":"I believe this book is a must have for those people that are new to Design Patterns or want to refresh themselves with the concepts of the most used Design Patterns. This book uses pictures and easy to understand terminology that helps you get a grasp of key concepts quickly, and retain them. This book is so much more fun to read and easier to understand than some of the other books out there on the topic. Give this book a chance. I think you'll be happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book number 1 on design patterns","review":"I use to stay away from design patterns due to the confusions they brought with overlapping between different patterns. Big kudos to authors for writing such a wonderful book. They make learning design patterns so simple yet brilliant.I am big fan of Head First books and this one stands rank 1 even among Head First books. For other topics, you can read other books and understand the concepts. But, none of the other books on design patterns was able to entice me towards design patterns.If you are planning to read GOF / Core J2EE book, this is a must-read book to read before GOF and Core J2EE."},{"rating":"2","title":"design patterns explained -- really!","review":"The introduction says you need to know java (or at least C#) to get the most out of this book. That may be, but I found the explanations perfectly understandable, even though I do not know any java or C#. Before, I read the original design patterns book by the gang of four, but I got 10 times more out of \\"Head First Design Patterns\\". Actually, the book introduction includes a hand-written note from the marketing department that the book is for ANYONE with a credit card -- the marketing department is more on the money. I think this book is for anyone with a credit card who wants to put design patterns to work, whether they know java, C# or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Doesn't Work on the Kindle","review":"You'd think something dubbed \\"Kindle Edition\\" would work on a Kindle? Guess again.

Go get this book and you'll see how easy can it be. I loved how funky (even childish?) this book was. Examples are great and not too small or too large and are easy to remember.The only downside is that I read pre-generics version, it would be nice to have generified design patterns from those authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and Understandable","review":"This is a book that I recommend to all of the software developers I work with, it is so much more than the gang of 4, it is actually readable. The unique format used to address the topics helps with retention and understandability. The only complaint that I would have about the book, and the reason I gave it 4 stars, is that the examples used are impractical and sometimes silly. The authors also could have alluded more to the usages of algorithms and efficiency of code."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for writers of the period or people wanting a source","review":"This book is just what it says, a listing of Scottish Historical Documents starting with Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the early 8th Century and moving up to 1707 with the Articles of Union. All Major Documents are included, such as the Letter of Barons of Scotland to Pope John XXII in 1320 - known more commonly as the Declaration of Arbroath, to even the lesser known Statues of Iona in 1609.Over 240 documents are dealt with, from all aspects of Scots' History, covering education, settles of succession, the poor acts, Kirk matters, land tenure, crown rentals, and constitutional changes. Note are kept brief.So people wanting to know more of Scotland's history and without access to ancient documents, or writers of Scottish fiction, this book is a MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply superb book of 19th Century African Exploration !","review":"Samuel White Baker is perhaps overlooked in the modern age but in his time he was famous for his big game hunting and African exploration.

Well I bought this Etymotic ER22 based on the reviews here on Amazon. It was a disappointment. I tried the different earpieces and never could find one that worked well. The microphone portion of the unit kept rotating down and away from my face. It is also difficult to see where the microphone is in relationship to your mouth without looking in a mirror. Mic placement is critical with this unit. A longer boom for the microphone and a headband or ear hook might be good additions to this unit. The sound was just ok. The included assortment of earpieces was a nice touch but alas I can only give this unit two stars. I bought a Plantronics M175C to replace the ER22 which has much better sound both sending and receiving. Anybody interested in a slightly use ER22? ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly designed product","review":"The headset comes with various size \\"eartips.\\" After trial and error, one can find an eartip that fits. However, the eartip does not support the weight of the microphone which extends towards your mouth. After a few minutes, the microphone is dangling by the side of your neck instead of being near your mouth so people can hear you speak. I used to have a Shure QuietSpot headset that had an earhook which supported the headset by a loop gently arching over one's ear. The Etymotic headset lacks this supporting feature and the microphone drops away from one's mouth. If the microphone would stay in place, this would be an excellent product, as the sound quality is superb. Until the product is redesigned, I do NOT recommend this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREEPY CREEPY CREEPY!","review":"Terry O'Quinn is super creepy as Doctor/DAD.

Poor workmanship & assembly control are very evident by a cursory examination. The concept is great, the executation is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This album is literally unlistenable, consisting of Casio-like synthesizers and drum machines drowning out Sarah's voice in a relentless cacophany. Her songs can barely be recognized under all the synth.At least in the case of artists such as the Chemical Brothers we get compelling industrial beats. This album sounds like it was put together one night by bored sound engineers. This is simply the worst album I own -I'm surprised I haven't thrown it out. Maybe I will try to sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Sarah McLachlan CD","review":"This is a good one to buy if you have never owned a Sarah McLachlan CD. Good mix of songs, all remixed with a beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Sarah McLachlan","review":"Having been fan of Sarah's in the late 90's - 2001, including Mirrorball, I eagerly awaited a new album. I bought mine on eBay for eight bucks and then paid too much. This album is NOT Sarah we came to love. You cannot add a drum beat to City of Angels. Ridiculous! This album is nothing more than a cheap trick that smears her own work and appeases her existing fans awaiting new work. Sarah, why did you ruin your existing legacy. Incredible disappointment ... I will definately NOT be buying any more of her albums if she's going to try cheap shoddy marketing like this. Sarah was great while she lasted, I guess.My #1 female vocalist is now Aimee Mann, who doesn't pretend she is what she isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed? or trashed","review":"The sample tracks do not do justice to how bad this \\"remix\\" really is. Take great singing and compositions then add techno crap and you get this album. A one star only because no star is offered. It is hard to believe that her label allowed this thing to see the light of day. My favorite Sara song is Angel but it will now take some time to purge this horrible version out of my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Slow","review":"Most of these songs are not even remotely techno or electronica. They are just boring songs with a slightly less boring beat. I literally thought that I was going to fall asleep and drive off the road when I put this CD into the player. These songs would be great if you just want to relax on a rainy day while you read a book. They sound more like MUZAK than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I had heard a few remixes of McLauchlans songs and for the most part enjoyed them (Rabit in the Moon, etc.) but some of these are just perfect!I've listened to this CD so many times I know every click of every rimshot and every high hat by heart, the remix of Black still gives me chills. These are masterfully done remixes of already incredible songs.Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome album - but still waiting","review":"I was searching for something new by Sarah McLachlan, and this was the only new album I could find, so I bought it. Although I am a bit tired of remixes from Sarah, this album really is great. The tracks are different enough from other remix versions of her songs to keep the album from getting too redundant, and tracks like #7 \\"Black\\" remixed by William Orbit are truly innovative and exciting. The album proves, like \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstacy\\" that Sarah's etherial voice belongs with beats and electronic music (\\"Surfacing\\" was way too boring for my taste). Where's the new material? A die hard fan wants to know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No justice","review":"I must admit, this CD was a tiring. I found myself constantly skipping through the tracks to get to the few good areas. I am not one fond of remixes because they always mutilate the songs and do them no justice. This CD was no exception, I am sorry to say. The only way you could tell they were actually Sarah McLachlan's songs was by recognition of the lyrics and her voice. Almost all of the original melodies are gone.To those fond of heavy, pounding, repetitive club beats, this will be a good album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely does Sarah Mclachlan music injustice","review":"I like Sarah and I like techno & dance, but the mixes on this are really BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Live My Life to 168 bpm Anymore","review":"Oy - I'm getting too old for remixed dance music. This disk seemed like a good idea (I purchased the import version about 2+ yrs ago)at the time.Some of the stuff is good - but nothing is outstanding. But any subtlety or nuance that McLachlan uses in her standard releases is gone w/these mixes (and isn't that true of most all dance/remix/electronic music?).My biggest complaint is that McLachlan (or more likely her record company) reissues her music in multi-formats (remixed or acoustic singles, 100s of compliations or soundtracks)almost ad nauseum.I guess the company has to make a buck when it's 6-7 yrs between original material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"With the exception of BT's Hold On Remix, this is a great CD. The mood of the tracks keep true to the originals, while still adding quality trance. Sweet Surrender, Black, and Silence stand out. If you like trance, this CD will please. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 is that I would like to see more experimentation with the mixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Mclachlan has found a new audience!","review":"I think a lot of people bought this album because Ms. McLachlan has not yet released anything new or want to attain a copy of Silence. Silence is a great song for Ms. McLachlan....but the real jewel of this album is Sweet Surrender. It compliments Sarah's voice and retains the dark emotion of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive...","review":"I just bought this CD and was expecting something brilliant, and it is just that. For anyone enjoying trance or softer electronic music, this CD is beautiful to your ears. With, of course, DJ Tiesto's mix of \\"Silence\\" and a personal favourite of \\"I Love You (BT Mix)\\" Definitely a recommended purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet ANOTHER filler album","review":"Since Sarah McLachlan hasn't released any new material since 1997's \\"Surfacing\\", I suppose her record company felt the need to once again release a filler album in an attempt to satisfy McLachlan fans who are craving new material. Now that Sarah has recently had a baby, I don't expect any new material from her until about 2003. Anyway, \\"Remixed\\" just doesn't cut it for this longtime Sarah fan. We've heard these songs one million times before and these remixes don't breathe any new life into them. The only ones I like are \\"Angel\\" and \\"Hold On\\" but the rest are silly and far too long. Unless you love dance music (which isn't music to begin with) try Sarah's \\"Remixed\\" album. I think I'll stick with \\"Solace\\" and \\"Surfacing\\" until she releases something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy the thing","review":"Great album. Buy it. If you like Sarah's music, this is a fantastic album to compliment the others in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I guess if you are an unconditional fan, this is OK, but I found the remix VERY boring. It all starts right, the beats are kind of cool, but it feels like the song never really takes off. There is a lot of momentum but nothing really happens.I kept waiting and waiting to get better, and never really did it.Some remixes like in Possession, totally destroyed the mood of the song. I couldn't stand the \\"close your eyes\\" being repeated over 30 times in the same music. If this CD was $5, I would still not buy it. I guess you either like it a lot or not at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"drum machine galore","review":"Unfortunately, these remixes add no value to the originals.I like House genre (I even own Hybrid's \\"Wide Angle\\" and DJ Tiesto's \\"In my memory\\") but fancy synthesizer tricks don't necessarily add value.The only one that does is the Sanctuary Mix for \\"Silence\\" which was raved on about and for very good reason - it transformed the original and enhanced it way beyond it's initial uninspiring form, however, it is not on this CD. [The Sanctuary Mix was the only CD-Single I ever bought.]I see no evidence remixing has gone beyond filling-up a CD-Single."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!!!","review":"the song Barricades on this cd is AWESOME! i love that song, musically and lyrically its grand also World Dominator is really good too its more ska. ok well anyway this cd is good in what you'd expect from AAA, but its also a good cd i think for Common Rider, this cd makes me really want to get more Common Rider but i'm just too lazy right now to make the decision of which cd i want to get first. but yea this is a good cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality filter","review":"I really like the quality of the K&N air filters. I have run one in my Chevy vans for years. I am not sure about how much more power you can get, but I am sure more air is getting to the engine. I bought this one for my wife's turbo new beetle, and it is the same construction as the others I have seen. I am sure it will do the job. The only downside is the cost of these things, but I guess you get what you pay for, and you never have to buy a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"K&N hasn't failed me yet!!","review":"What more can be said about oil filters vs. paper filters? Nothing!!

Now that I can agree with I have noticed a slight increase in my MPG.

It is both intelligently writen and layed out. Although, it's section on St. Petersburg is very short compaired to that of the section covering Moscow, it is to the point, and helpful. There are so many differint beautiful places in Moscow this book really helps when deciding where to go. The metro maps really come in handy since they are in english. The information is not influenced by advertisers, so you know you can count on the opinions of the authors. You can't always count on the prices listed though, since they change regulary and are are higher if you are not Russian.

Wow.... I never thought of that before.... flotation devices..... what a great idea.... Mmmmm orbs..... Okay, seriously, I did not enjoy Angel Links. The animation of this series is sub-par.

I mean if it was once or twice throughout the book, okay fine that is kind of cute. But the whole book and SERIES is the same. Horrible grammar on every page (i.e. runned around my room, I helded my head up...ect.)Not only the grammar but Junie B. is a total brat!!! She whines and cries until she gets what she wants.

I have never heard that many curse words used in so few pages - it would have done some thugs and delinquents proud. I have no idea why anyone would print so offensive a book. The characters are repulsive and I can't begin to guess why anyone should care if they are redeemed or not. It is crude and just plain awful so don't let the cute cover fool you.

(No matter how big my annual check was!)While the sisters started and stayed rather unlikeable quite far into the book, by the end they showed definite signs of becoming human. I thought Gamma Angel was great, though I did wonder what took her so long to put her foot (and pen) down.At least in fiction, there's hope that ANYONE can turn her life around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean","review":"This would be a great feeder if the grid could be removed for cleaning. I set this up in the backyard and in two weeks, there was mold growing in the corners.

They chewed through the plastic mesh and used it as a shelter from the rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like a good design at the time","review":"The squirrels not only beat this one by using their paws to reach the seeds, one of them chewed up the side, leaving shreds of plastic on the ground below."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squirrels love it","review":"The squirrels in my yard must be really smart, because they enjoy feasting in this. It is also difficult to fill, empty shells, and clean.

His voice is again powerful, and the songwriting is brilliant. Although not as consistent as \\"Love Is Hell, Part 1\\", part two gives us two of his best songs \\"English Girls Approximently\\" and \\"Hotel Chelsea Nights\\". The first being a poke at his relationship with singer Leona Naess, chronicles a break-up with a clever chorus that stays tongue in cheek. \\"Hotel Chelsea Nights\\" is a heavy look a living in a nyc hotel, the lyrics are overshadowed by the gutiar and keyboard that drone along accordingly, and the classic voice of marianne faithfull backing ryan creating the perfect harmonies. This is a keeper, although there is some filler, this a wonderful e.p, and a worthwhile addition to a young songwriters career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful treat","review":"It's a shame that this and Love is Hell Part One were released as afterthoughts by Lost Highway as they show a natural progression from Gold. What's more is that these EPs (and I think Love is Hell Pt2 in particular) show Adams maturing as a song writer. From the base of his talent evident in Gold, Adams is able to weave songs that hold their own and mesh well as an album. English Girls Approx. is one of the best songs I've heard in years. Unlike Rock N Roll, Adams doesn't wear his influences on his sleeves with this work, instead he branches out in his own direction creating some of the best music of the past five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Record label Foxtrot","review":"Record labels have always thought low of their own market, but never has it been so appalling as now. Seems Lost Highway didn't believe we were sophisticated or intelligent enough to appreciate Love is Hell so they slashed it in two; that way they can reliquish responsibility and still make a buck. A shame, because both EP's add up to the Ryan Adams masterpiece we've been waiting for, a brilliant addition to Sea Change, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, even After The Gold Rush. It's certainly better than Rock and Roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrical Vomit","review":"I grudgingly admit to being a Ryan Adams fan, but damn the man for sucking so bad. Heartbreaker was a work of genius but the fact is that his whole output since then has been on a downward trajectory. Rock N' Roll is garbage (not garage) but, hey, he just wrote it in five minutes right? Love is Hell was denied as an album for a reason. It stinks. The man needs to install some quality control. He has attached some half hearted lyrics to excrutiatingly boring tunes. To be fair, he has it in him to drop another gem like Heartbreaker, but his lack of discipline is killing him. (Apparently not, since every reviewer here seems to love him.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely gorgeous","review":"I wish everyone would put aside comments on Ryan Adams personality disorder and really listen to his records. A lot of people say horrible things about him and that's becuase they are afraid of being un-hip.The second volume of love is hell is Ryan's best work yet. In my opinion as beautiful, if not more so, than Heartbreaker. All the slight mistakes are left in tact as is his trademark. This is the best male vocal performance from a rock artist i have ever heard.Ryan here is at his absolute best. Infinitely sad and soaringly beautiful. His voice plunges into the music and becomes at times one with the piano and guitar which is surreal. Stand out tracks are My Blue Manhattan, I See Monsters, and English Girls Approximately. The picking,piano and lyrics are incredible.Don't miss this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The purpose of the temple","review":"I have only read sections of this book, but what I have read are excellent in their complete description of the Jewish temple. From the layout of the temple to the implements used, Edersheim fully explains why the temple was even needed and the ceremonies performed by the priests. I plan a return trip to the Holy Land in the Summer of 2001, and I will be bringing this book with me to read closer in my desire to fully understand this place. As we know, the conflict in Israel stems mainly from the holiness of this site, held by both Jews and Christians today."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like","review":"cannot find what I am looking for.

If you would like to see how important God's timing is.this book is for you. There are still appointed times such as the Sabbath that is a set day and appointed time to meet with God. There is so much, very deep and important things to learn and this book would be a great way to start learning how Deep God really is and how everything meant or represented something important to Our God."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Temple","review":"I echo the one thought of the first reviewer. Don't make the mistake I did of getting the cheaper used book. I truly thought I was getting the latest edition. Nope. This was the early edition with NO pictures. On top of that the writing style is antiquated. All of this has been improved in the 1997 edition with its numerous illustrations and updates on the archeology as well as modern english useage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Temple-Edersheim","review":"A scholarly and well-written book giving historical and Talmudic examples and proofs of customs, ministries, and services of the Temple during the Herodian era, i.e. the Temple used when Jesus lived. It is very informative. I really enjoyed it, but I found some of the customs recorded differently in other books written on the subject. But is a good summary. Other books may give more detailed histories and a more in-depth analogy to the fulfillments found in Jesus Christ. Still, I'm glad I have this book in my library. Good resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"About some of the most innocently racist stuff ever","review":"The guy is a committed academic in his desire to recreate the past for the purpose of informing the present, however every sentence falls further into the abyss of conjecture, innocently naive racism, and personal interpretation based on religious beliefs, both his and his personal ideas about turn of the millennium Judaism. He is a great read if you want ridiculously dated material on the social concepts that lead to passive (non-violent) racism. Don't rely on it for real facts, free of confusing personal interpretation.

There are many errors in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure for Stooge fans!","review":"This collection of short subject films and clips featuring pre-Columbia Stooges is a valueable piece of Sttooge history. We get to see the Stooges with Ted Healy, their co-founder and straight man. What makes this video interesting is that we get to see the origins of many of the Stooges' routines with lines delivered differently than expected. Bear in mind, this isn't the hardcore slapstick that became the boys' trademark ; it's watered down with song and dance segments, but for the true Stooge fan this is a terrific historical document."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"naked eye\\" is worth the whole cd!","review":"when i first heard \\"naked eye\\" i was in love with it!I spent 2 years obsessing over who sang it but when i got on amazon i found out who it was(even though i had never heard of them), i automatically bought the cd and there are 4 other tracks i like but the main one i love is \\"naked eye\\" so go out and buy this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Manny!","review":"Judging by the glowing comments already here, I suspect my review will get panned...... Here goes:This is the album where Luscious Jackson lost their hip-hop edge. The songs before were a little more funkdafied, a little more bass-heavy, a little more soulful. Fever In Fever out is a lot more radio friendly and palatable, and kind of bland in comparison to LJ's previous efforts.I am sure this is a fine album, but it is so much more poppy and over-produced than the last 2 albums that I hardly recognize the band.I miss \\"Natural Ingredients\\" and \\"In Search of Manny\\". Be sure you check out these other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Luscious!!!!","review":"This CD confirms for me that the 90s was probably the greatest decade for music in terms of freshness, creativity and just plain good music! Every song on this cd is good. Nice smooth vocal backdrops against creamy melodies and funked up rythmes. Surley Lucious Jackson have inspired many a female artist. Get this CD and chill out."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like fever out, fever out","review":"\\"Naked eye\\" was the only good song on this entire album. It's a different sound compared to most bands, but I couldn't adjust to their style of music. \\"Naked eye\\" sounded different than the rest of their songs on this album (unfortunately)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't no Gap ad...","review":"I sheepishly admit buying this CD on a whim after seeing Luscious Jackson in their Xmas Gap ad. I was expecting a squeaky-clean Go-Go's meets Jewel sound. But it is not that. It is much more mature, softer, more...vulnerable. They have a unique sound that I've not heard before. Funky, ethereal, slippery grooves that guide you from track to track. Great background music to slowly move your body to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry of Plano, Tx's review was dead on!","review":"I borrowed this CD from a friend, had no idea who LJ was, and immediately recognized their hit \\"Naked Eye.\\" After listening to that song over and over, I listened to the rest of the CD, and it's all wonderful. They're creative and inventive, interesting, and the music is delicious. It's now my favorite CD to listen to on Saturday mornings. I have to buy it now because my friend wants his CD back! You can't go wrong with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive, isn't it?","review":"If you own this album, you know. If you have heard the catchy \\"Naked Eye\\", you know. It's funny. Naked Eye hooked me to this album, but the rest of the songs meld together to create a unique and varied emotional atmosphere. What does that mean? It means you'll be grooving during \\"Naked Eye\\", amorous during \\"Electric\\", and mellow during \\"Take a Ride\\". I've had the cd for six years now and still find time to stick it into my rotation. For any athletic types, give it a spin during a workout (preferably on a walkman) and let it take your mind off the pain.I have a pretty wide range of musical tastes (ending before the train wrecks of boy bands and pop-country) and I consider this to be my favorite album of all time. Means a lot from a guy that usually listens to the three M's (Metallica, Motorhead, and Ministry). Just buy the album and give it a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"a delightful conclusion to the \\"Gemma\\" series","review":"In this charming book, Gemma, now a student at Headstone's drama school, is \\"lent\\" to Headstone University to play Juliet.

Two years ago he went on record as predicting DJIA 800 in the next five years, and DJIA 1500 within two years. The books to read by Prechter are his expositions on EWT, which are THE presentations of EWT. Rather like Granville for so many years, Prechter seems bent on crying \\"bear\\" until one shows up. Unless you are fond of hearing yet another theory on \\"Why the economy will collapse and trash the world's wealth,\\" skip this presentation by Mr. Prechter."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Aren't Many Books Like This One","review":"This book is really, really interesting. It was written by a man that had, to say the least, a very interesting life. Matt Warner's book is far from a \\"tell-all\\" but it is filled with the kind of detail that breathes life into the Old West as it really was. How do you REALLY get away from a posse? What is it like when the guns start firing? What were the hideouts like? We don't have many autobiographies of this kind and they should be read by all Old West enthusiasts for the real nuggets that they contain.

Those are nice concepts, perhaps, but not songs worthy of the price of this EP, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mess of noise.","review":"I like it, although I think it is just a mess of noise. He's not the most talented artist on the Digital Hardcore label, but he's still fun and this album is way more accessible then some of his other EPs and singles. He shows he has real potential on tracks like Sweat but on tracks like Punks your left wondering what the hell was that afterwards. New Kick is cool, sounds like a drugged out hippie singing but it's awesome. Some of the songs just sound like his drum machine is breaking down or exploding or something along with his sampler spitting out nonsense but there are some other really good songs too like the 60 second long Chill. Blow-Job is a highlight too. If you like noise, sex, violent beats and static buy it.

I thought a couple of the scenes were a little over the top. One of the story lines that impressed me was the integrity of John's character in keeping his sources confidential but also being such a sleeze when it came to getting a story. The other story line was the obsession that people have about their bodies as if their appearance was all that mattered and their heads could be full of fluff. I would recommend this movie to anyone for just pure entertainment also. If I wanted totally intellectual movies or programs then I would go and immerse myself in deep thoughts like the scarecrow.

No, not Oscar-caliber by any means, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours. Very much a product of its era (the 1980's), which is part of its appeal these days, a major flashback. If you're looking to relive the days of the Jane Fonda workout backed by the music of the Pointer Sisters, Dan Hartman, Berlin and a young (then yet unknown) Whitney Houston duetting with Jermaine Jackson, this is what you've been looking for. The plot is somewhat laughable (John Travolta as an ethically questionable Rolling Stone reporter in lust/love with aerobics instructor Jamie Lee Curtis, who is trying to hide a bit of a dicey past), but it's still a good time, what with the workout scenes and all the talk of promiscuous sex. Ignore the story for the most part and concentrate on the silliness that was the 1980's and you're in for a treat. Jamie Lee Curtis shines as always (and was in the best physical shape of her life).

It's hard to describe but I would say its a mix of Monty Python, Saturday Night Live and South Park. There is lots of dry English wit, puns, slapstick, obsurd and over the top characters and costumes, surprisingly good musical bits... If you aren't sure it's for you, check it out on the Adult Swim website before buying the set. But everyone I have shared it with has loved The Mighty Boosh."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the Martin Scorsese that I remember","review":"It is truly sad to see a great director like Scorsese stop being creative, try to imitate, and fail so miserably. I guess it started when Departed garnered him an academy award. There is nothing original about that movie, and the Hong Kong version which it was based upon is superior. That is just the way things are in Hollywood. What is Scorsese trying to do here? Make another 6th Sense? At the end of 6th Sense, there was this revelation, \\"ah, everything all make sense now\\". At the end of this one, after following the plot the whole time and it just spent five minutes trying to convince you that this indeed was the truth, there is just no way it could work. You can still rent it, the cinematograhy is nice, and Scorsese assembled a very respectable cast, but don't expect a big payoff after all the suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty box; no movie inside.","review":"The box had no movie in it.

The plot is good, the cast is great, and the cinematography is super cool. But everything else is just downright stupid: not scary, not creepy, and super obvious.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I didn't know too much about this movie going into it and I found it to be a pretty good movie. You follow the main character(DiCaprio) around on Shutter Island which has a hospital on it, while he is trying to solve a crime. He's going through a great deal of torment related to his personal life while trying to figure what exactly is going on at this hospital and when you get to the end of the movie you discover its not at all what it seems.

It was occasionally difficult for me to determine when I was watching scenes from the past or in the present. However, having said that, I must go on to say that all of the performances are excellent, especially DiCaprios and Ben Kingsleys. The script, though confusing, is nonetheless well written and the production values are top-notch - as one has come to expect from a Scorsese film. A perfect depiction of what it would be like to be a visitor stranded on a rain soaked island, in an asylum staffed by a sordid and disturbing cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it","review":"I'm not going into details as many others have already done so but I will say I enjoyed the film.

I didn't know this was Scorcese, when I saw his name at the end, my jaw dropped and an old King Missile song started playing in my head. This could have been so much better. Has some interesting moments, but overall, quite boring and predictable. I predicted in one scene what would happen, just by the music and camera angle. If you've never seen Alfred Hitchcock movies, then you might like this. It's definitely not scary, but decent suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Shuddered....","review":"IMHO, when a movie resorts to the cheap scare - people jumping out, accompanied by loud blasts of discordant music - it's time to move on to something more productive. This amateurish annoyance must have been employed half a dozen times in Shutter Island. Frankly, one would hope for better from Scorsese. The good acting and gothic sensibilities of the movie were badly weighted down by plot holes and a \\"surprise\\" ending you could see coming long before it arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't think this movie deserves 3 1/2 Stars","review":"I thought the acting was good. You realized why certain things happen when you see the ending. It's definitely not scary by any means, and though they try to make you jump like you usually would watching something like this, it doesn't work out. But I like the movie, it reminds me of Identity, Fight Club...Movies like that. I just don't believe it's fair to the movie to have such a low rating, when others that don't catch your attention get higher ratings. Four Stars is good enough for me. Giving it Five Stars to get that 4 star rating. I'm sure 204 reviewers have touched on almost everything about the movie, so I will not go into details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinkers movie","review":"I love to sit back and watch movies that make me think. I use movies to escape and this movie did the trick for me. I am not a great fan of Leonardo, but I must give him credit on a decent performance. The ending was perfect in my opinion and am not going to ruin it for those who haven't seen the movie. If your looking for a movie to unwind after a hard days work and can't find anything on the 300 channels of cable like me. This movie wont disappoint. If you liked movies like \\"The secret Window\\",\\"Fraility\\",or \\"stir of Echos\\" than this movie is for you. If you hated these movies stay away. You probably will not like this movie either.

That's not the only slapped-together aspect this waste of time offers: how about dull improbable dialogue, wooden acting, and a nonexistent pulse of suspense-building or terror. Totally flops, it was putting me to sleep so I finally bailed. It gets two stars for a few imaginative sets and shots, that's about it.Another example of how it takes a good director and story. Hitchcock could do something shorter, in black and white or color, without the graphic stuff,no computers, and have you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad hair day for Scorsese","review":"Here is what I liked best about the film: When the woman patient asks for a glass of water and in the shot of her drinking it she has an empty hand!

However, since it was made by Martin Scorsese, I expect a lot more. When you are among the best directors, you have high expectations...which I felt that this movie did not fullfill. This movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it did played out over it's full length.Most of \\"Shutter Island\\"is pretty good, as far as the casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are great), the scenery is effective, and the sound lends to the atmosphere.I just thought that the story was lame (NOTE, I am purposely not going into the plot since it will impact/reveal the mystery). When the film is all done, you feel as though you watched a \\"Scooby Doo\\" ending.This atmospheric movie is a weak Scorsese film.

However, deep down, I'm a horror / thriller fanatic, so SHUTTER ISLAND came as a wonderful surprise! From the outset, the entire atmosphere is gloomy and full of dread.

All I can say is you have to watch the movie to fully understand it. I can say if you don't like movies that keep you on the end of your seat or have a little bit of blood in them then this isn't the movie for you. Overall not very much blood shown through out the movie just a lot of scene's that can really pull you into the movie basically a lot of suspense.Extremely good movie & I highly recommend watching this if you like suspense movies. 5/5 star's from me.Happy Movie Hunting!

The book and the movie have the same exact plot, but when you read the words instead of actually watching actions unfold on the screen, it's easier to believe the twist. I don't know why that is but i think people see it so they view it as real. Whereas when you are reading it you have more of an imagination. I knew what was going to happen but i still enjoyed watching the movie. People just get soo caught up in the ending, how would you of liked it to end?

The keyed background scenery at sea is so fake that it looks like the movie was produced on a Video Toaster. In retrospect, I think the effect was intentional, but it set me up to expect a cheap and cheesy movie. Surprisingly, the main plot is interesting and takes a few good twists and turns as we learn more about the bizarre treatment of the patients on this island.Unfortunately, the final scenes are precisely the one cliche that should not have been. The ending left me disappointed and is also what reminded me of how poorly it began. Based on the middle two-thirds, I would give this four or maybe even 5 stars, but sadly, I have to give it two.

I'm sorry, but Shutter Island had this feeling the whole time like it was trying too hard to be spooky. That's Scorce's fault.

Unfortunately, for him, this is not one of his best parts. Oh, he was, as usual, interesting, however the story line was far less clever. Was anyone really not sure, after several of his flash backs, just how the story was going to play out?? It started out promising, but soon fell to mediocre after the first 35 min or so. I kept watching because I already bought the movie, and because the shinning reviews promised there would be something redeeming in the story line. It was not to be. If you just like to look at Leonardo and don't care about the story, then by all means get the movie.

Also, the movie really captured the 1950s era feel. Chilling movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious and basically boring","review":"Despite the clever casting, the \\"trick\\" to this movie is obvious almost from the very beginning. Once you see the illusion being created, the characters are stereotypical and really uninteresting. If the writing has been a lot more clever and intelligent, the plot of the movie wouldn't have been so obvious and perhaps held my attention a bit longer, but at a fundamental level the characters have nothing new to tell us nor do they shed any new light on the kind of evil that exists in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a whodoneit not a horror film","review":"Well, first there is no island like that within fifty miles of Boston, let alone within the harbor islands plus other factual errors.

And by satisfying I mean one that would make the time spent and the attention given worthwhile.

The only potential negative is that, if you get a used copy, the Touch and Feel parts aren't what they ought to be.

In this second book, the pace is much faster and more exciting. Great job with the series and I can't wait for the third to hit in July 07."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gundark in the Ointment","review":"I read \`Hard Contact' with some trepidation. I loved the idea of the Republic Commandos and enjoyed it for what it was. Karen Traviss' first book was exceptional; entertaining, clever, and a perfect complement to the Star Wars mythology. \`Triple Zero', however, is nicely written, but suffers from \\"too much\\" syndrome. The whole Mandalorian language and cultural aspects of the Commandos seemed pulled whole-cloth from the Klingons in Star Trek. After a while, the similarities became overwhelming and I started to have doubts. Coupled with the romance between Etain and Darman (are there any stable Jedi out there?), and the idea that dedicated killing teams are reduced to John LeCarre-style spying on the homefront, I had to step away. Long ago, I had stopped buying all Star Wars (and other licensed) books, I was really hoping that this series would be the one Star Wars series I'd pick up. That isn't going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Wars novel that isn't a \\"Star Wars\\" Novel","review":"Triple Zero was a well written follow-up to Hard Contact. Both books have rekindled my enthusiasm for the Star Wars franchise, which has not produced anything worth bantha poodu in the past decade.There really isn't anyone out there that can compare to the master of the genre, Robert Heinlein and the original Starship Troopers ... and this novel will not win any pulitzers or awards on originality, but the Republic Commando series is a very entertaining read than manages to inject emotional dialogue into a gritty story. It's refreshing to see something \\"Star Wars\\" besides Granpa Han Solo and the Wonder-twins.BTW: Don't call Halo, Mechwarrior (or even this book) classic. They're great fun to read, but to place these tie-ins in the same category with Aasimov, Herbert, Clarke and Heinlein is insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome expansion of knowledge and a good story","review":"Triple Zero is exactly the type of Star Wars book that I enjoy most. While I do like following the continuing saga of the Skywalker-Solo on-going shaping/reshaping of the Galaxy, Karen Traviss gives us something quite more appealing. She offers us alternate views of the events and times, expanding our knowledge of the clones and the people who use and abuse them. It reminds me quite a bit of the CBS series The Unit in the respect that it shows the soldiers and their life, no judgments or slanting, the reader provides all of that. It is not always pretty or honorable, but the storytelling is compelling, the crises of faith and dedication quite thought provoking and the end result is quite satisfying. Traviss expands the knowledge base of the Star Wars universe especially the Mandalorian aspects by several ranks. Enjoy it readers, I certainly did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triple Zero","review":"This thrilling sequel to Hard Contact (both by Karen Traviss) is a great and exciting book. It is filled with action from beginning to end and is laced with shocking twists, turns, and developments. I would highly recommend this book to any Star Wars fun or anyone looking for sci-fi action. But please do yourself a favor, read \\"Star Wars Republic Commando: Hard Contact\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels I've ever read.","review":"Triple Zero is where the REAL story of the Clone Wars finally starts being told. Forget the battles on exotic planets against battle droids and alien mercenaries, forget the clash of Sith and Jedi. This is about soldiers and the tight bonds of brotherhood - in this case, true brotherhood among the clone troopers - they form. Karen Traviss gives us a plot that would equal or surpass any Tom Clancy thriller, but the shining point here is absolutely the characters. The clones are strikingly individual and their need for not only individual identity, but family and cultural identity, form the heart of this story. The Jedi shown here aren't the invincible sagacious warriors we're usually presented with, and indeed some even start to question their purpose and justification in the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"While Traviss certainly can spin a tale, I found the first Republic Commando book quite a bit tighter and sharper than this one. This book -- and it may have been driven by Lucasfilm, not Traviss herself -- requires a far greater knowledge of the Star Wars EU to enjoy, and frankly, most of the EU novels aren't that great. I was also irritated (and I'm probably alone in this) by the overuse of the Mandalorian language; it's confusing to the casual reader and unnecessary. This book reads a lot more like it was aimed at the 'hardcore' fan who gobbles up everything Lucasfilm pitches at them. The first Republic Commando book didn't have these issues -- but again, this may have been editorial direction and not author's choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book!","review":"Run away from this book!If you have no other way to study for the CBEST, then I would recommend borrowing this from the library ONLY.

I also concur and can not understand how this book achieved a rating of 5 and 6 stars. It highlights some events of Lynn's climbing in her lifetime but it doesn't capture the soul of climbing. I also felt some arrogance with her writing where most of the writing were concentrated on the negatives of others' climbs while in some instances she had the same.

Unfortunately, it is so poorly written, much is left to be desired. The majority of the book skims over events that deserved more attention (i.e. Hill's involvement in European climbing competition) while using her love life as filler. I still respect Hill greatly and was awed by the color photos of her climbing, but a good editor and more introspective on Hill the climber and not Hill the dating machine would have done this book wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I'm a little baffled by the previous reviews because I don't see how this book rates 5 stars. As a climber, I think Lynn Hill is a role model to look up to but as a reader, I could barely get through the pages.

This book is the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my precious time!!!","review":"If you want to read an incoherent mix of writer's ego and an alcoholic saga of self-destruction this is the book for you. There is nothing constructive in terms of advancing the crime novel genre in this publication. The hero does nothing, solves no crimes, and stays wasted the entire book. Why in God's name people think this is a critical success is completely beyond me. Raymond Chandler is resting peacefully knowing his skill as a writer has not been challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Guinness","review":"I didn't like this book very much. I found its minimalist style contrived, showy and offputting. The plot didn't amount to much and most of the book seemed to dwell on the protagonist's battle with the bottle. There was some good Irish local color and I enjoyed reading for once about an Irish city other than Dublin, namely Galway. But the book didn't hold my interest and I was glad when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar and unique","review":"Bruen doesn't reinvent the murder mystery - he just shifts it's phasing and phrasing. Reading this, you're always comfortable with the genre and shaken by the interpretation. If you love murder mysteries, detective novels, or Irish humor, you'll be at home with this book. A quick read, you find yourself slowing so as not to finish too soon. Can't wait to read the next one...slowly...savoring it like single malt or fine Irish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty Novel","review":"If you like George Pelecanos' early work, you almost certainly will like this writer. Bruen's writing style takes sparse to a whole new level. Most of these chapters are 2-3 pages at most but this is not a criticism. The book is very focused. If you are looking for a travelogue of Galway, Ireland disguised as a mystery, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a well-written, sparse but focused, dark (and reading the other reviews I don't really need to expound on this) novel. This is a great way to spend a couple of days."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sottish Rambler","review":"Like being trapped by a drunk who insists in telling you his incoherent life story with special emphasis on his resentments, puerile philosophical insights, and excerpts from bad Irish and C&W music. Don't go there.

I have never seen so much blank space in a book that wasn't poetry.Don't waste your time when there are so many excellent mystery books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best debut mystery of the year","review":"There's certainly no shortage of \\"drunk P.I.\\" novels, yet somehow Bruen has created a completely compelling work.As a former member of an elite Irish police force, Jack Galway now whiles away his time nursing drinks in a pub. Despite his fall from grace, Jack is still known as a man with a skill for finding things. Enter the beautiful older woman (one of many cliches this book gets away with) with the missing daughter, and Jack's back in action. Inevitably, he has encounters with all sorts of seedy types, leading to a resolution that may not satisfy some readers.The story may not be original, but Bruen's writing more than makes up for it. A great read for fans of the P.I. novel, especially those who appreciate strong writing. Unfortunately, this book will likely be overlooked in favor of others, but for anyone interested it's definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a professor's prespective","review":"I'm a professor at Yale, CT.

I was amazed at the intrique, the storyline is solid. (few minor typos-oversights), however it in no way hurts the story.At first I thought all the details contained in this bountiful book was too much. However, when I finally got to the end, I was astonished beyond discription at the final disclosure, and why Garcia fomated her book this way.

I enjoyed Garcia's (I have never heard of a Latina writing sci-fi in this particular realm, I hope they make it a movie) discription of the accident, when all the characters come to rescue Mark Sanders, the Public Defender for Ethan Franks. I liked the creepiness of Ethan Franks and the mystery surrounding him.

I enjoyed so much. I told my dad. He read it, and emailed the author about it. (MY dad hadn't picked up a book to read, just the newspaper, in 17yrs). He really laughed in certain sections of book. He was Oh My God, and other words he used said he enjoyed just like I did.By the way, my copy is authorgraphed by the author. I meet her at a DC37 Union function this November. She's really very nice. I like her, and she loves kids. She's not fake, she wants to know what kids think about the book and things in general. Please buy her book.

For instance, The \\"Doubt thou...\\" from Hamlet, and many from a Midsummer Night's Dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"While it's just a short collection of Shakesphere related to the movie, it's an easy read for people that aren't that well read with poetry. And it makes a great way to say I love you to someone. May be for Chritsmas or Valentines Day. I used it as a nice reference to place quotes in wedding cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose and pretentious","review":"The purpose of all truly good poetry is to reduce stress in readers or listeners, calming them both physically and emotionally. This has been proven in many scientific studies, but these poems only create more stress due to their subject matter, which is source of anxiety and tension for all but the luckiest of mortals. The filmmakers would have done better by their fellow man had they refrained from reprinting these misguided poems from an earlier, more insensitive era in our species' history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hope for other \\"Pixotes\\"","review":"The film Pixote depicts the real life crisis that is life for millions of street children in the world.

These people are hosting the 2016 Olympics, maybe that will help them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Infective","review":"I saw this film in the theater as a first release movie and still remember its disturbing images to this day. While most movies show the innocent dream world we like to think children live in, Pixote slithers and crawls through a dark and surreal world unknown to most of us -- yet it is a world with recondite beauty because Pixote knows no other. We see things happen that would be totally unacceptable in the antiseptic world of civilization but our little protagonists does not seem to see his world as anything but normal. With the self-survival morals of any jungle animal, he goes about his day-to-day life. And this juxtaposing of morals leads to a little bit of an internal conflict with the viewer before the end of the movie. I highly recommend this film to anyone but would warn you that if the \\"Pollyanna\\" world of children is what you think exists and want to see, this film with keep you awake for quiet a few nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur?","review":"Although I have enjoyed many Brazilian films and am a fan of Brazilian culture and life in general, I was quite disappointed in this particular effort.I can dimly grasp why someone might WANT to think of this as a good film but not how anyone actually COULD. Beyond its use of an amateur cast one might also think of it as an exercise in amateur sociology and, seemingly, film-making in general.To identify it as \\"Best\\" or \\"One of the top ten\\" of anything, as reviews quoted on the DVD case do, seems absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixote","review":"I thought that this movie was a real eye-opener! I didn't know that you could film child nudity/pornography. I thought that the basic plot of the street kids and reformitories was good. When it began to stray from the basic plot that is when I thought the movie went downhill. I would not recommend this movie to any of my friends.

Initially, I was a little skeptical but as I started to peruse this, I found the information both very interesting and extremely helpful. It IS advisable to understand why the things you know work in cooking actually happen so you can transfer them to other dishes/situations.I found the observations about vegetable and fruit selection (e.g.: shopping) and preparation the most instructive, with those on seafood being helpful as well. However, I really can't say I was particularly wowed by the recipes. They are not for the low fat, low calorie, or unusual dish type of cook. I was particularly disappointed that he didn't offer suggestions for using fruit other than as a dessert or breakfast type of item.While not rivetting, this is an interesting and useful reference.

I guess I expected more science explained but most of what I discovered was very basic. That's not to say that I didn't learn anything, I did, but most of the info I had already gleaned from other sources such as Food TV.

I'd considered myself an intermediate baker, and it makes a world of difference to understand the science of baking. The chapter on ganache alone is worth the price of the book several times over. It has opened up the doors for me in terms of being able to create my own recipes and variations. An important facet of this book also is Sherry Yard's style. Noticably absent is the air of condescention some authors adopt when deigning to speak with the amateur baker.

Vincent Herring has clearly studied Cannonball, and he has the great intonation and tone of the Master. Louis Hayes was Cannonball's drummer for classic sessions, and he is still burning it up. Jeremy Pelt is an excellent stand-in for Nat Adderley. My only hesitation, and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars, is that to my ears the pianists here are not as facile with the tunes as the other performers. If you long for a new Cannonball recording, you will be happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got ESPN Insider for 5 bucks","review":"What more can I say?

If you are looking for in-depth articles that present new ideas then look towards Sports Illustrated. ESPN magazine features many short articles about current, and upcoming events in sports. Most of the content in each issues can be written by a couple of interns, but within each issue are one or two lengthy article that maybe worth reading. Otherwise, this magazine is great to read in the bathroom, or during breakfast. I subscribed ESPN magazine because I wanted a cheap magazine that provided an overview into sports. For those more serious about sports, upgrade and spend the extra money on Sports Illustrated.Pros- Cheap- ESPN InsiderCons- Articles lack quality- Many Ads"},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"This was a great deal on a good sized magazine.

The magazine is so all over the place otherwise that its hardly worth reading. Its chock full of tidbits that barely gloss over sports topics. I keep it in my bathroom and I guess its good there when I only have a few minutes to read while brushing my teeth or whatnot. Don't expect SI-type depth though, its full of ads and slick factoid type departments. Reading this magazine is like watching Sportscenter, a lot of many little things with no depth on anything. I guess its worth it for less than 60 cents an issue, but if I sat down to read this magazine cover to cover I would be done with it totally in under 15 minutes....enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly Bad","review":"I should preface my review with two facts. First, I don't pay for ESPN The Magazine, it just started showing up in my mailbox a few months back and hasn't stopped. Secondly, I love sports, so I'm interested in the material. With that said, this magazine seems to have been designed for those under the age of 14, or at the very least, individuals with attention spans equal to Robin Williams on speed. The writing is juvenile and boring while the format is clearly an attempt to mask these faults. To make up for its kiddie pool depth, the magazine is stuffed with things like countdowns, top 10 lists, odds and anything else an interns can whip up before the deadline. Bottom line, it takes 4 minutes to read the thing cover to cover, and at the end you'll wish you had that time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking substance","review":"I switched to ESPN The Magazine from Sports Illustrated because I wanted an Insider membership on their website, and I figured I'd try something new. Now I am regretting it. The majority of the content is lame random facts and top ten lists. The few articles longer than a paragraph are hard to find between all the ads, and they lack substance and anything to entice the reader to keep reading. This magazine feels more like teen magazine with all the gaudy headlines and lack of any real reporting or journalism. If you want a magazine with interesting and insightful sports articles, beautiful photos, and 1/100th of the advertisements, get a subscription to sports illustrated.

I'm not happy about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamest sports mag out there","review":"Of all the sports magazines out there, this, disappointingly, is the worst. It's virtually all graphics and lame trivia. The photos are sub-par compared to SI, and the writing (when there is any of length) is by far the lowest quality amongst the main sports magazines - both in the topics that they cover as well as the depth and quality of writing. You would think that the \\"world leader in sports\\" would put more effort into producing a quality magazine, but they don't.The class of the field is still Sport Illustrated, followed closely by Sporting News. ESPN the Magazine is a distant third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yechh.","review":"I subscribed to ESPN the Magazine because I had heard that Rick Reilly would be appearing in its pages. That, at one point I thought, would have been enough. Not now. Even Rick Reilly could not save this mess. It's like what if instead of being a brilliant novelist William Faulkner had been a wretched sportswriter. Bits and fragments scattered here and there, graphics upon graphics and not a bit of substance or content in sight. Run, don't walk from ESPN the Magazine.The bizarre thing to me is the choice they made with this magazine. I'm obviously not their target audience. I'm too old. However, I think there is probably a niche for a sort of Esquire done through the lens of sports - that is what I would have thought ESPN the Magazine could be.

When my subscriptions end, I won't be renewing ESPN.I want detailed sports information, in-depth stories and the kind of details I can't find in my morning copy of USA Today. Instead, ESPN delivers a Maxim-esque version of sports with lots of popular culture reference and clip art. And plenty of ads for gold jewelry, cell phones and men's body spray.I used to complain more but I've come to realize the magazine is a reflection of SportsCenter -- a show that has devolved into a series of annoying euphemisms for home runs, slam dunks and touchdowns.Bottom line: If you love SportsCenter, you'll love ESPN magazine.

The main reason I purchased a subscription was for ESPN Insider which seemed to have a decent group of writers like Eric Karabell and Christopher Harris. However when I attempted to go through the process of activating my Insider account, ESPN said I did not have an active subscription. When I read off my 10 digit number to the phone rep, they said that number was not active and I would have to contact the magazine company to see what is going on.Needless to say I dont have the patience to spend an hour or so on the phone with a sales rep getting yanked around being told I need to contact Amazon and then ESPN and then the magazine company. I canceled after one issue, good riddance. I will never subscribe again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"This magazine is edgy, and it does stuff that most sports magazines don't do. It has unusual angles to it's sports stories: it's really quite different from S.I., or Sports Illustrated. That's good and bad. Also, this thing is absolutely JAM PACKED with ads. Four and five full pages in a row of full page ads. It's just crazy. More ads than a cosmo magazine.I got it on sale for five dollars for five months, so like fifty cents per issue. And that's about all it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good mag","review":"Very dissatisfied, too many ads and not enough variety.

I don't know what happened at ESPN, but their magazine has gone down hill since the last time I had a subscription. The worst was the MLB season preview. 6 pages. SIX MEASLY, FREAKIN' PAGES!!!!! Each page was devoted to a division. No in depth team coverage, just a per division preview. That's it? That's the best that THE. SPORTS. AUTHORITY. of the world could come up with? Needless to say, I've canceled my subscription and moved on it life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Magazine-sized!","review":"Wouldn't have ordered if I'd known this wasn't really a magazine.

The description says 4-6 weeks, but I placed my order on March 8 with an estimated first magazine of May 2--more like 7-9 weeks. Or is that 4-6 weeks to send my subscription to ESPN? This is what happens when you try to save a couple of dollars by not going straight to the source. If my first ESPN magazine actually arrives by May 2, I will give them back a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known","review":"First I'll say that I will watch ESPN while complaining about ESPN. They know they can get by regurgitating the same crap all day long throwing in random \\"analysis\\" and making a huge deal about as many small subjects as they possibly can. If your going to read a sports magazine SI is the way to go. The ESPN magazine is huge and full or random crap lots of pictures and twitter posts. Its 90% football most of the time with half pages (if that) given to some of the smaller sports. Overall its just not much content inside you can get a good deal on it I got if for a year for only 1$ but it just made the old magazine pile in the basement look rediculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for Dad","review":"I bought this magazine for my dad for xmas and so glad I did.

Since then, I have referred to Contracts in a Nutshell many times in the context of both academic and professional research. At present, I find that many excerpts are even suitable for teaching basic principles of contract law to students in non-law-related fields.

In my despair, I bought this book. It opened up my eyes and lifted the fog of contracts for me.

All of the current biographies view him with rose colored glasses. Cooke, the general editor of the intitial 15 volumes of The Papers of Alexander Hamilton and general editor of the 13 volume A History of The American Colonies, really knows his stuff. He presents a well written, engaging biography of the right length and depth of coverage for what I wanted. He has an unusually balanced view of the feud between Hamilton and Jefferson, and used psychological techniques to try to decipher Hamilton's conflicted personality. Hamilton was an essential part of the mix of our founding fathers who's views balanced Jefferson's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the flash cards, not the book","review":"I purchased both the book and the flash cards. After reviewing both I kept the flash cards and returned the book.The flash cards have everything you need, and they are ready to use. The flash cards include all forms of the greek or latin word on the front, and on the back they list many common English words based on the root.The book requires that you make flash cards. The book also includes a few pages of background material, but not enough to make it worth the money. While the book has a lot of useful material, it is not as easy to use as the flash cards.

The book has Greek and Latin root words that make up our English words. For example \\"graph\\" means to write so a child can discern the meanings of words like \\"autograph\\" and \\"graphite\\" by breaking down the word.They sell flash cards but I have found it more effective to have the student write the vocabulary word on a 3\\" X 5\\" card in green (for Greek roots) and red (for Latin roots). On the back they write the definition and English words that use that root. We then punch a hole in the top left corner and put them on a ring. Whenever there is a free moment, if they finish up another subject before anyone else, they can pull out their ring of word and do a review by themselves.It is an extremely easy curriculum to add with almost no extra work for the teacher and lots of vocabulary and spelling for the student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"When I ordered this book, I didn't realize that it was a) home made b) for teachers. Considering the price I was expecting a real book, not something that appears to have been assembled at Kinko's with a photocopier. The print is giant, so there is very little information on each page.I was expecting a workbook of some kind for older students, but the format seems to be geared toward very little kids with notes at the bottom with advice for teachers on how to present the material. I found this book disappointing and overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree - Buy Cards, not book","review":"For starters, be careful that if you are starting out with this program, that you must start with \\"Volume I\\". \\"Volume II\\" is apparently another set of words that the book states you must have completed \\"Volume I\\" as a prerequisite before moving on to \\"Volume II.\\" The majority of the book is one page each of the 100 flash cards with the front & back shown. There is a small write up that you can read as each card is introduced, but it really doesn't seem very helpful to me, and if anything, just something boring to read. Pretty much, this seems to be a vocabulary memorization type system & the flash cards will be fine. The flash cards are numbered in the order the book recommends you present / learn them.

But it felt the same way as the score to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"... there wasn't the same level of flow or coherence in it that I felt in \\"The Two Towers\\". More simply put, the total didn't feel as great as the sum of the parts or as coherent a piece of work as the score to the second movie. Some of the songs, though (in particular, toward the end, and most of all Annie Lennox's \\"Into The West\\"), were truly brilliant and inspiring.

It was amazing, and for each movie, I bought the cd that went with it.This cd is my favorite.

Regardless if you are a fan of the movies or not the score to this movie should be in anybody's collection. The tracks are well written and paced. Hats off to Howard Shore for doing it once more just as he did with Two Towers and Fellowship. All of the tracks are great to listen to including the final one from Annie Lennox called Into the West. It is different from May it Be and Gollum's Song in a good way. Minas Tirith and Return of the King are defintely worth the price of the CD by themselves to have.

My favorite tracks? 16, 17, and 18!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds All Expectations","review":"I fell in love with the soundtrack to Fellowship when it came out, and could not expect that the next two installments would be as wonderful. The Two Towers was satisfying, nearly as good, but this one is truly fantastic.Near the beginning we spend a lot of time in Gondor, away from the familiar musical themes from the last 2 films but with exciting new ones to hear instead. The tension builds all the way up to \\"The End of All Things,\\" which really puts you right back into the climax of the movie. After that comes a flood of joy when all the old familiar themes come back in the last three tracks -- which are some of my favorite film music ever, and which make \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" (a beautiful piece from the first film) look like kid stuff.Vocal turns from Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd are welcome, and Annie Lennox's ending song concludes the album beautifully and appropriately. I recommend this CD to anyone who has seen the movie, and also to anyone who hasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"When you see the movie, you can clearly see that there are plenty of opportunities for tons and tons of emotional, powerful music. Howard Shore takes advantage of every one of them. The music really gets inside of you, instilling you with a fitting emotion be it a fright, battle, or love scene. The orchestral performance is excellent as well. The Anne Lennox song is a little out of place, but who cares when the rest is so fantastic???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase below expectations","review":"I like the cd but it came with the case all cracked and broken so the disc slices around inside the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Howard Shore is a genius! This soundtrack is amazing! [one note about the DVD included with the limited edition- the bonus DVD is okay, but the 'supertrailer' is edited very poorly]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Boyd","review":"I got this soundtrack for Valentine' Day, and I think it is absolutely wonderful. Billy Boyd, \\"Pippin\\", deserves his own CD. His voice is absolutely gorgeous...very velvety and soft, yet passionate and powerful. The whole CD is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Catharsis.","review":"Howard Shore has done an amazing thing: composing and orchrestrating three separate soundtracks that not only stand alone by themselves, but that can be played together as one seamless whole. Peter Jackson did it with the movies, but Shore's job was more difficult because he wasn't scoring all three films simultaneously. Anyway, there are some familiar refrains from FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS on this album. However, there are several differences. The major new instrumental piece is \\"Minas Tirith\\". Also new to this album are vocals from the movie sung by the actors in the film: Billy Boyd on \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" and Viggo Mortensen on \\"The Return of the King\\". The final song on the album, Annie Lennox' \\"Into the West\\" seems like a pop ballad, but contains enough depth and nuance to end this magnificent piece of movie music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack","review":"Having started out hating this series, its ironic how much I love anything Lord of the Rings related, and this soundtrack is another exapmle of this. The music conveys teh tone of the movie, and even though I haven't seen the movies all that often, I can still picture the scenes that the music came from. Soundtracks are a great way to relive a movie without having to sit through another 3 hour long movie. would definately recommend this to anyone interested in the books, movies, or just likes classical sounding music.It amazes me that Billy Boyd really does have an amazing voice. I'm not sure if it was digtally enhanced or whatnot, but if that is his real voice he should be in musicals, if he isn't already, because it really is amazing. I think that \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" is my favorite track because of it. the song is haunting and his voice is perfect for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it Purports to Be","review":"I was really looking forward to receiving this enhanced CD. Sure enough, I got the DVD and the enhanced part of the CD. Problem was - NO SOUNDTRACK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just To Let You Know A Secret.","review":"I'm giving this four stars not because I don't like it or anything it's just that my twin sister has been listening to track 5 over and over to get on my nerves. You see, she's a little upset that I'm watching this certain musical again and she doesn't like it at all. So everytime when we go somewhere, she puts it in and goes to track 5 just to bug me. It makes me so annoyed and stuff. But, anyway. I do like this soundtrack but I don't love it. I mean has your sister or brother listened to a soundtrack that you didn't want to listen to? Did they ever badger you on and on about a movie that you just like and not love? Oh, well I'm going to BroadwayOnline. Com. Bye!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"All this does is repeat the one theme from the 1st movie. It went well with the movie but just sitting and listening to it by itself it does not hold up well. It is not something I would listen to again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howard Shore was a poor choice for such a beloved series","review":"The score functions in its role adequately enough, but the notes lack the spirit of works by more refined composers such as Harry Gregson-Williams or Patrick Doyle. The main LOTR theme sounds good enough, but the rest of the score is sheer boredom.There is a dynamic, emotional quality that is completely missing from Shore's effort, and the score comes accross as something akin to 'elevator music' as a result"},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITING STRIKES AGAIN","review":"Once again, the adoring public gets screwed. Howard Shore has worked to get the most amazing cinematic soundtrack in history put on disc, and like in TTT, the good tracks have been removed. In TTT, we saw eowyn's theme cut for stupid monotonous boring tracks like the black gate is close and treebeard. wtf? now we see the music from theoden's rousing speech scrapped like garbage for again, weak tracks like end of all things. howard shore i salute you, u have bee screwed, like all of us, but the editing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"So much has been said by all the others who have contributed to this review I would just like to add that all things considered I think that maybe Howard Shore has created the finest movie score of all time, and that takes some doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than FOTR and TTT","review":"This soundtrack is definitely Shore at his best. It's wonderful to hear different themes again from The Fellowship of Ring, such as the Rivendell theme and Hobbit related ones. This CD is definitely a work of genius. Buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL HAIL THE KING!!!!!","review":"Although The Two Towers had the best score, this definitely comes in second. The only theme established in this film is the heroic Gondor theme ( heard in fragments in FIlms 1 and 2). The theme is heard first in \\" Minas Tirith\\" Even though the soundtrack prominently features Frodo's journey, the others still get to shine.. \\" Ash and Smoke\\" \\" The Fields of Pelennor\\" and \\" The Black Gate Opens\\" are musically dark, as those tracks tell of The War of The Ring. Flute soloist James Galaway appears. Ben Del Maestro( a 12 year old singer) returns. Lite Pop singer Annie Lennox belts out Into The West, a heart warming end to the trilogy. ALL HAIL THE KING!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking....","review":"First off, I'd like to say, if you have not seen the Return of the King, you have no business whatsover to be sticking your nose into the music. You must see the movie before you buy this soundtrack.Howard Shore is ingenious. Each song captures the beauty and harmony of every scene in the movie. For instance, Shelob's Lair is by far one of the best tracks. You can feel the emotions put forth into the music, the dynamics are OUSTANDING.The Steward of Gondor carries us away with the beautiful flute solo and Billy Boyd's voice is magnificent. It is very much a depressing song, but nevertheless beautiful.Into the West is quite stunning. Annie Lennox knows how to scare people with that voice of hers. Strong and powerful it is, yet calm and soothing. You will find yourself close to tears if you often listen to that song.This further concludes my \\"review\\" of the Return of the King soundtrack. I do not want to spoil anyone's ears. Do buy this CD. It is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No theme of its own?","review":"Though this a beautiful piece, there seems to be many hints of the previous two musical themes from(FOTR + TT) without really striking out on it's own direction. Granted the point of the third installment is to weave the various threads together and provide a final climax. None the less, the subtlety of many of the themes are quite poignant and use a \\"less is more\\" mentality...wish there had been more and then realize, hey....I'm dead an not even in the third movie. No wonder I don't like it as much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually hav not listened to this yet.","review":"For some reason I have the feeling that the tracks of the trilogy's soundtrack will be known for a long time to come. Just as John Williams is still known for his Star Wars music, Howard Shore will most likely be known for the LOTR soundtrack. I think that this will be the epic motion picture music of our generation (those born early 80s)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Incomplete","review":"I love this soundtrack from start to finish. However I am forced to give it 4 stars for omitting the greatest pieces of music in the entire trilogy, in my humble opinion. Specifically the music from the chapters in the DVD \\"The Last Move\\" and the start to \\"Mount Doom.\\" Put those in a grand collection and I would be happy as a clam"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR:ROTK - as awesome as the others","review":"I may be prejudice, but I love EVERYTHING about the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. This CD of the soundtrack is no exception. Howard Shore's music is so evocative of the action in the films that I can relive the action just by listening to it. And the vocal piece which won the Academy Award is as deserving as all of the other 10 awards the movie won (and we all know the clean sweep was for the mamouth effort of the entire series and not just for ROTK, for heaven's sake!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the trilogy","review":"How do you write about one of the greatest composers of our time? Howard Shore has captured the best of the themes, enhanced some beyond what I thought possible, and even created yet more themes for us to love and hum in our dark moments. If I ever have the privilege to meet this man, I will have to thank him for the last three years of music and kiss him for the beauty that this trilogy is. Howard, you've done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great End","review":"I think that this cd is great. It has the same quality as the other two but is different in its own right. I think the best thing about it is that it uses people from the movie instead of professional singers which makes it even better. WIth Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd included, it is a great piece of music. I especially love Into the West by Annie Lennox. It is such a touching song and a beautiful ending. The added card is a great touch along with the translations for some of the songs. It would be a great addition to any true LOFR fan. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed it by this much........","review":"Sorry about that Chief. After listening to the ROTK sountrack start to end I find it a bit.......incomplete. Seems to be a common thread these days, you buy a CD 'cuz you really loved the Movie and the COOL parts are shortened or missing completely. Loved 'The White Tree' just awesome. One word. Goosebumps. Otherwise a fine CD to round out the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie in top form","review":"I must disagree with the naysayers regarding Annie Lennox's contribution to this soundtrack. The song is powerful and Annie's soaring vocals perfectly capture the bittersweet farewell to dear friends departing, Into The West. Out of her range? No way. This beautiful and perhaps slightly unconventional track provides a fitting finish to Shore's tremendous score."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stellar Soundtrack for a Stellar Film","review":"Howard Shore has done it again! He has wrapped Peter Jackson's final film in the Lord of the Rings with a rich texture of themes. This is the best of the three soundtracks as the movie is the best of the three films.The selection of Sir James Galway, Ben del Maestro, Renee Fleming and especially Annie Lennox to perform is outstanding. And who knew that Billy Boyd could sing? His song in \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" makes you \\"see\\" the futility of Faramir's attack on Osgiliath. Viggo Mortensen singing the actual Elvish lines from the book in \\"The Return of the King,\\" was brilliant as is the use of text from the book for \\"Into the West.\\"For serious soundtrack collectors, this is a must and I certainly hope that Howard Shore can be nominated for an Oscar for this soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me wrong...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the music. It's some of the most moving music ever composed for film. My beef is with this \\"Limited Edition\\" soundtrack, and that complaint is the \\"limited\\" part. Although the soundtrack for FotR suffered from cut-and-paste it at least managed to play in film order. This one felt like the editor chose the tracks and order by tossing a dart at a list of the different pieces. And here is also the biggest flaw: Two of the BEST musical cues from the film have been cut from this soundtrack: The chorale variation of the main Fellowship Theme from the Battle of the Morannon is gone entirety, as is most of the Charge of the Rohirrim.Maybe I'm being harsh, but just how much was left out, and the jumbled order, deeply disappointed me. I only hope that when the Extended Edition of Return of the King is released this entire 12+ hour symphony, in proper film order, follows it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"My husband had a 'best of' Lord of the Rings soundtrack and wanted cds from all the movies.

The first part of the book looks at Native American and colonial weather, explaining how our perceptions of the elements were being shaped even then. A fascinating chapter looks at the West and the Great Plains, describing the tornadoes, blizzards and dust storms common to the region.The book's second half covers the National Weather Service and present-day meteorology, showing how technology has changed the art of weather forcasting. We see the daily weather report through the eyes of the weather men themselves.Laskin is a great writer whose book will appeal to weather buffs and others alike. I only wish he had spent more time covering specific storms in our history and how they have shaped communities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price... Slow Shipping, No Assembly Instructions","review":"I bought these paper lanterns as a gift for my sister's kid's birthday party.Pros: They were in excellent condition when they arrived and were great decoration for the evening party.Cons: I wish there was an instruction booklet, my sister said there was none. It took very long for shipping, 10 days since ordered. They reached just the day before the party and since there weren't any instructions, it took her a while to assemble. But, luckily she managed to get them up for the party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lights!","review":"When I looked over the reviews for this item, I was very hesitant about buying the lights. I decided to take a chance and I'm very glad I did! The lights are adorable and really brighten up my room. The lanterns are made of paper and wire, so its not as durable as I would love, but none of mine ripped. It was relatively easy to put together, you just need to be a little careful with the wire frame.The picture does show colors that the item doesnt have, however the green, yellow, orange, red and blue ones are perfect together.I do have two small complaints.One is that the item did not come with instructions on how to put them together, however, after a little bit of playing around, I managed to figure it out.Second is that one of the wire frames was broken. Luckily, there was a spare, but, ideally, the product shouldnt have any problems.I do plan on buying more.

First of all, who knew they would arrive unassembled? They were so difficult to put together, and they came with absolutely no assembly instructions. The paper in the lanterns is so thin that when you try to insert the wires that convert from flat to round structures they all tear. It was a mess. In addition, after I finally got one of two lantern sets assembled (which took two weekends)and hung them up outside (with many torn and disfigured lanterns), the light string went out after two days! The return policy was only for two weeks from date of purchace (and it took over a week for them to be delivered), and the ordeal required to ship them back to the vendor was outrageous. Needless to say, I had to keep these defective, unusable light strings. I would never recommend this vendor nor order anything from them again!Disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly made, badly desgined","review":"I bought 5 strands of these, one wasn't working, and there were a whole bunch of broken metal pieces in there among all 5 of them (the metal that props up the paper part), and this can't be from shipping, they were packed in there like that. It was hell trying to assemble them and make them work, paper parts would rip and lamps kept falling. They are obviously very well priced, but still not worth it... I would have gladly paid a little bit more to have them not be so crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made at all","review":"I didn't mind having to put the laterns together but the fact that 4 of the poorly made brackets broke as I was trying to put it together was really annoying.

First of all, it is difficult to assemble them and because you have to force the lanterns open with a metal bracket the paper gets easily ripped. Half of the brackets broke in half at the point where the metal frame is attached back to itself while I was assembling this.I had the lanterns strung outside when it started to rain. I quickly gathered them up and pulled them inside (they were maybe in the rain 5-10 minutes). The dye in the paper ran all over the place leaving a mess and some crappy looking lanterns once they dried. If you plan on using lanterns outdoors, these are poor choice due to the shoddy craftsmanship and total lack of durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNHAPPY CONSUMER","review":"This product was supposed to have microsoft word 2007 cd with the book and it did not so we had to purchase the software."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Book","review":"This was a school book that was purchased for my sister and a lower price than the book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Great product with no problems!!

I have had it in my own library since 1956, and every few years I pick it up again and try to figure out what the fuss is all about. If you must buy this book I urge you to consider one tiny revision. Instead of whacking with your right hand at the last second, get your hands ahead of the clubhead as far as possible (like he says), hold the angle of your hands which got them into that position, and get your right knee in before your clubhead hits the ball, which it will do a whole lot better without your right hand's voluntary help."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S WRONG BUT IT'S RIGHT","review":"IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF PAGES IN THIS BOOK IT SAYS , AFTER READING THIS BOOK YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND TAKE 15 STROKES OFF YOUR GOLF GAME.

However, if you are a new golfer thinking this book will give you some magic secrets, you may be disappointed. I'm not saying it can't help, but to get the most out of the book, you need to have had some lessons and some familiarity with golf, including your swing. If you don't know what a spine angle is, or what the slot is, go take a class or get private lessons, and THEN buy this book. It's analysis on the mental game and playing the course is great and probably isn't taught too well in lessons. THAT's where this book shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not that great.","review":"Armour's book contains some decent basic tips, but he often comes across as a pretentious snob who is speaking down to the great unwashed masses of golfers. That takes away a lot from any enjoyment of the book. There are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Basics Work!","review":"I've taken several courses in college, listened to every piece of advice on the range, and had my swing analyzed on videotape. Yet, I found my swing getting more inconsistent -- skulls, chewing the fat, hooks, slices, you name it. After applying Armour's techniques, my shots are now consistently straight. Armour breaks down the swing into its basic elements. Not only does he provide theory, but he explains how to apply the theory to where it counts -- your head, hands and body. I almost spent another $200 on golf videos, but with this book I saved over $180. This book is a must for any beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Play your best Golf all the Time.

Five Lesson from Ben, Swing the Clubhead, etc.I like this book, it provides insight about how to play really good golf. I have read over couple of dozen golf books and this is certainly the one in top of my list.In comparison of new golf books versus the old ones, I found that there is more fundamental skill that descripted very clearly for the old ones. Maybe, it is because in the old days, if you need to play well, you can only rely on the technical skill, but today, you can sometimes rely on the technology. It is not easy to find those secret from the new published books."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only read two golf books","review":"This book is an excellent follow-up to Ben Hogan's Five Lessons. Hogan covering the backround theory in more detail and Armour emphasizing the practical application.There are differences opinion: Hogan wants the hands to act as a unit while Armour says to whack the ball with your right hand. But they agree on much more than they disagree, and Armour explains how, through basic footwork and other simple measures, you can be sure you are swinging correctly. Armour also goes into more detail about specific shots such as chipping, pitching or driving.Theory, then applcation. You can't go wrong if you read Hogan and Armour back to back, in that order.Hit 'em straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I bought if for myself","review":"This book is well layed out and is the definitive source onJacobsen.

I found the price most reasonable and, of course, ordering was quite easy. My thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery.My wife told me that she enjoys the story, too, so it's all good.

I found the book to be very dated in its cultural relevance and more or less a tract on the authors ideas about how to create a society in his own image, which bears some resemblance to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young's thoughts on the subject (which Wyndham touches on). Lots of internal and external dialog and exposition without resolution. It's written as a first-person of course, but I found the approach frankly tiresome. Kind of like reading Ayn Rand - you want to jump over big chunks just to avoid amateur philosophy.

She's a country-pop-rock, singer/ guitarist/ recording artist, and an extremely talented live performer. I've seen her perform several times around the Phoenix area, and my spirit soars every time I do. If you get a chance to see her, trust me, she's fantastic (...you can google her site for details). An incredable amount of diverse talent and energy come through this CD. I've actually purchased a handfull of them to give as gifts, and I'd say it's on par with what any well-known artist would likely hope to deliver. IT ROCKS WITH AMAZING WARMTH & BRILLIANCE. DEFINITELY GET THIS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tutorial","review":"This is an excellent book for learning how to use Fireworks...it has very good projects and it even has things to do on your own when you are finished the lesson.

I love how it took the original story and went more in depth with it. Explaining how they actually turned him into a living weapon that they couldn't control.

The book relies heavily on scientific techno jargon that I found boring with little action going on for Wolverine who seems to spend most of the book drifting in and out of memories that were only half lucid. While it can be interesting to learn about how and why he had the adamantium bonded to him, I wasn't really wanting to go as in-depth technically on the process. Great if you're a scientist or techno geek, but bad if you were just looking for a fun read. There are much better books out there that actually show more action and have less textbook explanation of things. Very disappointing overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent","review":"The sound is really nice and though I only have 2 Sony 6X9 on my car, the sound was coming out really decent. The drawback was that sometimes you hit any button and it doesn't respond (maybe a feature to keep you from hitting the button and changing stuck accidentally).

Someone else called this Mr. Reagan's finest performance. Actually, his finest performance is in \\"Kings Row\\", but I am sure these same folks would find that film \\"dated\\" as well.This film has a classic performance by Pat O'Brien. This is not method acting but this is acting of tremendous energy and drive. It perfectly suits the high-compression narrative engine sported by Warners films of the time. Like so many of these films, it is a miracle of dramatic compression. Overall it is a highly stylized narrative style that concisely conveys a load of plot and charcter detail and never, never gives the audience a chance to be bored.The flaccidly paced, european-influenced American films of today have a lot to learn from this \\"dated\\" but delightful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Brien plays Rockne","review":"Earlier in my life, I actually saw Pat O'Brien in person at a summer playhouse in Denver and he reinacted a few of the speeches, which he did of Knute Rockne in this film.

I have found Romanian pronunciation to be no more difficult than any other European language, and the book presents it in a way I found useful. The book's content is both appealing and very easy to understand. As you work through the units it is clear that Romanian is similar in many ways to French, Italian, Spanish etc., and this enables the learner to make progress quickly. This is the best Romanian language book I have found, and is a must for anyone intending to learn this language or travel to Romania."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners; only deals with pronunciation on 2 pages","review":"The subtitle is \\"A complete guide for beginners\\". It's not. Out of 244 pages, only 2 deal at all with pronunciation - one has general rules for vowel sounds, the other consonant sounds. There is a companion audio cassette, but it wasn't mentioned in the ad as a separate item. At the price, it should have been included. Anyway, the Berlitz phrase book -- at less than half the price -- is much more useful for the traveler and for anyone just starting out in the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Tubby Classic LP plus Solid Selections","review":"CD 1 of this set is a re-issue of King Tubby's DUBBING WITH THE OBSERVER original album. IMHO it is one of THE great dub lp's and a great example of King Tubby the mix artist. Incredible mixing. This alone makes the set worth seeking out in absence of a proper re-mastered re-issue of that album. CD 2 here is a fine collection of dub sides of Bunny Lee productions. There is also an informative booklet included, with a heartflet tribute from Steve Barrow, who had already selected this compilation just before Tubby was tragically shot and killed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and fabulous","review":"This book has both my boys (ages 6 & 4) laughing and singing (there is a made-up ditty about Heinrich the Pizza Man) and wanting to read the whole book repeatedly.

I stopped smoking years ago using the principles and information in the third edition of this book and I was very happy to see that there is a new, fourth edition. In fact, this book has more information and support than any other book out there on the subject. The author, David C. Jones, holds your hand through each of the stages of quitting smoking and gives you the knowledge and skills to succeed. It was a great relief to finally read about smoking as a physical addiction - a medical condition - and not just a bad habit that can be overcome by willpower. I always felt like I was a bad person because I couldn't stop smoking. But this book made me look at myself, and at smoking, differently. The true-life success stories and the daily meditations included in this book also inspired me a great deal. This is the best book out there for stopping smoking.

I still remember all the other books quoted HR at some point. The weak point is, however, that for students who need step-by-step, spoonfed explanations, this is not the book, as it requires the reader to have a good level of Maths."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice book for introductory Physics","review":"I am a Chinese Computer Science student and we use this book for General Physics. After one year of study, I find it a nice book for freshmen. Because the authors take much effort trying to explain more Physics phenomena with less demand of advanced Mathematics, students following the book have the opportunities to acquaint Physics with ease and get much reward. It also covers relatively up-to-date development in applying certain Physics principals, which not only broadens the reader's sight but also raises much interest to read more about Physics after class. If the vast volume of after-chapter problems could be more compact and representative, it can be \\"ideal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for first course in Physics","review":"I can't think of any other book which prepares one better for a career in Physics or Engineering.

I borrowed their third edition( Physics Part2) from my college library and wondered why they ever changed it. The fourth edition is an extremely condensed version and is hard to follow.

A very good compilation album but, unless you are a Jerry Lee scholar, you will not know where or when tracks were recorded. And, there is little evidence on the tracks as all quickly fade at end, which accounts for the somewhat brief album running time of 57:16. That means each track is approximately 3:10 (minutes/seconds). The track list is excellent and presented on another review. I would have given this album five stars if the fade-outs had not been abrupt and liner notes incomplete. It is certainly worth the price for very good or better used discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the five seasons.","review":"Phenomenal season of one of the best shows ever on television.

It's a bit more complex than Season 1 in that it really dives deeper into the challenges faced by law enforcement and presents parallels between the law enforcement community and the street gangs. There is an order to this season that feels so good for such a transient moment, it's hard to explain. Overall, another great season."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best TV series ever","review":"Every time I watch another season of The Wire, I am surprised again that this show did not dominate the writing, directing and acting categories of the Emmys and Golden Globes.

The last two episodes left me with my jaw hanging in surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"\\"The Wire\\" is simply the best written drama television has seen in over 40 years. For those who enjoyed \\"Homicide: Life on the Streets\\" \\"The Wire\\" improves on the gritty drama of life on Baltimore's mean streets. To all those that complain that TV is whitebreadland, check this series out. A host of African American actors turn in top-notch performances from the Cheif of Police right down to drug dealers.

This is definitely the type of show you have to watch actively and appreciate the pace of character development for it is slow and requires patience. If you are willing to watch and soak up the realism, versus looking for some mindless patter to occupy your time, you will be rewarded with the most incredible story lines and a show that is so addictive you won't be able to stop watching.

Otherwise the book is a waist of time and it will be better spend if you read the Bible itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecumenical treatise","review":"I was absorbed by this book, having just read Memory and Identity. This book truly reflects on how the church can celebrate difference and still be united in its mission to the world. Truly Christ died for the world and it is in this spirit that the answers are made to the very vital questions that are asked. All religions have a place but Christ is the way to the Father through His sacrifice on the Cross which no other religious leader was called to do. It is this that marks Jesus as the way to salvation and He is the hope of the world. I think any christian or non christian will be challenged by this book and all divisions will fade away as the Truth is seen and received. I pray that with the passing of the Pope that his writings will have a more powerful place in leading other's in the way of Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Hope","review":"I remember when Crossing the Threshold of Hope was on the bestseller list. Although I was interested in reading it, my life was at a particularly overstressed point at that time. I finally caught up with it recently, and it has proved well worth the wait.John Paul the Great was more that a holy man unparalleled in our time. He was a scholar, a historian, a philosopher, a writer, and a teacher. The pages of this book are saturated with his strong yet gentle wisdom as well as his rock-bound faith. I was especially fascinated by his discussion of different religious faiths and how he perceives them fitting into God's plan.This is a book for every person who ponders the mystery of the Almighty, whether or not they are Roman Catholic. Perhaps especially if they are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing the Threshold of Hope","review":"This book is wonderful. Pope John Paul II answers a lot of questions in this book.

Pope John Paul II answers the questions of an Italian journalist with alacrity and succinctness. He carefully expresses his opinions that lifts the shadows off the Truth, revealing it with philosophical expertise.The Holy Spirit was surely using Pope John Paul II to spread the message of Jesus Christ and answer many of the questions that Christians and secularists may have concerning God, life and religion.A major work of Faith defining the Catholic Church and Christianity as a whole. The Pope shows his superior intellect at work. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing the Threshold of Hope","review":"I read parts of this before, the this time I revelled in it.

Right at the beginning of the movie, as soon as they show a shot of the \\"Opera House\\" You can tell that they shot the film at a rate just above a high school. The idea that the Phantom should have a servant is completely out of whack. Also, they could have done a better casting job on Christine, and they could have at least used her real last name. I also comment, the \\"St. Joan\\" opera was a piece of garbage that someone bagged out. I deeply protest that the Phantom would actually HIT Christine! HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN LOVE WITH HER!!! In conclusion, about the only thing related to the book is, Christine's first name. That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.....","review":"I do not recommed this at all for someone who wants some truth to the story line. It's a good movie, in the Hammer House style.

Besides the first two well-known tracks, there's a bunch of other material from two 80's albums he put out. Schilling is admittedly cheesy at times, but undeniably fun, and his lyrics oddly reflect a fascination with armaggedon and sharp criticisms of modern western society. He's a weirdo alright, and I can't stop listening to him.

I found this book extremely helpful in refreshing my mind to the \\"basics\\" of grammar. Ms. Stilman provided enough examples for even those who are slow witted (like myself) can understand. Her style is simple and straightforward without making you feel like an idiot. I highly encourage those who are looking for an easy way in understanding grammar (rules even the average person forgets at times) to buy this book. In fact, it helped me in writing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"Anne's newer book is much more complete. I don't usually need a book on grammar because I don't normally write formally. But I do need a good reference book for those times. In this book, important items are omitted that are included in her newer book of similar nameGrammatically Correct: The Essential Guide to Spelling, Style, Usage, Grammar, and Punctuation. For instance, try to find anything on verb mood in this book and you'll be disappointed. Interestingly, the word, \\"verb,\\" doesn't even show up in the index. Hmmmm... and I thought this was a grammar book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I liked this book. It was very helpfull. She used many examples that clarified otherwise confusing rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"style","review":"The book begins by essentially quizzing the reader. I don't care what the rationale for this is. If you want to feel further discouraged by grammar, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical & Enjoyable","review":"I bought this book based on customer reviews after browsing through grammar books on amazon.com. It has certainly more than met my expectations. There are few grammar books that you can pick up and can't put down. Anne Stilman in \\"Grammatically Correct\\" has forged a new style in presenting information that is both enjoyable to read and provides the necessary rules. This book literally breezes through the basics of spelling, punctuation, grammar and style that meets most of the needs of both writers and editors, yet at the same time holds itself up to the highest standards. The book itself is printed on high quality paper, and has a well-thought out layout and lots of examples, often using passages from well-known past and contemporary writers to illustrate a point. What a departure from all the other grammar or style books I've read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"Despite what the book title \\"Grammatically Correct\\", this book is mostly about punctuation usages. Grammar is limited to a thin, single chapter. There are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages, let alone correct them.I would recommend \\"Painless Grammar\\" over this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammatically Correct: paperback","review":"I am certain that this is an invaluable book for those needing writing help. Yet, there is an extreme drawback to this book, for no matter how well written this book may be, the paperback version is produced with a mere 8 point font throughout-making the book seriously unreadable.If you need the writing help I suggest you spring for the more expensive version of the book, or better yet just buy the latest edition of Punctuate it Right! by Harry Shaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headlamp at a Great Price","review":"I love the fact that this uses LEDs and common (AAA) batteries. This is very bright - plenty of light for anything I might want to do. The fact that it has a Red LED, to preserve night vision, is icing on the cake. I ordered one the first time around, then went back and ordered several more to be used as gifts. (My nephew is going to love it!)Update: Subtract 1 star because I found it turned on in the pocket of my backpack. (It appears that the slider switch moves a bit too easily. I may try something like a rubber band wrapped around the light to try to keep the switch from moving.)On the other hand, add back 1/2 star due to the fact that the light swivels up and down so you can direct the light where you need it.Still comes out at 4.5 stars for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This is one of the worst headlamps I've used. I bought this for my unit's field exercise so I could go on fire watch and bivouac at night without having to worry about carrying a normal flashlight, but when I took it out of my ruck I found that it had burned through two lithium batteries because the extremely sensitive on/off switch had been flipped without my knowledge. The white LED's are standard and nothing special but the red LED barely illuminated the are in front of my feet.This headlamp was extremely disappointing, especially from a brand such as Energizer and I urge you to spend your money on something much more reliable and long-lasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price","review":"Bright enough to work under the car, holds up pretty well, batteries last a while. Price is good.

This light does do this and does this well. I've used this light operationally and it has performed well for me. As noted the by another review the switch can sometimes get turned on and drain the battery, at least the white lights will. I've litterally turned on the redlight to try and kill a set of rechargeables and had to wait three days for the light to dim much. The white light will dim after about 9-12 hours of constant use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I ordered these for use at the nav station on my boat so I particularly was interested in the red light feature to minimize effects on night vision. These are so affordable that I have three of them aboard for night use on deck as needed. I have them hanging from the overhead hand rail at the nav station so they provide light directly to the table when not worn on the head. The beam is very focused and sufficiently bright. The white light is easily bright enough to enhance daytime use at the table. I am very pleased. I don't understand why some were troubled by the fact that they use AAA instead of AA batteries. This is a minor issue and they actually make the unit a little smaller. Certainly an attractive alternate to the much more expensive units available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a nice simple headlamp.

Absolutely produces more than enough light in pitch black conditions. also really good in really low light conditions. If you ever used a regular 2 buck light form some where you know what I mean. The red night vision light is not very bright but does help when the blood sucking insects are hungry at night. The bugs don't want to attack your face as much as compared to a bright white light in the night. The beam has a pretty wide spread it is not just a narrow dot of light in front of you. I have not had to replace the batteries yet. been using camping maybe 20 days out of the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This item has: Long battery life, lightweight, durable, compact, practical, decent value.

So I'm shopping for led headlamps for a third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combat-Proven!","review":"Carried this little light through two deployments, one to Baghdad and one to Afghanistan. I was looking for a larger light and would have spent more money, had my mother not purchased this for me at a big-box store, I guess she braved the falling prices before these lights braved the Asia. For some, it may not be bright enough, but the light was perfect for me. Having a slide switch, as opposed to a single button, was great. One must cycle through the settings on some headlamps, but the slide switch enables one to choose red or white light easily. Did a lot of reading and searching houses and cars with this thing. Wore it on my helmet, head, around my neck, hung from the roof of a HMMWV. A great thing to have at one's use. The batteries last forever, which is great, because sometimes triple-As were tough to find. I just have to rip the padding off the back after six years of hard use, but that was my own fault, spilled something on it. Replaced it with moleskin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headlamp","review":"Bought this for a christmas present, it has both white and red settings which is better for your eyes, and seems to be made very well and is very bright!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"These lights are very bright and fit well. I use them for lobster fishing at night and they are very handy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not AA, it's AAA-powered","review":"The \\"Technical Details\\" section states in two places that the LED Headbeam uses AA batteries. It does not. Only the \\"Product Description\\" text is correct when it identifies the battery type as AAA.ANTOnline not only refunded me their shipping costs, they also sent me a prepaid shipping label to cover my cost to return the product after I pointed out the errors in the ad. I have since shopped happily with ANTOnline and will do so again, because I'm confident that they'll do the right thing by their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to 30 lumens","review":"Ok, it's a handy little light that is very easy to use. The switch goes right for white, and left for red. It works fine in a very dark room or when doing close up work, like the inside of a computer case, or tying up fishing lines. However, it's not even close to 30 lumens - more like 10 - so don't buy this thinking it's going to light your way to paradise. It's not even very good for any outdoor uses beyond arm's reach.There are better options out there for the price. The Energizer 7 LED headlamp is far superior to this one, for only a couple of dollars more. The Energizer 7 does throw 30-50 lumens, and has more switching options, and is much sturdier. Go for that one instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Headlamp","review":"I bought this headlamp over 5 years ago before I deployed to Afghanistan. This rugged, efficient light probably got used 1-2 hours a night (almost always in Red light mode) for 16 months without any issues. I happened to lose my headlamp a couple years ago and I foolishly bought a PETZL which broke within 6 months of use. Luckily I found my Energizer headlamp again and I've been using it ever since. Its already got a spot in my bag as I head out for my third tour soon. This little piece of equipment really delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"What a great value!

Brown, Herbert Marcuse, Antionio Gramcsci, Michael Foucault, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others.I'd suggest you try Rudolf Rocker if you are attracted to liberatarian socialism.

For me, the details got a little overwhelming, but I so much wanted to learn more about this actress that I admire greatly. Sadly, as the author himself stated, it was difficult to write a biography because Greer Garson was a very private person and did not give many interviews or express many personal opinions in public. However, he richly details her movies, her public service, and others' opinions of her (and a good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold). I have always enjoyed watching her many films and am tracking down as many of them as I can on DVD so this made for a fine addition to my collection of her work.

The dialogue that sounded like classic Elmore Leonard was taut and witty, but seemed out of context. Ms. Foster has a hot figure, but her character is more valley girl than sultry temptress. And while I love Owen Wilson's perennially sunny personality and the fact that he makes such an unlikely con artist, he doesn't bring any cynicism or complexity to this role. Even his most cold and calculating lines are delivered in a characteristically laid-back and friendly tone of voice.

I bought the movie because of him! Don't get me wrong: his acting is simple impecable; just a natural born actor. But the movie, oh no!, a comedy with no humor...a thriller with no suspense.

Your music has suffered for years because of the swelled head. As in his music, Buffett has peaked early in his attempt at writing. Stick to telling short stories like \\"Tales to Margaritaville\\". We already know how stinking rich you are; your legions of Parrotheads made you the success you are today. No need to brag and rub our noses in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wanderer's Fantasy","review":"Reading this travelogue was the most fun I've had in a long time. I've always fantasized about touring the back ways of South America just like some 1940's adventurer. Jimmy does just that. His is a fine culture study of Latin American locales interspersed with autobiographical bits about Buffet himself that every good Parrot Head should know.I still want to do a tour like this myself one day, but unless I become independently wealthy, I may have to settle for rereading this book. Fortunately, it's a vivid and fun narrative, so it might be just as good as a trip down the Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"...a Boomer's Concise Guide to Solace","review":"\\"A Pirate Turns Fifty\\" may be one of those idioms of that time and place where a generation of North Americans found some sense of becoming, and then, of being, the first generation of people born beyond the confines of an adversarial view of the human condition.If you enjoy the humor intrinsic in the human experience, Jimmy Buffet serves up a feast of anedotes, yarns, and healthy fictional illusions that repeatedly hit on the folly of taking things too seriously. This little volume exposes Buffet as a truly gifted humorist in a time when humor was verging on the obscene and purely pessimistic side of life. Interleafed with autobiographical sketches, Buffet does a wonderful job at entertaining in the style that Mark Twain so lavishly conjured into American Literature.If you're a Boomer, this is Jimmy's BOOMER ON THE HALF-SHELL, --you'll love it; --and you'll be looking for the sequel. =======> '\\"Bop til you drop\\", ...he whispered.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like that special fish - a real keeper!","review":"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book with the same anticipation as any of Bubba's CD's. I was not disappointed. Maybe it is the fact that I maintain a summer home in the Northern Caribbean (Gulf Shore, AL)or that my daddy flew an albatross as a Coast Guard officer, who knows. All I know is that it is that this book takes me to the beach and the islands whenever I want to go. I was so disappointed to finish it that I was ready to read it again immediately, but I will wait until I go \\"Back to the Beach\\" next month. Jimmy, see you at the Flora-Bama.Fins Up! See all you Dallas parrot heads on September 24."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\" for Parrotheads!","review":"This is Jimmy's best book yet. Mr. Buffett shares some touching personal moments along with many wonderfully humorous tales of his life (so far). As I read this book, it was as if I could hear Buffett's voice telling his own tale. This was one of the best books I have read in a while; extremely entertaining. My friends will have to get their own copy, I'm not letting go of mine. I can't wait for the sequel (the second fifty years)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting For Buffett Biography","review":"If you were hoping to read a Jimmy Buffett biography, you will still be waiting after you complete \\"A Pirate Looks At Fifty\\". This book is not for the sun-bleached parrothead hoping to read about Buffett's sailing days. In \\"A Pirate Looks At Fifty\\", he babbles on endlessly about flying and fly-fishing. Maybe he was hoping to gain a new following of pilotheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring/repetative","review":"Who cares how many planes, houses and hunting lodges he has or the fact that he makes pancakes for the kids. Its a pretty much rub your face in it. I'm rich your not"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the only Jimmy Buffett book that I have not liked.","review":"Think Jimmy was on a Downer when he put this together. His editor needs to be asked why. Buffett is a great writer of songs and books. This just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL...","review":"The first half of the book made sense. The rest is just a history and a daytrip of the Amazon and the Islands he flies over. He lands on a couple but sort of zips by them way too fast. If you want a much better description of the Amazon, read John Grisham's 'The Testament'. I really think he should've concentrated more on either doing a traveloge or a biography. This mixed bag gets annoying flipping between Central and South American history and his life. He should've gave us the bar stories of his life in music and on and off the stage or a really good story of his travels that made him into the man he is. Not a small combination of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written In Response to the Unauthorized Biography?","review":"Jimmy Buffett's \\"A Pirate Looks At Fifty\\" is a disappointing book because he couldn't decide whether to write an autobiography or a travel diary. His stories of his travels didn't excite me that much. To me, it was just a way to brag to the reader about his toys and his wealth. I don't fault him for these things; he's earned them, but it just got old after a while. I would have loved more of a retrospective of his life (to date) from his standpoint, since the unauthorized biography written about him a few years ago was very poorly written. I think Jimmy needs to ditch writing books (his novels/short stories aren't that great either) and lousy musicals and get back to what got him where he is today, and that is making entertaining music which tell great stories in (usually) less than four minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy can do better than this!","review":"I am very disappointed in this offering from Jimmy Buffet. It is obvious that he had a contract to honor and just cranked this book out. Margaritaille was funny and adventurous. This is just a diary and not a very interesting one. I am one \\"parrot head\\" that won't be buying any more of his books. I doubt I will finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories From A Great Storyteller","review":"Jimmmy Buffett tells great stories through his songs and his other books. This is a definite addition to any Parrot Heads library. Even non Parrot Heads will enjoy this trip through the Caribbean, and stories from early in his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"good geography lesson, but otherwise disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I am not a devoted fan but thought the book would be interesting. I was hoping for a more philosphical effort. How he got to where he is in his life. Not a compilation of went to college, did drugs, worked in bars, stopped drugs, learned to fly, etc. The work also contained a lot of, seemingly, unnecessary name dropping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Boredom","review":"If you like airplanes and Jimmy Buffett than this is the book for you. I found it rambling with uninteresting details such as his packing list for his trip and the contents of his flight bag. Its not well written and if the author wasnt Jimmy Buffet than noone would read it. I do love his music and was hoping for more of his life's juicy details. You know he has tons to tell but isnt sharing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, just an advertisement for his CDs,concerts,et","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. Jimmy serves up the same old stuff, barely warmed over. His near constant references to his songs, concerts and earlier books serve as thinly disguised advertisements for those other products. I wish Jimmy would become a little more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tres Ya Ya No","review":"This book reminds me of Jimmy's Margaritaville souvenier store/resturant in Key West--all style and no substance. I don't doubt that 25 years ago, he was sincerely a vagabond poet/pirate, but come on, how much of a vagabond can you be on a Grumann Albatross packed with family, friends, servants, gear, and people willing to fly your two kids back to Florida for a few days so you can fish? I am happy Jimmy has the sort of lifestyle than enables him to spend money foolishly, he's earned it. I just don't choose to read about his methods of doing it. I'm disappointed, it seems to be Jimmy has sold out, when he really didn't need to. What makes it even more sad, is the fact he hung in there all those years, resisted becoming a Yuppie sellout, and now that he's fifty, he's reversed everything he's accomplished in the past. The book was a nice piece of mind candy to pass a few hours with, but don't take this book on vacation with you--it will only make you feel discontented."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing,particularly for a parrothead","review":"please return to the imaginative short stories that you weave so well.this book appears to be a way to get a long central/south american vacation paid for by a publisher.i had to force myself to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much ego for one book.","review":"Should change the title to: \\"RICH BOY TAKES A VACATION.\\" Not much adventure when you get there via floating, flying bachelor pad. Would've been much more interesting if he did it in a sea kayak or a home-made ultra light. Hey Jimmy, he who dies with the most toys still dies. Do yourself a favor and stick to fiction. There are many more adventures out there much more noteworthy. Bush pilots are just shaking their heads in pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who'd have ever thought...","review":"A man who makes such fun music, could entertain with longer vignettes. Thanks for making my three-day vacation seem a little longer and enjoyable!!! Happy B-day Jimmy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, big disappointment","review":"As an avid reader, this book took me the longest to read in quite some time. I couldn't believe I have been reading this since July and I have finally finished. What a bore! The first few chapters on his planes and turning 50 were Buffett all the way, but once his journey started, it bored the hell out of me. My wife read this first and she is a huge Parrothead and she even struggled to get through this inflated tome of ego and geography. This book should have been subtitled: \\"A trip with a middle-aged ex-hippie man with his toys.\\"Sorry, but this is not the classic all those Parrotheads are claiming it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as engaging as I hoped","review":"I love Jimmy Buffet and had high hopes of a rollicking read of his life and trevails around the Caribbean. I found the book fairly disjointed without much continuity and spending too much word space on some very mundane things. This probably would have been better with a good cowriter. I became bored with it, and didn't quite finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pleasant but Empty Book","review":"I like biographies and I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan but I just couldn't get interested in this book. He uses his sea-plane and travels as the literary vehicle for this book but his heart just doesn't seem to be in the whole thing. My guess is that if he wasn't on the hook to produce another book this one would not have been written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!","review":"I picked up Jimmy's latest before getting on a plane for my holidays..big mistake because I could put it down. I found it amazing..I am a huge buffett fan but I didn't pick the book up for that reason I bought it because Buffett and his adventures never cease to amaze me..yeah, he's got money and toys but he has such a carefree attitude and he still enjoys the simple things in life. The only part I didn't like about this book was I was so jealous..he has so much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you have to be a guy?","review":"I am a female Jimmy Buffett fan and was looking forward to reading about his music and his life as a musician in this book. Instead, I get stories about fishing and plane crashes. I couldn't even finish this and I very, very seldom quit a book in the middle. Maybe this was designed to appeal more to his male fans, or nonfans interested in travel, but it didn't do anything for me. Next book, Jimmy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"an unreadable ego trip","review":"A treatise on how to be boring, patronizing, and egotistical. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"A Pirate Looks at 50 is a lackluster effort by my musical hero, Jimmy Buffett. This is not the definitive autobiography parrotheads were hoping for. It seems like something he cranked out to fulfill a contractual obligation with a publisher.Where are the colorful stories that come through in Buffett's music? The details of Buffett's life that we read in this book are mundane, such as the lengthy account of what kind of duffel bag he likes to carry (really!). It also seems that this is a sterilized version of his life, like he has cut out all the unseemly parts that would make for interesting reading.Stick to Buffett's fiction or his music and avoid this disappointing book that is very difficult to read and will burst your impression of this musical legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvin Gardens must be rolling over in his grave.","review":"I did not realize how rich Jimmy was until he told me. I didn't realize how famous he was until he told me. I didn't realize that he has traveled the world until he told me. Jimmy...get over it. I understand that people change in their lifetime, and musical tastes evolve, but what Jimmy has evolved into is an embarrassment. What he once did for the love of his art is now done because he knows faithful fans will buy whatever he puts out. Your time has come and gone. It's a shame that you sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was tougher to get through than Dick and Jane.","review":"It appears that the pirate has forgotten what adventure is. Being pampered by guides and babysitters while pretending to tough out life on his fans' money must be rough. Grow up Buffett! The book is the work of a con man; a way to make Parrotheads spend their money to subsidize Buffett's extravagent lifestyle. His music and his writing ability were better when he was a real sailor and adventurer. His storytelling abilities (whatever the genre) haven't improved with age, they have only molded. Save your money for margaritas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Buffett friend of the Rich and Famous","review":"This book was a supreme disappointment. I was hoping for light heart verse and amusing antidotes. Instead I received drug stories and boring stories about all the doctors and rich people that Buffett knows. He seems to inject into every story the fact that his friend is either,rich,from a famous family,a doctor, or in some way very successful. Jimmy does not seem to know any people that hold average jobs,or do not consume illegal drugs. He is a bore. Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, where are the pearls of wisdom?????","review":"I have always enjoyed Jimmy Buffet's music. Changes in Lattitudes Changes in Attitudes is one of the best albums I have ever purchased. His version of Biloxi is wonderful. I purchased this novel to learn more about the author of such great music, however after reading this book all I can say is boring. So you grew up Catholic, so you got divorced, so you can fly a plane, so what! Where are the inspirational aspects of your life that lead you to write these songs? Where are the contributions to society you have made? Please Jimmy stick to music, fly fishing, and your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"An understanding of every pirate in your life","review":"This book gives a unique birds eye view into the lives of those in our life that have a sense of freedom and adventure.

What an inspiration for the average person to take control of their life and LIVE it rather than existing. Jimmy would be a great role model for anyone who wants some spark and adventure in their life - but still keeps one foot on the ground for stability. A real account of a real good life force from a real great guy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, rambling, and fun","review":"I own no Jimmy Buffett music, but all three of his books. I found this to be less entertaining than his previous two, which I loved, but that is primarily because it's true. Fiction is more fun than real life! But Buffett here provides great summer escapist reading, especially for those of us who work too hard. Jimmy reminds us to take the time to have some fun. He and I have different perspectives on life, but he is a greatly appreciated incentive to relax and enjoy the ride...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy reading and interesting account of JB's adventures.","review":"The book is structured into many small tidbits of Buffet anecdotes. Any true parrothead will enjoy the insites and background behind many favorite songs, and marvel at how a person can be a busy, successful artist, yet come to really achieve some lifelong passions. Life has not passed him by. The book is broken down into many small one to three page bits of history, and the structure may be annoying to some, but it's great for intermittent reading and can be picked up and put down without losing a train of thought. Really enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"I thought that this was a very good desciption of the life and philosophy of Jimmy Buffett, the great songwriter and performer. He gives great description of his life traumas (i.e. plane crash) and his expiriences.

I wish it were more reflective on his career and stories that he has encountered over the years thru his climb into his island cult following. This seems more of a travelogue and inner reflections on his 50 years of life. It is still a good book and one that is hard to put down, so definately recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The drum has quit kicking","review":"Track down all scares about damp spider infested corners of the world with the cool ol' island boy but wipe your tracks.

The glory days strewn in or sewn from his diaries are like the stickers anyway. The niche is a skein of fruit wine to his people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever Written","review":"Jimmy Buffett has summed it all up in this book. His best writting yet. A \\"Pirate Looks At Fifty\\" is not only humorous but it is full of adventure and intresting stories about the past and present of his life. I find this Book to be better than any of his songs. It is basically a song itself. The whole book makes you wish that you were there with him through most of his life. There is nothing bad that I can say about this book. It is fun and intresting from beggining to end. I recommend this to anyone. It is the perfect book for anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the story of the life we have always wanted","review":"People who give this a bad review, in their words, DON'T GET IT !! This is to be read for just the thing it is ....a story about the man who all Parrot Heads admire and why we fell in love with him in the first place.

Much like a Jamaican meat pie, tasty but just barely filling. More to be read between the lines here than a list of facts- more of an analysis than a real clear statement. The feeling I get is that it is ok to have fun, ok to still be confused and maybe we all need a few more toys and time with kids to appreciate life. It is good to know that when I'm 50 I will still be as confused as I am today, and was 25 years ago.

I needed to \\"settle down\\", pay my bills on time and receive an allotted amount of sleep, rest and respectibility. I needed to prepare for \\"my future\\" and to \\"act my age\\" (35). I almost arrived to this particular state of mind about two months ago. I cleaned the house and watered the plants in an orderly fashion. But(t), last week, I picked up Buffett's new book \\"A Pirate Looks At Fifty\\" and began to read. I have since digressed to the days that my parents DIDN'T warned me about. Jimmy once again reminded me that \\"Today's The Day\\" and I had best be gettin' busy with tha FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy, take me with you next trip...Please!","review":"Bubba has never let me down.

That was MONTHS ago, and I'm STILL trying to get through it. Why Mr. Buffet has to resort to constant name dropping, people quoting and song quoting astounds me. Take all that away, and you'd have a book the size of a small magazine. Countless times I've had to stop myself from cursing out loud, and hurling the book across the room! Maybe I can finish by the New Year! Too bad. Stick to FICTION Jimmy...It is infinitely more entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and funny -- bad attitude","review":"I know that his fans will love him for ever... I know that he created a culture where there was none...

His attitude... my friend, take another vacation but this time make an attitude adjustment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh...OK.","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. What an ego ride he was on. Parrotking or not, you don't talk down to the people you are trying to reach out to, to sell your products. Actually, the only reason I'm writing this is because I noticed a few editorial mistakesm (making me think the book was rushed as well) and Buffett seems to contradict stories and liner notes from his albums and other writings. It was an OK read but I guess TRUE Parrotheads will not find any fault in ther self-worshipping idol (reason fans are named after FANATICS). Form your own opinion, not just because you like the guys music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book","review":"Simply put, this is garbage with a cover on it. Those who can finish it are to be praised, but certainly not this exploitation of a following. Sorry, Jimmy, you ripped us off on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something....","review":"Looking over the other reviews, many with 5 stars, I must be missing something. I like Buffett's music, and impulsively picked up the book with the Albatross on the cover since I'm a pilot and would love to fly the Caribbean. I guess I expected more of an adventure story about flying throughout the area, which really didn't start until well into the book. I was looking forward to the author making me feel like I was in the right seat with him while making water landings in exotic ports of call. Alas, the reading was more like watching someone's home movies. Unfortunately one of the most boring I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think it is.","review":"I bought this book to read \\"at the beach\\" thinking \\"what could be more fun than Jimmy B?\\" Well, War and Peace, maybe. Jimmy's accounts of air flight preparations, customs entries, and wave heights on the ocean did nothing for me. I really wanted to know what a 50 year old pirate/singer thinks about!!! Instead I found Jimmy to be a rich rock star who needs 10+ people to assist him in search of his youth. The book is at least 100 pages too long (mostly from his details of fishing and airplane guts). You know what? He made me glad to be almost 50 and NOT the manager of a musical empire in need of an escapist adventure. I still love his music, but won't ever think of him the same way. Buy his music, leave the book on the shelf!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same Old","review":"Once again, I feel like I have been snookered. For nearly 20 years, I have been \\"daydreamin\\" with Jimmy as he takes me from port to port with nothing more than a pair of flip flops, suntan lotion and cold beer. Lately, however, additional baggage has found its way on board. Citation jets, seaplanes, customs greeters and the like are now standard issue if one wants to be a part of the fun. Working stiffs like me who make up the parrothead flotilla can no longer relate to the stories that Jimmy weaves. He fails to realize that simplicity was the one distinguishable feature that set him apart from the others. Let me off this sinking boat, I am getting seasick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egomaniac tells all - poorly!","review":"He really *IS* a pirate! He ripped me off for about $20. Between naming off every one of his friends and acquaintances and showing us how worthless our pitiful, ordinary lives are, I was unable to find anything to like about the book. The least he could have done was share his \\"Famous Dad Pancake\\" recipe.I thoroughly enjoyed his other two books. They seemed to have been 'written'. This one left me feeling that he and his buddies sat around one night after a few beers sketching out ideas on bar napkins, then hastily 'assembled' the result before the buzz wore off. It has almost turned me into a _former_ parrothead.The only redeeming part of the book had to do with his relation with his father. I guess there really is a little humility wrapped in all that ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"It bites","review":"Quick, someone grab the pen out of his hand! How can a person who's been so many interesting places and done so many fascinating things write a book that reads like your mother's grocery list.

Seriously, it was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of pilates--streamlined for those of us with little time","review":"I bought this mostly so that I would have Target Specifics with Jennifer Kries and Target Specifics Plus. I like how those workouts are divided into 15-minute segments so that you can pick and choose which ones to do depending on how much time you have. I also like how those two vary the moves, whereas the precision toning and sculpting videos are more focused, and to me, less engaging. I got bored with them moving so slowly. The others, like Dynamic Cardio, really keep you moving. I hope that one day my coordination and dance moves improve so I can keep pace with them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infernal Affairs","review":"If you are a martial arts fan like myself, and you expect to see martial arts action in this movie, you well be very disappointed. There is ZERO martial arts scenes in this movie. The plot of the movie is very good. There is a lot of suspense and drama as the moles from each side gang/cop attempt to uncover each other. Most of us in the States buy Hong Kong flicks for the EXCELLENT fight scenes, so I don't need to buy a Hong Kong flick for suspense and drama with no fight scenes. Movies like these are a dime a dozen in America. I think this movie is the exception and not the rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hong Kong \\"Heat\\"","review":"This is a brilliantly conceived Michael Mann-esque police drama. It is quintessentially Chinese, with plans inside of plans, broken loyalties, underlying moral dillemas. In the end, it is a very serious, believable portrayal of a corrupted man, and is truly Andy Lau's film. Tony Leung's side of the story is much more conventional. Still, the two stories work together marvelously and transcend the appparent contrivance or \\"high concept\\" of the plot.\\"Heat\\" still reigns supreme in this genre, as its subplots are truly as fascinating as the major action sequences. It portrays the entirety of its characters' lives. Infernal Affairs attempts this but it all seems too rushed and too convenient. Like many Chinese films, it gets very melodramatic at times. But to its credit the film has such strong performances that this is not a detraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping crime thriller....","review":"This is the original smash-hit Hong Kong inspiration for \\"The Departed\\"...only 50 times better. An absolute must see. Tony Leung is great in this and even the often stiff Andy Lau deserves some credit. Anthony Wong Chau-Sang and the always energetic Eric Tsang both take the cake for their superb acting.One thing that just irked me is the hot chick on the cover of the Miramax re-release of the DVD. That piece of arse is none other than Elva Hsiao (or Siu if you prefer Cantonese). She's a famous Taiwanese singer and *snicker ahem* \\"actress\\". Elva was in the movie for no more than a total of 5 minutes. Then why is she on the cover? Hey, sex sells. Slap a hot girl on the cover of anything and it'll sell. Only problem is, \\"Infernal Affairs\\" is an awesome movie that has nothing to do with sex and stands in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST out there.","review":"This film was one of the best written, directed and acted action flix I have seen in a longtime! Andy Lau is the best.

Highly reccomended","review":"This is a truly great film. For those who don't know, this movie inspired The Departed and tells roughly the same story. The DVD port is great, there's no editing jumps, the subtitles work well and the English dubbing is matched perfectly, though several of the characters have inexplicable British accents. I certainly can't explain the cover of the DVD case, though. The girl pictured in the middle a) never dresses like that b) never uses a gun and c) is a minor character at best. I guess they figured butting a pretty lady on the cover would make people more likely to pick it up. I reccomend this movie highly, though I feel it could use a little longer runtime to develop the characters a little more. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for young \\"idealistic\\" hippie, \\"equality\\" closet communist pinkos","review":"This book is perfect for anyone who has a friend that thinks communism is a good idea.

The use of profanity by characters added nothing to the character development. There was no point to having it in the book.Finally the book has very little to do with dragons.

I was also a rabid Paul Michael Glaser groupie, so I was a little concerned at Ben Stiller's take on Starsky. I was hesitant to go to the move, but decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Although the movie didn't follow the show exactly, Ben's portrayal or David Starsky was right on the money! He had his physical movements down pat, ran like him, stood like him and really had the part down! I wonder how many hours he studied for this. I will say that I wasn't as impressed with Owen Wilson's take on Hutch. He was ok, but I'm afraid he's a little to nasally for my taste.All in all though, it was a lot of fun and it was great seeing that \\"undercover\\" blazing red Ford Torino again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME, DONT BELIEVE ANYONE ELSE!","review":"This movie was outright hilarious! Most people who slammed this movie dont know anything about comedy. If you liked any other films by Stiller and Wilson, YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE! I thought the story line was perfect, because it allowed the insertion of hilarious offshoots and parts that were not necessary in the overall outcome of the plot. Great cameos by WILL FERRELL and the old Starsky and Hutch from the TV Show. Oh, also, most people who reviewed this also cared if it matched the authenticity of the TV Show. WHO CARES???? I honestly thought it was and still is, the funniest movie of 2004!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"There's two things you can't go wrong with - Starsky & Hutch and Ben Stiller. I'm a HUGE fan of the TV series and there are tons of jokes that reference the original series. Ben Stiller nails a \\"cartoon\\" version of Paul Michael Glaser's Starsky. Owen Wilson's Hutch is nothing like David Soul's rendition, except that he's blonde. Still, when he breaks out the guitar and sings \\"Don't Give Up on Us Baby\\" I could hardly stop laughing. Even if one does not get the references back to the original show, it's a very funny movie that pokes a lot of fun at the 70s. Stiller and Wilson work well togther and make an excellent team. Snoop gives his own fun spin to Huggy. Will Farrell, while his part is small, is the icing on the cake. Great movie, a lot of fun. A sequel could be a great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"From the reviews and recommendations from friends, this movie looked pretty funny.

Not much, but enough. Enough to make it a pleasant ride. The whole thing starts off slowly, though. I was ready to give up after the first twenty minutes. But give it a chance.The plusses? It keeps the corn to a minimum, there's a nice rapport between Stiiller and Wilson (although they were much better in Zoolander), and the script eventually becomes whimsical enough to be engaging. There's also a nice cameo by Will Ferrell.I guess one question needs to be raised. What the heck happened to Juliette Lewis? She's reduced to a pathetic role without even so much as a couple of decent lines. One would think that an actress who had such a fast start in Hollywood would retire before taking on a role like this.

Snoop Dogg and vince Vaughn costar in which Starsky and Hutch try to stop a drug dealer. Will Ferell is in the funniest scene with \\"two dragons\\". After that scene, you'll be on the floor laughing. The accent that Starsky adopts at the end is funny (just do it), and the horse scene along with the chinese kid that throws knives are also funny. There are so many more funny scenes, like when Starksy takes drugs by accident. Believe me, it's really funny and is worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Movie, but it sure ain't the Original S&H....","review":"This fairly amusing spoof, homage, whatever you want to call it, was an ok movie, but nothing special. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or an action drama, and ended up being not much of either. It doesn't hold a candle to the original series at all, nor to the original stars. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, while likeable, can't possibly begin to match the chemistry of their original counterparts. It's like comparing classic Coke with new Coke- change the formula, and it just ain't the same. The best part of the film was when Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul finally show up at the end- what a nice treat to see them with the Torino. It makes me wish they were the stars of this movie. It's a shame the movie execs did not go that route. Still, it's worth seeing if you're a fan of the show or just plain curious. Just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike Two for Stiller and Wilson","review":"This movie is not funny, relying on the same inane \\"comic\\" interplay between Wilson and Stiller that propped up Zoolander. The comic talents of these two actors are simply not up to vanity projects like Starsky and Hutch. It just plays as silly and infantile.Ben Stiller was far more effective in this season of Curb Your Enthusiasm where Larry David exploited Stiller's main attribute: he plays a great twit.And no matter what you read from the politically correct out there, Snoop's performance was a joke - truly amateur. Though he certainly looked the part, his performance seemed read from cue cards, at best.The best part of this movie was the cameo by the series actors at the very end of the movie, followed by a dialogue free stretch of streets scenes using the Torino, and S&H; running down an alley like much like the title sequence of the 1960s Batman show."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it no stars if possible. Gad, what a waste....","review":"...of time, talent and money. This could have been such a funny movie, but they really blew it. As a fan of the original series I thought that this \\"remake\\", or \\"re-interpretation\\" if you will, had the potential for some serious laughs - even if they had played it straight. Boy, was I ever disappointed. A big part of the old series was the chemistry between the two stars - Stiller and Wilson just have none. They were both too busy trying to be individually funny - and failing. The only bright spot in the movie was Snoop Dog's portrayal of Huggy-Bear, performed with his tongue planted firmly in cheek. Julianne Lewis was completely wasted in her throw away role as the brainless mistress of Vince Vaughn's equally one-dimensional thug. All in all - hardly worth your time.

That is probably the only reason to not really like this movie.

I always like Ben Stiller, but this movie doesn't show him off as well as Meet The Parents. The black lady's rendition of that Captain & Tennille song can only be called sacreligious. I guess one could call it a fun/upbeat movie, but it is **not** funny. The only two things keeping this off the worst possible rating are Carmen Electra and Juliette Lewis. Juliette blazes my world white-hot, but she is not in many movies anymore for some reason. The other cheerleader [besides Carmen] is also a babe. There was one minor breast cleavage outline from behind, but I guess they were trying to keep the rating not so harsh, so as to draw a more mainstream audience. This can be summed up easily by saying:wait for rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD FOR ENTERTAINMENT BUT----","review":"Stiller and Wilson upheld their parts as did Vince Vaughn - Bateman and Snoop Dogg - the story had some comidic parts but it was just slightly above average.Still not bad for entertainment - the gals were beautiful - the guys were into their parts - the car was great despite its dents - loved the end where the two originals showed up.Huggy Bear had quite a range of wild duds.Not a classic but it will do.

But the two of them make this, after all why else was it made(?), and thats it.The extra features on the DVD are pretty dull, a few wisely deleted scenes(-though one features an amazing butt), some mockumentary about how everyone hated making the film(-this gets old very quickly), outtakes of Stiller and Wilson and the rest stopping takes because of laughing(-reinforcing the uselessness of such features) and a short Snoop segment featuring him in his various 70's Huggy costumes.Rent this, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Forgotten About Very Quickly","review":"I watched this movie, with the intention of a good laugh and seeing some very cool 70's action.I was very dissapointed with it. I could count the funny incidents on one hand and I think I had to wake up my wife when it was over.It does have it moment's, but will certainly not go down as a classic - not that the movie should be avoided at all costs, as it is not quite a Battlefield Earth type of bordem but I would hire the movie to watch rather than buy it...I don't think it would get to many multple viewings....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson ruin it!","review":"The only thing I liked about this film was the cameo appearances of the real actors from the \\"Starsky & Hutch\\" tv series (ABC, 1975-79), Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul.Starsky & Hutch - The Complete First Season.Looks more like a Zoolander 2.\\"Easter Egg\\" in Special Features: When the yellow star is on Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel or theatrical trailer, press the right button.

(Ben)-dover, please don't make anymore movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie EVER!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! In this movie Starsky is protrayed as a psychiatic control freak, who is nothing like the series Starsky. Hutch is protrayed as a dirty cop who is involved in criminal activities, nothing like the series Hutch. Huggy Bear is protrayed as a criminal not as a police informant. Take my advise don't buy or rent this movie it BITES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great...","review":"I was 13 years old when the series originated and have seen every episode several times. I have purchased seasons 1 and 2 on dvd from Amazon and was at first concerned that the show would not be quite as enjoyable as I remembered. The fact is that viewing these episodes after all this time I find that the original series was really great and that Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul, Antonio Fargas as well, not only acted well but that the action was top notch. Which brings me to this movie. I like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, both very talented guys. This could have been great instead it was full of low end cheap dialogue and situations. It has absolutey nothing to do with the original series regarding wit, character or integrity. It shows these chacters as bafoons. Hey I enjoy senseless bad taste as much as the next guy but it has to be at least funny. Don't waste your time with this movie, watch the original series."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're going to do something -- do it right.","review":"I'm not a purist who can't abide a satire of a classic TV show -- I loved the irreverent Brady Bunch movies -- but I found little to laugh at in this lame outing.The Brady Bunch movies were funny because they captured the essence of the show and then infused the satire. This movie captures the look and feel of the 70s, but Stiller and Wilson are NOT playing Starsky and Hutch. They are playing Stiller and Wilson in Starsky and Hutch clothing.Starsky was not an uptight, humorless stiff as played by Stiller and Hutch was not a crooked, bribe-taking cop as played by Wilson!I'm not an indignant fan who says \\"How dare they!\\" Just a fan of the old show -- I was a high school girl during its intial run and their posters adorned my bedroom wall -- who feels that if you're going to parody S&H;, get it right and don't simply use the premise as a vehicle for Stiller and Wilson's familiar schtick.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is enough","review":"Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong. Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for. With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than meets the eye","review":"I love this movie and decided to buy it on DVD. now I consider myself a tough critic (I have Animal House, Fast Times, Stripes, Spies Like Us, Fletch, Billy Madison, Napolean Dynamite, etc) and this movie has a lot of subtle, and hilarious, moments. For example, Will Farrell might be one of the most overlooked players in this flick. As Big Earl, he's friggin' awesome: ...I'm not gonna lie, things are gonna get weird. Two dragons...\\" AMAZING!

Stiller & Wilson don't tread new ground. We've seen them act like this before. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETHING BEYOND THE RETRO FASHION FEST WOULD'VE BEEN NICE!","review":"More of a costume party than a real film, with more 70s references than plot points, Starky & Hutch is mostly about Stiller and Wilson playing dress-up, jiving with each other and making countless 'insider' jokes about the mod/pop culture of 30 years ago.And when they run out of ways to make fun of afros and other sundry items of retro fashion, they resort to leering at bimbos (enter Carmen Electra and Amy Dumb), making what starts out as just harmless junk into callow, obvious junk.Most of the 'jokes' seem targeted at the 13-18 year-old male demographic. On a humorous scale of 1 to 10, it scores a magnanimous 0.5 -- idiotic and disturbingly reliant on a conversance and affection for a television show that most of us remember as being about a red Grand Torino if we remember it at all.Two stars for the occasional funny moment that sneaked in."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"I just saw this hilarious movie. I knew it was going to be good when i heard the song can't smile without you playing during the opening credits. I was taken by the way this film had enjoyable comedy. I thought it would be mediocre but fun but it was all fun. Thumbs Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Movie, but nothing special","review":"Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are wonderful comic actors with little breadth in their vocabulary as characters. They are playing the same energies they play in every other film in Starsky & Hutch, and it still works. But this film is not going to be one you watch over and over. It's just not funny enough, with some special prize moments peppered into an otherwise perdictable and drab story. I still liked it. It was fun. I just didn't bust a gut the way I had hoped... Go ahead and wait for the video release. You gain nothing by rushing to see this on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for a laugh","review":"Going into this movie, I wasnt expecting much. And I was right after only finsihing it half way through the movie. I tried to laugh, really I did, but when I was laughing, I was laughing at how bad the humor was. Ben Stiller just didnt work the part for me. Seemed like he was trying to hard. Owen Wilson didnt work the part for me either. And I wasnt buying Vince Vaughn as the bad guy either. Snoop Dogg was pretty funny though, but the movie just didnt do anything for me. GO rent DODGEBALL instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very displeased","review":"I am very displeased at the fact that they debited my account before the item has been shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Lousy DVD. Inexcusable.","review":"The film is quite good, I'd say 4 stars. Not Barbara Steele's or Antonio Margheriti's best (that's probably Black Sunday/Castle of Blood), but a very good, enjoyable film.But this DVD is really lame. For more, see the other review here, but suffice it to say, these guys obviously encoded an old worn-out VHS tape with bad audio built-in and acted like it's a serious DVD. No, it's terrible. I guess if it's the only way to see the movie it's worth a rent on bargain day, but otherwise forget it, and avoid releases by this company. Even worse than Alpha video.

What at first glance appears to be a collection of Latino penned stories about their love lives and interests is in fact more of a collection of essays underscoring the pervasive fetishization of men of color (here, Latinos) in the mainstream gay community. The wonderful pieces by Arenas,Campo, Castro, and Manrique, for example, are exceptions to the rule. But I found many other pieces down-right offensive--I thought I was reading the Spartucus Guide!

That is the formula. That is how you become a powerful creator in this physical world of time and space.Unfortunately this program takes just one piece of that formula and expands it as if it was the entire universe.

All I can think of us the starving children in Africa and the genocide in Darfur, and IF ONLY the recipients of such atrocities knew \\"the secret\\", they too would prosper, and not be in such a predicament.The really sad thing is the shallow, self-centeredness of applying the law of attraction....cars, houses, a lot of money.

The principle of \\"The Secret\\" is to try and help the reader tap into the hidden power within. Through the use of positive thoughts one allegedly will attract money, power, health and happiness.

Once you are able to find that peace, then you will be able to enjoy life more abundantly, Love more, Laugh more and see more. To those of you who are Christians, you will get it Immediately.

And frankly, 20 minutes in this thing turns into an infomercial on how to get rich. Also, I didn't appreciate hearing blame put on people who get sick, as if the reason they got sick was because they didn't think positively or because they didn't truly belive that they would get better. Like, how do you account for those positive spiritual people who got cancer from the environment they lived in? Thoughts are very powerful but they cannot overcome everything and this video pretty much claimed that thoughts could overcome anything. Another thing I didn't like were all the \\"miraculous\\" stories that were told with no fact or proof to back them up. To me, this video is a HUGE hit to Opera's credibility. I will never trust her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Since watching The Secret back in 2007 my life has changed in so many ways.

Of course they mention \\"oh, yes you have to do something than just sitting and wishing...\\" but it is the actual WORK that you do that gets you where you want to be, NOT THE WISHING. The secret, I believe, is just another pseudoscience that replaces the placebo effect.

But if you are open minded and willing to try to be positive and go for what you really want (what's the harm in that???), then I highly recommend viewing. People who claim this is a cult are silly. Cults want things from you (money, submissions, etc). This is actually a lifestyle choice, and this film is a great source for explaining the Law of Attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not a Secret anymore.","review":"This is not new information, it has been around for many years in one form or another.

Start focusing on the positives around you rather than the negatives. Your ATTITUDE is key! Nobody likes being around a \\"negative\\" person.If you want something bad enough, then keep telling yourself what it is you want (like a teenager wanting his/her drivers license). The more you stimulate your mind about reaching and accomplishing your goals, the quicker they will happen and the more people you will begin to attract into your life.It all starts within you. You have to like and believe in yourself first, which then opens your doors to the rest of the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"is God excluded from the secret?","review":"This DVD is purely new age.

And it's so intensely focused on acquiring material posessions, money, trips, etc. I've gone to a seminar called the Landmark Forum in which there is a much more intellectually rigorous examination of similar concepts, and it was a powerful and meaningful experience.

I have seen it do wonders in my life and the lives of my friends. Other than that, it contains only the incoherent rantings of philosophers who claim to be scientists.

This DVD and the book both explain that if you dwell on the GOOD instead of the BAD you're going to attract that into your life! This is real! It works! I\\"ve read several \\"self-help\\" books and motivational books. The basic principles are in all of them, this DVD just takes them \\"over-the-top\\" with real people and real situations.

How many gullible (or lazy) folks are sitting at home thinking of winning the lottery instead of thinking about how they can earn the things they desire. Magical thinking will leave you with nothing but regret from wasting time imagining attraction instead of actually doing something. I should write the alternate book called \\"The other secret\\" which billions of people already know: If you do it, it will be done! Guess what, you get a job, you earn money!

So don't blame corrupt politicians and businessmen for your inability to make enough money to pay your bills, the problem is within you.

So, when I hear someone say such powerful things about some form of teaching, I'm immediately interested. This ridiculous pile of garbage is nothing more than a doctors amazing knowledge of marketing techniques and new spins on old ideas. This \\"movie\\" takes old school neuro-linguistic programming and makes the watcher/reader focus on the smallest most insignificant area of themselves.

I do not think that if you simply think posotive about something that you are just going to get it. I think that you should work hard and be re-warded for it.I do not agree with another comment that was made about GOD not being in the movie. I think that the movie was aimed for everyone and not just a specific religion. When you think about it god plays a role in spirtuality and not a massive role in mentality. A crazed killer can say that god is one with them but that their spirituality speaking not the mentality of the person.Overall though it is a good dvd to watch but it's one of those movies just like religion you either take seriously or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"attraction -- \\"the power of positive thinking\\"","review":"The secret is \\"attraction\\".

First of all, I think a 10 year old could of done a better job putting a movie together than these people. Secondly, how can these people leave GOD out of the total equation of how the universe works? This should sound warning alarms for any Christians out there! Thirdly, they state that the secret behind the SECRET is the Law of Attraction: That like attracts like. They even quote quantum physics. However, anyone who has studied physics knows that like does not attract like, opposites attract. Perhaps they were thinking about the chemistry concept of Like Dissolves Like; I don't know. Needless to say, I agree that people should conduct their lives in a positive manner, but also understand that GOD is in charge, not us.

This movie in essence is several capsulated formulas and postulates that will help anyone seeking to change the way they think....change the way that they view themselves and the world they CHOOSE to LIVE in and be.

I found it inspiring and although you think things like \\"Follow Your Bliss\\" and \\"You are the designer of your own destiny\\" may be cheesy or obvious, the messages in THE SECRET are ones that we may think we know, but forget or really don't live by. I watched this online and want to buy the DVD to have on hand to watch at home when I start to get negative and feel defeated.

While I liked The Secret's overall positive message and that it's getting out to a broad audience, I do agree with it's detractors that it's very surface and pretty hard to put into practice (it's an MTV-style gloss-over). But I'm mostly annoyed that I didn't get to see the one presenter I really wanted to see and who has been discussing LOA for years longer than anyone else in this video.

Are there actually good and bad creatures of nature, or just those we perceive as such? Are blue caribou good and wolves bad? Are doves heavenly and snakes devlish?

It was more powerful to hear and see the people who I read about in the book as they came to life on the screen and helped to solidify the understanding of how The Secret works.I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to make a positive difference in their life for now and years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the simpe truth even if you don't want to believe it...!!!","review":"I would love to see this in the schools and any place where people gather. If you are honest with yourself and just sit down right now and think... you will have to admit that everything in your life up to this point is exactly how you pictured it would be good or bad. If you don't like the picture as it stands then you must go deep within your being to change the outcomes that you don't particularly like in your life.I have always said if you think it you can do it and I am a living example of this law before I even new the \\"attraction or intention\\" definition for this ability...and the beautiful thing is you are only limited by your own connection to the universe. Regardless if you call it faith, attraction, intention or any other name you can muster the outcome and potential are still the same.I highly recommend this DVD and I watched it with my wife and children ages 13 and 10 and our lives have never been the same!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental but overlooked truth","review":"Having read Jack Canfield and listened to his course on Effortless Success, I found the points covered in this movie easy to accept and understand. Might not be so for everyone, but for me, The Secret underscored what is already manifesting in my life--that whatever I focus on becomes my experience.The Law of Attraction is one term for it, but it's been around for thousands of years in one form or another. The challenge is to learn how to change ingrained ways thinking so that you invite what you want and what benefits you and others. The people behind the movie (and in it) understand this and have discovered a variety of approaches to making that mental switch. I happened upon Bill Harris through a chance email from a friend, and Holosync has worked for me now for several years.Regardless of the negative reviews here, you and anyone you care about deserve to experience the movie. Try to learn from it. You will be rewarded if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret","review":"A great substitute for reading the book. I felt like the DVD was in-depth and answered my questions about \\"The Secret.\\" It is religiously inclusive and reminds you to keep a postive outlook on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content.","review":"This version is in Mandarin. I think the Mandarin translation is better than the original English version!If you are open minded, this film has fantastic content! \\"The Secret\\" is learning to harness physics to influence your life in positive ways. Not an easy task. I have understood this for a long, long, time. But, I am yet to master the Universe! That being said, my wife and I find this film to be very inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful insight on how to attain a great life","review":"The Secret contains useful information on how to channel positive thoughts to attain great things. It is true that our thoughts determine our feelings and feelings influence our behavior. At a first glance the process seems easy but like everything else it requires time to get used to thinking and feeling in an optimistic way, and to practice the little steps of the creative process. I would recommend watching the film several time to a get a good grasp of its message.However, I believe there's one very important thing this film is missing which is how to get rid of the emotional baggage that is causing the negative thoughts. Getting rid of insecurities, guilt and shame from the past is not easy and requires dedication, willingness and in many cases professional help. Thus, I believe The Secret can be extremely useful once an individual has unburdened him or herself of most of those old beliefs and is ready to soar!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Not The Original Version As Claimed","review":"Be careful when ordering this particular DVD from this vendor.

I was hopeful that The Secret would at least be something new. It's not. Don't get me wrong, there is value in creating a vision for the future. Envisioning yourself succeeding, \\"seeing\\" everything down to the detail and tapping into what that successful \\"future you\\" has to \\"say\\" are all good practices to help you get where you're going. But the secret is, \\"Its no 'secret'.\\"Unfortunately, like most repackaged self-help pseudopsychology/pseudo-metaphysics this puts a fancy wrapper on stuff people were writing about in the 1920s and before.An interesting question that this psychology fails to answer is \\"Why then are so many miserable people successful, and so many successful people miserable?\\"Watch the first 10 minutes if you have AmazonPrime, otherwise move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is","review":"a sucker born every minute..nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public..insert your own cliché about scams here"},{"rating":"1","title":"fail to deliver","review":"I have never received it this Item and I have already paid for it, please find a way to get to me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Waste of money- all this is is common sense- you don't need to buy this to understand that if you think positively and do good things, good things will happeto you"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!!","review":"This is full of things that are already in a million and one things out there now.

One star for a basically positive message, under a heap of junk. They talk about how being poor or rich is a function of your thinking. I found that overgeneralization really stomach turning. What about all the thousands of years of bloody struggle for equality? It's ongoing, and a good deal of it is more involved than self-absorbed positive thinking. I'd been hoping it was just another inspiring self-help film, to get me out of the rut of my week, but instead it became a nightmare of outlandish and offensive generalizations. Maybe if I'd been able to get past the ridiculousness I could have enjoyed it. I'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This movie is just a total waste of time.

I can't say how ridiculous I thought this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is just repackaged karma. The idea that there is some mystical force that governs the quality of your participation in life is a joke. I don't need a video to tell me that I am mostly responsible for the content of my life. The idea that we are all walking/talking radio tranceivers is laughable.Anecdotal stories are not convincing or impressive.

Even if you read or have the book, the DVD is EXCELLENT for those like me who are very visual. In 2006 it came into my life right after my sons daddy passed away and he was 5 1/2 years old at the time. He watched it with me over and over and he even has his own favorite speakers. The DVD is exactly what I have always believed in and lived but couldn't put it into a visual format. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret","review":"I purchased the DVD for The Secret. With our busy schedule and so many task to accomplish, sometimes we forget about of selves and go into a rut. I think we need a reminder once in a while of our needs and how to handle certain situations and The Secret, in my opinion, remind us of our internal gift that we already have and need to be reminded of it and use it.

I would recommend anyone to use Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little much","review":"The basic point of the \\"Secret\\" is to believe in yourself.

Instead of spending money on this pathetic piece of plastic you could instead put it in savings, 401K, your kids college fund, etc. The only people getting rich off of this are the people making it.

It WILL help several someones and that is what's most important!I needed to hear these messages again, and being the drama queen I am, a good soundtrack helped to further elevate my spirit & renew my interest in taking control of my own happiness again.Regardless of the higher power that you believe in, this movie will help you seek your answers from within. They are there, ready to change your life for the better!Highly recommended to those who need uplifting or know someone who does.You can't please everyone all the time.

I also heard about it on an HBO talk show late night then my mother mentioned it in a telephone conversation so I ordered it. I think it was very well done but I have been exposed to these principles before, I guess I was expecting something totally new because of the name \\"The Secret\\". You can find out a lot about the law of attraction, and positive thinking from Wayne Dyer and others. Don't get me wrong this is not a meant to be negative feedback, I do accept what \\"The Secret\\" has laid out as being real. I have one question - What is the name of the 100 year old book (and the author) that was given to Rhonda Byrne by her daughter that seems to have sparked the research?[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Own Forum","review":"Have had this special DVD for a while.

This type of a perspective on the universe would only be so popular in a White American materialistic culture. The implications of this thinking are so vast and selfish that i cannot even begin to unpack them in my review.

Stop thinking so much about how you can get yours and reach out your hand to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying an informercial","review":"After watching the DVD , I felt ripped off. What i saw were a number of people talking about the law of atraction with no technique . It all leads to a CD they want to sell for over three hundred dollars .

However I would endorse the sedona method which by the way is represented on the secret CD ."},{"rating":"2","title":"the power is always in you!","review":"This is a GREAT tool to do ANYTHING! Because it make you responsible of your power, your acts and beliefs. Having faith is good as long as you have faith in love and abundance, but sometimes we have faith in the sad world we live in, in the evilness of people, in the limitedness and ruthless of the laws we obey or disobey. We tend to think that our lives are dificult and painful and that that's the way it should be, but those are misconceptions and films like this prove it consistently. Anyway... GREAT WORK!.... and if you are looking for more and deeper I would recomend you \\"What The Bleep do we Know\\", another masterpiece of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"How refreshing. Yet another attempt at convincing people that accountability is a thing of the past. If you have a bad or compulsive thought nagging at you and its not in your best interest, you may as well indulge your whim because you cannot control the mystical powers that are forcing you towards acting on your self destructive thoughts or habits.While it is true that a person is much more likely to achieve their dreams with focus and a positive attitude, I hardly think that it is a secret. Just good \`ol common sense, motivation and attitude are required."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an info-mercial, so don't waste your hard earned cash","review":"Unbelievable! The only thing the secret did was re-package the concepts of chi and postive thinking. Try it...go to their websites for more professional infomation for them...only to find links to their packaged materials and books for purchase. I'm so dissappointed in Oprah for taking her cut from this project and running with probably millions of dollors for a fluff piece with no real assistance or newly gained knowledge. Work hard...do your best...It's when you do these things that your life really changes. Not, standing in a window wishing for a necklace or bike. Sad statement on our societies true desires!

If we believe we can change ourselves then we believe we can change others. thus putting us in grave danger of becoming tyrants and self serving, ego maniacs. The only thing that can truly change anyone is, the savior Jesus Christ. We must wash our minds with scripture and let God transform our lives, only then can we receive what our hearts truly desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Film","review":"The quality of the filming is excellent.

It makes it look so \\"easy\\" just think about it enough and it will be yours.Ok. I believe that negative thoughts can bring negative energy, and good thoughts bring good energy and all that.

I've read the book, it's easy to read, a very short book. What does it even say? Oh we can change things and make things come to us. Yeah, I guess you can. Maybe, if you work hard and get a bit lucky, then you can achieve your dreams. But this book doesn't really tell you how to do that, it just offers some pseudoscientific nonsense about how to do it. It offers people false hope. A starving child in Nigeria couldn't use this method to get food. Why should you be able to use it to get a leg up in life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could have given it no stars","review":"The real secret is that people people take advantage of those who are gullible enough to beleive this garbage. While I agree that there is power in positive thinking, it is ridiculous to think that everything you have (or don't have) in life is the result of your thoughts. An abused child was not abused becuase they had negative thoughts. People don't die becuase they walk around with negative thoughts. And to say that people have success because they imagine it is equally ridiculous. People are successful becuase they work hard. Your doctor didn't become a doctor by imagining what it would be like to cut people open. I don't think you would want to go to him/her if their success was built on that! They worked hard. That's the secret to succes. It helps to motivate you if you have a positive attitude, but things don't fall in your lap becuase of it. This movie was free, but I feel like I should have been paid to watch this propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what was expected.","review":"I used the Secret (both the book and this video) for a Wednesday night Bible Study at my church. We were doing a 10-week Cult Study. So, I chose the Secret for one of my resources while discussing the New Age Religion. It was exactly what I expected and was actually very clear regarding the \\"gospel\\" it is preaching. The basic line runs: you are in control, you control your destiny, you can even control your environment. One of the ladies interviewed actually said plainly, \\"you are god.\\" You can't get much clearer than that. Nor can you contradict the Gospel of Jesus Christ more severely than that. Be aware when you purchase this product, you are not hearing a neutral \\"spiritual\\" talk. You are hearing a gospel that does not lead to life. Anyone who is willing to be honest with themselves will admit, even if to only themselves, \\"I am not in control.\\" Look to the King of kings, Jesus Christ and be saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown","review":"I see how this could be attractive in theory, but seriously?
