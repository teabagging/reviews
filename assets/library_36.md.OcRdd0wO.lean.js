Contrary to poplular belief electronic music does not have to be dancy and although this album does have a beat I don't feel a person should think this album is in any way generic techno. I know that there are people out there who enjoy ten to twenty minute songs because I am one of them.....I am a long song junkie. Anyone else partial to slightly long songs that they can visualize and concentrate on will love (just like I do) the last track on this mind-bending cd. The name of the song is STAMP and it is about 14 minutes long and amazing all the way through and that is why this track is my favorite. The third track JOURNEY is also exceptionally good. So in close any person who is exploring the surreal world of mind exploring electronic music should not miss out on this great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trine, yes.

No. If you have been hardened and jaded by the grittiness of today's films, this lighthearted fare won't please you. But if you want to experience the fun of the eighties, this is a perfect film.BTW, to the reviewer that had not heard of Robby Benson, look him up. Not only did he have many films that did well, he moved to voice work. The Beast in Beauty and the Beast. You know, Disney. First animated film nominated for Best Picture Oscar.

The author's insistence that Americans lost the tank battle at Sidi Bou Zid due to the superiority of German tanks is absolutely false.

In fact, it is one of the few books other than Stuart Wilde's e-book, Gods Gladiators, that covers the subject.There is way more theory than practice presented in the book, but anyone with at least a little knowledge of the astral will be able to put the information to practical use.One of the book's weakness is that there no teaching of the spirit, only a teaching of a mortal soul (astral body) and mortal physical body. Thus it can be a very grim book at times. However, many astral travelers report that there is indeed an spiritual component to humankind, and this should be born in mind by any reader.There is also a tendency on the authors part to present his views as the ONLY correct reality, no exceptions. For those who have had actual experience in the astral, it is clear that there is a greater truth than presented in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title was the best part of this book!!!","review":"Contains a lot of bad information.

The author believes astral experiences fall into two categories: negative and/or illusionary. The author is only listed as G.Travels and says it is 'necessary' for him/her to remain anonymous.

I have heard the seats will fade after time outdoors, but that is okay. It will get lots of use! I love the pendulum effect, which prevents pinched fingers like so many others.

We've had kids as young as 3 and as old as 14 playing on it and they all enjoy it. We have definitely put it through the wringer and it's holding up really well. You can run a chain through the middle and \\"lock\\" it so the kids cannot play unsupervised.We were hesitant to let Grandma spend this much money, but she insisted and we have been very grateful We have definitely gotten her money's worth out of it!

I won't get into the specific details except to say that the ending will give you nightmares!! Trust me on that! The remaining two episodes is about a Nazi War Criminal who gets his \\"just rewards\\" and the other episode stars Joan Crawford who is desperate to get her eyesight back. Overall, this is an OUTSTANDING DVD to those who remember Night Gallery with Rod Serling, and a great introduction to those who might want to get the series on DVD. I can't recommended this highly enough!! If you want to get SCARED then GET THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS tape a bit noisy","review":"I recalled being really scared watching this as a kid, so I purchased this tape. I still have a vcr/dvd combo unit, but it's a Phillips brand and not the best quality player. My good hi-fi unit got crushed in a move, and the ones you find at Goodwill are usually damaged in some way. So I guess I'm stuck.I only watched the first episode, and it started out with quite a bit of noise in the audio. It mostly cleared up after the first few minutes. Not sure if Season 1 on DVD has these 3 pilot episodes. For the money, I guess it was an OK purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible blunder","review":"This is the third in the Matthew Hervey series and the last I will read. Mallinson's editor needs to find a new line of work. In a blunder of astonishing magnitude, Mallinson kills off his most sympathetic character Henrietta, Hervey's wife. Her death is oddly pointless in a novel that has no dramatic momentum whatsoever. In a final, and unforgivable slap in the in reader's face, he doesn't even bother to finish the work. O'Brian, Forrester or Kent would never have treated their readers with such disdain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great brand, but Stick with black!","review":"These people make the best dryers around. The problem I have, is that the paint they use rubs off with use. They look horrible after a few months. Buy the black ones, they are awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great power but too much weight","review":"This is a wonderful hair dryer for someone who can bench about 150 lbs. It is very sturdy and is a quick drying machine which helps reduce the frizziness factor. However, it is too heavy to operate easily. The red is fun if you need a splash of color for the bathroom. Otherwise I would recommend another Turbo Power machine which weighs less. By the way I do practice yoga and do some weight lifting so I am not a wimp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books.","review":"Worth every penny. Great reading. I love Michael Savage. He's a true conservative unlike Rush, O'Reilly and Hannity.

I love to cook, but when I get home from work the last thing I want to do is spend hours in the kitchen, especially in the summer. The book claims that all these recipes can be made in 30 mins or less, and so far it hasn't disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the kindle formatting is atrocious","review":"The kindle formatting is atrocious. Do not buy or at least try the sample first. Did anyone bother to QA this book before it was release? Even when you buy a cheap paperback you get decent formatting and it is readable. This is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIOLENT BUT GOOD","review":"I originally watched this movie because I am a big Eric Stoltz fan.

I REALLY, REALLY LIKE ERIC STOLTZ and BILLY BOB THORNTON and JOHN CORBETT is GOOD. The STORY LINE SHOULD/COULD have been GOOD, but WASN'T (Thornton is one of the writers). The ACTING SHOULD have been GOOD, but WASN'T. It was TERRIBLE. I wanted to like this movie , but CAN'T. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GOOD REVIEWS. If you want to see these actors REALLY act, get these movies. Eric Stoltz in KILLING ZOE and Billy Bob Thornton in BAD SANTA or A SIMPLE PLAN. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY BAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps Keep My Big Dog's Joint Healthy","review":"After spending big bucks for our 120 lb dog's knee surgery, we started using this product along with the regular joint supplement for humans.

My kids just love using their new toy, so they can send pictures to relatives all round the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old even did it!","review":"I took the camera out of the box, installed the software, reviewed the quickstart guide, took a bunch of pictures, and checked them out on my Mac, all within about 10 minutes. I didn't want to spend a ton of money yet got pictures fast, my 3 year old even took some pics too, she had a riot though she's got to work on her composition some! Listen, this is a great starter camera for people that want to send digital photos to friends and relatives worldwide."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"I'm on my first day using this camera. The software would not connect to the camera to download anything, so I ended up taking a link from the Ixla website to get the twain driver for the camera before I could do much. For outdoor photography, the camera is fairly decent. For indoor photography...the camera would be better off not even having a flash. Or at least that is my experience trying to take pictures for a bowling team. Blur and dead black pictures...and this is with the flash set to \\"always on.\\" I'd say look for another camera...or if you're an outdoorsman...then this might do for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Technical help whatsoever","review":"I bought the photo easy deluxe with camera thinking it would be good. It is brand new. I followed directions and could not get the program they sent to identify the camera. I tried all the phone numbers I could find on the box to no avail. I emailed IXLA Tech support LOL it took them 3 days to email me back. I tried their suggestions didn't work. Called a tech in and he checked my computer etc.... Nothing wrong there. We have both emailed IXLA tech several times and have not received a response. They suggest the serial cable is bad, well, where do you buy another one? I have wrote many bad reviews and strongly suggest to the consumers not to buy their products!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall a difficult operation...","review":"This camera is okay...nothing to brag about. The camera interface is clunky. The software is not very good. I guess for the price the whole package is okay. But I'm returning mine and will spend the extra 150.00 for something much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I love this tureen. It's simple, beautiful and I can serve anything from the fanciest soups to vegetarian chili at the table and it looks great. The only problem is that the inside of the top rim isn't finished (glazed) so it's hard to clean and stains easily. Other than that, it's fantastic, and has made me be able to proudly serve soups at the table instead of having company parade into the kitchen for self-serve from the soup pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken every time","review":"This is the second Tureen I have ordered from this company that is broken. I will be returning it for the second time now and looking for somewhere else to purchase one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Underrated Band in History","review":"Ok...disclaimer..I am from Mississippi, as are the band. However.....it still blows my mind why The Windbreakers did not garner the success that REM, or even the db's did. This is a total gem of a collection. Each track is superb, and sounds fresh even today. Do yourself a favor....if you love rock and roll (call it jangle rock, or whatever)....buy this album. If you love old REM.....buy this album and see for yourself. While you are at it, check out the Tim Lee 3....he is still making great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the hobbyist only","review":"Neena and Veena, while very sweet and pretty to watch, are not exactly \\"floatin' my boat\\" with their dancing. This was the very first belly dance DVD I ever purchased and even as a complete beginner I was not overawed with it. They are competent dancers however, and present a simple choreography which will suit someone who just wants to learn one routine for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful to anyone who has been in therapy.","review":"The messages this book delivers are at first preachy, but then it gives you the option to skip to Chapter Five, where it starts instructing the reader to retrain the thinking that leads to dysthymic/depressive episodes. It's a cognitive behavioral approach that does begin the path to a more sound daily life. As soon as I read it, I wrote my therapist and told her that her messages to me about my dysthymia diagnosis strongly resonate throughout the book starting with Chapter 5. Have high expectations when you begin to pursue this book's method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I felt the overall tone was condescending. There were several implications that depression is caused by a failure to \\"try harder\\" and think positively. For example, one statement by the author indicated that some people who experience various traumas don't struggle with depression because they simply choose to have a more positive approach to life. I found this to be an overly simplistic statement -- unfortunately, these types of statements are peppered throughout the book. The author does acknowledge the various facets and causes of depression; however, his intense agenda of recommending cognitive behavioral therapy derails any attempt to maintain a compassionate tone. I believe cognitive behavioral therapy is very valuable and has many benefits, and I was looking forward to reading this book. I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a sensitive and compassionate approach to treating depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting-edge interventions for mild depression","review":"This book explores causes and new treatments for mild depression. It is easy to understand and accessible to all, providing readers with a thorough understanding of depression.It is formatted for quick reference to key ideas and information. Plenty of new, innovative, effective coping strategies are included. Readers will be inspired to take action to overcome depression. Highly recommended for anyone suffering from depression or interested in treatments for milddepression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute beginnings","review":"Simple yet cute.

I can easily picture this nicely colored, very well made flag flying over pround Nunavut residences and businesses.

I was pleasantly surprised that this flag normally flies much farther north over a new province we should all be lucky enough to visit one day. Great flag, great place, great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too difficult","review":"all the books by preston J. Blair are way too difficultfor a beginner.

It along with \\"White Squaw\\" and others tell a graphic story of pioneer life in the eastern U.S. mountains in the late 1700's. I am, of course, proud to be a direct descendant of this great pioneer woman.I must note though, that I am quite disappointed in the editing done by the Jesse Stewart Society in this revised edition. Unfortunately, political correctness has \\"softened\\" the savagery of the Indians from what was originally published by Caudill. Other than that, and as was noted by a previous reviewer, Caudill's softening the impact of her supernatural encounter(s), this is an excellent read and I highly recommend it.Also, if you find the original publication in a used book store, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song and awesome video","review":"I just love this song.

And at just over $60, it's pretty darn expensive, too.\\"Ethical Hacking\\" is really just a hotch-potch of descriptions of tools that can be found anywhere on the Net. The English is so anguished as to be scarcely recognizable in places - almost as if it's been translated into Lithuanian by Google, and then back into English again. The peculiar typesetting makes it even more difficult to read.I just gave up trying to read this book. My advice is not to waste your money in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book and the Contents are poorly written","review":"I agree with all the negative comments. This book is poorly written. This book is not clear on several of its concepts. It has flaws on the factuality of the concepts of security. Hacking Exposed is a much better book compared to this.

That was a terrible mistake on my part.Don't waste your money until these guys know how to write.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader From Italy","review":"The EC-Council has a great CUT and Paste method of publishing a book, they don't even list the Author.

Waste of $75-00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you might think!!","review":"The EC Council has produced a great book!! Well, it doesn't fall apart like some. It's such a shame that the content doesn't match the manufaturing quality.I have some experience in IT security and I was shocked to discover that some people are still teaching the 'Ping of death'!!!!! That hasn't worked for years. The modules they have structured the book on are not organized and too disparate!I was really disappointed with the book. I'm going to have to buy another book, a better book.Such a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethical Hacking","review":"I can't believe I bought this book! The description of the (mostly outdated) tools are just rip-offs of what you can find just by searching the web and most of the exploits are old. Surely there have to be far better books out there by people who know security. I have a library of IT security books at home and this isn't one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in","review":"It seems to me that the 'EC-Council' are simply trying to cash in on their exam by publishing this book.

Why did he never play the character for which he was properly suited by voice-type and personality? Beckmesser.Despite the overall badness, this is not completely without merit. Josef Greindl is very nice as Pogner, as always. Also as always, Karl Schmitt-Walter is excellent at Beckmesser. Both are better elsewhere.It's funny. I recently got hold of a Bayreuth 1957 because Gustav Neidlinger plays Sachs and Clutyens conducted it beautifully. He must have had an off night."},{"rating":"1","title":"While a good live performance parts of the recording are bad","review":"Over 95% of the recording is good for a live performance, however, portions of the recording are quite unacceptable due to technical problems.

It does have a summary and notice of which tracks have recording problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Cold-Callers Only!","review":"Should be titled 'Art of Selling Products, Making Hundreds By Manipulating Prospects'. Excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off.

The director uses wonderfully imaginative techniques to provide the surreal texture so necessary to the success of this bizarre tale. It is thought-provoking and deeply disturbing, perhaps the more so since it evokes a time within living memory when mankind was forced to confront the ultimate futility of our attempts to create a truly civilized world. It is a pity that this film is so obscure. Taken in the largest context, it raises many poignant questions about our future and is a very fine example of the film-makers art as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD PLEASE!","review":"An extraordinary movie full of imagination, sensitivity, and passion.

Also, Wim Wender's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess antichrist is his only good cut...","review":"I saw antichrist first (yeah, I know, boo hiss.), and was frankly blown away by the juxtaposition of the jittery handheld approach with the painfully slow and beautiful shots. Plus the story was great, suspense well paced, and von trier wasn't afraid to 'go there' and beyond.So, I considered von trier a great director. I bought europa thinking it would be amazing and it was this pretentious piece of garbage. The constant color on black and white and overlapping frames came off as trying too hard. \\"Look! I'm an artist!\\" Sad.Hopefully, von trier's sci-fi movie will be as good as, or better than, antichrist. Maybe its just his older films. Who knows. But don't buy this. Shame shame criterion."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars based on excellent Criterion production; 00000 for the movie!","review":"This pertains to the Criterion Collection version; the movie remains interesting but BAD...painful.

Don't let previous reviews fool you, as they do not really tackle the book's relevance. All they want to do is glorify Fujimori's past and push their own political agenda, just like Kimura. \\"Fujimoristas\\" (like Kimura) are still passionate and vocal about their leader, and they will always be there, just as there always will be Neo-nazis or communists. At present time, though, they are just an anedocte in Peru's political landscape and Kimura's book (like Juan Ortecho explains) nothing more than a pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requiem for a Murderer and a Thief","review":"(...).The main flaw of Kimura's book is not that it is poorly written, or that it is plagued by paragraphs of half-truths and unconditional adoration of a murderer and a thief. What makes this book so terrible is the fact that history is so terribly twisted and tells us nothing of what us peruvians had to go through during the decade of fraud and thievery that became known as \\"El Fujimorato\\".Never mind the pay phones, Tio Woody. What the heck do you need pay phones anyway if your children are starving and you don't even have a dime to put in them. The truth of the matter is not only that Fujimori stole like no other dictator before, but that it left more people below the poverty line than there were in 1990 when he became president. Kimura's book conveniently overlooks that. It is nothing more than an awfully written pamphlet for a man whose political future is dead and gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dennis Rowland's voice is truly music to the ears!!","review":"Whether he's singing a beautiful jazz ballad or shouting the blues, Dennis Rowland is without a doubt one of the greatest living singers today.

I read Never Talk to Strangers first, and was very disappointed. What do camels with bony knees, grouchy grizzly bears, parachuting hawks, a rhinoceros waiting for a bus, coyotes asking the time, and cars with whales at the wheel have to do with teaching my child about strangers - other than their ability to rhyme with the phrase \\"Never talk to strangers, please.\\"?After reading Protecting the Gift, I decided to return this book rather than share it with my 3 1/2 year old daughter, especially after the author specifically mentioned the book Never Talk to Strangers in a chapter about why merely teaching children not to talk to strangers doesn't work. I would rather teach my children that it is *strangeness* (inappropriate behavior that's relevant), not strangers, that can be dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing to children, bad information, wrong message","review":"A reality based approach to teaching children to avoid strangers is best.

It only talks about animals! I don't need a literal interpretation to teach my kids, but good grief, have it relate in some way to the subject matter. The last parts about certain people knowing someone so it's ok to say hi and invite them over is so blantantly wrong, especially in today's world. I could care less who my daughter's teacher knows. How on earth is that not a stranger to me and my child? If this book was left as a sing-songy book about animals, fine.

I read it to my 6 year old and had to re-teach our safety rules that I'm always going over with him. If you're hoping that this book will help you solidify what's OK and what's not OK, this is not the book. It teaches that someone a teacher introduces you to is A-OK, while I teach \\"The Safe Side\\" DVD method - my kids understand that teachers, coaches and friends of my husband and myself are \\"kinda knows\\" who are to be respected, but NEVER obeyed if they ask my kids to go somewhere or do something without my permission.

I purchased this book through my child's preschool hoping that I could teach him about strangers. When we read this for the first time I couldn't believe it. We are to teach our children at a young age about strangers and this book should be geared for a 10yr old because only that age and above would only be able to understand the metaphors of the animals being the strangers. Now my 5yr old thinks every animal is a stranger. he still doesn't understand that strangers can be bad but every time we see an animal he says \\"look mommy, it's a stranger!\\" I do not recommend this book and I feel they should pull it from publication.

It holds your interest throughout the entire movie. Great cast with good acting performances. Just loved it and was so happpy to have \\"Above Suspicion\\" added to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, What Irony!","review":"This is a pretty interesting crime movie that has been overshadowed by the irony of it: Christopher Reeve playing a man in a wheelchair, and he himself being paralyzed not long after this movie.This story concerns a cop who gets paralyzed and then gets revenge on his wife and brother, both of whom were having an affair behind his back which he knew about. Joe Mantegna's role, I thought, was the best, as the pursuing cop on the case, although Reeve is very good, too. Kim Cattrall's garbage-mouth helps make her a convincing villain as the cheating wife.There is one major credibility problem, however, with this film that might have you shaking your head. You'll have to check to movie to know what I mean, because I don't want to spoil it here. The film is a worth a look, however - definitely recommended. It will have you involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but is first person","review":"I agree whole heartedly with the previous review regarding the first person issues. My biggest complaint with the whole chick lit genre is the reliance on this trite and limiting writing style. At least Liz Fielding offers up comic scenes with flair and never falters on her voice and view- this is a well written 1st person novel. I liked the Philly meets the hunk next door and thinks he is gay so he is safe thing.... she is sweet and nice but the 1st person limits the depth we usually expect from a Liz Fielding romance.

An upbeat memoir chock full of terrific anecdotes! A must read for anyone who is a political junkie like myself, but also a very inspirational read on how to look at life in general!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A veritable shot in the arm!","review":"Hamilton Jordan tells of his inspiring victory over the deadly disease that affects us all in one way or another - cancer. He also tells the intriguing and compelling history of his brief tenure in the White House under Jimmy Carter as well as the inspiring story of his uncle, who fought racism in rural Georgia ahead of his time.But above all, this book provided me with a shot in the arm while I was in the hospital for over a month with pneumonia. Feeling somewhat down, this book really lifted my spirits.Jordan proves that a positive outlook and one deeply rooted in prayer and faith in God immensely helps those in dire medical circumstances. I am a walking monument and a true believer of the power of prayer and faith in God.I highly recommend this book to everyone - whether you're sick or not. It is ineffably a book that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling after you put it down. A great gift to someone you love - including yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir that grabs you and holds you to last page!","review":"A good friend sent me this book even though she calls me a \\"right-wing Republican\\" and not a Carter fan even though I happen to live in Georgia and ironically have the same last name at the author. This book is bigger than all that. It is the human story of one man's life, rich stories about Vietnam, Washington and the civil rights movement and powerful, emotional and important stories about Mr. Jordon's three different bouts with cancer. But not just a cancer book but a book for anyone who likes a good read that grabs you and holds you and holds you to the very last page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Book For All","review":"This book had me laughing and crying.

A must read for 2000!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick and highly inspirational read","review":"That Hamilton Jordan has been able to prevail against the odds is amazing. This book is insightful, touching and filled with important, useful information for anyone who has a family member struggling with cancer (or any other catastrophic disease). I found the story about his hospital encounter with Roy Cohn to be fascinating, human and honest. There were things I found curious, though. Mr. Jordan tells much about his political career, with stories about his rise and fall interwoven throughout the cancer narrative. As one who is familiar with his career, I was as surprised by what he included as by what he left out. (Ross Perot and Ed Rollins, for example.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the Harder They Fall","review":"This video cannot be viewed in the United States.

The catch? His glass jaw and powder puff punch. But Toro remains oblivious to the fact that he can't fight because the boxing community is more theater than anything else. Mostly. When they throw Toro in the ring with a hot headed boxer who can't be bought, they throw him to the wolves.Great film. Again, it's obviously not the *best* Bogart film out there because there are too many great ones, but it's still very good.

For instance, on page 25, you read \\"Parental love is the main bond ((or)) (should be \\"of???)) human society...\\" - it is clear the editor in this case just didn't finish his job.I am a big fan of Vision Forum's material, having ordered quite a bit from them and intend to continue to do so.

She is beautiful and has impossibly incredible abs but she is SO stiff. AND she is absolutely vapid. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know where she is. Rania's background dancers have more talent and panache than she does, and are apparently happier to be doing this video than she is. The workout itself is good for beginners and fun if you watch anyone but Rania, but I didn't learn much about belly dancing. I'd hoped I would learn a little more than was begrudgingly offered. Many \\"moves\\" are basic for any aerobics class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Sweat, Too Light","review":"I recently started working out again after having had a slipped disc. I needed to start with something light yet exciting enough to keep my interest. So, naturally I thought this dvd would be perfect.I barely broke a sweat in this workout, so everytime I see the cover, I break into a laugh.I expected to have some authentic belly dance moves. I've taken a class of beginner's belly dance and I guess I expected something along those lines.This dvd left me feeling cheated out of my money. Now, I feel hesitant to buy another belly dancing dvd workout. Maybe I just need an intermediate dvd workout.....Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Rania's tapes are well-produced but this one did not make me sweat and it was much harder to follow than the Hip Drop Hip. I felt more like a club dancer than a belly dancer. Maybe it was my lack of connection with or inspiration from the music? I did not like this one very much. A fun fitness workout and I like the fact that she repeats things but I felt that some of the movements weren't explored/explained or done slow enough or enough times before trying to choreograph them into a tempo routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Pure Sweat,\\" puh-leeze","review":"Not only did I not sweat, but my heart beat didn't raise any.

The Cardio Shimmy from the same series is actually pretty good.Also, the music is indescribably awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic and Stuffy.","review":"That's the feeling I get from watching this video!! The instructor is so stiff and looks like she is trying so hard to look pretty, happy and to actually do the moves properly that it just makes you feel tense watching it. I just didn't feel like these were traditional belly dancers. I feel like this was someone that is fit, and is just sort of going through the motions of the moves!!

I can't imagine even the most inexperienced person enjoying this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"I cannot believe that I actually spent money for this video. The music is terrible, boring and the moves are pathetic. There are maybe a couple of steps you may like but on the whole, I am so disappointed in Rania. She is so beautiful and capable of so much more. I have her Cardio Shimmy tape also and although I'm not overly impressed with that, either the dance routine is worth keeping the tape. I have two of the tapes from Veena and Neena ( Slim down and Hips, Buns, and Thighs ) and this video cannot compare with the twins.Rania, nothing personal but this one's a bad egg, honey..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video bored me.","review":"I first got into bellydancing through Veena and Neena's videos and since then have tried many others. I am always interested in trying something new, so I immediately ordered this video. Not only is the music lousy, the set uninspiring, but more importantly the workout is boring. I couldn't make it though the second workout. There is a routine at the end that has nothing to do with what you just learned, which is irratating. I still enjoy after many viewings The Veena and Neena Sensual videos, Dolphina's Goddess Workout videos and Shamira's bellydance video. All of these teach you how to bellydance, while giving you a great workout and teach you a routine YOU can learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in the CD were very difficult to understand","review":"I came across this set in our local library and as a native mandarin speaker, I was very excited to play this for my kids.

This book has good intentions and a great idea, too bad it teaches kids wrong word tonations."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kindergarten students really enjoy singing in Chinese.","review":"I use this book with my kindergarten students. It gives the Chinese words for several popular children's songs including London Bridge is Falling Down, Mary Had a Little Lamb, and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. The kids learn the song in both English and Chinese, making it easy to understand the Chinese. It also has some \\"classic\\" Chinese children's songs, including Liang Zhi Laohu and Mi Feng Gong Zuo. The tape is clear and easy to understand, so that even teachers who don't speak Chinese can learn the songs. I recommend it highly for children from preschool through fifth grade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"My 4 year old son just loves the songs. He will listen to it three or four times a day. He has learned all the words in book. All the Chinese say he has very good pronunciation. A friend of mine recommended this book to me. She says they have worn out the tape once and are now on to the CD. The singer sings and also says clearly the words to the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book and CD based on the recommendations of other Amazon reviewers. Many had warned that the CD was really difficult to listen to but said their kids liked it so I went ahead. The CD is really intolerable. A woman sings in a way that does not at all encourage sing-along and is also unpleasant to listen to. The accompanying book has both simplified and traditional characters along with the pinyin, which is interesting, but it is cheaply printed in black-and-white. I suppose it could be used as a coloring book but for over $15 I would have expected higher quality. I would recommend Faye-Lynn Wu's Chinese and English Nursery Rhymes over this book. Faye-Lynn Wu's book is high quality and the children's voices on the CD are endearing and invite sing-along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my 3-year-old!","review":"My daughter loves to sing, and this is a great way to cement and rehearse the vocabulary she is learning in her Chinese lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELP ME!!!","review":"Was this book ever actually published.

It would be stereotyping to say, gee, consider the uneducated oafs who created this \\"literature\\": it's no wonder they couldn't do any better. Well, we won't do that; we'll just say that the book was not at all what one might hope for.

Returning this mic and searching for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used with GoPro HD Hero 2...","review":"I got this mic specifically for my GoPro HD Hero 2. The added stereo sound is nice, but all the audio has a constant hiss (especially when shooting a quiet setting -- probably due to some amplification or the like), for the most part, it is removable in post, so it isn't that big of a deal. The over all quality of audio is miles beyond what GoPro has supplied in their product. It's also a bit quiet in certain situations.Another problem is that if someone breaks wind in the room next to where you're recoding, the microphone pops and cracks (obviously a bit of an exaggeration here), but that to say, there is exactly zero pop filter on this, and any air movement will pick up immediately on it. I purchased the smallest wind muff (a dead kitten) I could get to put over the top of this for the majority of it's use.Overall, for this price range, it does a pretty good job, and with the addition of the dead cat/kitten it can suffice in many settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus ME-51S stereo Microphone for use on my GoPro Hero 2 and other digital Camera that has a external mic jack","review":"Wow this unit rocks, has a clip on kit, and cable.

Good news is that the sound of my olympus recorder is already amazing, bad news, I had to send the microphone back. However, for someone who wants to enhance the recording quality of an old pc or recorder, this external microphone might do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sensitive","review":"This mic is so sensitive that I can't use it as a lapel mic without getting high frequency crackle. I've even covered most of the mic with dampening material and clip it on just above my waist. I've tried every setting on my Olympus WS-300M, a recorder for which this mic is recommended, but cannot get rid of the crackle while using the mic clipped to my body. (The voice recorder records cleanly with its built in mics, though at a much lower volume.) I think this mic is really engineered for setting in the center of a conference table.If anyone knows of a better stereo lapel mic for Olympus voice recorders like the WS-300M and its family, I'd love to hear about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

You don't have any speed to tow and can't fight and tow at the same time. When you do tow you can't protect the shuttle and you are also bombarded until you or the shuttle is destroyed.

This writer expected the source to be one of the 16mm home-movie editions that circulated years ago (with C & C television titles). This DVD seems to derive from a clumsy bootlegged copy of same. Details are washed out and there are actually scenes missing.The film itself is an enjoyable antique, vintage 1930, with Bert and Bob fast-talking their way into helping Dorothy Lee salvage a rundown hotel and fend off gangsters. A good early-'30s cast helps (Jobyna Howland, Ralf Harolde, Stanley Fields, Natalie Moorhead) and there are enough vaudevillian jokes and bad-pun groaners to satisfy comedy fans, but video collectors can certainly do better than this particular edition. Digiview DVDs are generally an excellent value for the money, but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several problems with Digiview copy! 10 minutes missing!","review":"The movie is easily a **** movie, but this Digiview copy looks horrible.1) It is mastered from a copy of a copy of a copy of a 16mm C&C; television print. The focus is very soft & the contrast has washed out whites & crushed blacks.2) This DVD runs only 64 minutes, 10 minutes shorter than the original movie. Apparently the original TV print had been cut by some TV station to get more commercials in.The sad thing is that TURNER HOME ENTERTAINMENT released an excellent LASERDISC (and probably VHS tape) in 1991. That version ran the full 74 minutes, with perfect contrast showing all grey tones, and a sharper focus. I don't know why that master was not used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing movie, awful print","review":"There are plenty of poor quality DVDs on the market, and this is one of the worst. This is an amusing Wheeler & Woolsey comedy, but the copy is taken from a duped and edited C & C Television print; the original runs 74 minutes and this copy runs 62! To add insult to injury, this is a bad dupe; the climactic shoot-out takes place in a darkened hotel, and here it looks like they're in one of those Warner Brothers cartoon caves where only the eyeballs are visible. Bad sound, bad picture quality, and edited to hell-yuck!

At one point he is enslaved by the giants. The best stuff to compare the Imaro books to is Robert E. Howard's Conan series. Imaro is unabashedly a Black Conan with a flavor and vitality all his own in a richly described setting. It's too bad that the books were never reprinted because they are extremely good and deserve to be available to a wider audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of the product","review":"I love the stories of Imaro; they are well-written and a whole lot of fun.

He was able to find water cooled by ice some 500 years ago, and as soon as he started drinking glass after glass of it, one knew that there was something in that water that would do him in. And seeing the Spanish nobles so anxious to take the crown from their legitimate Queen made no sense . . . there were too many unanswered questions, and too obvious shifts in plot to make this anything more than a pleasant view of early sixteenth century fashions and mores.

The techno drum solo bonus performance is awesome as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment...","review":"I purchased this video a while ago going by what the DVD cover said and I really had no clue who Rania was. The workout does make you break a good sweat that's why I am giving it 2 stars, however it is very repetitive, therefore it gets boring, not to mention the dancers in the back who lack gracefulness.Rania did not impress me in her bonus performances. Belly dancing is a sensual dance, not a sexual one and she makes an erotic act out of it. She rates very low on her belly dancing skills and her instructions are annoying. Thank goodness there's an option to workout to the music without the narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bellydancers Beware","review":"What an absolutely appalling DVD!The only thing more monotonous as Rania's droning instruction is the workout itself. Don't get me wrong, I worked up a fairly decent sweat, but sharply banging my head against the wall for an hour would have given me the same workout with the added incentive of saving me a great deal of time and money. I've never seen a more dismal, soulless bellydancer than Rania. Fake vacant smile plastered firmly on her face, her dull eyes wander all over the studio as she \`dances' the routine - checking herself out in the monitor every two or three seconds.The Special Features of the DVD were fantastic - turning off Rania's slurring blether was a godsend, and the dance pieces she performs are sterling examples of what not to do in order to become a captivating and charismatic dancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes You Sweat","review":"Rania has another Belly dance DVD for Fitness and Beginners to the art called Pure Sweat.

While it contains basic linguistics chapters, it also has fun stuff about animals and language, historical linguistics, computers and language, and acoustics.

There are many exercises since this is a text book and some answers in the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if your into this kind of thing.","review":"Though this book is lengthy, and out of date, it does give an excellent first hand account of organized crime in the 1960's. The author, Ralph Salerno, used to be an officer in the police intelligence unit, and gives hundreds of examples of situations he has encountered. Everything from recruiting to operations in organized crime is described in depth. I did a book report using this book as a reference and got 100%.

When this book was released Lattimore, like Alger Hiss and a number of others, had the reputation of being innocent,New Deal spawned intellectuals caught up in the whirlwind of the so-called red scare. However, since their workers paradise(the USSR) fell, the evidence is now in, clearly showing that Lattimore, Hiss and virtually all of the other fifth amendment communists WERE spies.

The knowledge that Dr. Brier shares in this book is amazing. It is a reference book that reads as easy as a novel. And it is a fun read. Don't believe me, try it yourself. Beware, Dr. Briar's Ancient Egypt books has the power to turn a browsing reader into a full-fledged researcher. I warned you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egyptian Mummies = DYNOMITE","review":"This is a great book. Bob Brier combines a great sence of organization along with his humor and wit. It is a rare find in book about Ancient Egypt to have a person who is so enthusiasic about the ancients as he is. No longer is History Bonk, Brier makes it living. I plan to pursue a career in Egyptology and have attempted to read the dry, booring naratives of some of these \\" scholars\\" ( Budge), but this is a great work of scholarship. I applaude you Mr. Brier, Bravo!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and thought that it was absolutely wonderful! It made me think of mummies in a different light: not as being nasty corpses, but as being beautifully preserved human remains of an ancient people who were very much loved. It was very interesting and informative about it's topic. I think that it would appeal to anyone interested in mummies, not just scholars. As soon as I started reading it, I knew I would love it. And I did. Dr. Brier is a very interesting writer, as well as an extremely nice and cheerful person. (I met him at a lecture last month) I highly reccomend this book to everyone, regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2","review":"I think this is a very enjoyable game for adults and children to play, but I was very disgusted in the choice of music that was picked for this game. I have younger children and this game is rated for ages 13 and up but I still think it is inappropriate for any ages to be listening to. There is one song in paticular that talks about killing ourselves and repeats the word kill over and over again. If I had known the music was going to have lyrics in it like this I never would have bought this game even though it is very fun to play. I don't know why anyone would think that it was appropriate to put songs like this in games that children and teenagers especially would be playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Review","review":"This game is cool.

This game is so ill!","review":"I made this one star because if your like me i dont read too many 5 start reviews because everyone has the same opinion, i tend to look at only the bad reviews, this isnt a bad review but keep reading. I am an ex skater, currently practicing architect. I bought the first version and thought TOny 1 was off the hook, i was a bit leery about the sequel because the developers usually [mess] it up. However, this game is far more better then Tony 1. If the soundtrack doesnt get you into the game i dont know what will, killer soundtrack. The skaters are impecable with more control for the user. I swear playing with Cab takes me back to the bones brigade days!Dude, what happened to Lance. The levels are phat and much bigger. Whoever says that this game [isn't good] should just throw away they're playstation. Hey guys get working on Tony 3, and bring back the other old school skaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great game!","review":"I'd buy this game at any price!!

It is very addictive at first, but after a couple of days, you get sick of it and dont play it anymore.

Through repetative playing the game could be completed in next to no time. The makers have altered this by making 10 tapes available on each track. All the same characters from the first are still here so you will still be able to use your favourite. One excellant new feature that has been added is the fact that you can design your own skate park to make it best suit your finely refined skills"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old after a few hours","review":"I bought this game after hearing everyone say how great it is. I have previously been burned after going for games, movies, etc that everyone said was excellent. I dunno, maybe I have very high expectations when everyone builds something up? anywho, this game is a disappointment. The tricks are fun to do for the first couple of hours or so, but it gets old real quick, plus the difficulty of accomplishing the missions objectives is, in my opinion, needlessly difficult.I got this game for Christmas and I've stopped playing it already (today's 12/27/2001).

The gameplay is perfect and I like the create skater mode. You can choose any color and type of shirt, hat, pants, shoes, socks etc. I also like the park editor, there's no other game that I know of that has a park editor(except for Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX). It's pretty cool, you can places half pipes, grind rails, tables, and lots of other stuff wherever you want. There's also different camera views and you can rotate the peices.

The graphics are better than the first game, with more detailed animations. There are more modes in Pro Skater 2, such as creating your own skater and even your own skate park! Also adding to the fun are movies and fly through of the skate parks, which add to the fun of playing. You can even enable hidden movies of the skaters and makers of the games.

Similar to the original, but this game has more stuff than just skating around and getting the pro score tape in the first 20 seconds with the 10x multiplier code. The addition of money was a great idea, plus create-a-skater, and the park editor. Building skate parks with the games park editor is already worth the money. The graphics are boosted well up from the original, the soundtrack is much better than the original. and the multiplayer games are rad.

There are so many pieces to choose from, and it's a blast testing it out (one complaint, the area to build in is kinda small). The levels are more interesting than the ones before (it snows in the hanger!) and some skaters are new. Graphic push the PS1 to it's limits, looking as good as the original for the Nintendo 64. I was really impressed by this game. Even better than the original.ac"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME GAME but impossible moves","review":"This game is fun but almost everything you do is impossible. The game is fun and challenging but it doesn't get even close to looking real. Trust me, I love skateboarding and I would wait. the first one allowed you to jump off of a building and land, at least you can't do that as easily in the second one but in both games you get right back up after getting hit by a car and a skateboard magically appears under your feet. The makers should have been on earth, in the real world when they designed the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the original","review":"This game, in every way, is twice as good as the first. However, if you own the first one, you won't spend hours upon hours trying to get a high score anymore. The novelty wears off. Still a great edition in your library, especially if you never owned the first one, but it won't suck up as much time."},{"rating":"2","title":"you might need an endoursment to play","review":"this game may have overdone it. The second to this series finds Tony a bit older and wiser. You now have to perform harder tricks to gat paid, so you can pay for better stats and better equipment, and only after you earn a certain amount, then you can proceed to other levels. This becomes bothersome. But if that wasn't enough now you can learn new tricks(after paying for them) which you can perform after peak performances and hitting the correct combo buttons. Most times after playing you want to take a nap. You almost long for the days when you just skated or died. I believe the next Tony Hawk game may be set up where Tony becomes retired and as a new recruit you have to fight crime with your new batmobile and skateboard. That's of course only if you make enough money to open those levels up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony hawks Pro Skater 2","review":"I don't have this game for play station, but I do have it for game boy. if you love to skate board, but can't do it , this is the game for you.

Told in the first person, this story has a strong autobiographical feeling to it, and probably closely tracks the author's experiences during the war. In many ways, this account is unlike anything else I've ever read about this war. Instead of constant patrols in the jungle with constant ambushes and firefights, this book shows how the war included periods of calm, when a soldier could almost convince himself that there really wasn't a war at all.This story is not an action packed thriller, but a coming of age story, and is filled with a range of characters, all of them convincing, and all of them reflective of the diversity of the men who fought the war. The narrative draws you in and convincingly describes the setting. It definitly provided me with a clearer picture of what duty in Vietnam might have been like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The feel and emotion of what it was like to risk one's life","review":"A finalist of the 2001 Frankfurt eBook Award, Carl Melcher Goes To Vietnam by Paul Clayton is a compellingly written novel drawn from Clayton's own experiences in the Vietnam War. Packed with gritty detail and a story that obliges thought and attention on the part of the reader. The feel and emotion of what it was like to risk one's life amidst a larger conflict that vastly superseded the individual comes clear in exquisite detail. Carl Melcher Goes To Vietnam is an original, entertaining, occasionally thought-provoking, and highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belinda Bee's Busy Year","review":"A delightful little book that is perhaps more educational than it's author's modest admission.

Like others, the title of the book both caught my eye and turned me off a the same time. However, after picking it up and leafing through, I could see that the book is much more than the title. It's an inspiration. I'm currently writing a book as a process of learning to become a good writer; with Ms. Orr's 50 secrets, I feel like I have a private instructor with me right next to my laptop. When I hit a wall, I pick up the book, read for a while, then hurry back to tear down my wall. For those who are developing their craft, I would encourage you to add this book to your writer's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an alright game.","review":"I bought this because The Lion King is my all time favorite Disney movie. The controls for this game where a little weird and the game its self was very repetitive. Just when i thought i beat the game there's still other stuff in the past levels you have to collect which are really hard to get to. Over all it was an alright game. But i would only recommend it to true Lion King fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun time-waster.","review":"It's not the best game, and I think it could have had a few more levels or perhaps longer levels, but overall it's still a very fun game for The Lion King fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"I was expecting this game to be more than it was. The graphics were excellent, as were the movie clips which helped to build story line. Now I'll get to what this game lacked. Levels were short, and left no room for \\"exploration\\". Simba's attacks do not increase as he gets older. It seems slash, maul, etc. were removed. My guess is for violence reasons. Pounce, roll, and roar are his only attacks, which proves to be awkward later in the game. This game is aimed highly at a younger age group. I finished the game in a little over an hour; it was hardly a challenge for me. I am a die hard Lion King fan, and regardless of the disappointment, I'm glad they finally decided to release a 3D formatted game based on TLK. As I said before, this one's for the younger gamers, they should enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...unique character design, but fuzzy plot.","review":"The plot was a little uneven, as it hardly tied into the real movies. However, most of the scenes were fun, nonstop action with cool effects. :D I would reccomend this product to anyone who loves Lion King, video games, and action adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should've called it...","review":"Simba's Mighty Flop. I have the GameBoy version, and believe me it is not much. Only 10 levels, 4 bonus games that I don't even like, and annoying music. All you do is run around, get stars, jump on enemies, and that's it. The only attacks you get are scratch, roar, and jump. The way you get through level 1 is to jump on Zawzhu, the little bird. Definately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie","review":"I bought this because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan and I wanted it for the soundtrack. I do not think I would make the purchase if I had seen the movie before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I searched high and low in many rental stores for this and finally found it through a friend of my roomate in college. Of course I love the soundtrack for this, which is why I wanted to see the movie, but I wasn't going to buy it. I realize after I watched it why it was so difficult to find. If it wasn't for Pink Floyd, this movie would not be back for sale. But, in my opinion, its really boring and the only cool part about it is the music that sounds better on the album anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"More","review":"This film is only a must for the extremist Floyd/Farmer fan and collector; just to say,\\"I have it!\\". There was plenty of drug use, a fair amount of sexual play and an ex-Nazi. The problem is that none of that made the movie interesting. Almost all of the character scenes were plain straight on shots. Even the dramatic landscapes that comprise much of the films setting seem muted by the lack of life and genuine emotion from the actors. The Monkees TV show had better camera work. The Floyd score is heavily re-mixed well into the film as to make it still pretty neat but unintelligible as published Floyd music. Reminds me a bit of 'Liquid Sky'. It was probably a more interesting experience to make this movie than it was watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phew!!","review":"I'm sorry. This movie has to rate as one of the worst movies ever made. I picked it up for the Pink Floyd score, of course. I knew I was in trouble from the opening credits; \\"Music by The Pink Floyd\\". Roger, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Pink Floyd was ever known as \\"The\\" Pink Floyd.I give one star and that is only for the music. There are actually a few interesting musical elements that don't show up on the soundtrack. And what happened to \\"Cirrus Minor\\". I certainly hope the song wasn't cut to make room for more dreadful acting or laughable dialogue. There was plenty of that to go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censored DVD","review":"I bought this video thinking it would be a complete unedited version. i was wrong its the same as the vhs version i also purchased from amazon.com. drug references are edited out and so are partial scenes. do not buy this video from amazon in vhs or dvd.i was fortunate to have rented an uncensored vhs copy from tower records a few years ago. now im stuck with two crap copies. i wish amazon had forewarned me before purchase.i will no longer buy from amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig it...","review":"I totally liked \\"More\\"... Nestor Alemandros does excellent camera work as always, Mimsy Farmer is a complete babe, and there's lots of cool scenes of them getting high. And actually, it's a pretty accurate morality tale.. I don't think it falls for the 'reefer madness' stuff, but it shows a starkly realistic descent into the nightmare of heroin addiction. I'm suprised the movie is not given a fair shake.. during the wild, get-high times of the late '60s, this is a great little film that shows the downside of drug culture without being preachy. And it's gorgeous to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, snapshot of the 60's","review":"Continuing my fascination with European films of the 60's, I watched Barbet Schoeder's \\"More\\" (1969) last night. Starring Mimsy Farmer and featuring a classic soundtrack by Pink Floyd, the film is one part Icarus myth, one part sixties \\"free love\\" sexploitation film, and one part cautionary drug tale. Filmed mostly on the island of Ibiza, the cinematographer was Nestor Almendros, who would later film such classics as \\"The Story of Adèle H,\\" \\"Days of Heaven,\\" and \\"Sophie's Choice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"I bought this tape hoping for a quick, good workout. However, the steps aren't broken down well and therefore the tape is difficult to follow. Since the crunch philosophy is for people of various \\"shapes, size or ability\\", I was expected something better than this. If you're more advanced, don't need to learn by watching the instructor and can learn steps easily, you might like this face-paced video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I bought this in 2008 with the hopes it would solve my network shortcomings. The reality is NetGear abandoned the product and it does not support some versions of XP, it does not work with Vista and certainly not with 7. Do not waste your money. This piece of hardware is all hype and no delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pippi movies were my favorite as a child...","review":"I was so excited to see this out on dvd. The picture quality is superb compared to the movies of the 70's. However, what keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the british dubbing. The voices are boring and uninteresting.(They could have at least picked some more distinguishable voices.) I was expecting similar dubbing as in the movies. This gives me hope though, that the original movies will come out on dvd!!! This is still great to watch if you are a Pippi fan! I have been trying to get my children interested, so far the 6 year old is watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy PIPI FAN!","review":"I bought this dvd for my five girls for Christmas, extreamly excited and telling them about PIPI for years till I finally came across purchasing this dvd. Who the heck is ANNA first of all? I believe her name was ANIKA! Not to mention the fact that the voice of PIPI, TOMMY AND ANIKA are not like it was when I was growing up! The most important dissappointment to me was the fact that I childishly taught my children PIPI's THEME SONG! Did anyone notice that she didn't sing it in one episone? I'm so bummed. Although they liked it, it just wasn't the same for me. It was like changing a holiday Charlie Brown Episode! Hope and a hay and a hope shaaaana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Treat","review":"This is the classic that my kids(and the parents)adored when they were little. The voice overs ae not perfect but no one noticed or if they did it did not detract from the fun. There may be more slik productions of Pippi out there, but this one in the one our family still watches and loves. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - a disappointment","review":"The dubbing is terrible !Obviously room for enhancements - since Pippi will continue forever !If I remember correct the music sounds different even.Ok better than nothing - but I will try to get it from Sweden instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Silly!","review":"I grew up watching Pippi so i was excited to introduce her to my kids. Pippi is a funny, endearing, and silly character who demonstrates friendship and generosity to others. Yes, they do use some inappropriate language in Pippi, such as \\"stupid\\" but overall, the series is more wholesome than some other current movies out there. My kids love watching Pippi and even their friends, who gravitate toward Jonas Brothers, Hannah Montana,hip/hope, etc love Pippi as well. They ask to watch Pippi whenever they are in my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not charming at all!","review":"Since i know the german TV Series, which is nearly double as long as the movies and has a lot more atmosphere and shows more charactere of the three children, i was happy to find at least part of the series in English. But what a mess! The english dubbing is really bad. The Text was somehow adjusted to a more serious, say boring mode. Pippi is not charming at all in this version. For me a lot of the fun and wits is gone. I think the Englsih Movie Version is good and well dubbed, and the better choice. I hope one day the whole TV Series will be released in English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the original I grew up with.","review":"This video was bought by myself along with the box set of PiPi. This video is not at all the way it was shown when I was a kid. The voice overs are done over the original voice overs that were first done. They don't even call Annika by her real name they call her Anna. The kids voices have English accents....I do not reccomend this video. I reccomend the box set. The box set is the exact episodes I remember as a kid being showen on regular television with the original voice overs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pippi Longstocking","review":"I grew up in Sweden and Pippi was very big when I was a little girl. I was thrilled when I saw that Pippi was translated into english. I wanted my children to be able to understand the movies. The biggest problem I had with the dvd was that the sound was inferior, it was hard to hear what they were saying. The british accent was hard to understand.It was also very annoying that the girl was not called Annicka, like it is in the books and in the real version.If I could have sent this back I would have done so immediately. I would have loved to buy all of Pippi's dvd's, but I will not buy any more in this serie for the fear that they will be the same bad quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for multifuction printers","review":"The product claim was that it would work with any printer - not true - when I connected it to two computers and a Canon multifunction printer, the computers would not recognize the printer.

There's no up front warning that the switch is not compatible with all peripherals and since it's a passive device you wouldn't expect any problems.

Problem is, it doesn't work with my older desktop computer (circa 2004) nor with my work laptop (circa 2006). So, it really doesn't serve its purpose.

I had trouble putting it down as little by little, more details about the creepy town of Stepford are revealed. Joanna is the main protagonist of the story, and can't comprehend the uniform docility of the thoroughly domesticated women of Stepford, where her and her husband have recently moved. The final outcome of Joanna's discovery is typical of Ira Levin. 'The Stepford Wives' is an exciting and entertaining yarn. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I had to purchase this book for English class since we were covering Ibsen's major works. The one we focused on was A Doll's House and the major conflict most students have is the translation. Rolf Fjelde translated this version; my teacher recommends him and so do I in contrast with any other translator. The book came as promised in new condition, without a scratch to be seen. I'm completely satisfied with the delivery and condition of the book and I enjoyed reading A Doll's House. For students who are looking for a bundle of Ibsen's works, look no further as this is the perfect one. It has four of his major works, including A Doll's House, as previously emphasized and it's the best translation out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it.","review":"We like this mattress pad but when we ordered it we did not realize it is a Sunbeam Product.

Tony Bennett continues to be simply a wonderful gift to mankind. Tony says it best when he mentions that many people the world over have said to him that their greatest dream is to be in San Francisco, on Nob Hill, listening to him sing, \\"I Left My Heart In San Francisco\\". This performance, on the 40th anniversary of his signature song's public release, is the next best thing to being there. The San Francisco Fairmont venue, orchestra, Tony's long-standing hits, and the bonus features which include an interactive gallery of Tony's paintings and an interview session with Tony and k.d.

No he doesn't sing like he did 40 years ago, but like Sinatra in his later years, he has the style and he sings great songs. I higly recommend this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs in a good quality DVD","review":"I consider those songs are for the older people ( I am still young :-) ), but both my wife and I loved them, and we can listen them again and again. The recording quality is actually excellent. I disagree with some negative reviews on the recording quality. The way Tony held the mic in a different position will change his voice volume and the 'effect' to be recorded.

Combine bad controls with the fact that you can't even tell what your skater is doing and you have Tony Hawk 2 on GBC.

You'd think it'd be hard to improve on the success of the first, but Neversoft did it making a game that's not only larger, but also more rewarding. You have all the original characters plus 3 more, you have more objectives per level, and more secrets to open (get 100% with a character to open up a cheat). Besides that you can now make you're own skater and you're own park and you've got replay value that can't be beat. Add on top of that the new manual move, and you can send your scores through the roof once mastered.It may take a little time to master the controls, but it's easy enough and once you do learn it's almost second nature.

What is the point of buying a game that costs like [...] and then putting all the cheats into and its over? thats my question...well lets get to the good parts of the game. ON my game i have all of the cheats done but i still am able to save that or not use any of my cheats at all. its fun finishing the level and getting bonus things and you can create your own players...build your own skate parks and much more. My advice to you is buy this game, its very fun and o ahead and get teh cheats if you want right away, but you won't really master the game.

At the time I failed to understand his analogy of the book to that of an onion. Now I understand. When you read this book you will abosrb a tiny fraction of the material and each time you choose to re-read a chapter, it's as if whole paragraphs are revealed to you for the firts time - a bit like removing successive layers from an onion skin. I find this book to be a foundation for any magik and although perhaps not easily understood in places, the more it is read, somehow the more you are allowed to understand. I now have had to return the book and am about to purchase a copy for myself. I agree with the others, it will be the best $14 I have spent for a very long time. A superb work and an absolute must for any collection worthy of the name."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Fooled Many People","review":"I have read this book in its entirety and it is not really wholly hermetic. The writer was William Walker Atkinson who was deeply interested in Indian mysticism and yoga. True that same phrases are hermetic but it is largely mixed with ideas of Indian origin. He had written a few yoga books under a different name. This book is a case where an author get some ideas here and there and with the pile of ideas, packaged it into a book and called the whole thing hermetic principles. I would strongly you people out there to read The Upanishads, at least the Prashna Upanishad and you will be convinced by what I have said."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS","review":"Love Hermes, and anything Hermes related.

She even asked me to find another book written by the same author! A good book for your child to read, particularly if they've lost someone in their lives.

Sure, you CAN locate a Days Inn in Honolulu, but why not show one of its better hotels, such as the Mandarin Oriental Kahala? Most of the readers here are going to pay a bundle to get to Hawaii, and might as well know what the top end of the market, in housing at least, looks like. Only three restaurants are portrayed: La Mer and Indigo are perennial favorites in Zagat, and Buzz's is a simple steak house on the windward side of the island. That said, this video recommends a number of charming things frequently overlooked by people getting a package tour look at the islands: the Mission Houses museum area downtown, Chinatown (although they could have mentioned the lei shops there), Lyon Arboretum and the Museum of Art.

He took time to describe the characters, but did anyone really care what happened to Garth? Or all of the drunk sailors? Not me. My reaction after a sailor was killed was, \\"Ow that would suck to die that way.\\" It should be \\"Oh, no don't kill off that guy!

It is about stolen goods, and drug trafficking, the Chinese Revolution, and the machismo of the policeman. As well as the Abakua secret society, and a Chinese secret society. And Palo Monte, a magical practice. For all these things, it is an interesting and unique book, set in Cuba, in and near to Havana. It is well-written, engaging, and a mystery to the end.

I bought two pairs, which should be about a three-year supply, based on previous experience. I admire the entrepreneurial aspect of CliCs' product history, and find the product compelling and useful. Minor complaints: the current pair is a bit stiffer and has slightly poorer fit and finish than my previous CliCs.

There are twenty-five levels, however, the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours, which makes it like a movie.

This game is sweet. this is a must have.If you liked this game check out all of the other Spider-Man games."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO, SPIDEY, GO","review":"I know that a lot of people think N64 is totally outdated but when you play this game it just brings back that old time fun.If you're a Spider-man fan and you like video games then this is the game for you. You can web sling, crawl up walls and even lift up huge and heavy objects such as heavy chairs and bombs that are five times your size. Your attack moves consist of k.o. punches and lightning fast kicks combined with classic capture webs and impact webs. As you travel from level to level you will encounter tons of bosses such as Scorpion, Rhino, Mysterio, Doc Ock, Venom and Carnage. This is one of the best games I've ever played on the N64 and maybe even on any system. This is a must have game for a Spider-man fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman is back","review":"I haven't finished the game yet but, It is so fun that I have to write this review. This game is quite challanging from the start and it becomes pretty easy after awhile. For example the first stage: you must protect all of the hostages, one of them cannot die. If they do you start all over. It takes even strategy to make that not happen. This game is pretty much the same as the psx version but, the fmv's are missing but it is no biggie you do get clips as it was like a comic book. The sound and voices in the background are so spectacular, who ever thought that the 64 could handle that. The controls I have to agree is quite akward, whoever heard of punches and kicks on the c-buttons. But, you'll get used to it. I am giving this 5 stars still even if doesn't have the fmv's. Remember the fmv's are to relax and watch while the game play is what is important. Have a nice day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get to be Spiderman!!!","review":"Forgive me if I sound too enthusiastic, but I love this game! It is just plain fun. What kid (or adult!) has not dreamed of being able to climb walls like Spiderman or shoot web and swing from building to building? You get to do all this and more in this game. It comes complete with 4 levels of play (including Kid level). The graphics are very good and interspersed with comic pages. Game on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spider-man fan says","review":"i own the PSX version and the n64 version iv'e seen the movie own the second spider man game spider-man 2 enter electro have all the spider-man games all the books this game is very very cool my friend and i have all the comics of spider-man so if your a hard core fan of spider-man buy it but one of the bad things is that the PSX version has FMVs and this has comic stirps so who cares buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This game is OK, but there is one big problem with it. My friend brought his to my house the other day and I began playing it. And in, at the most, 2 hours, I beat it! No memory pak needed. There are only like 5 or 6 bosses in the game and the rest is just mindless slinging from one thing to another killing all the baddies. There are so many mini little puzzle type things that are just too easy and useless. He brought it over again last night and I beat it again--on hard difficulty. This game was a great idea, and the graphics and sound are great... but c'mon guys, you coulda done better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"this game is great. my freinds dad lives in japan and is a nintendo 64 game designer. the friend got a playable copy and i went over to his house to play it. it is a lot like JET FORCE GEMINI. it is very similar gameplay.get it. hopefully it comes out before christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst game I have ever played","review":"I bought this game because it had Superman on the front. Big mistake. The graphics are horrible and far too simple for the N64. The gameplay is awkward and hard to control. But the worst part of this game is the story. It took about 2 seconds to think up and the game spends just as much time on the storyline. The whole point is boring- flying through endless hoops and other monotonous unexciting tasks. This game is horrible. Buy Spiderman instead- at least you wont want to throw Spiderman out of the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new each time","review":"Put simply, this is a great CD. If you're not sure about which jazz piano CD to buy as a gift for a friend or maybe for yourself, make the decision easy - buy two of this one. Give one away, keep one for yourself, and listen to it a few times. You'll find something new each time. Dave's sytle is so rich, fluid, swinging, musical, and fast, that you just can't hear it all in one go. Incredibly, it sometimes sounds as if there are four hands playing. At others you simply can't take your ears off of his amazing swinging bass lines. Then all of a sudden he surprises you by seemlessly dropping in a few lush chords, then goes back to the swinging line, all the while jsmming with the right hand. It's just great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave was way off base with this recording","review":"This is one of the many cds I have in my collection by DM. In the case of this cd, i'm embrassed to own it. It really came up short of what I have come to expect from this master jazz pianist.Dave seemed like he was in another world while playing on this cd. I never could seem to feel his pulse or the soul he was trying to convey. I know it is hard to always top your past performances, but this is not the Dave McKenna I have come to appreciate.I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"But how do I get the last few mL out?!","review":"This is my current favorite perfume and I love it. However, when I got to the bottom of this particular style of container, I realised that there is perfume left in the bottom that will NOT come out through the spray mechanism. I've tried prying it apart to no avail ;-) I recommend the slightly larger bottle with the separate globe on top; not only do you get more, but the globe opens from the bottom, which means you can use all of the perfume. As far as the fragrance itself: I discovered it when I did a search for tuberose, a scent I love. This is a fantastic scent (my 6 year old son says it smells \\"like honey\\") that can be worn either day or evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon must provide nutrition info and ingredients","review":"790 mg of sodium per serving. What looks like a vegetarian product contains fish. MSG gives me and a lot of people a nasty reaction. I left feedback about including this info but Amazon hasn't responded or taken any action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly reviewers","review":"There is absolutely NOTHING misleading about Amazons ingredient description, it is just that some people, while trying to make themselves sound so intelligent and as such great cooks, only reveal their ignorance To not even know that Bonita is a fish, yet have the gall to condemn Amazon as misleading, is laughable. If you don't know what an ingredient is, look it up, before buying the item, don't condemn someone elese afterwards, for your ineptness."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much $","review":"I felt like I had been had. This was for my daughter and she gets the same soup mix at the grocery store for much less. This is a time when I should have checked the grocery store before buying on-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed to discover that this contains fish :(","review":"I agree with the last reviewer, the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear. I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it, now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that \\"powdered bonito\\" is powdered fish. It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package, but on amazon it doesn't specify this. So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for me.(I have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago. I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants. Fish & shellfish are not the same as far as allergies, so I do not know why this sometimes happens. It could have been cross-contamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as well....In any case, I make it a point to avoid things like \\"powdered fish\\" in my food.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"FISH TASTE IS TOO STRONG","review":"This soup would be more rightly called FISH SOUP, rather than miso soup. It has miso listed as one of the ingredients, but the BONITO fish overpowers everything else. Although I like fish, I really hate this soup and I feel cheated by the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"old and stale","review":"The soup tasted stale so I contacted the manufacturer with the code on the package. It turns out it expired in 2011. Yuck! no wonder it tasted bad. DON'T buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"miso soup","review":"not a fan of miso soup but my daughter loves it. I wouldn't mind buying it again. She loves japanese foods"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great instant hot soup for the cold weather season.","review":"I recommend this product. You get satisfying, tasty warmth without all the prep and clean-up. here are a few more words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't manufacturers listen to their customers???","review":"This soup sounded delicious and nutritious until I read that it contained so much monosodium glutamate. Why would manufacturers deliberately try to poison their customers! Monosodium glutamate is a well known and studied NEUROTOXIN! Can't they just use REAL FOOD flavorings to keep the product tasty and well received by all consumers? I really wanted to try this soup since it looked terrific and most ingredients were excellent but I won't buy it until they stop using MSG like it's salt and pepper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beim ersten Mal tut es noch weh","review":"(3.5/5 stars) Komm auf die Schaukel. Jetz geht der Hans Albers los. The Hamburger's best-known songs are here, from \\"Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts un halb eins\\" to \\"Ich bin der Hans im Glueck\\" and \\"In Hamburg an der Elbe.\\" Sure, some are corny (\\"Mein Gorilla hat ein Villa im Zoo\\") and others schmaltzy (\\"Ganz dahinten, wo der Leuchtturm steht\\"). Forget the fact that Albers doesn't so much \\"sing\\" as he does recite; he does it with style and that's all that matters. You know all the songs (or at least some of them), so sing along! If you aren't familiar with Hans Albers or his home city of Hamburg, there isn't a whole lot to recommend about this CD. It is more nostalgic than it is good, though it does have a certain charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best","review":"Overall the album was boring, some great songs but others were so bland that I sold the cd shortly after buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silverstone case","review":"Overall the case looks good and is very sturdy. The optical drive ejection cover is a glue on piece. Now come on! For $110 you mean to tell me the company can insert some hinges or something! Another thing that bothered me was the position of some screws. Several screws were very hard to reach especially the screws for the front casing. I had to replace the noisy front fan and believe me, it wasn't easy. If your looking for a good HTPC case, I wouldn't buy this one unless you have plenty of space and don't mind some cheap looking parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had promise but poorly executed","review":"Activision has a dubious track record for making great and near excellent Spider-Man games and making poor and lacking X-Men games. Why this is is anyone's guess, and X-Men: Mutant Wars for the GameBoy Color is one of these types of games featuring everyone's favorite merry band of mutants. In this 2-D side scroller you get to pick from Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Iceman, and Gambit as you take out hordes of generic baddies and then take on bosses, most of which are most well known even to casual X-Men fans. The graphics are nice and colorful and look surprisingly good, and each character's powers are presented well, but the overall feel of the game just feels unfinished and the levels are poorly designed. If your a GameBoy gamer of any kind and are a fan of the X-Men then this game is worth a look, but don't expect anything remotely redeeming from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the So. Bapt. Convention-Turmoil in Transition","review":"David Morgan does an excellent job with the history of the conflict within the SBC over the past 25 years. Clearly documented and well researched, Morgan takes you step by step through the transformation of the convention from liberal (or moderate) leadership to conservative management. Although he never suscintly states his position, he does offer clear clues along the way that he comes from a more \\"moderate\\" persuasion, but he does seem to present a quite unbiased reference work. He demonstrates clearly the attitudes and actions of both sides, neither of which is very complimentary in light of Christianity at times. An excellent, readable work - exciting, frustrating, and most of all, enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way to read those pulp stories nowadays","review":"Wow, I got hold of this book just recently, and I must say this is a great edition that recollects the pulp stories of my favorite hero. Even though the stories would make no sense to any Zorro nitpickers out there (the chronology and inaccuracies between the stories themselves would drive them nuts!), the actual adventures are a fun read, and delightful.The only downside is the format of the book itself, which is pretty huge, though it leaves ample space to reprint large images from the original magazines, as well as allow for a column typeset which makes it easier to read... a bit like a newspaper.All in all, a collector's item for any Zorro fan, if you happen to be lucky enough to find one of those at an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate, yet not overbearing summation of modern psychology","review":"Schultz and Schultz offer a wonderful summation of the history of psychology. Many history of psychology texts are large and burdensome, but Schultz and Schultz sift out the waste and offer the facts. Interesting anecdotes about psychology's pioneers are offered, and the social climate surrounding the perspectives of each school of thought is also mentioned. All in all, this is a great book to have in the collection for the average historian of psychology. The authors, unfortunately, do present the information in a rather bland display. More color and layout effect would be useful and appealing. Furthermore, the chapter on the impact of women and minorities in psychology should not just be thrown on the end of the book ... it should be integrated throughout. Other than those two drawbacks, however, the book is wonderfully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Overview of Psychology's Past, Present, and Future","review":"This book was used for one of my classes this past fall. It is very readable, and all of the names that you learn in psych classes actually become people, characters in the development of this ever-broadening field. I thought it was a great start to get psychology students more interested in the people who came before them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Install and Piece of Mind","review":"Just recently installed this in my '86 MR2. Unlatch 4 clips on the stock intake cover, put in the element after oiling (K&N; filter oil sold separately!), re-latch the clips, and you are good to go! This is the easiest aftermarket intake installation I've had! The stock MR2 intake box has tension clips to hold the K&N; \\"donut\\" in place. Just make sure not to over-oil the element.I can't compare this to the stock element since the previous owner didn't even have an intake element in the first place. Either way, K&N; quality is a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lord of Derkholm","review":"As a long and loyal fan of Diana Wynne Jones I admit that I'm slightly biased - I'll eagerly devour anything that she writes! But regardless of that I still have to say that this was a fantastic book! It was incredibly funny (I actually laughed out loud several times) as well as brilliantly written. I've worked as a tour guide many summers in a row and the satirical aspect of this book as it played out all the different aspects of tourism was great. To anyone who has not read Diana Wynn Jones' other masterpieces, I encourage you to. I've never read another author who compares in this genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GREAT GREAT","review":"I was only looking for one more book as a \\"filler\\" as I had to buy a certain amount to qualify for a discount/coupon. Surprise surprise! Of the 5 books I bought, this is the one I truly enjoyed the MOST! Excellent writing, plenty of humor and my interest was kept well up throughout the book, start to finish. I was sad when I neared the last few pages, I wanted to read more about Derk and his family's adventures. The other book I bought, a $17.95 hardcover copy of The Last DragonLord was SOOOO DULL and boring, ridden with cliches every corner you turn. Ironically, the other book I bought was also Jones' - TOUGHT GUIDE TO FANTASYLAND - which pokes fun at fantasy book cliches. Wish I had bought more of Jones' books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade and his family save the world","review":"Diana Wynne Jones has created another wonderful story of a magic-filled world. Unlike \\"A Sudden Wild Magic,\\" where Earth was being depleted by a magic-filled world, in \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\" the world in which the Wizard Derk and his children (human and griffin) live, is being sucked dry by the Pilgrim Parties, organized by Mr. Chesney, and ruled by the demon he has is his pocket. On certain levels and allegorical tale of the depredations that connivers like Mr. Chesney perfidiously perform on our own world, the plot revolves around families, how they function, and what the members mean to each other. Ms. Wynne Jones has developed ever more rich, complicated plots with successive books. Fans will be delighted, and those new to her writing will appreciate the complex plot with flashes of levity. A very rapid ending leaves the reader whirling, but on the whole a satisfying, one-sitting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apporved By THIS Teen","review":"As a rather picky reader who goes through an average of 66 books a month, I am particularly choosy with my fantasy and sci-fi books. Only a precious few authors ever write a book that is to my liking.For instance, I have never liked any of Philip Pullman's books. I always try and read them when a new one comes out, but they don't keep my intrest.However, with this book, Jones was able to keep me glued to the page throught the whole story. Upon finishing, I immediatly returned to the libraey to get the sequel, Year of the Griffon.All in all, the whole thing is thrilling, fun, and rather charming, with the griffon children and Blade screaming in people's faces and canivourus sheep.I love the sheep."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"If you want the other side of the story - the story of the Dark Lord that is - this is an amusing and well written book. It is a different and creative take to the usual defeat-the-dark-lord fantasy story. Buy this book. it is enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you laugh when someone slips on a banana and gets hurt, this book is for you.","review":"This is the fictional version of Jones' Tough Guide to Fantasyland. I enjoyed that book. Not this one, though. It is over 500 pages of sadism which, apparently, is supposed to be funny. It is not.I absolutely would not allow a child to read it and I would be suspicious of any adult who enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing!","review":"Even by reading the back cover I could tell I would not understand it. The book has a plot Im sure but I couldn't find it. There was barely any detail at all and the author didn't describe the characters well enough. I'm still not sure, after reading the book, how Barnabas fits into the story. My advice to you is DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a young adult maybe, not for them.","review":"While there is some spark of originality in this book, the actual plot and characters are all prefabricated. Simply from reading the back cover I could tell this book would not win any awards. This was due to the fact that grammatical errors were present in the excerpt on the book's jacket, which you would think someone might have caught, considering the excerpt tends to be the main selling point. Let this be a warning to all potential readers, only order if you desire mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I first picked up this book, but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\" keeps a nice pace so you are not bored once, and there are several good laughs through out the story. This book is a wonderful spoof on the whole concept of the evil Dark Lord versus the good guys. I believe people of most ages would definitely enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though a bit confusing, a wonderful book!","review":"This creative and original book approaches fantasy as it's never been approached before. Jones slyly inserts quite a few comments about fantasy stories and writers, while still portraying a wonderfully entertaining story.A problem I found with Jones' writing, is that she introduces all of her characters at once, sometimes making a reader have to flip back a couple pages to remember which character is who. Other than the slight confusion of introducing them, Jones' characters are wonderfully developed, each with his or her own distinct quirks.I suppose the ultimate reason I liked this book was because of the originality of the whole plot. A definite read for someone who is focused enough to stay with the plot as it twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but good ending","review":"In hindsight, Dark Lord of Derkholm is a great book with a fully realized enviornment and a great plot. In the beginning, the introduction of the tours, it's effect, and all these characters including Derk and his Creations can be a little bit confusing, but will settle in over time when you start to realize the difference between Calette and Mara. It feels like the story travels through several stories, including the fight against Mr. Chesney, the preparation for the tours, an Blade's journey with his pilgrim party, providing an interesting feel.I suggest this book for fantasy fans with some time on their hands. It may not be the book of the year, but it is a good book nonetheless. If you find fantasy mixed with reality an intriguing idea, I reccomend this book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is funny and at the same time has a good plot and excellent character development which is unfortunatly no always the case in modern fantasy. I only wish I could give it more stars :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad grammar","review":"I happened to glance at the book and the first thing I see is the first line of the blurb on the back cover says the dragon is \\"wronger\\" or \\"worser\\" (I can't remember now exactly)... how terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a really pathetic excuse for a seller.","review":"The first book that was sent to me was defective.

Although it is a platform game that is basically side-scrolling (very little 3-D action) it is really fun. But I guess you have to be a fan of the best-selling book series to get into it and understand it. But it's great. The voices are great and the animation is great. They got the morphs down packed and K.A. Applegate should be proud. I love the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to have Gotten Much Better!","review":"This game has gotten much better! It was exciting,and had better music by the fourth level,extremely scary (as I'm into scary stuff) by the sixth,(beware the fifth is pretty hard)and by the fourth environment of the seventh level,not only does it make you feel like you were back in old times,or on an extremely huge mountain,the music there was so good,I just had to get eighth.I would recommend Animorphs:Shattered Reality to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when its over","review":"This game is BAD.

My brother and I played through it together and at best this disc is a waste of space. Occasionally the graphics were impressive for their time, but nothing about the game really made any sense.

Better GAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I actually rented this game because it sounded interesting and original, and when I popped in into the old playstation, I was expecting just that. Boy, was I wrong. This game is so boring. You never do anything except jump around avoiding pitfalls and collecting coins (groan). Oh, once in awhile there will be a battle, you'll know when they're coming because all of a sudden you morph into some animal depending on which character you chose it the beginning. Battles are lame and boring. Every single enemy can be easily defeated using the old hit and run method. There doesn't seem to be any point to this game and if that isn't bad enough, wait until you hear the voice talent (or should I say lack of talent). So CHEESY!

Boy, was I disappointed. The DVD says it is intended for children age 5 through 11. However, the author, Patricia Robinson, delivers her lectures in this DVD by talking about art in a dry and erudite manner. I did not want lectures but rather a compilation of major art works throughout history with a trend emerging from the presentation. Clearly this was not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"This film was good and was very interesting to view.

Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raging ignorance and paranoia, don't bother.....","review":"I'm ashamed to say I actually bought this book when it was first released in the 80's. I, like so many, was caught up in the whole Revelation/End Times/New Age Conspiracy/Pin-the-tail-on-the-Antichrist hysteria. The book is so full of bizarre and irrational claims that it boggles the mind.

If ignorant rappers like Juvenile and Master P would shut the hell up about their money and their cars, and actually try and say something that matters, maybe they'd actually learn something. All you are doing by buying this is making Master P richer and richer. Stop being ignorant. This is not rap. This is business, and all No Limit rappers are whores to Master P. If you think this is rap, then you're totally blind, too. Try some Public Enemy, KRS-1, Boogie Down Productions, Tribe, Gang Starr, and the Roots. At least they have something to say.

There are also 2 Remixes of HA one with the Hot Boys and one with Jay-Z. They are both really mint, and every song on the cd is worth listening to. Lots of guest stars like B.G., Turk, Lil' Wayne, Big Tymers & Jay-Z make the album even better, if that's even possible.

I like hip hop but this is absolutely terrible.Also, never before have lyrics been so meaningless. He raps about girls and money. That's it. The sickening thing is how much money he actually has. Juvenile owns a record company worth over $350,000,000. Meaning he has about half of that in network wealth. There are hundreds of underground hip hop artists with 10 times as much skill and unlimited potential that are sleeping under bridges.

They \\"were\\" absolutely amazing (the new Nightwish is a pop remake of the old and has lost what they once were). The reviews here tell it all. It is both sad and disappointing that Tarja is no longer a member because Nightwish is not Nightwish without her (smart people make stupid decisions). Annette of the new Nightwish just does not provide the mystique, presence and heavenly voice that Tarja did. It would be a gift to all if the band got back together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Import DVD-Audio version is not a DVD-audio","review":"And it is not Spinefarm either. It is 1 single disc DVD-Video from NEMS Enterprises, made in Brazil. I tried to update the product information and the only bindings available were \\"Audio CD\\" \\"DVD Audio\\" \\"Cassette\\" or \\"LP Record\\" and this item is none of these.I made one mistake, NEMS Enterprises is from Argentina, not Brazil as I originally stated.On a related note, there is an SACD version of Wishes to Eternity now.There is a DVD-Audio version of \\"Once\\" but it's only available in Finland.If I could change my star rating I'd give a review of the content of the concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Gift Ever","review":"There's really nothing to like about Nightwish, unless you're a teenager trying to fool your parents into seeing how cultured you are or a parent trying to show your kids how cool you are for listening to \\"metal.\\" Everything here has been done before by better metal bands and/or orchestras alike. They even fail at pandering to the Pink Floyd fan base by covering a song from easily the worst album ever released with the Floyd name on it. Those who call this \\"edgy\\" or \\"original\\" or even \\"powerful\\" are grossly out of touch with the metal scene. Nightwish is the musical equivalent of a snuggy with a skull on it: soft and not to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent concert, good blu-ray production","review":"This is an absolutely stunning concert. I really wish that I could have been in Helsinki in 2005 to see it live. I finally ended up buying the Blu-ray after renting it from Netflix and realizing that I had kept the disk for two months and watched it at least 15 times. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Nightwish and/or Tarja.The Blu-ray is well produced as far as concerts go. I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about the audio quality. There are a couple minor issues to be aware of with the video and menus if you are an A/V snob:- No popup menu to select tracks while playing (you have to return to the main menu or skip blindly)- Chapter selection is not perfectly aligned with the start of all the songs.- Not perfect 16:9 aspect ratio.

To say the least, Maria Baez Kijac, of Ecaudorian background, is either lacking in knowledge of our culture and food or is just being extremely biased in not giving Peru the credit for what is ours. To say that we serve Ceviche \\"sashimi\\" style or that we use Tuna to make it instead of Corvina (as she claims they use in Ecuador) is just in bad taste. The Exotic Kitchens of Peru or El Arte de la Cocina Peruana is my recommendation for anyone that would really like to see what Peruvian food is all about.

After 6 months, one of the replacements died. Another call to Casio, and thankfully they provided another replacement.So we've had 5 of these batteries, and 3 were defective. We don't use the cameras often. We checked all the batteries using both of our charging docks, and confirmed in each case that yes, the battery was the problem and not the charger.Casio has treated us well and acknowledged the problem, though.

In desperation, I purchased an inexpensive replacement battery (not Casio brand), and on the slim chance that the charger that came with the camera was in some way defective, I also ordered an inexpensive car/home charger with good reviews.

The problem is that battery charge becomes so low that the charger will not recognize the battery and the red light on the charger will blink without charging. To fix the problem you need to jump start the NP-20 battery. Connect two D-cell flashlight batteries together. Then connect a wire from the (+) on the D-cell batteries to the (+) on the NP-20. Then connect the (-) on the D-cell batteries to the (-) on the NP-20.Hold the connection for about 10 seconds. Then put your NP-20 in the charger. If the red light remains on, your problems are solved. Charge the NP-20 in the charger for 90 minutes then place it in the camera. You should be all set...Hope this helps, Glenn.."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK until they fail - (frequently)","review":"I'm on my third \\"genuine\\" Casio battery in one year.

And, even though the subject inexplicably turns away some readers, Bell once again reveals his strong Christian beliefs, and how they can be decisive in overcoming the trials and tribulations of our lives here on earth.

Store bought, pre-ground spices loose their taste within a year. With a mortar and pestle you can buy the seed of any spice you like, toast it and grind it yourself for the freshest tasting and most potent flavors and aromas. Of course I could have bought an electric spice grinder, or a second coffee grinder. But it's not that hard to use the pestle to pulverize spices and you will be saving electricity and have one less electric gadget cluttering up your kitchen counter.

All Afire to Fight is one such work, and I have to say I have really enjoyed reading this book and learning about the Ninth Texas Cavalry--not to mention the military activities in the theater of the war where they were active, about which I am not that familiar at the moment. I found the narrative to be excellently written for the most part, although there were a few awkward spots. The one real detracting aspect of the book was the lack of a roster. In my opinion, no regimental history should be without one (the more detailed the better!) provided the information is extant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Title, but does not Deliver the Goods","review":"I write as an economist who works in behavioral ecology in general, and on the analytical modeling and empirical testing of theories of reciprocity in particular. From my point of view, the book leaves much to be desired.I do not have the expertise to comment on the author's neuroscientific arguments. Whatever their value, his applications to economics and the other social sciences are highly general and superficial, consisting of quoting some authorities from the past and interspersing one or two current references on a given topic. The link between neuroscience and behavioral ecology is pure hand-waving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The novel starts well enough, but then it meanders for about a hundred pages. Again and again the writer mulls over the suspects without coming to any conclusion. One almost senses that space is being filled for the publisher, without the plot moving forward a single inch.But that is tolerable, perhaps. What is not tolerable is the murderer confessing in detail (while a tape recorder is running) and explaining just how the killing took place and why the crime was necessary--and then committing suicide. Baloney! It has been done far too many times. Surely readers are sick of this by now. The evidence here against the killer is flimsy at best, certainly not strong enough to stand up in court if the accused has a decent lawyer. All the murderer has to do is deny, deny, deny. The easy way out of this for the writer? Those old stand-bys, confession and suicide. Surely there has to be some alternative to this facile denouement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't care about the characters or the story","review":"Henrie O poses as the aunt of a dear friend's nephew in order to investigate the murder of the man's wife.The nephew was such a spineless sleazeball that I had no sympathy for or interest in Henrie's detecting.

There are, I think, 12 volumes in the original, so I wouldn't expect all of it to be available right now. It's the first of its kind, a sociological study of a large city, Paris and its life and inhabitants, and it dates from just before the 1789 Revolution. This kind of study was later attempted by other writers, but Mercier remains the first and the best. It should be of interest to all social historians and sociologists."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Bad Thing About This Book Is The Cheater On The Cover.","review":"Well done.

Unfortunately, after receiving it, I was extremely disappointed with it, and returned it. The size is nice, but the quality of the pillow is similar to one sold at a big store in most cities for about half the price. And, the pillow is not temperature-sensitive. The pillow did not become more firm when it was cold, as would a real temperature-sensitive visco-elastic pillow. This pillow cannot even be compared to the famous brand with lots of informercials. It feels almost like regular foam with the exception of a slight pause when returning to original shape. If you're looking for a pillow that responds to temperature, and has good support, then this is probably not the right pillow. You get what you pay for, and there's a reason why some pillows cost near a hundred dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Cable, As Advertised","review":"The cable is not that common, old school but we needed it to upload information and communicate with a satellite control box......it worked. it was very reasonably priced and arrived with no challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for a lover of classic jazz!","review":"My Dad requested this CD for his birthday present after hearing a track from it on the radio.

If this brief scan interests you at all, plunk down your money (the price is definitely right). There's no way one collection can capture the entire story of American music, even of the section this covers (1893-1946). But the sheer bulk of it (9 CDs, nearly 11 hours) means you get a big fat cross section, and I've found that pulling out any of the discs at random and putting them on transports me, makes me jump up and down, fills me with the pure feeling music is supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is a terrible book, but unfortunately you probably won't have much choice in whether or not to use it if it is required for your course. I agree with the other reviewer that the companion softbound supplement is far more useful in understanding the concepts presented. If you can find that or the Bar review multistate materials, you'll learn far more of the structure of criminal law than you will from this book. This is a philosophy text.If Dressler spent half as much time explaining topics as he does making snide political comments, this book would be far superior.Luckily, Criminal Law is just one semester and the Bar review materials generally make up for the many shortcomings of this ridiculous text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Starplace","review":"The Starplace by Vicki Grove is a good book. It is about thirteen-year-old Frannie Driscoll, who lives in Quiver, Oklahoma, in 1961. When a black girl named Celeste Chisholm comes to Frannie's school, everyone is shocked. Celeste is the first black person at the school. All the black kids go to a separate black school. At first, Frannie, like everyone else, ignores Celeste. But she finds herself becoming friends with Celeste, especially after they are chosen to be in the \\"Ladies of Harmony\\", a double trio from their chorus class that will perform in public. But will Frannie ignore everyone else's thoughts about Celeste and remain friends with her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steph's Review","review":"A black girl moves to a \\"white town,\\" and isn't treated the best by her peers.

The klu klux klan had been terrorizing her family for a long time, but she responded better than most people would, she didn't try to get revenge or anything. After a while, Frannie and her friends didn't care about what other people thought about them hanging out with Celeste, and they stuck up for her, even when she would't stick up for herself. This is a very good book that makes what happend in the past, directly after segragation was outlawed, very interesting and you can really relate to this book, and understand everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I've Read.","review":"This book was awful! The plot was predictable, the story-line simplistic, and the characters were shallow and mundane. I felt as though I was reading a book aimed at teens. The story lacked interest and came to its conclusion before any suspense was built. Although, I am reading another book by this author and thus far it had proven much, much better so...maybe this particular book was just a singular stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witch","review":"Not a bad book, but certainly not up to the usual Michaels standard. I thought it was just a bit transparent in a lot of places. The ending was almost predictable. The heroine was just a bit too flaky to have gone through all the troubles and travails without really making a lot of big mistakes. The daughter seemed to be a lot more sensible than the Mother. Oh, well, it still was worth the time it took to read it. While I don't recommend it highly, I still recommend it to any Barbara Michaels fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"an affecting, well-written first novel","review":"I went from being put off at the beginning of the book by the protagonist's vision of the Virgin Mary to being totally drawn in by this character's travails. Ultimately, despite a shaky and improbable start, the book is affecting and rings true. Schneider won me over with her exploration of the complexity and fragility of relationships and her descriptions of an artist's compulsion to create. Her characters are rich, well-drawn, and compelling. All in all, this was a moving well-written novel. I look forward to Schneider's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, lyrical","review":"I don't think that it is particularly the story that I love about this book , though it is a good story.

Let's reserve that for the once a year absolutely incredible book. Having said that, Katie Schneider's \\"All We Know of Love\\" is a very, very fine book. Not everyone will enjoy it though. If someone is looking for quick diversion from their day, then they will miss the point of this book. This book will not divert you from your life, but take you toward it. If a reader is just looking for something to take up their time as they fly from LA to NY, then they will miss the beauty of this book. However, if you are the type of reader who enjoys looking into the soul of another, exploring the humanity of another, the confusions of love, the fears that artists have, and discovering pieces of yourself right there, then you will enjoy this book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artful prose paints each page","review":"This is an extremely well-written first novel by Katie Schneider.

Best book I have read in a long time.","review":"I borrowed Winterdance and enjoyed it so much that I am buying two, one for a friend as a gift and one to share with family and friends. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to buy others by Gary Paulsen. I love the discription of the personalities of the dogs. I have never cried laughing so much, while reading any book, as I did with this one. After reading this, I would love to watch the Iditarod, but would never run in it. Gary Paulen's ability to decribe the hardships and pain, was outstanding and just made us laugh! Great book. Everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping novel about perseverance and determination","review":"Winterdance, by Gary Paulsen, is an autobiography of a courageous musher with a drive to succeed. We learn of the life threatening situations he goes through, the beauties of Alaskan nature, as well as dangers faced by those who race in the Iditarod. One simple choice can save you life or lead you to disaster. It also tells the wonderful bond between a musher and his dogs, the unique love that comes with racing in the mountains of Alaska. You will never find another dog book this compelling. This book is beautiful and funny and contains details that allow you to thoroughly understand the characters. You will find yourself with great admiration for the man who is one with nature and really get a feel for the Alaskan wilderness. The novel will move you in a way so unlike any other. If you are interested in reading about a life-altering adventure, you cannot go without reading Winterdance. You will see life like you never have before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read aloud book!!","review":"I read this book aloud to my then 12 year old son- it might be strange, but I still read aloud to him even now at age 15- very bonding! We all laughed out loud for pretty much the entire book. it got to the point where my husband pleaded with us to wait for him to read so he didn't miss anything. Gary Paulsen has comedic timing in the most wholesome and unique way! One of his other books- My Life in Dog Years- had the same effect, just different format with short stories about dogs- so grateful to book like this- a rare and amazing find- wish there were a whole shelf of books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a wonderful book - and like the other reviewers said, parts of it are hilarious.

I really enjoyed it and I think anyone who owns a racing/pulling dog should also own this book so they can have a laugh. The best part in reading this book was remembering the fact that it is a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting adventure, different breed of people & dogs","review":"Great book which I read during the '99 Iditarod race i.e. 3/99. Loved it because it was an adventure about a sport which is so far from my lifestyle that it is almost unimaginable. I could hardly believe what the dogs and mushers go through. I learned everything I wanted to know about dogs, mushing, and the great race. I read it in 2-3 sittings since it was so exciting. I could hardly put it down. In comparison to a recent two hour TV documentary on the Iditarod, Gary's book takes the prize. The book has so much more detail and info than the glamour of TV. The only drawbacks are that I thought there was excessive use of the - & ( ) i.e. dash and parentheses. It became cumbersome at some times. And the book is really not a scholarly piece of work (I wasn't expecting that either) so it can be easily and rapidly read by any 9th grader in high school. A great book and I will definitely read it a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG","review":"I started reading this book on a recommendation, it was on a 12 hour flight to France.

This book dives headfirst in the pains and pleasures of training and racing in the Iditarod. Gary Paulsen is a superlative writer and storyteller making you laugh with one story and cry with another. This is honest, down-to-earth stuff and there is never a dull moment. Everyone I've recommend this book to comes back to me and wants to discuss the different situations Paulsen finds himself confronted with during his training as well as during and after the race. I loved this book and I have gained a healthy respect for the participants of the Iditarod and the spirit that drives them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter didn't dance for me","review":"Very disappointing book.

He will pull you into the book at the first chapter, and you'll be sorry when the story ends. Find out the details of what it takes to run in the greatest Alaska race of of all. He will have you rolling on the floor with his true antics of 'training' hellish sled dogs from Canada, and learning how to maneuver a sled - on dry land! This is the inside story of combating the violent extremes in weather, and the lonliness and pleasures of being on a trail. Few people ever take this trip - take it with Paulsen and hang on for the ride. I gave this book to everyone in my family for Christmas - it's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Curl up with this book on a hot summer day!","review":"I loved this book.

This is one of the best books I have come across - I started it on a road trip with my husband and was soon asking him to turn down the radio so I could read passages to him. It is funny, enlightening, scary, energizing and awe-inspiring. I envy Mr. Paulson and his ability to chuck everything and answer his inner voice's call for adventure and a different way of life.

Mrs. Mitchell's descriptions of the landscapes in the Shenandoah Valley makes you feel as though you can see it. The daughter Leah is a teacher at a girls college. She firmly believes this is her lifes calling, and counts out the slightest possibility of romance or getting married. The father, a widower, also counts out the possibility of romance because of his age. With all of his daughters grown and gone, he is becoming very lonely. Entering Mrs. Mitchell's world in \\"Virginia Autumn\\" is quite an experience. I haven't read book one yet, \\"Shenadoah Home\\". I'm very anxious to read it to see how these girls grew up. It would probably be better read in sequence. BUT ITS GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"Whoever decided to let Fabio write a book was seriously disturbed.

Marco/Viktor is Mr. Perfect. Well, except for one major flaw. He expects the women in his life to give up all their dreams and live his. When his first girlfriend refuses to give up her career to be his baby-making machine, he continues filming his movie, only to be thrown back in time. He kidnaps the step-daughter of the evil Wolfgard and again, tries to force her to change who she is to satisfy him. Even when assassins threaten he won't do the sensible thing and let her return (even for a short time) to her homeland so she'll be safe.Nope, Marco/Viktor is a male chauvinist pig who thinks all women need to do whatever he says. Whenever Reyna challenges him he threatens to spank/thrash/clobber her, even though he knows Wolfgard used to beat her with a whip!For a guy who makes his living in romance, Fabio doesn't know diddly squat about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-budget ganster film too much","review":"This movie must represent what foreigners think American gangsters behaved like in the 1930s. Every actor plays to the rafters and surely had fun making this film. B-movie great Billy Drago (The Takeover) plays his cool, perfected, villain persona as Lucky Luciano. Think a hoarse Frank Black (Millennium) on drugs for Lance Henriksen (Stone Cold) as the tommmy-gun blasting Dutch Schultz. Martin Kove is the cigar-smoking G-Man who keeps it cool. But the real actor that will keep you rolling your eyes is hero FBI Agent Bone Conn played by John Christian. This movie has all the standard gatuitious sex scenes and violence but you just can't help thinking the actors must have had a blast making this. If you are into collecting certain B-movie actors or follow their work, it's a must have. It's also a fun bad movie to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray is a dud","review":"This is a review of the blu-ray only. Becket is a fine film, no doubt about that, but the blu-ray has suffered from some terrible processing decisions. Just about everything is outlined with a halo because of Edge Enhancement and grain is missing, faces are smooth and picture seems slightly out of focus because of the excessive use of Digital Noise Reduction. Shame. Probably would have been beautiful if they'd left the grain intact and refrained from using EE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting.","review":"The acting in this film really makes it. Such very fine actors. It is a long movie and a lot of it is dialog, but I found it absorbing and in my opinion, historically accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts","review":"I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THIS IS THE MOST MOVING MOVIE THAT I HAVE SEEN MADE ABOUT St.THOMAS ABECKET,AND RICHARD BURTON IN THE TITLE ROLE WAS INSPIRING,PETER O'TOOLE AS HENRY 11 WAS IN ITS SELF MAGNIFCENT. TRULY ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST OF MY OWN TOP 10 MOVIES OF ALL TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie Better on Blu-Ray","review":"I don't think this is a great movie, but it's a very good one.With the elaborate costumes and sets, the movie really benefits from the hi-def treatment -- with only a couple exceptions, the Blu-ray looks far superior to the DVD. (The exceptions are places where enhanced clarity makes film tricks like matte paintings more obvious. I still prefer the hi-def image without reservation.)I tend to imagine Peter O'Toole as too big a star to give his attention to DVD commentary tracks, but he does a commentary track here and is fully engaged, interesting and informative.The Blu-ray supplements are missing two archival interviews with Richard Burton that appear on the DVD. (The interviews are interesting, but there is no mention of Becket in either of them.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Drama....","review":"One of the reasons Anouilh's \\"Becket\\" fell from grace way back when is that the history is somewhat muddled. Anouilh chose to make a kind of social statement out of Thomas Becket being a Saxon, a lesser fellow in those days in jolly old Norman (read 'French-ruled') England. Problem is that Becket was every bit as Norman as Henry. Because it is a major theme of the play, it is hard to zone out. Once you pass that, however, the film is one of the great films of all time. Drunk or not, the acting couldn't be surpassed. And if you willingly suspend disbelief, and let Becket be a Saxon, it all works magnificently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic historical drama","review":"A great movie about one of the greatest figures in English history, Thomas Becket. Richard Burton does an excellent portrayal of Becket as Peter O'Toole does of portraying Henry II. Although the film takes liberties of the historical events of the lives of these two, it doesn't in anyway effect the plot and drama of the movie. A great scene in the movie is when Becket (Burton) says to Henry II (O'Toole) \\"do not do this\\" when Henry II insists that Becket takes the title of Archbiship. It would be interesting to know what the actual thoughts of Thomas Becket were when we was offered the office of Archbishop in the 12th century. A great movie that should be more known to movie enthusiasts as it is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for our times","review":"This movie is about Henry II's attempt to tell the church what to teach. He doesn't like what the Archbishop of Canterbury is saying. Like Henry VII, this Henry wants to be rid of a \\"meddlesome\\" priest. Like Henry VII and Thomas More, this Henry and Thomas Becket were friends. I guess in some ways, it is bad luck to be a friend to a king. It is a good movie and worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter O'Toole","review":"I love Peter O'Toole as King Henry II. Becket is great but the Lion in Winter is better. Peter plays Henry a bit mad in Becket while he played him cunning in Lion in Winter. Richard Burton also provides a fine performance as Becket. And Lion in Winter has a star cast, if not when it was made, then over time such as Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton not to mention the wonderful performance by Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Restoration and Transfer to Blu-ray","review":"It is incredible to see a film from 1964 restored to the screen so beautifully. I have both the DVD and the Blu-ray and the higher resolution only reveals more gorgeous detail, not flaws in the film. Films half or a quarter the age of Becket would look so much better with this film restoration treatment than they do when with just the transfer to Blu-ray. I wish they would do this for Lion in Winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film faithfully reproduced. Great performances.","review":"I saw this in a theater many years ago when it first came out, and recall that even then it appealed to everyone from intellectuals to the guys on the street corner. It starts from great material- a play by Jean Anouilh which is wonderfully adapted for the screen by Edward Anhalt, one of the best screenwriters of the era. The film has everything- humor, pathos, tragedy, with magnificent performances by Peter O'Toole as Henry II and Richard Burton as Beckett. Both were then at the height of their powers and it shows on the screen. The details have been gone over by others so I won't repeat them. It is a must-see classic.The blu-ray transfer is flawless and a pleasure to watch. Who can ask for more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Becket","review":"I am a World History teacher (10 grade), and Becket teachers SO much about that time period. The stuggle between church and state, the horrible treatment of a defeated people, and the loyalty to one's job, no matter what it is. It helps me teach with a visual!I am just so glad I finally have my own copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I wonder, why Hollywood doesn't produce any more of this quality.

A few years later the Widescreen Video, bought that. Now the DVD in all its glory. What a marvelous show and battle of wits and of course the dialogue. I usually watch a double feature of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" and \\"Becket\\" with great food and to enjoy the dialogue. I would introduce students to Shakespeare and other classic by first having them watch Becket. It demonstrated to them that period style speech can be entertaining.Becket is generally regarded as historically accurate except for the fact that Thomas Becket himself was Norman, not Saxon. How one deals with the issues of loyalty to King and God can be a model, although a sad one for all political leaders.I am pleased with the DVD I purchased and really enjoy the extras provided.Get yours now!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beckett","review":"Great DVD.

Would recommend to anyone who likes O'Toole or Burton who are icon actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"A great take on the Henry the 2nd/Thomas Beckett story. I had to watch this movie a second time almost immediately after the first just to fully savor Peter O Toole's performance!! They do not make em like this anymore!! It never ceases to amaze me how I assume these old classics are going to be bland and boring but actually manage to impact you in ways that movies just don't do anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time classic","review":"Besides owning this excellent film, you owe it to yourself to see it on the big screen during its limited theatrical release. I had to drive two hours each way, but to watch Becket in its full glory was worth it.For those of you who have never seen this movie, you're in for a treat. Once you see \\"Becket\\", be sure to then watch \\"Lion in Winter\\" for a fascinating comparison of Peter O'Toole's performances of the same king during different stages of his life. That O'Toole didn't win the best actor Oscar for both roles is one of the great Hollywood travesties."},{"rating":"2","title":"About bloody time!!!","review":"Praise the lord. Beckett on DVD. This was and is a supreme movie. Two dynamos of the English stage/screen at the peak of their abilities. I loved this movie since it was first released. I have owned it on VHS for over 10 years. The only sad thing seems to be that it is not letterboxed like the VHS is. I guess I can live with that.As a matter of fact it is one of the two reasons I have kept my VCR. The other reason is the 'non'-director's cut of Blade Runner the one with commentary. Now if only Ridley would cough up a 'non'-director's version of Blade Runner I can get rid of the old thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"becket - one of the best!","review":"I first saw this movie in 1964 when it came out. peter o'toole is playing henry II (who he also played in 'a lion in winter' w/katherine hepburn), and richard burton plays tomas a'becket bishop of canterbury. this is a moving and amazing piece of film. the story is true, and the acting is supberb. it is one of the best movies i have ever seen. don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Revived","review":"Becket is a classic movie with some great actors obviously enjoying playing off each other. The film is a talk-fest most of the time, and certainly lacks some major action scenes, but is still a memorable movie, and this DVD edition has been beautifully restored.Of the bonus features, the interview with the film's original editor is well worth watching for the extra dimension it gives to the film and acting performances (as well as insight into the actors' liesure activities!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Which is greater than the honor of a King\\"?

When it came to DVD I immediately ordered it. However, I found that the film did not stand up to the memories of a 14 year old. Shot almost as a play -- though there are good location scenes -- it came across as overly dialogue-driven ... again, great theater but not-so-great cinema. Also, and unfortunately, the acting now seems over-the-top almost to the point of over-wrought hysteria, and this in more than a few places.

The problem was when I placed the order again for the tortoise ones, received them and they were still 22mm. The way I could tell is by the model numbers inscribed on the inside of the left arm which reads RB2140-902-[50/22]. In my ever so lengthy hunt for wayfarers that fit a smaller face, which are the true original ones that come with a 15mm bridge, I stumbled on this Amazon listing that advertises exactly that, a 15mm bridge. Lo and behold. But beware, Amazon is falsely advertising and does not actually have any 15mm bridge sized Wayfarer's whatsoever which I found out after contacting the marketplace seller directly who told me that Amazon is the party responsible for the false advertising.

Howard. This author, unlike many other Conan writers, really knows his stuff. He obviously has a great respect for the old Weird Tales pulp adventures. This action packed saga features several sorcerors, including one attractive female, a stalking killer zombie, a band of Stygian outlaws, and ends up in a spectacular carven palace similar to Petra. Truly the heighth of adventure, Conan has to face a terrible Cthulhu monster and a giant grim idol of Nyarlathotep, all for the sake of the unthinkable emerald lotus, a plant and drug that came down from the stars in ages past that gives its user unlimited magic power and a inescapably deadly addiction. Hocking has crafted a tale of pulse-pounding excitement and fascinating narrative. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"It's been a while since I read a good Conan yarn that wasn't mere jock-barbarian nonsense, and didn't expect much from another Conan book, so I was pleased-to-be-surprised with Hocking's work. A fantastic Conan yarn with a great evil villain and wonderful set-scenes, great characters (both big and small), with action that just keeps coming and coming. I didn't want to put this one down once I'd started it.The only issues I had were one or two places in the book where things slowed down for a few pages (though the payoff was worth the wait) and a few moments where certain characters seemed cliched (though, again, showed themselves much more complex as the book progressed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want it on my Kindle 4","review":"It's a great Conan story. I like Conan books like Conan the Valorous. I wish I could have Conan And The Living Plague from the same author. Viva Jonhh Maddox Robert, Steeve Perry (fast pace Conan books), John C. Hocking, Karl Edward Wagner and Howard. Other Conan author, I do not like much. Conan story should be fast, razor written and super intense. It shold show how Barbarian society is better than ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Character Development, High Action","review":"I had not read John C. Hoking's Conan tales before this one. If he has any others, I would read them. Emerald Lotus was pretty good, I would recommend it as better than most of the Conan spinoffs published by Tor or Ace. The carnivorous plant featured as antagonist in this tale is not terribly original, but it's wizardly gardener seeking to harvest the plant's magic is a well crafted and compelling enemy for Conan to encounter. Conan's travel mates in this story are not as annoying as some of the other's he has been saddled with. If you are looking for a Conan read that is a little more involved and rich in character development then I would recommend Emerald Lotus. Hocking keeps the action coming at a good pace and also does a good job of bringing Conan's world to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword & Sorcery Perfection!","review":"With the notable exception of Karl Edward Wagner's The Road Of Kings, there is no finer Conan pastiche than this. This novel is flawlessly executed fantasy fun from start to finish. You'll never want it to end; it's a compulsive page-turner that puts lesser Conan pastiche writers to shame. Other reviewers have gone into their reviews in far more depth than I have time for at the moment, so I'll just say they are right! Buy this novel now. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"Another ho-hum entry into the non-Howard Conan genre. Unlike John Maddox Roberts or Robert Jordan, two of the better Conan writers, Hocking writes a very middle of the road fantasy novel that just happens to have Conan in it. He makes the mistake of spending way too much time with villains and other characters and not enough time with Conan. And he doesn't really know the character that well, so Conan seems fairly indispensable here. As a rule, other than Karl Edward Wagner's \\"Road of Kings,\\" stick with John Maddox Roberts or Robert Jordan when ranging in the non-Howard Conan field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Reader","review":"Sorceress, evil sorceress, or barbarian hero, pretty much no-one wants to hear these words:'\\"You die for Nyarlathotep.\\" Needle talons stroked the air and its eyesburned brighter.Ethram-Fal spoke haltingly in Old Stygian. \\"You make sacrifice?\\" Itbobbed its head, bird-like.\\"Yes.

It not only reveals much about the errors of the modern missionary methods it also reveals much about modern day churching.This is a must for anyone wanting to start a house church. Allen couches his critism in missionary work and the like but hidden therin is a much broader comment the hierachacal nature of the modern church.Once we begin to understand Paul and his methods we are forced to then begin to question the way we ourselves church and indeed why we want to start a church. Amongst others Allen comments on money, hierachy, leadership, church buildings. All in terms of how Paul planted churches.He questions the validity of statements that suggest Pauls methods are no longer relevent for todays cultures by highlighting the many similartys between the many sub-cultures that existed in the Roman empire and those that we find today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missionary Methods: Saint Paul's or Ours?","review":"This is a well written book by an Anglican.

I have read a lot of fiction and non-fiction about World War I (the \\"Great War\\" presumably referenced in the title), but other than the time and locations in which the story is set, I see minimal connection to the actual World Was I other than the general pathos and overall horror of a war. There is a lot of soul searching about the relationship within families and about death, which is more interesting and somewhat inciteful, but it beats you over your head for much of the 880 pages and to me did not seem all that profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Win This War","review":"Normally I like lengthy tomes and epic novels. I just couldn't get into this one. After 60 pages I put it down. If a novel doesn't grab me by the first 50 pages, I go on to the next. Because of the solid reviews, I gave this one 60 pages. That is too long to read and be bored. The writing quality is good. Maybe if I stayed with it for another 100 pages it would have spoken to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read this book a few years ago and loved it. This book stays with you forever. If you loved A Soldier of the Great War you will also love Chris Bohjalian's A Skeleton at the Feast about the end of World War II. Both books kept me awake late into the night and I will never forget either one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Good","review":"In \\"A Soldier of the Great War,\\" Helprin weaves a plot of incredible beauty and grace. His command of the English language is simply extraordinary. There is a touch of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' \\"magical realism\\" here, with a bit more realism and a bit less magic. The incredible situations, people, and places shown in this book are marvelously entertaining. Helprin is one of the greatest living authors who's writing in English - and this is his finest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awe-inspiring literary achievement","review":"Following in the great literary tradition of journey tales (The Odyssey, The Divine Comey, Pilgrim's Progress, 100 Years of Solitude), Helprin writes another masterpiece (almost as good as A Winter's Tale) of modern fiction. The story is so real and the characters so 3 dimensional that your feet will hurt as you relive not just the physical journey, but the emotional journey through war torn Europe through the mind of the protagonist. A work of art brilliantly written and conceived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds Us Of The Insanity of War","review":"I am not sure why we need to be reminded of the insanity of war, any war. What it does to people's lives besides cutting them short. People die for reasons they never understand. Sometimes it's nothing more than a bureaucratic gambit. Helprin's writing is superb. For some tastes it may be long-winded and wordy and often times philosophical. But it's hard to write about war in a telling manner in clever sound bytes, though our politicians try, and that texting on our smartphones demands. Take your time with this read. Don't expect feel good or neat endings. It made me want to read everything by Helprin. Not sure why I hadn't read these ages ago. They are \\"old.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the whole is not greater than the sum of it's parts","review":"At times the story grabbed me and held me and I couldn't put the book down. At other times it seemed to drag on endlessly. As others have said, the prose is fantastic. But the pieces didn't fit well for me. More time was spent developing the character of Alessandro's first crush, who vanished after 200 pages never to emerge again, than was spent on his lifetime love, Ariane. And the surrealistic dwarf, while fascinating, seemed out of place in the book. There were moments when I thought - \\"I love this book\\", but when I was finally finished I didn't have that feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment that comes when you have finished a truly great work. Still - I would recommend it to fast readers and those who have lots of time to read many books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent and witty view of nature, beauty, and war","review":"Frankly, when I picked this book off the shelf, I thought I was getting a war thriller, or something. I was taken from the beginning, however by the character of Alessandro, his view of the world, and his various adventures. I measure a book's worth by how many passages I take the time to underline and review later, and this one sets a record for me. I wanted it to go on and on, like a Fellini movie, and was sad when it ended. Everything works in this book, and even the allegorical characters (i.e., Orfeo) are tolerable. This is not a book for casual readers, and you must expect to \\"do a little work\\" in getting to the essence, but it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work to be cherished and loved.","review":"This is an epic adventure through early 20th century Europe. Mr. Helprin shows us through the eyes of an invincible young man, and at the same time the eyes of a refined elderly gentleman, some of the defining moments of this century. We feel his pain and share his aspirations throughout. From his relationship with his father during childhood to his eventual marriage to his elusive lover, Ariane. In the mind's eye we are lifted, far beyond the budget of any Hollywood motion picture, to foreign vistas of rich hues and vibrant color.I have read this book many times, it seems to speak to my heart. I hope that you will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in recent times.","review":"This is one of the best modern books I've ever read. Full of hidden meanings and ironies that may, perhaps, be lost on some. Like his earlier work, \\"Winter's Tale\\", this epic is very moving. This is the kind of writing that grabs you and makes you think, cry, and laugh out loud. This is the kind of work that, when read repeatedly, loses none of its charm or appeal.There is simply no better modern author than Helprin."},{"rating":"2","title":"War IS Hell","review":"Flowing, often poetic, and emotionally riveting, in my opinion, this is Helprin's masterpiece. Protagonist Alessandro is deeply and authentically human, a strong but sensitive man caught in a vicious machine, all the while struggling to maintain his humanity when constantly chllenged bythe degradations of war. This book reads like a movie and would make a fine screenplay. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Author Writing in English is More Brilliant","review":"It seems that so many novels these days sacrifice writing for story; the two are part of a whole. To ignore one for the other leads to trite or throw-away fiction, of which there is far too much. Mark Helprin clearly knows this. His chracters almost breathe, and his writing is magically lyrical in a way that recalls Gabrial Garcia Marquez. Far from being cut and dry, A Soldier of the Great War is as Byzantine as a Pagannini concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and unconvincing","review":"Helprin borrows themes and images from many great books, but the result doesn't add up to a work of art. His rip-off of Hemingway's \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is doubly offensive in that his crypto-fascist hero ends up going back into the war with a renewed sense of patriotic fervor, which goes against anything I have ever read of the true feelings of the typical WWI soldier by the end of the war. Helprin's use of \\"magical realism\\" is stale, and smacks of adolescent wish-fulfillment. One of the few books I have thrown away unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moved me to tears","review":"This book made me want to cry, it was so dreadful. The hero reminds me of people I've met who just can't keep from telling lies about themselves; after a short while, it gets very tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never forget this book","review":"It's been six years since I read A Soldier of the Great War, just as I stood on the brink of being sent to Bosnia on a peacekeeping mission. It brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart. In fact while on leave in Italy I HAD to visit Venice to see 'La Tempest' by Giorgio - this painting is an integral part of this book and to Alessandro's life. Once you have read this book, try Helprin's 'Refiner's Fire'. Helprin is a wonderful writer with a rare ability to touch one's self. I hope you are intrigued - please read it, especially if you have served in the military."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and compelling","review":"Wonderfully written novel of WWI and Alessandro Giullani, now 70 and looking back at his service in the war. What I really liked about it was that you knew Giullani was going to live. The novel was lyrical and poignant, making the terror and horror of the war real. It was kind of like a WWI Catch 22, with some of that same gallows humor and inevitability and absurdity.The premise is that Giullani, now in his 70's, gets kicked off a bus when he tries to get the bus driver to stop for a young man running after the bus. Giullani and the young man set out to walk to their destination, which takes several days and as they walk Giullani tells the story of the war and of his love."},{"rating":"2","title":"No better book yet.","review":"I'll save the flowery stuff...terrific book, I give one away yearly. Will tick-off many to say it, but I do not know a better living author. Will tick-off even more to know that he also wrote a near-famous speech for Sen Bob Dole, upon his retirement from the senate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10","review":"THE BOOKS IN MY top 10 aren't necessarily the greatest because of a generic formula I apply. Some I consider great because they are so unique and entertaining (The World According to Garp.) Some for the emotion evoked (Grapes of Wrath.) And some for the absolute beauty of the language, the word choices, and the stunning imagery(Cold Mountain.) A Soldier of the Great War is pure poetry. I LOVED IT. It definitely has earned its place in my top 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the century!","review":"Helprin's novel is among the best I have ever read: poignant, apropos, and deliciously detailed. You are taken on a journey that lasts a lifetime, a journey you wish would never end. You are so tightly drawn to the humanity of his characters that you feel your own mortality exposed to the terrors of hate, sudden brutality, and moral duty. But love conquers, even in the face of death. This book will change you. Beware. But don't miss this opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life itself is the \\"Great War\\" and each of us a \\"Soldier\\"","review":"Helprin's engrosing novel is an elegant dissertation on the meaning of life. This is no a War novel - this is a fairy tale we can all relate to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Between Heller and Hemingway","review":"Appropriately placed on the shelf between Heller and Hemingway, this is a large, lyrical story by an author who can compress a chapter into a paragraph. Simply the best book I've read in the last ten years. Helprin is a throwback to the time when authors wrote as though they cared for the words they used."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book that changed my life the most","review":"This book has influenced me more than any other. It has taught me about love, death, art, children, patience-- I've read Soldier of the Great War four times. At times wonderfully profound and hysterically funny.

A girlfriend who read it around the same time I did the first time still remembers this book as vividly as I do from the first reading. It is rare that a book holds up this well over time and is just as enjoyable during the second reading, but this one definitely was a treat to read both times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit and contains the mess!","review":"Great product that does a really good job of keeping the mud, snow, rocks and leaves from getting onto my trucks carpet.

Let's face it: the topic is a huge, slippery challenge, and any given chapter could be the bases for more in-depth research, but the Guide does a nice job of introduction. It also provides strong additional resources. Rather than \\"airy fairy\\" or even \\"airy fairy faith\\", I found the attitude of the author honorable, and his emphasis on service to others refreshing. I have students. Although I expect them to take the high road of academic Celtic scholarship, I welcome this Guide as a beginning step in their upward climb."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this wisdom? Or Celtic?","review":"It seems to be just another typical New-Age book preaching guru rubbish and labeling it 'Celtic' knowing that it will sell. There is hardly anything accurate or traditional about its content. It is pretty much in the realms of fantasy instead of reality. Being a Celtic scholar, I am still shocked at the nerve that most of the fad driven world of mysticism tries to produce. With a title like 'Complete Idiot's Guide...', I think it says it all, if not being a little redundant. This cannot turn one on the 'Celtic path' to life, the world doesn't work that way unfortunately, Romanicism has no place with the cultural and historical realities shared within the Celtic regions of Europe. One simply cannot just add a dash of water and be an instant Celt, nor druid, etc! Firewood beckons this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celtic Wisdom???","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Celtic Spirituality\\" and also the \\"Complete Idiot's Guide\\" series of books, so... when I heard this book was coming out, I was very excited. Then when I read it,.. Well, I didn't even bother to finish it... I agree with the previous reviewer who also gave it one star... this book is just New Age fluff and no Celtic substance. I can not recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Celtic Spirituality, of any kind, whether it be Pagan or Christian. Considering how great so many of the other \\"Complete Idiot's Guide\\" books are, this book was a real shock... It does not live up to their normal standards...."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but they blew it on the CD","review":"I was enjoying the cultural material, and thought they did a reasonably good job of introducing pinyin and the sounds of Mandarin, and providing practice material in the book and CD.It all fell apart though when I got to page 39, where I was supposed to \\"repeat the following sentences after the reader as you listen to the CD\\". It's a conversation between two speakers, and the problem is that they do not pause between sentences as they are spoken to give you a chance to emulate them. The tracks for practicing individual vocabulary words have pauses for repetition, but all the practice conversations I checked do not. I don't know how this is supposed to aid me pronouncing sentences in Mandarin. It was a real disappointment, and I had to find a new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a touching tale of the reuniting of two friends","review":"The tale of how two best friends, parted forever by death, comes to VHS. The movie startes out as Watson remembers his dearest friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. As Watson walks down Baker Street to 221B, brought tears to my eyes as he explains how much he misses Holmes. The case of the young Ronald Adair, is what brings Holmes from France. He did not die but just disapeared. He visits Watson at his consulting room, using his amazing disguises. Holmes and Watson travel to the 'Empty House' and waylay a vilian set out to kill Holmes. The old Hound is out of practice, but me is able to keep the assain busy until Scotland Yard comes. The reuniting of Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and, of course, good old Inspectjor Lestrade is funny and yet touching. The detective, Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to solving the interesting problems of cat and mouse once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation, true to Doyle's story","review":"Please ignore the review by the ignoramus above. The dialogue between Holmes and Moran in THE EMPTY HOUSE is a faithful transcription of what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually wrote. The first three years of this series produced some outstanding episodes and THE EMPTY HOUSE is one of the best. It's beautifully directed and well written. Edward Hardwicke is excellent as the new Watson and Jeremy Brett is fascinating to watch, and even more fascinating to listen to. There is an amusing pastiche sequence at the start which takes place in the coroner's court. It nicely rounds out this story without padding it. The supporting players, particularly the excellent Colin Jeavons and Rosalie Williams, work well as an ensemble. You will want to watch this directly after viewing THE FINAL PROBLEM, another terrific episode; the two should really be sold as a set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME - AWESOME - AWESOME","review":"There will never be enough Sherlock Holmes episodes to satisfy my love for English Literature, Drama, Film, TV, etc etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empty houses can be full of action and adventure","review":"Sherlock Holmes is back from Reichenbach Falls!

This little disc sure puts you in the mood! I can't wait to play it on Valentines evening, candles, champaign, chocolate and Bocelli, ought to do the trick....After you've seen it a couple of times you'll notice how well the cuts are timed to the music, and how the clips build in intensity as the song crescendos.

I've been using books like Real Time Rendering for a while, but these are more \\"reference\\" texts... Core Tech & Algorithms is a 900-page textbook, and its goal is clearly to help you understand techniques, not to try to squeeze as many techniques as possible in the smallest space.Still, the book delivers complete tutorials on all of today's general algorithms (portals, BSPs, IK, it's all here), and many all-time classics (from Atari to Zelda, etc.). I'd recommend it to people who'd like a textbook-tutorial approach: you'll understand each and every technique Mr. Sanchez teaches here. I wish the book was longer, and more techniques were added in... a chapter on Audio and another on Physics seem somewhat lacking to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good!!!","review":"I love the movie, but this game is very hard to play. The controls are weird and awkward. You can't jump and hit at the same time. You play as Fred Flintstone, and I have no idea what the plot is.

I'm a big fan of the Jackass series - I think the concept is brilliant - but this Steve-o video wasn't even fun except for a couple of stunts. I watched some guy get beat up with a skate board and wondered why this scene was even in the movie.

I'm not averse to this kind of film--after all, these nuts are doing things at their own risk--however, the south padre gangster scene was incredibly disturbing. Not to be a spioler, but basically this skater guy is goofing off and his board hits this guy's car. When the guy confronts him, the skater guy clobbers the guy in the head with his skateboard three times. He also kicks him when he's down. The guy gets up and staggers down the street. He's lucky he's not dead. This was out of one of those scenes out of Faces of Death.

The book is incredibly accessible, even entertaining, but it never loses its intent to put you into the heart of the situation, sparing no one, revealing everything. Of course, one cannot know what a historical figure thinks, believes or desires. Even their own words are tainted by the unswerving gaze of history. Wright, however, does not let his book rest on his assumtions of thoughts and feeling.

It cost me all of 45 cents with a student ID card to get in to see the most memorable concert of my life. After the concert, Harry, Tom, Steve, and the other 3 members of his band came over to the student union and needed a place to sit. Our table had the seats and I had the pleasure of talking to a very down-to-earth, regular guy who happened to be a great artist. This CD represents his purest work, done at time before some of the personl troubles Harry later went through. Harry never made a bad recording, and this CD will always rank at the top of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more atmospheric Chapin album","review":"Although I don't agree that this is Harry's best album, it is certainly an incredible work. Perhaps because it came before my time. 'Taxi' and 'Dogtown' are really the only story songs of the bunch, a genre with which Chapin has really become identified and where he really shines. I've found that this album is definitely more atmospheric and somber than his other albums. It's a like a small voice that creeps into your mind rather than shouting at you. 'Empty' is a particularily somber and overlooked piece that I really grew attached to without really being able to explain why. Great album, but I would rate 'Dance Band on the Titanic', 'Legends of the Lost and Found' and 'Portrait Gallery' and possibly 'Verities & Balderdash' as slightly superior albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falkner 2 CD set for fans","review":"It's really not essiental but fans of Jason Falkner will enjoy this import CD of demos (five of which were previously released on his domestic CD The 4 Track Years) and remakes of classic pop/rock & folk songs. The covers vary from earnest, overly faithful to fun reinterpretations of classic songs by Joni Mitchell, The Kinks, Brian Eno and The Byrds.

Then I got so engrossed in the storyline that I was finding myself smiling while reading. Couldn't put the book down once I got into it as all I wanted to do was find out what Josh Greene's secret was. I recommend all of Jude Devereaux's books as she takes you right into the story.

You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Enchanted Land","review":"While reading other reviews of this book, I'm beginning to wonder if I read the same book as others! This was the worst book I have read. No sympathy toward Morgan and what she went through. And Seth, betrays her because of a kiss? He doesn't like women, and yet can't see through their conniving when it comes to Morgan? The character's were completely unbelievable, and I can't believe Morgan would put up with Seth, especially when he \\"kidnaps\\" her at the end.

I like others remember Jude Deveraux from my late teens and twenties and was looking forward to a reissue that I had missed. Holy cow - this book was an train wreck. Just when you think it can't possibly get any worse - she manages to surprise you with yet another horrifying plot device. Attempted rape, actual rape, absent hero and insipid heroine aside - the book was totally and horribly implausible to a fault. It made books like Shades of Grey look like documentaries. I seriously hope that others aren't completely deterred by this book and turned off to JD because she does have some great titles, this just doesn't happen to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't my favorite","review":"I don't know how anyone ever finished this book. I've read almost everyone of JD's books, and she is by far my favorite author. But this book is hideous. The characters are flat and boring, showing no motives whatsoever for anything they do. I couldn't feel anything for Morgan or Seth. I couldn't even get past the first fifty pages. I wouldn't give the book any stars but for the fact that Jude Deveraux wrote it and I love her books. I don't recommend this novel to anyone, but try one of her others, like A NIGHT IN SHINNING ARMOR or WHISHES, those are pure magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters not well-defined, stilted reading.","review":"I love Jude's books, but this was a disapointment. Seth and Morgan were completely uninteresting until they parted halfway through the book. At that point, they seemed to come alive as characters, and I found myself rooting for Gordon to win Morgan's love. It did get better, but as I said not until they parted and that was over 100 pages into the book. I wouldn't recommend this if you've never read one of her books before, it'll give you the wrong impression.

This book was so erratic jumping into so many different story lines that I had to keep going back to make sure I didn't skip/miss something.

She gets kidnapped & he finds her 6mths later, has sex with her & leaves, she gets pregnant from the encounter & he misses the entire 9 mths of her pregnancy, & still yet is gone another 18 MONTHS of the childs life..... So right there they spent almost 3 YEARS apart :/ Even when they do FINALLY get back together it wasn't good. The ending of the book was abrupt & stupid.

You get what you pay for. I was debating on getting a Babyliss Pro vs. Hot Tools before I bought this and thought well they both are similar however the price range was a big difference Babyliss ($84.99) vs Hot Tools (34.28) so I opted for the Hot Tools.Now that the ceramic coating continues to peel off I am considering buying a new one and will most likely go with a more QUALITY brand hoping the curling iron and its Ceramic plate lasts longer!!I do love this iron for the time being but dislike the fact that my hair touches a metal plate and is considerably damaging my hair....."},{"rating":"1","title":"TURNED MY HAIR PURPLE","review":"This curling iron worked great - creates long lasting beautiful curls for my fine straight hair.

Initially I replaced it with a $100 Paul Mitchell 1\\" curling iron with digital read out from a retail store. It worked fine and the blue digital read out was impressive, but I kept thinking this is crazy, it doesn't knock my socks off. So I purchased this through Amazon and only paid $17.00!! Works great, returned the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"Great curling iron, however this is the second one that has stopped working on me. I replaced the first one thinking it was a fluke, but the 2nd one is doing the same thing after less than a year.

However, it never did that to her hair. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that every curling iron works differently with different hair. After doing intensive research, on which one was the perfect one to buy, that would LEAST damage my hair.. I found the Hot Tools Ceramic! I LOVE IT! I curled my hair 3 days in a row with excitement! Not once did it do to my hair what the Revlon did. It got hot REALLY fast, stays hot, and made beautiful curls! Recommend it 100%. Price is right. Easy to use for a beginner like me!

However, if you use this, make sure you have about 20 minutes for the entire process. Mind did NOT have a foldaway safety stand so I had to stand there and hold it while it heated, do my hair, then stand there like an idiot until it cooled enough to set it down. There is NOTHING to keep it off your counter to avoid burning your countertop. I'm sending it back.

Martha produces a beautiful magazine and her new Best of Weddings book is superb so I thought that this book, although older, would be a nice addition. I was disappointed. Although the book was published in 1999, it seemed even more outdated than that. The flowers used seemed repeated over and over again and the book was centered completely around the varieties in Martha's garden. For a more thorough view, I'd like to recommend 2 books in place of this one. Jane Packer's Fast Flower Arranging is fantastic and shows beautiful arrangements that can be made quickly even by a novice. For actual, technical \\"how to\\" steps and design theory, I'd recommend Judith Blacklock's \\"Flower Arranging\\" (might be called Teach Yourself Flower Arranging in some indexes).

They look stunning massed together.\\" Most of the description is of her garden.However, the photographs ARE wonderful and gave me many, many ideas. I checked this book out of the library to get ideas for my wedding, and it's a book that I've renewed several times.Most of the arrangements included are simple yet elegant, involving one species of flower or monochromatic color schemes.I recommend this book as long as you're looking for arrangement ideas, not step-by-step instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new world of pokemon!","review":"In Pokemon Gold you are allowed into the land of Johto!

Well this is one of those most thrilling games. The object of this game is to capture all 250 pokemon to fill up your pokedex which indicates how many pokemon you've captured and seen(you will earn it in the game).In the beginning of the game you start out talking with Prof. Oak (a pokemon researcher) about pokemon and what the object of the game is. You meet up with Gary(your rival) and you pick your first pokemon out of three(Chikorita,Cyndaquil,and Totodile).Then you are off on your journey from city to city capturing pokemon and battling pokemon trainers. It's an exciting game and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the little ones!","review":"I'm sure this is a great game for older kids, but unless your 5 year old can read, try something else.

I think you should be able to fight with people who have the red,blue and yellow versions it just isn't as much fun just being able to fight have aganist people who have the gold, silver and crystall versions.It is also a pain when you trade pokemon I mean pokemon like pikachu who knows a move like zapcanon can not be traded with people who have pokemon blue red and yellow it gets to be a pain having to get my pokemon that I can trade to the blue red and yellow you have to go to blackthron city and talk to te move deleter to remove the move before you can trade it.

The first, in 1932, was a hyped-up vehicle for Arthur Wontner featuring fistfights, motorboat chases, and a peroxide Mary Morstan. This one was made in the middle of the Granada TV series and has two crippling problems. The first is Jeremy Brett, at the beginning of the illness that would take his life, and consequently losing his looks, voice, and presence. The second problem is that the central romance has been eliminated -- and without it, the whole point of the story (Watson's chivalry) is entirely lost.

The pregnant woman is always referred to as either \\"your wife\\" or a \\"girl.\\" Also, its expectations of fathers are quite low: be patient, don't sulk, be nice.

It's not my first introduction to yoga, but I think it is good for beginners and intermediates. What I like most about the tape is that it is a decent yoga workout in 30 minutes that does not focus entirely on sun salutations as do many other tapes (though poses from the sun salutation are included). It also shows modifications for people with less flexibility (or for a less demanding session). It also takes some of the \\"mystery\\" out of yoga and treats it as stretching with breathing. After doing this tape for a while, though, I find that I am beginning to dislike the set alot. It would have been so much more pleasant to have been taped outdoors with some scenery. Otherwise, I think it's a good tape when I don't want to spend a lot of time stretching. I do find that I reach for this tape more than some of my others tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a walk in the park!","review":"I fondly imagined that this would be a gentle stretch to soothing music, so was rather challenged by quite a tough workout. One thing, do have a proper mat. My knees did not do well on a towel and I had to purchase a good mat before I could repeat the workout.

It is definitely not a good choice as my first Yoga tape. Although there is someone in the class doing a modified version of the poses, I felt they weren't modified enough. Many times, it seemed like she was doing the exact same pose as the instructor, except for the fact that her knees were a little bent. This experience hasn't soured me on yoga, though.

I used to be an aerobics instructor but over the years I have not exercised much mostly due to a knee injury. This yoga is very appropriate to do if you have any kind of injuries that require no impact activity. There is a lot of stretching and strengthening involved which is very good. When you do this yoga, you can relax and enjoy it. It is very easy for beginners. However, watch out! The next day you will be sore in places you forgot existed!

I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga, and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement. The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes, frankly), not teaching YOU how to do it properly. I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes, starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.& Tone, Tot. Body Cond., and Cond.& Stress Relief, among others. I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes. Learning yoga is a wonderful thing. The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations, and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to cry...","review":"When my original copy of this game was broken during a move 5 years ago, finding it again is nothing short of awesome!!!The game itself is a RPG Action style game mostly 3D with a 360 degree environment, also as a break from the usual RPG's of the time this game has no random battles!!! All enemies are visible before you have to fight them and only respawn after you leave the area and come back. Other than that the story is a lot of fun and the interaction between the 2 characters Mint and Rue (both are ingredients used in real world cooking) is funny without being crazy!Beyond that this game is relatively old so the controls and timing for some newer gamers would make things a little strained but stick with it it's well worth it to play it through at least once per character!I loved this game and still want to add it to my collection again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rock funk candy","review":"Some reviewers are talking about \\"flaws\\" in the CD.

I've had the pleasure and honor of performing with him through the Pan Afrikan People's Arkestra. I personally own this book. If you are ever in the Los Angeles area, you have to see him live.

NO PLACE TO GO, SIX DAYS ON THE ROAD, BORN IN CHICAGO, HELLO LITTLE GIRL are tunes that also rock the house and shows us some of the bands influences. However, the true gem on this album just might be another original Thorogood composition, OKLAHOMA SWEETHEART. It is a country ballad that fits in perfectly on this album. It is a gem that the listener will truly enjoy. I think everyone reading this should go out and buy this album now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthless, but close","review":"This album is bad.

The title track is playful.This is the ballad half of the \\"Pure Getz\\" concert (I think this is the much better half, despite it's delayed release). Mostly Standards Getz meshes well with other players in the band. Ensemble playing is as close to perfect as it gets. With a sense of effortless lightness.ROMANTIC, Smoky, Lyrical, Blue fog notes. Good for late night listening. Lyrical and melancholy.These Concord albums are rapidly going out of stock. Buy it while you can!!!Excellent recording quality. Highest recommendation! One of Stan's best posthumous releases. Wish I could change rating to 5 stars (or more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Outstanding Getz Album","review":"\\"Blue Skies\\" released in 1982 on Concord Records is a fantastic album. Absolute lyrical beauty. Jazz doesn't get much better than this folks. This is the ticket right here. From start to finish, you won't be disappointed, especially if you're a Getz fan. Getz is joined by Jim McNeely on piano, Marc Johnson on bass, and Billy Hart on drums. This trio is empathic to Getz's musical vision. If this album doesn't bring tears to your eyes, especially after hearing the second tune \\"Antigny,\\" then you have no soul. You don't want to miss out on this one. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!","review":"With the camera angles and sound, this dvd could have been great.

It is a beautiful, heavy, well made pan with a high domed lid(included). It is a good sized pan and I really love the \\"helper handle\\". Yes, it is somewhat heavy...but I think that is a plus. It cleans up like a dream and I love the fact that you do not have to be extra careful about metal utensils, the dishwasher etc.(although I love this pan so much that I will probably \\"baby it\\").

Unfortunatly I think I'm like one of 10 people in this country that know how wonderful and refreshing these songs sound.A little something for everyone here, and I find myself remembering the melodies and hooks to these songs quite well, thank you very much. Perhaps Aussies are taking Ms. Noonan for granted?

Sadly, I've never met him before. I do not totally understand all of his stuff on VERTEX, but I still like it. Just the music alone is awesome, and then you listen to what he is saying.

The pictures are amazing, and the story telling style is excellent.I proudly display this book in my office (at a bank) where my clients and I often talk cars.

With a couple exceptions, Ford muscle cars are generally dismissed.

The diet is complete BS. No refined flour or sugar? A bagel is a treat? I like the Q & A format but little else. For sound medical advice, I found the Mayo Clinic guide to pregnancy great. For fun reading, the Girlfriend's Guide. For quick reading with some neat pictures, Pregnancy for Dummies. Overall, it's a good companion piece to a pg collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhaustive and informative but not very inspiring.","review":"This was yet another of the many books I read in pregnancy but I am an obstetric anaesthetist so have a good knowledge of problems in pregnancy already. I am surprised that this book has provoked such vitriolic reviews although I too prefered Sheila Kitzinger. I thought that this was actually a reassuring book for people who do get complications in pregnancy and the chapters relating to such complications were sensible. I am afraid I have little sympathy for people who object to the eating dogma (everything on your fork...!!!) cos believe me, if you are like me and put on too much weight only a few pounds of which disappears at birth then you too will wish you had considered each forkful a bit more carefully!!Overall I think people would be well advised to combine this with a more \\"naturally\\" orientated book but that if used in combination with other sources it may well be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introductory book on pregnancy.","review":"Being pregnant for the first time, I've found the revised edition of WHAT TO EXPECT... to be a good basic book on pregnancy. I didn't feel that the book emphasized the negatives (perhaps it was different in the first edition?), nor do I feel that they condemn moms who just have to have that chocolate bar or pint of Ben & Jerry's (heck, they recommend cheating on your diet once a week!). My main gripe with the book is that the exercise section is a bit confusing; they name exercises but don't do a good job of showing how they're done. It's also sometimes not clear, when they talk about a certain number of weeks into the pregnancy, whether they mean weeks since conception or weeks since last menstrual period. Overall, though, I've found it to be a good introduction to pregnancy. It shouldn't be your only book, but no book should be your only book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear-based and mysogynistic","review":"Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. Pregnancy has the potential to be an amazing time in which you can connect to the power and effectiveness of your own body. These authors seem determined to frighten and pathologize you for the normal, healthy, and miraculous event taking place in your life. Having read literally hundreds of medical studies, I can attest that the \\"doctor knows all\\" philosophy which is so rampant in the United States (although not in the 22 countries with better birth outcomes) is misguided. Do yourself the favor of doing a little research of your own, and steer clear of this fear-based book. Better-educated authors include Sheila Kitzinger, Penny Simkin, and Gayle Peterson. (Hint: if you're interested in the pregnancy and childbirth literature, look up books by Henci Goer. She summarizes the literature clearly and accurately.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided and horrible.","review":"For anyone experiencing a less than perfect pregnancy, this is a horrible and upsetting book.

And neither does my sleep-deprived husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful as Reference, Harmful as Guide","review":"Yes, everyone should have this book, if only as a detailed reference resource for everything that could conceivably go wrong with a pregnancy. However, the tone is condescending, the \\"facts\\" are tempered with neither reason nor perspective, and the overall attitude seems to be: 'If something goes wrong, it's ALL YOUR FAULT' (e.g. the \\"best odds\\" diet).By all means, use this book. But unless you feel the need to take orders, or have the confidence to read without immediate self-doubt, do yourself a favor and get a book that will support you as a prospective parent and human being (e.g. The Hip Mama's Guide, or Dr. Sears' book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this book!","review":"I did not like the way the book seemed focus on problems that can occur - for example, there was a brief discussion about a problem that occurs in 2% of pregnancies. Well, if there is a 98% chance that it won't happen to me, I don't want to start worrying about it now! Also, I have always had a relatively healthy diet but when I read the following quote I had to laugh - \\"Before you close your mouth on a forkful of food, consider: 'Is this the best bite I can give my baby?' If it will benefit your baby, chew away. If it'll only benefit your sweet tooth or appease your appetite, put your fork down.'\\" Talk about pressure! If you stress yourself about about every forkful of food, I believe that the stress is probably worse on the baby than if you had allowed yourself to have that handful of M&M's!

I was put off by the cover - I mean c'mon, it's ugly; anyway, I read the summary and decided it sounded interesting, and I've always been a fan of Irish and British chick lit, so I decided it was worth $10 and bought it. The first chapter gave me pause, but I kept going and after a few more pages I was really into it. I finished it in 2 days and couldn't put it down before bed...I had to force myself to stop reading it so I could function at work the following morning. The characters are realistic and funny, it's humorous and sexy and there is a fun mystery thrown into the mix as well.

I was a history major, but never learned about revolutionary or pre-revolutionary Paris/France, and have never had a chance to travel there -- a good work of historical fiction is probably the best way to learn. Mute Witness has left a wonderfully alive picture of the times and places its characters inhabited.WARNING: If you are prone to reading-induced insomnia, have someone hide this book before bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Authentic","review":"Absolutely a good read, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and found it very authentic - even with some French spelling of titles.

I'm looking forward to Charles O'Brien's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Combination of Mystery and History","review":"Mr. O'Brien vividly captures the years just prior to the French Revolution, with a fascinating cast of characters and a story that's gently laced with suspense throughout.

The first 4 are excellent, but someone at Fantagraphics made a terrible boo-boo when they did 1935. ALL the strips in the entire book are in the wrong order! The Monday strip each week follows the previous week's Saturday strip, and then is followed by the Sunday strip on the next page. I talked to someone at Fantagraphics about this gross publishing error, and they told me that they were NOT planning to reprint the book with the strips in the correct order! The existing book is virtually unreadable because of Fantagraphics' uncaring corporate decision, and this is undoubtedly why Fantagraphics never did any more of these books beyond 1935. The other earlier books are fine, but avoid this one at all costs. The new \\"Complete LOA\\" book #5 published by the Library of American Comics has the beginning of 1935, and in December #6 will come out, which will have all the rest of 1935."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!!!!!!","review":"I can defenitly say, I learned aleason buying this product.

It is moody, and the descriptions are interesting. On the other hand, the characters are shallow and not rememberable. The story is confusing, unbelievable, and jarring. The author attempted to tell the story from five different points of view without clarifying when this switch between people was made. The character's voices are not distinguishable from one another.

The story--a memoir--is written in the most unusual and engaging literary voice I've read in months. Not a word out of place. \\"Uncle Eddy\\" has wonderful mastery of organization and rhythm in language, and a particulary strong sense of the daily absurd. Reading Wintle's tale is not unlike sitting down to coffee with an animated, cultured and highly eccentric girlfriend. Nevertheless, this documentation of the destruction of a little girl's childhood and her Uncle Eddy's frantic, well-meaning attempts to salvage her psyche and heart and provide her with a loving, stable home is also a harrowing read, particularly for a parent. An very interesting book for adults, but not for children and certainly not for anybody who has even a smidgen of homophobia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, smart and moving read","review":"BREAKFAST WITH TIFFANY is one of the few memoirs in recent years that I have absolutely adored. I loved Wintle's struggle to keep his life somewhat normal in the face of Tiffany's sudden (and unavoidable) presence in his life. I also thought Tiffany seemed like a very real teenager--angry and moody one minute, vulnerable and scared the next.

Deus Ex was 98's Game of the Year, and after playing it through 5 times, I'd categorize it in my top ten ever. The graphics aren't incredible (considered good in 98), but sufficient enough to help the plot of the game along. And what a plot it is.

In simple and accessible language, Bulla tells fascinating - often historical - stories that will keep your child riveted to the page.The Secret Valley is set during the California Gold Rush, and relates the adventures of the Davis family (and their cat, Nugget) as they travel from Missouri by covered wagon to seek their fortune in the golden fields of California. The journey is difficult, with rivers, mountains, and prairies to cross, and regular encounters with Indians.Once they reach California, they make friends and begin their search for gold. They learn that prospecting is hard work, and there is no guarantee of success.In the end, the Davis family does not strike it rich in a monetary sense, but they find they have what they truly want - a new home in a beautiful new land.Highly recommended, along with anything else written by Clyde Bulla."},{"rating":"2","title":"just an opinion, but","review":"you have to love an artist you gives you the full song every time. she has a wonderful voice, and great timing and an occassional smile you can hear through the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd had some bright spots that made me smile","review":"This is another Susannah Mccorkle cd for me to add to my collection.

Susannahs' voice never sounded better. This is a cd that the performers seemed to enjoy playing on and I think this feeling has spilled over to the listener as well.I think the repertoire performed her left a lot to be desired.Cole Porter sure pinned a lot of wonderul songs that were excluded from this project.I know it's impossible to please all the fans of Susannah, so some of us fans will just have to be half pleased with this cd.Recommendation: I think it would be alright to buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Susannah is better live than on cds","review":"My wife and I had the privilege of hearing Susannah live on several occasions at the Oak Room in the Big Apple.

We felt like she was a member of our extended family. She was a great performer, but least of all a great person. She did a lot of charity work, but never ask for publicity. We will al miss her!As far as this cd goes, we only liked 5 songs out of the 14 performed her. My calculator says this is only a 40% rating so all we can give her for this effort is a 2 star rating.

Too bad, because the recital in Helsinki from August, 1976 includes a potent account of two Richter favorites, Beethoven's Op. 10 no. 3 sonata, in which he found strong shades of the composer's middle period, and Schumann's \\"other\\" carnival piece besides Carnaval, Fashingsschwank aus Wien, given a rollicking, high-spirited reading.

His car trip through the Chilean North with his wife, Angelica, so many years later, is at once a reflection on those events as he visits concentration camps, clandestine graves, the family of a good friend who was \\"disappeared\\" by Pinochet's army, along with an evocation of the beauty of the desert landscape and its earlier, hidden history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best digital camera","review":"What i luv about the camera is the high resolution, clear images, and the sound recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice versatile camera","review":"I was enjoying my FD-90 and the combined convenience and hassle of having it record images onto a floppy disk (convenient in that you can easily transfer images to the computer--hassle in that you are constantly changing floppies), but now I love it.

The one bad thing is that the LCD, in bright light, the screen, and it doesn't have a regular view finder, is kid of hard to see. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with the amazingly easy to use Mavica FD90. Thanks for reading my review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing camera!","review":"I bought the Mavica fd90 about 2 months ago, and I must say that I'm quite pleased with my purchase. I recently moved to a foreign country, and this has been the ideal way for me to document my stay here - as well as have the opportunity to share all of my photos with family and friends via e-mail. A cd-rw drive allows me to save on disk space, if that is worrysome for anyone.... I read one review that stated that the camera only took 15 second movies - NOT TRUE. If you merely hold the button down longer, you can fit a 60 second movie on a 1.44 mg disk. I don't know what the capabilities are if you have the memory card, but it would be worth investigating! If you've been searching for a great camera that takes beautiful quality photos, look no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Camera Replacement","review":"In October 1997 I purchased one of the first versions of the Sony Mavica camera -- the FD7 model -- and I have replaced it with the FD90 model. The main reasons I purchased this camera was 3.5\\" storage and the versatility of the 'jpeg' files in Windows-based software. While easy to understand HOW to use, the camera itself is awkard WHEN used (especially compared to the FD7) as you need to use the same hand to grip the camera and work the controls. The 'mpeg' movie feature is a definitive plus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on the basics auto electricity","review":"This book does a very good job at teaching the basic information for the first auto course.

Worse yet, the remanufactured CL-41s are not much cheaper, especially considering the inferior quality versus the Canon-brand new ones.Is the ink good? Sure. Is the price right? No. My advice: Check the price of both new and third party ink cartridges/tanks prior to purchasing a printer.

Well, if he acted as stupidly as an operative as he did when confronted with Cliff Baxter, the antagonistic, jealous, redneck police chief, he would have been dead a long time ago. One would think that Keith would have more \\"street smarts.\\"In addition, his endless use of one word ,\\"yes\\" or \\"no\\", answers to questions made me realize Keith had a flat, bland personality that he carried throughout the story.If I hadn't had a long commute, I would have shut the tape off after the first side."},{"rating":"1","title":"spenceville","review":"after reading to page 210, pages 211 to 242 were missing.

This is a departure from other Demille novels, in that he cut out the technical espionage of his other novels. This is a simple love triangle between an old flame coming back to reclaim his old girl friend from her abusive bully husband, who is also the Sheriff of Spenserville. The only difference is that The old Boyfriend has 25 years of CIA training under his belt. This was one interesting intense simple novel. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most people give it credit for","review":"I've seen plenty of complaints about this novel, pertaining mainly to the characterization.

Only a well-crafted novel can produce this, and Spencerville pays off.

The Gold Coast wins that title easily, but the book is a good read. An interesting story about a former secret agent of some sorts returning home and starting over.

But it never delivered - could not believe in the stupid actions of lead character and didn't really care. The book failed in plot line, tension buildup, and any semblance of realistic or interesting character definition. Makes me think that this book was written early in DeMille's career (or by someone else) and pulled out of mothballs. Nelson, please come back to us in \\"Plum Islsnd.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"When Does the Story Start?","review":"I just can't finish this book. I'm probably two thirds the way through it and the story still hasn't kicked in. I guess there's this man who moves back to his hometown for reasons that are not at all believeable who gets in something of a confrontation with the local police chief who's married to his high school sweetheart. That's the premise and perhaps not an irretrievably bad one, but when does the story begin? Perhaps unfairly, I couldn't help comparing the story to Elmore Leonard's \\"Valdez is Coming.\\" There's a story of vengeance between a strong man and the town's local kingpin bully. Valdez not only stands up to the town's boss, but also steals his woman. It's perfectly paced and well told; the action scenes are very cool and macho; and at no time is at unbelievable. In short, it's everything that Spencerville is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence Against Women?","review":"I'd read a number of DeMille's books, including Gold Coast and Talbot Oddessy, before hearing someone complain about his gratuitous use of violence against women. I thought back to Gold Coast -- which I'd loved -- and realized that, yes, it had some questionable scenes. Then I read Spencerville, and I don't think I'll ever read another one of his novels. Every criticism of the book is accurate -- it's trite, the characters are cliche, etc. However, the graphic husband-wife rape scene is simply over the edge. I realized that every DeMille book I've ready includes not just horribly graphic violence, usually intensely graphic sexual violence against women. I then saw the film of The General's Daughter. Is this for real? A woman's reaction to her rape is to have herself tied up, spread-eagle, and naked? Please.I don't think there's any reason to encourage this crap.

The lack of effort thinking through the characters and plot is palpable. I kept waiting for some hint that Demille cared about the story, but it never came. The bad guy, Cliff Baxter, a sociopathic chief of police of a small Ohio town (Spencerville) is so awful it defies reality, but worse, he out thinks, out maneuvers and gets the better of the protagonist (supposedly a cracker jack recently retired intelligence officer) at every single critical point in the book. Unbelievable. Don't bother with this one. It will only make you mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"DeMille has written some really good books, \\"Word of Honor\\" and \\"The Charm School\\" are great reads; this one is an embarrassment that I hope he regrets. DeMille is never going to get any awards from feminists, but his books generally contain at least one strong and effective female character. In \\"Spencerville\\", the abused wife behaves with incredible stupidity and spousal abuse is exploited to a sickening degree. Especially offensive is the last scene where the lovers go off gaily together; after being imprisoned, chained, raped, and brutalized by her husband for days, there is not even a suggestion that the woman might need medical attention before rushing into the arms of her paramour.....garbage. An all-time low [I sincerely hope] for DeMille."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domestic abuse is not his best subject","review":"DeMille has written some excellent, fast-paced, engaging action about terrorists, cops, and spies. He creates an identifiable, likeable, male lead. But this is one of his weakest works, about a small-town guy who returns from sadness in the big city, only to find himself immersed in the small-time life he thought he had set aside years ago. Enter the old girl friend, with an abusive boy friend and soon you have a struggle between good and evil with an antagonist not worth our time. He makes the hero less heroic. And the dark side of domestic abuse simply does not rouse the interest, passion, or even sympathy for the characters of his other books.I'd pass on this. There are so many other, great DeMille works: Cathedral, Rivers of Babylon, Charm School, Plum Island, and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After General's Daughter, Plum Island and the Gold Coast, I had to check the cover to make certain this was really written by DeMille. Steretypical characters and an unbelievable relationship between Annie and Keith. I'm putting this aside and hoping for better in Word of Honor and Charm School."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I read this","review":"Spencerville by Nelson Demille starts out great and eventually bored me to the point I stopped reading. Unfortunately, it kept me interested enough through almost 400 pages (a wasted week for me). It's the story of an international spy who is forced to retire. He decides to return to his small Midwestern hometown and re-kindle an old relationship, while dealing with old rivals. Demille realistically captures the characters of a typical small town, and what it is like to return after being gone for years. However, the story is worn out, and extremely predictable. After a few hundred pages, the love story gets nauseating. This would not have been a bad novel if it was shortened, but 600+ pages is more than it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nelson let us down for the first time!!","review":"zzzzzzzzzz Sleeperville would be a better title.

It was action packed, there is a definite hero, there is love, action, suspence, and there is revenge, but it is a little difficult to believe parts of the story line. I have met people like Cliff Baxter, but none of them would go to the extremes that Baxter goes to in this novel.This book reminds me of a sophisticated \\"First Blood\\". Instead of the hero being a rugged John Rambo, the hero is a well dressed, clean shaven Keith Landry who, instead of being a Green Beret War hero, is a top government secret agent who happened to date the Sherrif's wife when he was in high school and college. The action in this book is great, but it seems a little far fetched. I would read this book as entertainment, but wouldn't spend too much time trying look at the realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best book.","review":"I had read 3 DeMille books before diving into this one. I was very excited because I had recently purchased all the novels he had ever written. I found Spencerville to be a catchy title and the synopsis at the back grabbed my attention so I chose to read that one out of all his other books I had just gotten. Well, after about 100 pages, I started worrying. I was devasted to find this book to be so boring, uninteresting and void of likeable characters. I was desperatly hoping that this one \\"not so great book\\" was a mere over-sight. And thankfully, it was. I have read two more of his books since then (mayday and catherdral) and both were soooooooooo amazing! I read both books in record time.I found Spenceville to be far too predictable. One could have guessed the ending after about 10 pages. The book got rather lenghty and windy at times. It is not to say that I regret having read it, far from it.

However, this book does not even come close to the excellent writing that DeMille has previously shown. The characters are almost cartoonish in their sterotypical portrayals. It is impossible to believe that a man such a Cliff Baxter would reign supreme in the small town Spencerville, and that his wife Annie, would suffer through his neanderthal and emotionally abusive behavior for 20 years, awaiting a rescue from her high school/college lover, Kieth Landry. The ending, which I gather is meant to be suspenseful, is so outlandish and implausible I nearly laughed from the stupidity. If you like to read for the sake of reading, you might be able to stomach this book. If you want a book of depth and meaning, pass this one! Choose the Gold Coast, Talbot Oddysey or any other DeMille book but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I usually buy Nelson Demille's book without any hesitation. But Spencervile really disappointed me. Love story didn't suit him very well.

AS USUAL, THE WRITING IS EXCELLENT, THE STORY IS LACKING. THE BOOK MOVES ALONG, BUT LACKS THE EXCITEMENT AND EDGE OF YOUR SEAT READING THAT I AM ACCUSTOMED TO WITH DEMILLE. READ IT IF YOU ARE A DEMILLE FAN, BUT READ THE OTHERS FIRST"},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker","review":"DeMille's character in this book is out of character most of the time. The book starts out well, but as it gets into the geteway scene Keith Landry, a retired ex intelligence bigwig, with contacts all over official Washington including a 24 hour old interview with the President who offered him a job as the aid to the National Security Counsel Chairman, forgets that he can use a telephone and get immediate assistance to head off a small town police chief. This plot line begs the imagination. While trying to get out of Ohio he stops in Toledo and can't get a flight out. Gosh, stymied again, we have forgotten all geography lesson, like the Michign border is less than a half hour away, and Detroit airport less than an hour. DeMille writes well, but he must have had a badly educated summer intern plot this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my GOD, this is DULL!!","review":"Demille really needs to recognize that his attempts at 'high literature' come off as total failures. He manages to sucker in a loyal readership to his little playtime experiments at human relations, social politics, and whatever else he chooses with which to bore them to tears. Thank heavens I got this as a loaner from a friend (actually, a 'gift'- he thought it blew chunks also) so I could tear some pages from it to be just the right thickness to wedge up the edge of a toilet as I worked a new wax seal underneath it. In that sense, Spencerville was the perfect book.And I'll never buy another Demille product again. I hear the same review can be applied to the Gold Coast and The Gate House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spencerville","review":"Mr. DeMille's writing style cannot be beat! Even when the main character turns out to be an overrated wimp, it's hard to put the book down. As usual, this novel has lots of action. The writing cannot be faulted, but the hero is less than heroic. He does not live up to his self perception and in most situations, is saved by others. I look forward to more real men as DeMille's main characters. If Keith Landry was supposed to be a loser, the author portrayed him perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a Lifetime movie; bad","review":"I got through about 15% of this book before putting it down. I love Nelson DeMille's John Corey books, but most everything else I've tried of his reads like a bad Lifetime movie. (Which is to say, any Lifetime movie!)His antagonist, Cliff Baxter, is a stereotypical evil bully chief of police in a small town. He lords over everyone, including his wife, who makes a half-hearted attempt to kill him early on. Ironically, her former lover, Keith Landry, moves back to town from his career as a national intelligence officer. He still has feelings for her, although he knows she's married. Think Keith and Cliff will do battle later on? I'm assuming so, but I'm not sticking around to find out.DeMille seems more interested in describing every acre of Spencerville and its politics than in telling a good story. Which is unfortunate, because most of the Cory novels (except \\"Up Country\\") are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You again Mr. DeMille","review":"A DeMille book is never a bad choice of a read and always entertains. Spencerville does indeed do that nicely. You've got to love these quirky characters with all their endearing flaws. While this all may sound funny, it's the place you only want to visit in a book. The cat and mouse game played throughout the book works well and keeps your attention. The sadistic side of things is edgy enough to give you a shiver, as does the invisible underworld Government angle. A darn good entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictibleville............","review":"If this had been the first DeMille book I'd picked up, I would have never read another. There are absolutely tons of these books written by other people. They are all the same....psychotic husband/boyfriend, beautiful girlfriend/wife. Or maybe she's just gone somewhere to get away from the big city and some maniac picks her out. Whatever, you know how it will end. I read it to the end---I'm a sucker for punishment (sort of...skipping long passages of abuse by the bad guy and musings by the good guy about how the world has changed, the fate of small time farms, etc). Was disappoionted that he didn't save the drunk ex-Vietnam vet...as soon as he came into the plot, I knew he was a gonner. He has written other books that are so good...I was amazed that this could be so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not credible","review":"By page 274 the only sensible thing for them to do is to elope. The only reason they don't is so the novel can go on for another 400 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domestic violence does not a compelling thriller make","review":"DeMille's odyssey into the heartland of America does not come across as a taut thriller the way \\"The Lion's Game\\" did. Instead, it's as if a Lifetime Movie of the Week were created in book form. The cat-and-mouse games between the protagonist and the villain make for somewhat tense reading at times, but I'll be at the library looking for something that DeMille wrote with Detective John Corey in it; those books are far superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but not his best.","review":"This was the fourth book I read by Nelson DeMille and this all in a 6 months frame. I fell in love with Nelson DeMille as an author when I read his novel Plum Island in June. Since then, I read The General's Daughter as well as Word of Honor and both kept me reading until the wee hours of the morning. When I got to Spenceville, I was captivated with it at the beginning, but as the story went on, I found myself somewhat bored with the all too \\"predictable\\" plot. It was still a cute story but a little too \\"feel-good\\" ending for me. The characters are easy to identify with but it is hard to create any real \\"attachement\\" to them because of their \\"whishy-washyness\\". This is not to mean that I hated the book and do not recommend it to anyone but simply that if you too are a DeMille fan, you may not want to keep this one for last. It is really light and an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far not the best of Nelson DeMille's...","review":"Compared with Plum Island and The General's Daughter, this book seemed to not even have been written by the same author. I only finished it because I kept hoping it'd get better. What wife would stay with a man like Cliff for 20 years? And the hippie couple -- what were they all about? Oh well, I'm still a DeMille fan, and I'm buying The Lion's Game in January 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil back to doing what he does best","review":"This album is terrific. If you like Neil, and enjoyed All-Night Fox, you are sure to love this album. More approachable than its predecesor, this album really has a smoky, yet organized garage feel to it, turning your listening station into your favorite dive instantaneously. I really love this album. The only downside is its length. The album only lasts 30 minutes. Nonetheles, it is definitely Neil's best work since the first Howling Hex album. Don't be stupid. Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference","review":"The Sacra Pagina series is a very reliable and accessible resource I use when preparing a sermon or bible study.

Though You can get the star trek encounters track on Neil Norman's Greatest Sci Fi Hits Volume IV, I'm not sure if that was available when this was released. If you can get this cheap, pick it up. Neil Norman's encounters suite is awesome, and its nothing like Meco's star trek: the motion picture disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap CD","review":"The music on this CD is a lame imitation of Meco Monardo's fabulous disco-style sci-fi music.

The over-long section on Holmes dreams definitely looked like filler to use up more time; which to me was time wasted.At the end, efforts were made to tie all of the loose ends together and as far as I recall they were pretty much eventually explained.I'm sure I will not watch this one again and would strongly suggest if anyone is curious about this movie, rent it first and see what you think before making a purchase decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Little Holmes!","review":"The trouble with the lengthened 2-hour Sherlock Holmes films with Jeremy Brett was that they often wound up boring.

I finally learned to like LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, but this is asking too much There was a feminist Dutch movie about a cabal of women shoppers who kill a shopkeeper or salesman, some of you know the one I mean, and this was down there in that absence of purpose and empathy department for me. A woman thinks she might have run over someone while driving and spends the rest of the movie agonizing over whether she did or not, when no evidence whatsoever surfaces that such was the case.

In this case, I was fortunate. Most of the unplayable sections were not in the ballet itself but in the curtain calls and extras. Most, but not all. In other Arthaus Musik Blu-Rays, I was not so fortunate. I had to return two different Arthaus Musik's Blu-Rays of Braunfels's Die Vögel before Amazon and I gave up trying to get a playable copy. By now, I have become expert on trying to remedy these defects with the help of Amazon's technicians. Alas, when the defect is in the manufacture, nothing can be done. I have contacted Arthaus Musik twice, but they have ignored me. Not only no quality control, but no regard for their customers. Caveat emptor.

I think they did a great job winding the tension up through the previous 3 volumes and it continues flawlessly into this one to an epic final confrontation.

Innes can get away with all of this, partly because he writes so well, but largely because he keeps the good-natured sanity of Inspector Appleby at the heart of the novel. Although that wise and learned detective just about manages to keep the whole absurd apparatus anchored, there are moments in which he risks becoming a bit of a know-it-all. If you can tolerate those, you'll like this a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedic melodrama in astonishingly good prose","review":"One of the strangest novels I have ever read. Plot is absolutely over-the-top, intentionally comedic melodrama, wildly improbable though of course technically explicable, with long-lost children and misplaced parents etc. The writing however clothes it all in vivid, lurid, yet believable and even realistic details.

He seemed angry and crazy. I saw his act live several years ago and I laughed til I cried all night. Where was the creative genius I'd seen before?!

It worked for about 6 months of light use, then quit working (turned off or wouldn't turn on at all). Creative tech support recommended downloading new driver, but this didn't help. So I was going to send it in because it is still under warranty. However, they require a non-refundable $25 \\"diagnostic and handling\\" fee just to send it in (plus I pay shipping), and there may or may not be additional charges for labor.

For every subject they mention, however, they give great dialogue and explanations of certain words, cultural differences, etc. I was 14 when I began reading this book, and was able to understand it very well. However, being on my own with this language had its downfalls, for when I actually got into a classroom, I found I had the pronunciation a little off, but I was able to pick up very quickly on the hiragana and katakana writing systems, sentence structure, and vocabulary.

The font size is almost three times too big so not much information is on each page even though this book is quite large.

It is about conquering independence in African countries that are colonized, here by the English. Must this liberation come through violence or through christian love ? Must this liberation be radical or progressive ? The film answers that christian love is essential, the church must lead this liberation and it must come progressively. We may regret that the point of view of the nationalist forces among Africans are not described in their real terms, contradictions and stakes. The film wants to prove its point and neglects the arguments of the other side, through it has the courage to show that some whites are for the use of pure violence to impose their domination and the exploitation of the natural resources of the country.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read with a glass of wine in the sun","review":"Annie Hawes writes in a slow, laid-back style that is evocative of the Ligurian lifestyle that she lives.

Even the color of red was odd -- sort of rosey pink, instead of red. I do have to say that returns thru Amazon are AWESOME.

The no-drip carafe is a huge improvement over any other coffee maker I've had in the past. And, if you at all geek-out over design, you won't be disapointed in how this looks on your counter.

After about 1 month, one of two little nubs that holds the carafe top in place broke off and now the top falls off when you tip the carafe to pour the last 1-2 cups out. All of the numbers and marking are gone from the side, so I have a sharpie mark on the handle for the approximate level that seems to get us 6 cups. More of an annoyance, but the top that flips up to load water and coffee is so big that I can't flip it up under our cabinets. I have to pull the whole coffee maker out to the edge of the counter top, load the water and coffee, close the lid, and then push the thing back under the cabinets so that the kids can't reach the hot surface.On the plus side, it makes coffee every time :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"coffeemaker","review":"I love the color of the coffee maker.

My husband has had nothing but complaints with this coffee maker ever since the day it arrived. (Luckily I drink tea and don't have to use it.) Poor design, ugly color--more like a maroon rather than hot red like everyone said it was, and the length of the cord is a joke--way too short which makes filling the pot with water impossible.

The yellow one was discontinued, so I bought this one in red. I am very unhappy with it. It is poorly constructed- my old one was very heavy-duty and this one is plastic and cheap. My biggest issue is that when you pull the coffee pot out, the clock goes to 00:00 and you have to reset it. I have reset the clock at least 10 times in a month. Bad investment on my part. ;{"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap garbage/poor planning/bad coffee","review":"I always buy cheap coffee makers b/c they break no matter how much they cost but this is the worst and it's not broken. My cord is about 6 inches long requiring a 3-prong extenstion cord just to get the the basic plug right behind it on the wall. It collects so much moisture on the inside of the lid to the coffee chamber that everytime I open it I get a shower of water all over. The water chamber opening, although the funnel type should work beautifully, the hole is too small so you have to pour the water very slowly or it pours thru to where the coffee pot would be-if I wasn't pouring the water-makes a mess of a puddle...and the coffee is bitter. Same coffee I've used for 10 years in other makers but I can't get the right ratio to water to make it not bitter. I usually double the grounds b/c I drink it strong but no matter how little, it's bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Well Red Coffee Maker","review":"Had an old Braun that kept clogging up and leaking water all over the counter. Had sticker shock when I started to shop online and other places for a replacement. Something relatively simple with a decent capacity as one cup of hot coffee for me equals about four cups as measured on the carafe. It brews quick and is pretty painless to use. It can use a permanent filter(not included) or paper filters and I've used both. If you want a stronger cup of coffee then you need to add more coffee grounds or use a stronger blend. The brew cycle is not adjustable for strength. It's solid, well built, and the glass carafe feels easier to handle than the typical glass pot. Easy to Clean. A Good Basic Design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker","review":"This Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker has been the best one I have purchased over the years.

Don't want it to leak? Don't overfill it. The soft plastic lid is removable for easy cleaning and is virtually unbreakable but I suppose it does take some mechanical dexterity to snap it back on. The pot itself will only leak if you pour too fast or aren't paying attention to what you are doing. I think everyone would agree that no coffee pot is without controversy. Every brand and model # of coffepot has it's own idiosyncrasies and you simply learn to work around them. But I suppose some people will always find something to bitch about.

This might be this particular machine, though, who knows? Not so bad worth returning but annoying. I like the round \\"Mr. Coffee-shaped\\" coffee filter (versus the cone-shaped my last one used). The water-fill section is a bit small and awfully close to where you put the grounds, so be careful, but overall the machine is cleverly-built and the coffee perks quickly and tastes great.

It just seemed like some run-of-the-mill, sex-oriented song. But the more I heard it, the more I appreciated it. It's reaaaaally catchy, and the video's actually pretty cool.

It intertwines seductive vocals from Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Gracinha Leporace, and India.Arie, and balances it with the talents of John Legend,Stevie Wonder, and others. This was the perfect marriage between old school classic and new school magic. Sergio Mendes has proven why his music is timeless. Now, if only Will.I.Am did not need to feature himself so much on this album, considering the fact that he produced it. Yet, do not let this discourage you from buying the best album of 2006!! Think of it as an investment piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Travesty on a great Talent","review":"I used to have all of Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66... albums. When I saw they were doing a tribute to Sergio I thought it was about time. Unfortunately it was the wrong time and the wrong talent. They have taken Sergio's classics and made them tripe, most of which has an undercurrent of rap. I suppose there is something to be said about the Brazilian indian chants like Ye Me Le from the album of the same name being brazilian rap, but I will not say it. If you have money to burn, waste, or spend friously then by all means buy this CD, but if you appreciate the talent and the warm of may tempos that graced Sergio Mendes' beautiful music stay away from this piece of you know what. Perfection should never be messed with, and that is what this CD is a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the background","review":"The beats and instrumental aspects of the remixes are just fine, even good, but the rap is too simplistic for a serious listen. This stuff works as hip party background music where you've got enough people noise to quell Will I Am. Not on your car or your ipod where you'll actually have to listen to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...you cannot mash the old (Sergio) with the new (Will.i.am & company) and be successful if you can't keep the spirit of the original and yet give it a fresh sound.

I like Sergio. I respect hip hop. Together, it's now working.The attraction of Brazilian music, for me, is its effortlessness. It's seductive in its simplicity. So when you add some rapper who's totally in my face tossing off lyrics about \\"empty 40 oz. bottles\\" and \\"Brazilian beauties with booties that wobble,\\" it just doesn't work.So we have a forced, unnatural marriage of two distinct musical styles. They're fine on their own, but neither compliments the other on this album. And what's this -- \\"yo, yo, yo, yo\\" -- Will I Am rapping about people that sound hollow? Hmm.I give it \\"2\\" because it's in tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless","review":"A great combination of the old and new. Sergio Mendes again flawlessly fuses classic bossa nova with hip modern artistes putting their spin on his timeless classics. Just goes to show why he's still relevant and current 30 odd years later. Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Brazilian Music but...","review":"While I am glad to see Bossa Nova and Tropicalismo make a push toward the commercial market in the U.S. again, the recording is not satisfying to me because the spirit of the music is lost with imposed rhythms that make no sense in context. Hip Hop and club beats just don't work very well with this music. They sound rather awkward and generic compared to the great variety of authentic Brazilian rhythms... like putting monster truck tires on a Porsche. Perhaps the best cut is Berimbau because it is sung by a Brazilian. You have to appreciate David Byrne more after this project. Sergio - please put out a real Brazilian music CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than horrible","review":"This is possibly the worst \\"tribute\\" CD I have ever heard.

If you want true Sergio Mendes music do not buy this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"SergioFan","review":"This is cd in my opinion is horrible. If you're a true diehard Sergio Mendes fan don't expect much out of this. The worse CD I've purchased this year. Maybe if the black eyed peas had been absent on this then it would've been a classic but as it is, it's JUNK! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"One would hope that a man of Sergio's profound musical and production talent would not be swayed by whatever prevailing style is blowing in the wind. This CD however proves otherwise. Take for example the 1st tune, Mas Que Nada. Beautifully produced on the 1st Brazil 66 album, this version is painful to endure with an inappropriate hip-hop beat and inane rap lyrics. While there are a few songs that express some of the great quality and depth of Sergio's previous works, far too many suffer from an inorganic attempt to combine contemporary hip-hop techniques with classic Brazilian tunes. To hear some great Sergio check out the 1st two Brazil 66 albums or the wonderful Brazileiro. While I would consider many of Sergio's previous works \\"timeless\\", this project certainly is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Bollocks..!!","review":"\\"Timeless\\"? I think not..!Classic '60s KOOL is desecrated by rap age, hip-hop twits who think they know better. I suppose The Black Eyed Peas ran out of their own ideas and felt they should smear their brand of non-singing and obnoxious street thump over a masterwork. These fools on the hill would spray graffiti over the Mona Lisa.Stick to the original Brasil '66 album, plus \\"Look Around\\" and \\"Equinox\\"... or pick up the very reasonably-priced \\"Greatest Hits\\". Mind you, if you prefer trendiness over originality, this remixed abomination may very well be your (very tepid) cup of tea.In years to come, the originals will still be unsurpassed and this mess will be very passé. That's if it is remembered at all.Awful, just AWFUL..!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to wreck a perfectly good Sergio Medes recording","review":"This is perhaps the most annoying record I've heard. Whatever you might think are the merits of hip-hop, its aesthetic is the polar opposite of the light and cheery samba and bossa nova of Sergio Mendes, and trying to graft one on to the other only produces a mess. I think there may be some good songs in here, but they're buried beneath the dumbed-down bass-heavy layer of hip hop and rap, so who can tell? All the sophisticated and complex rhythms of Brazil are bludgeoned by the idiotic simplicity of New York street music. I can't imagine anyone, of either musical persuasion, finding this CD to work. But then maybe you think Justin Timberlake is a musician, in which case you'll probably love this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING!","review":"I guess it all comes down to... whether you like hip hop/rap or not. I actually HATE it and feel like the songs were completely ruined. I've liked Sergio Mendes since I was little and I almost cried when I heard this. I'm sure some people will enjoy it but if you don't like Black Eyed Peas and stuff like that, you will definitely not like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Sergio","review":"Oi!I purchased this CD for one track... MAS QUE NADA, hoping I would discover another gem in the mix..... Nao... nothing else did too much for me, too much of the BEP's and not enough Sergio for my taste. MAS QUE NADA rocks (the video too) but unless you are a real BEP's fan, good luck. Muito coco!Abracos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mednes is timeless but not this version","review":"This is an updated version of Mendes' earlier recordings make them appeal the younger generations. The added rhythms do not fit well at all with the cooler Latin/jazz/Brazilian beat. The singers aren't that good and their voices do not blend with earlier singers. It is a shame to ruin classic sounds with something that sounds like a rhythm machine on an electronic piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Things Just Shouldn't Be Mixed","review":"I like Sergio Mendes.

This can be the only reason for making this mess. Why would anyone in their right minds want to do this. I can't even imagine it.

I wish the publisher or author would have chosen a better printed, \\"reader-friendly\\" appearance.The book might be loaded with awesome information and stories... once my eyes adjust to the format, I'll be able to find out.

I would caution someone who is very new to sign language to hold off on this particular book due to the lack of pictures. Also, some of the signs are outdated (Especially the country and city signs... but these, after all, seem to change on a somewhat DAILY basis). All in all, this book is wonderful at illustrating the use of idioms and words that mean many things... for instance, if you sign \\"run\\" do you mean run away, a runny nose, run for president, a run in pantyhose, or a run like in a card game? This books is an excellent source for learning how to sign English idioms of all sorts... I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for spices!","review":"We put this in the back corner of our counter as additional spice storage.

I'm sorry, but the whole thing is nothing but an over-written college essay. The author seems to have collected nothing but undescriptive, dry, unopinionated facts from other documents and simply thrown them together with no bearing on flow or feeling within the pages. The author jumps from one unrelated subject matter to the next, introducing names and events that have no bearing on the point of the chapter. There is continuous overuse of elaborate vocabulary as to keep focus on the author's wit & inteligence of such words, instead of simply focusing on describing the subject at hand.

However, to compare her to Barbie or Bratz or call her \\"tarty\\" is ridiculous! Madeline still is a little girl doll, only now she is a bit more trendy. It's not like she wears low-rise jeans or revealing shirts like other dolls! In fact, I personally like her clothing. Odd that they would pick a color scheme that doesn't look that nice with her coat and hat though. As for the doll herself, I think the head is cute, but I HATE the body mold they used. The limbs are too thin and make the hands look too big. It looks just weird. However, when wearing her coat, she looks okay.In conclution, I like this doll. If you don't like her, don't purchase her.

The only local outlet here has already run out of the real Madeline dolls, and others seems to be having the same problem. Just try to successfully bid on Madeline dolls on E-bay.

Dane's team is lead deeper into this mystery where a war unlike any he (or we-the reader) has ever seen is inevitable. Donegan (Doherty, Mayer, etc...) is very capable of weaving various plots both in our current time, as well as in the past to produce an exciting read, however once again, the author leaves so many questions at the end of the book that it's very frustrating to not receive any closure.

It also doesn't sport any of the cheesy one liners that Fred Krueger copped off in every one of his movies. Sam Raimi is very flexible. He would go on to make the incredible \\" A Simple Plan \\" not to mention the two hillarious sequels to follow \\" Evil Dead \\". The ending sequence lacks mindless chit-chat and just fills your face with gore and scares. A five all the way!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore... And plenty of it!","review":"Five friends travel to a cabin for their vacation, unknowing the Evil presence that lurks in the woods around them. While on a trip to the cellar, our hero Ash and a companion discover a tape recorder and a book. Playing the tape turned out to be a big mistake, because this same tape contains incantations from the book... The book of the dead! Incantations that were meant to release... The Evil Dead!For gore hounds, this movie is for you! Plenty of gore to be found here. The make-up for the zombies is just excellent! The grainy film quality, as well as the camera movements and camera angles, might be responsible the chilling atmosphere. Not as good as the sequel (Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) in my opinion, but a lot of die-hard horror fans might disagree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great","review":"\\"The Evil Dead\\" is one of my favourite horror movies and certainly one of the most important horror flicks ever made. It's a pity that, in Germany, you only can get the \\"cut\\" version (with less gore than the original, of course). But what the heck, it's still a spine-chilling experience to watch Raimi's masterpiece. The movie itself is far better than most people believe, it does certainly not rely merely on cheap shock effects, but what you can find is also a great deal of references to other movies - especially old Hammer pictures from the 60's (e.g. the sinister surroundings, the fog hovering everywhere). Of course you shouldn't watch it if you already can't sleep after watching \\"Gremlins\\", but if you love real good horror films, you must get yourself into \\"Evil Dead\\". Suspense, fun and gore galore guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest movie I've ever seen! Even now","review":"The first time seeing \\"Evil Dead\\" changed my nightmares forever. No more wimpy \\"chased by a ax-wielding monster\\" dreams for me! Somehow this movie plugged in to far deeper reaching fears. I first saw it at a drive-in with my husband. At one of the freakiest parts (the trapdoor), I remember wondering if there was an echo in the car, since there seemed to be more than one piercing scream being emitted. Imagine my surprise to see my husband, my stoic, never scared of anything, hunting and fishing he-man, motorcycle riding husband, screaming at the top of his lungs like a little girl. Of course, he still denies this ever happened, but the truth is this movie scared him half to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Cult Horror Film!","review":"The first of the Evil Dead Trilogy this cult horror classic is the most fun you'll have watching a horror movie. This Special Edition DVD from Elite is top-notch. Evil Dead has been released on DVD in 800 or so different versions but if you're looking for a great one, look no further.This disc presents the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with an extremely sharp transfer with strong color definition. Audio is presented in a great 5.1 surround mix or 2.0 original mix.The disc includes an impressive list of bonus features including:- commentary from director Sam Raimi & producer Bruce Tappert- commentary from start Bruce Campbell (which, incidentally is one of the best and funniest DVD commentaries you'll ever come across!- alternate takes/outtakes- still gallery- theatrical trailerFor the price, this is a great version of the flick.

I, thinking I've seen all the good ones, go to 5 different video stores and ask the counter clerk what the best horror film in the place was. 4 of the 5 walked past The Exorcist, Friday the 13th, and all the other crazily successful horror films and straight to The Evil Dead. I couldn't believe that 4 of 5 movie clerks picked a movie I had never seen. I obviously rented it and wow!! It has it all...humor, surprises, gore, and cheesy acting. (Cheesy acting is key to a good horror flick) If you haven't seen this one, GET IT!! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEATH!

I heard about it from fans of the other horror films I liked; Night of the living dead, texas chainsaw massacre, etc. They said it was one of the few films which was made up of every element that stuck out in these other pictures and still stood tall to the original source material. In terms of entertainment, the film is a 10+. In terms of filmaking, its a little lower. the film was Raimi's first attempt at a motion picture, and he didn't have a lot to work with. The make up is masterfully implemented by the other worldly camera, a charecter in its own. If you care even slightly about horror, see this and the 2 sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Dead","review":"This is actually one of the only movies to never scare me and keep me awake at night.

If you like camping horror movies, you'd be better off with something like Sleepaway Camp."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Disappointment","review":"After reading the good reviews of this flick I've seen on the internet, I decided to go and rent this one. I don't know what the reviewers were thinking (they must have been on crack) because this movie sucked! The acting was cheap and the demons were not frightening at all! For college-level work this was good, but its got competition out there that it just can't compare to. The romance of the main couple in this film was just not believable to me -- I kept finding myself forgetting they were boyfriend and girlfriend since it just didn't seem to fit. The only fair aspect of this film was the gore (rather low-budget, but still good) at the end of the movie. In conclusion, after watching this video, I wished I had done something else with my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Stinks","review":"This movie stinks the graphics, sounds, and whole just story stinks. If you want a good movie get ARMY OF DARKNESS. It is the sequel of the sequel of this movie. It is very very funny. And it isn't one of those movies you get bored of after you watch it once. You can watch it a hundred times and still laugh your head off. Literally"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumbest movie in the world!","review":"This movie [was] so horribly bad, I don't see how anyone could like this movie, and the second one didn't even relate to the first one. The graphics [were] so bad, it wouldn't even scare a little kid, it would probably make him laugh. My advice don't rent this movie or buy it, but if you like horrible actors and really bad graphics then go for it, but you'll regret watching it, trust me. P.S. don't watch the second one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God This is Just Bad","review":"After the largest mislabeling scandal in video history this movie remains the worst thing to hit Hollywood since the plot for Halloween 3. I deeply feel sorry for the people thinking they were buying Ben Hur (an actually good movie) and due to the scandal ended up with this [junk]. Is it any wonder Bruce Campbell's career has hit virtual rock bottom. Just watch this low budget [stink]fest. A bunch of poorly animated monsters attack some people in a cabin. At first the gore and killing of the monsters is pretty crazy and entertaining but it soons becomes stale and repetitive after 82 minutes of the same wackiness. Calling this a \\"cult classic\\" is unbelievable since there really is nothing classic about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it for the gore, not the acting.","review":"This is a really fun \\"B\\" movie. If you like horror movies featuring gore and dismemberment, then add this to your collection. The special effects are a bit \\"cheesy\\", but it's all in good fun!Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie but NOT! for the squeamish.","review":"The Evil dead is a great movie with plenty of scares and suspence But not for those who get sick easly. The demons seem to have more blood than phisicly possiable! It just keepes on coming out. Also there are sertain scenes that are in bad taste like when a woman gets raped by a tree! or when Ash gets raped by his decapitated girl friend and almost chokes on the blood spirting out of her neck. Otherwise it is a great movie and has some really effective and spooky scenes. If you really want a scare watch this movie alone with all the lights out. Or to laugh, watch with friends(for some reason its funny with company). You will love it if you like movies with bad taste. But if you don't like movies that show people washing their hands in thier own blood and other bodly fluids, stay away from this flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say about the EVIL DEAD?","review":"Wow. This film can beat any other movie to a bloody pulp (except maybe DAWN OF THE DEAD). Sam Raimi's genius is definitly seen in this horror masterpiece! I belive the other two movies, even though they are very good, are highly over rated. They make the original look inferior. This is due in part to NEW LINE CINEMA not giving Sam the rights to the first film to do a recap for the sequel. That made him have to make up a new version, which meant no Cheryl, Scotty, or Shelly. So the Book of the Dead never got burned, Linda never got stabbed and all this other stuff. Army went along with this but it also had a flaw. At the end of ED2, Ash is hailed as a hero, but at the beginning of Army he's a slave! Oh well, I'm off topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My film teacher at MSU grew up w/director!","review":"Not even remotely kidding about that. He was in the Raimi's The Quick & The Dead for all brief moment. All that aside... This movie is practically a gold standard. Even the super-cheese moments, which all c/c horror movies have, are shining examples of how much the imagination can do on a shoe-string budget. I wish they had made more than the three, but then it might have become like that whole Rambo thing, or actually, like the Rocky series, which climaxed at III (MR. T). EVIL DEAD is the movie which all wannabe c/c-type directors, writers, and cinematographers should study. Thank you and goodnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil...Evil...Evil","review":"This movie is superb. The scary atmosphere created here is excellent.

An interesting part of film making history. The Limited Edition pack is where it's at. Offering a little background history in a little text booklet about the Evil Dead Trilogy, great illustrations within the Book of the Dead itself, the texture of the book will send a shiver down your spine and there is a convenient pocket in the back of the book for the Evil Dead movie disc. I recommend this. It arrived within the time promised and it was repackaged in plastic and then in a box (Obviously). I can only complain about the cosmetics of the cover of the book. There were a few cracks or tears in the rubber material encasing the book cover. I would have classified it as \\"Good\\". Not \\"Very Good\\" or \\"Like New\\".

There's something that these movies have that The Evil Dead doesn't. These movies have interesting villains. It doesn't matter how gory they get, you still like the villains. Like Freddy Kreuger, for example. He's the \\"bad guy\\" of the movie, but the movie builds around the characters and keeps you interested in the next gory thing that Freddy will do. The Evil Dead had a thin plot that didn't bother to let you know the characters. There are many good horror movies out there that are very gory and graphic, but the Evil Dead disturbed me. It had no heart, and was a pure bloodbath. The whole point of the movie was killing and dismemberment, the plot is easily forgotten. I hated this movie and I would advise those of you like me who love horror movies, but not bloodbath movies to stay away from The Evil Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talant is not enough","review":"Sam Raimi knows how to make a good movie. If he had wanted to, he could have turned Evil Dead into a great horror movie. The opening scene is promising: a lonely car on a desolate road on its way to a cabin in the woods. Had Raimi only showed the same love towards the genre and the characters as he did in the Spiderman films... But, of course, he didn't. No love, only talant.There is a scene that shows the attitude of the film maker, where one of the character screams: \\"Why are you torturing me like this?\\" Obviously, that's a relavant question in many horror movies. That is if you're watching the movie, not if you're in it. The perspective in this film is rather distanced. Raimi is sitting in his horror movie sofa, laughing at the mysteries of the genre. When you're facing irrational evil, you don't ask \\"why?\\". There is only one thing to do. Just run, man. Just run."},{"rating":"1","title":"A film for sadists","review":"This was the word \\"Psycho\\" author Robert Bloch used for those who would watch this type of film. Having seen people's reaction to this movie, I have to agree.This is a sick film, designed to be such... to gross-out and create fear... not humor. The problem with the movie is that it appears to have been made sadistically. Rather than just show gore, the camera focuses on the violence longer than needed, as if this was pornography---indeed, this appears to be a motion picture for those who wish to be stimulated not by sex, but by suffering.There seems to be two types of reaction to the film--disgust and fear (normal people); humor and pleasure (people with a blood lust).The film received an \\"X\\" rating but withdrew this. Later, in 1994, the MPAA awared it an \\"NC-17\\". It well earns this rating. A film enjoyed by psychopathic minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really bad film...","review":"Let me start with the best warning I can give, if you watch this film, it's time you will never get back !

The movie is comedic to the point, where it makes it stupid. The guy gets covered in blood in one scene, and in that same scene his face is magically clean again.

It does come in a partial plastic case that you can pick up with less danger of having to take a trip to the sink, so it's not untouchable.But really, who wants to have to wash their hands EVERY day?Other than that, everyone should see this movie at least once to prove that Bruce Campell was capable something better than \\"Jack of all trades\\" and to see how much blood really can come out of a demon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun dvd","review":"Now this is what a DVD should be! A very low budget movie that outgrew its budget and expectations.First of all it is a truly scary and at times downright creepy movie. Added to that you have a lot of comedy in the mix. Could you ask for a better combination in a movie? A bit of wooden acting from a small, inexperienced cast is certainly passable and can be easily overlooked because of the very tight direction from new director, Sam Raimi.The over-the-top gore can have two effects on the viewer: absolute turn-off or outright laughter. Raimi mixes the gore so well with the bits of comedy and tension that it is effective in both. A combination that in a movie with any other director might not work.The behind-the-scenes footage on this DVD shows a lot of people having a good time. This translates to the screen. The DVD is not dressed up with repetitive extras, just the bare necessities that illustrate the amount of passion that went into this cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Freakin Fun and Gross, Man!!!","review":"We thought this movie was pretty good for a low-budget horror flick. It's really, REALLY scary! The gore alone will give you nightmares. There a lot of great suspense, too. We've watched this one ten times. The problem is sometimes the suspense is just dumb. Let's say you're a hot young girl who happens not to be wearing pants. You're alone in a spooky cabin and you here a noise. What do you do? You open the door, then walk into the dark forest all by yourself going \\"Is anybody there?\\" for like five miles until you're totally lost and then the evil possessed trees grab you and rape you violently.

I will shred you that the special effects are dated, the acting's not too good, and this movie is very gorey and very violent however that aside you get treated to a unique story with unique characters in a gothic and intriguing atmosphere and you get treated to a story the likes by which have never quite been done before.

It looks more like my VHS copy of this movie, which shows a little better. The picture was a little fuzzy at times and not sharpe at all. The movie is gory and violent. It's not for children at all, so parents beware. I am a horror fan, and this movie is one of my favorites to watch except toward the end after Ash throws the book of the dead into the fireplace. Sorry to expose that information, but what happens next is too gross even for me. I still have to turn my head on most of that scene.

I had never seen the movie with such clarity. I had NO idea that it was so well done. I should have known that it was better than those old copies of copies videotapes made it look! It's Sam Raimi for goodness' sake!But anyway, with the Book of the Dead artwork, the extras, and the article inside, it's a great thing to own and display.

It is SOOOOO worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evil DVD","review":"I have owned the original U.K video version of this classic horror gore flick for years and thought that it was completely uncut...How wrong can I be! This unrated DVD version has loads more blood 'n' guts mayhem and with the added bonus of behind the scenes footage and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack make it a must purchase for any serious horror fan. How Sam Raimi & crew made such a top notch film on such a tight budget is beyond me but I am glad they did! The atmosphere is brilliant, the acting suitable overpowering and the special effects are excellent (not a patch on modern day CGI but as stomach churning as you could ever want).

Even with the extremely low budget this movie was made on, it still doesn't sease to amaze you with is horrorific effects and good acting. Ash who is played by Bruce Campell is the hero of \\"Evil Dead\\", and his acting is so good that you forget how low budget it is. I did however make the mistake of seeing \\"Army of Darkness\\" before I saw this movie. \\"Army of Darkness\\" is by far a better movie than \\"Evil Dead\\", but \\"Evil Dead\\" is still the originator.

I gave it four stars for it's low-budget, incredible special affects, and it's entertainment value. It lacks a full five because it's not exactly perfect, but great because of what they did with what they had."},{"rating":"2","title":"horror classic","review":"I've watched the movies from this trilogy at least over a million times. This is a stand out horror film. Plot(?) is simple 4 college students in an isolated cabin by the woods (how cliche)play a tape recording that invokes an evil spirit and possesses them 1 by 1. Ash who is without a doubt the coolest super hero in the history of horror films is the last one remaining to battle the demon spawn. Cheesy gore effects and plenty of buckets o' blood , bad acting , bad dialouge , and if you saw this movie before all the new rereleases it was a terrible watch due to bad sound and picture (but that really helped out it's horror appeal). Camp classic horror"},{"rating":"2","title":"Join us!","review":"The Evil Dead is a very good movie. It is about 5 friends who decide to take a weekend at a deserted mountain cabin and awake something in the woods. One by one they become possesed by evil in the woods. This film I think tries to be too serious when it doesn't have to be. There is a very interesting rape scene in which a girl gets raped by the woods themselves. Sam Raimi is a genious at stuff like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Dead","review":"As far as teenage horror movies go this is pretty decent stuff. It is easy to see the tongue in cheek humor as well. I can see why it is a cult favorite. Part of a trilogy I think they got better as actor Bruce Campbell and Director Sam Raimi felt comfortable with this theme and took it further and further. By the time they got to \\"Army of Darkness\\" it became mostly comedy with some horror. AOD is my favorite of the three because of the outrageous bits and great special effects. This is a great collection for fans of horror/comedy movies. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Scary Movie\\".CA Luster"},{"rating":"2","title":"Materpiece of \\"Cheesy\\" Horror Flicks!","review":"this movie is amazing!

Go buy this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore at it's finest!","review":"Sam Raimi had a very dark vision. And he made this movie to make it come to life. Bruce Campbell steals the show in what has become known as his finest hour. For a low budget movie the effects aren't all that bad, and the excellent cinematography will blow you away. There is one scene that will absolutely leave your head spinning, the world's only scene in which a person is [hurt] by a tree. That alone sets the tone for the rest of the movie. I seriously recomend this to all gore fans who have yet to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun spoof on gore movies","review":"Do you ever find yourself yelling at the screen, \\"Don't go in there!\\"?

The plot is isn't that hard to understand: four college kids rent a cabin deep in the woods of Tennesse for the weekend. They find an old tape recorder in the cabin's basement and decide to listen to it, not knowing that it contains chanting words that will summon the dead spirits of the underworld to rise up and possess the living. They play the the tape and all hell, literally breaks lose. The only one who remains unpossessed is Ash, and now he must arm himself with shotgun and chainsaw and wage battle against his demon-possessed friends in order to survive the night. This movie is definitley not for those who have weak stomachs because it is graphically violent and very intense. I liked enough, though, to recommend it to horror fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, disapointing transfer","review":"My special edition (the last DVD release) may not be letterbox (which sucks) but it does have a clear, crisp picture. I rented this before buying, man am I glad it saved me the money. The transfer is THX mastered, which means it's been filtered through a computer. Well it didn't work. The film is dark, often blurry and hard on the eyes. Sure there's a couple of nifty documentries on this disk, but the cheesy cover? Really, a collectable? It's lame, seriously. If you want a 16:9 copy, look for the new version without the $20.00 cover.But really, they need to do a restoration on this film and finally, finally give us a last (this is the 13th DVD version)version of this classic.Don't but the lame cover, or the crappy transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a box set!","review":"Thios rating is for the blu-ray DVD only, not the movie. If you decide to buy this, there are some things you should be aware of...This IS NOT the two disc edition. For the new 1 disc blu-ray, all the special features have been removed except a commentary track.This WILL NOT play in all players. When you start the disc, you either have to watch or skip thru 4 trailers. At this point, my LG player goes black. I was only able to get a menu 3 times out of dozens of tries (by fast forwarding thru the last trailers instead of using skip) and then I was not able to make any selections, so I never got to watch the movie. If you decide to buy this, make sure you know what you are getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evil Dead","review":"This movie made Bruce Campbell a star and also made Sam Raimi a star director!A slow start but great use of one location milked beyond belief made the movie enjoyable.Acting was B-grade but will definitely appeal to fans of the genre.Effects were also pretty good for its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad Blu-ray Transfer","review":"This review is for the Blu-ray version. The movie itself is classic horror, however the transfer to Blu-ray is horrible. It is very grainy on both the standard and wide screen versions of the movie. I also have a 1080p Roku box. Streaming the same movie from it looks better than the Blu-ray version playing from my PlayStation 3. I guess this is why they are only charging $10 for the disk. My advise is to wait until someone comes out with a better Blu-ray before purchasing this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy","review":"Before Sam Raimi became a household name for his work on the Spider-man movies, he earned a rep as a master of visceral horror flicks. The Evil Dead is the first of the his deadite trilogy and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash, an everyman thrown into a decidedly unusual situation. The plot is simple, but perfectly functional. What drives this film is Raimi's keen understanding of the audience. The camera and pacing is tight, allowing little room for the audience to catch a breath. This results in a rush which only the very best of horror movies can produce. Although the effects have aged, there is no denying that The Evil Dead was an early sign of the young Raimi's gift behind the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new info here","review":"Dr Ward divided different ages into separate chapters and gives developmental characteristics for each age.

I have never heard a faster or cleaner guitar picker than Kilby. But, that's now. He was only a teenager when Just Me was recorded. It's a remarkable effort if only for the fact that he plays all the instruments here, but he had not yet achieved the brilliance that he now displays and the music here is not an indication of the level that he would later reach.

Enjoy! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep on this one.","review":"I was recommended this movie by a friend of mine. My friend and I share a good deal of favorites when it comes to movies, but this is not one of them.The premise of the movie, the life of a man who cannot tell dream from reality, was different and held a great deal of potential. I will not go too deep into story details since I am not sure where I would begin spoiling some of the (rather thin) plot. However, the movie's potential is wasted on a cast of shallow characters and a storyline that not only goes nowhere, it manages to make you feel less for the characters as the movie goes along. I came to dislike the \\"protagonist\\" of the story the most as the story spiraled into pointless weirdness and crudeness.Since this movie won some awards at film festivals I just may not \\"get\\" this movie. If this movie requires some kind of acquired taste I would not go through the agony of having to endure till I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This might sound biased coming from a Gondry fan, but...","review":"I think the reason why some people gave this low ratings at IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes is that they can't whether the movie is in the dream-state of the protagonist's mind or in reality although I was able to tell a few scenes where it was in real life. Sometimes that's the way it is though. Sometimes there's moments in your life where it just seems surreal. And I think that's one thing that this movie was trying to point out. As usual, Gondry's wonderful visual effects were used in this movie and I think the cast generally meshed together in the movie. There are some scenes I want to mention, but I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"PSR_ Parallel Sychronized Randomness!!!!!","review":"Thank the heavens for a film like this. You cant be a snob when it comes to your own imagination with this film. The acting is touching, and realistic to the point it can be in a movie like this.

There is absolutely no plot, the characters are unlikable and hard to care about (with the exception of Stephane's co-worker Guy), and the effects are cute but really nothing magical. It seems like it wants to be a hip, sexy, trendy movie with something profound to say about being young, artistic and in love, but there is really nothing that it says at all. I only watched it completely out of sheer stubbornness, but there are much better ways to spend 106 minutes of your life. The same guy wrote Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: that was a vastly better movie than this one. In comparison, this is more quirky, but with less heart.

The characters are much more dimensional than in mainstream studio flicks: underdogs, oddballs, pyschopaths, ordinary folks and everyone in between - just like real people you might already know. The performances hit all the right notes. From opening sequence to the perfect ending, the pride in craftmanship is impressive. Kudos to everyone involved in making this masterpiece. (By the way, I also highly recommend the soundtrack for this film. Though it's quite delightful, you'll have to go elsewhere for two tracks which featured prominently in trailers: \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room\\" by Death Cab for Cutie and \\"Fear of Sleep\\" by the Strokes.

They probably tried to do a little too much as it ended up as a survival tale and very little of that. Some of this was shot in what I am presuming, was a nudistresort, and some attention was given to showing scenes of various activities, such as kids on a slide and such. All in all, it was an ok film that would be better suited for rental rather than purchase. As for unsatisfied, it left me unsatisfied although the transfer was better.

Amazon has provided a free shipping label and will refund the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected","review":"I didn't have anything break, unlike some people. There are supports under the side platforms that helped hold the burgers, beers, and stuff like that. I had no issues, but I can see if something up there breaks it won't close. The strap is connected to the end platforms.It cooked extremely well. It got hotter than my round George Foreman outdoor grill, and can hold more food. It was great, and much less expensive than some other brands.

Such a bummer! I ordered them for Halloween and I was just planning on wearing them for the night, but for that price I was annoyed all the whole thing and just sent them back.

We timed intercourse according to the instructions, even confirming the accuracy by using an ovulation predictor kit. I am absolutely certain the timing was accurate. We were disappointed to learn we are expecting another girl.This child will be as loved and cherished as the others and our family is complete but my advice is unless you are absolutely certain you will be satisfied with the sex of your baby, do not attempt ANY sex selection method.

My husband and I really wanted a son, I have never wanted more than one child and have never had any interest in having a daughter, so we tried this method and practiced every suggestion in here by the book. I was skeptical with good reason. About 3 weeks ago they deterimined that we are having a girl and I have been having a really difficult time with it.

There are so many other books on there - don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not to mention the regret and remorse of addictive reading","review":"this was one of the most infuriating reads I can ever remember encountering. Yes, you can't put it down because the premise is so delightful, but in plain words the book is an impossible mess. The book is written in short stops and starts which begin to make you feel your on the LA freeway during rush hour. The end is such a nauseating mess I know for sure that in this rare instance I will not go see the film of a book I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good. But it's not.","review":"The characters are boring and annoying, the plotline tepid, and the emotional resonance nil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smashing read.","review":"Crackling with tension, THIS BODY will keep you up way past your bedtime. The well-paced and original story line about reincarnaiton, temptation, and family should be enough to keep even the casual reader interested. But what makes the book so thoroughly good is that there is also a healthy amount of character analysis. Deep introspection and clever plot twists make THIS BODY satisfying in more than one respect. By \\"picking the brains\\" of each of the characters, it is impossible not to learn about yourself in the process: \\"What would I do if I were in this situation? What would be the RIGHT thing to do?...\\" Doud's crisp writing style makes the entire work glow with honesty, insight, and (at times) humor. As an added bonus for the Shakespeare fan, frequent references to \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" add even more interest to this already intriguing book without slowing down the story or sounding obtrusive. THIS BODY provides a refreshing mix of intelligence and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban fantasy, class differences, and issues of body and mind viewed through realistic pragmatism ...","review":"What if the mind of a older mother of two woke up in the body of a drug addict with her life in pieces? What pragmatic steps would one take to get their life put piece by piece back together?This book answers that question, but in the process poses some truly interesting questions about addictions and tendencies, and how our minds and bodies not only INTERACT with each other, but color and influence each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly unique!","review":"This novel was refreshingly interesting and certainly worth the read. I could relate very easily to the subject matter and I found its entirety very well written. This being the authors first novel I hold high hopes for her next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"The first problem with this book, is that the pages measure 6.5 by 8.5. making it feel like a small telephone directory. The photographs show portions of rooms that are simply too miniscule to appreciate; the context in which they are situated is not displayed. I found myself frowning a lot and feeling somewhat baffled.Also, I question the relevence of including close-ups of flowers, or fruit, or a long blank wall with a tiny window at the end of it. It's very irritating. Also, most of these homes are apartments which feature ultra-contemporary furnishings - cupboards with no knobs, couches that look like surf boards, etc. Only a few of the homes could be described as cozy and inviting and they were the best pictures, in my opinion.Ultimately, the smallness of the pictures ruined it for me - I hate having to squint at a photo. A better book is the New Decorating Book (2002, I believe) by Better Homes & Gardens. A true feast for the eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photos, not very helpful","review":"Although it gives some style suggestions it is almost useless if you have less than 500 square feet (whichs studios in NYC generally are smaller than). If you are looking for some helpful ways to reconsider your small space, I'd recommend \\"Apartment Therapy.\\" If you want some nice photos, then try this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disapointment","review":"Save your money. That is, of course, unless you need to see the inside of a college dorm room, an unlikely high-trapeze bed contraption, and other decor from the Far Side.This book was a real disapointment. I was looking for common-sense solutions to the challenge of making a small space workable. I purchased the book based on the raves from other readers. This is one book I recommend--if you choose to read it at all--you read at the public library rather than own. (Sorry Amazon, two thumbs down on this one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of inspiration","review":"Love the way the book shows apartments of varying small sizes and multiple solutions for small-space dilemmas (like little room for sleeping, tiny kitchens). I was able to brainstorm a solution for my own apartment after one look through this book.My only complaint is that there are no product resources listed--just designers' names and contact information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely photographed and interesting","review":"As a studio apartment dweller, I'm drawn to books on living well in small spaces. I've found that many are aimed at those who own their own space and have unlimited budgets. While some of the apartments featured in this book clearly fall into that category, others are a bit more realistic, focusing on the renter who doesn't have the ability to knock out walls and raise ceilings. More of a 'this is what this person's apartment looks like' than a how-to or suggestion guide, I still picked up some good tips that will translate to my apartment. Many of the apartments featured do seem to lean more toward the modern look; FYI if you know that's not your thing.I gave the book five stars because I think it does very well what the title suggests: it offers good photographs of different living spaces sized 100 sq feet to 1000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Small Space Decorating","review":"This is far and away the best decorating book for small spaces I've read. It's 400 pages, with 400 photographs, and it explores 33 small homes from 100 to 1,000 square feet. My favorite aspect of this book is that the spaces presented are in the United States. I have found that most small spaces shown in specialty books are from Europe or Asia and so lots of the ideas don't translate too easily. The apartments/homes are presented in order of size. Each home contains a very readable description pointing out a wide variety of design ideas, decorating techniques and how each tenant achieved what he/she wanted in a home despite it's limitations. I'm so pleased I bought this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flip Through at the Bookstore but Don't Buy","review":"I didn't find the contents of this book inspiring enough to justify the $23.10 price tag. To its credit, the photographs are well-done, and you will start to think differently about making small spaces work. But I personally didn't walk away with any ideas for my small space, and I found the decorative styles of the apartment-dwellers interesting but not suitable for my lifestyle. A lot of the apartments featured are 2nd homes for people, so their apartments serve more as places to sleep rather than a dire need to live in <500 sq. feet. There's very little to no \\"how to\\" in this book, from furniture arranging tips to how to save space to how to make your life fit into 1 or 2 closets."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"This book is my absolute favorite. Real people with real space concerns (i.e., 300 sqft for two adults and a baby), limited by realistic budgets, and who have learned to love who they are and incorporate their quirks into their space. Not a coffee table, idealistic lifestyle book advocating that we should throw out all of our knickknack collections and live ascetically. Beautifully, lovingly documented and photographed. Afterwards makes you feel rich for having so much space (compared to the New Yorkers) and hopeful about what you can do with the space you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another coffee table book","review":"Don't buy this book if you want hints and tips to making your small space bigger. Do buy this book if you want to flip through it once and then leave it on the coffee table for visitors to look at. The book is beautiful to look at but for the price tag I would have preferred an art book. There is a lack of people who don't work in design fields that are featured in this book, giving the book a feel of \\"look at what others can do, but don't think you can\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"#2 of 7 \\"small decor\\" books","review":"I rated this second best of the 7 \\"small space\\" decorating books Ibought. The author says the average American apt. is less than 800 sq ft.,the average NY city one is less than 400. Most featured here are in NY, but there's a healthy mix of other US cities. Pros: Gives square footage, helpful photos, units more like what Americans live in then in many other decor books; with 398 pages, it's hard not to find ideas you can use."},{"rating":"1","title":"My bad?","review":"Perhaps it's my misunderstanding of the purpose of this book. or the implication of the title. In sum, it's stuffed with pretty pictures of overdecorated spaces - and nothing, & I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G remotely useful for utilizing small spaces.I thought I was purchasing a book on interior design, instead, it's strictly interior decoration - & more often than not - embarrassingly self-conscience decoration at that. A complete & utter waste of money for anyone researching small space design solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"no bathrooms!","review":"I don't know why this book indicates that bathrooms are included inside? There are like two pictures of bathrooms and they are both at poor angles. Do people not use the loo in small spaces? i guess i'll go bathe in the ocean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please be aware","review":"I realize that alot of people gave good reviews for this book.But please be aware, that this book is for people who havea zero budget for decorating. This book is not for peoplewho want beautiful design. It's for very simple people whocannot afford a large home or high quality furnishings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty and Informative, But Not a How-To","review":"This book has lovely pictures and good information; but the problem I found with it is that it is not the how-to for living in small spaces that I was looking for.Several of the homes are more art project than living space. I agree with a previous reviewer who noted that few of houses seemed inviting, comfortable, or very functionable for every-day life.If you are a student, as I am, looking for a practicle guide to living in a small area, such as a dorm or first apartment, this book is of little use. If you have the time, money, ambition, and know-how to redesign your small living-space, this book may offer some good ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"This is a nice book and gives you some ideas on how to save space. Unfortunately almost all of the occupants in this book are architects or are friends with an architect. I can't afford to have an architect help me with my apartment space so it doesn't really apply. I still like the book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing . . .","review":"Although the photos are lovely and utilize small space very well, I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for more than photos -- one quick look and and I passed it on to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Talented","review":"As the Mom of the fantastically talented, pre-Eryykah Badu, Neo-Soul Sister, Adriana Evans, Mary Stallings reigns a champ. Between the two, talent is in the DNA. And, Manhattan Moods is a testament to Mom's talent and the gift she passes down to her daughter. She blows a set of strong pipes; her voice, still quite clear. There is no need to resort to stunts. While I am a fan of Stallings' debut music--despite what people say about her rawness, I like it; find it to be her authenticity, proving her ability to break through a longstanding tradition--I enjoy her maturity on Manhattan Moods. Queen Stallings' covers of these jazz standards display a commitment to convention. Yet, her style and vocal skills make her renditions creatively savvy. Track 4 How High the Moon is simply lovely, peaceful and romantic. Stallings is a foremother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable for my 19 mo old son","review":"We got Little Touch Leappad for DS's first birthday and he is now 19 mos old. His favorite book is \\"If I were..\\" because he likes the pictures of the animals and the animal sounds.HOWEVER, he doesn't like \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" at all because it doesn't hold his attention. I think it was a waste of money.Basically \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" is the same as the regular story book of the same name. Leapfrog added sounds, of course, but the don't fit in well with the pictures. The focus is on instruments and the sounds they make.If you have a small six month old baby, then this is the book you should buy because it the gentlest of the Leappad books. However, for a toddler, it is just too dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"My daughter loves her other Leap Pad stories and activity books, but she was bored with this one. As she got older, I hoped she would grow into it. She is now almost three, and it still doesn't interest her. Plus, it is really no different than the regular book. (She would rather have me read the real book than listen to it on the Leap Pad.) Save your money- buy the book, don't buy the Leap Pad version."},{"rating":"1","title":"No interest","review":"This is not an interesting Leap Pad book for my 16 month old. He has an interest in instruments, but not in this book. Even my attempts to use it before bed to calm/soothe him have failed. Better off with others books in the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"LittleTouch LeapPad book is a hit with 2 year old","review":"The LeapFrog LittleTouch LeapPad book \\"Guess How Much I love You\\" is being enjoyed right now by my two year old son. As with other LittleTouch books, there is the narrated story and there are also games and music, colors and various sounds included in the fun as well. I don't think you can go wrong with this one, though I did read negative reviews before making this purchase, but I took a chance anyway and was lucky. My son is very entertained by \\"Guess how much I love you\\", not bored in the least, and he likes to dance around to the background music. Too cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pricey but worth it","review":"This was a little pricey but much cheaper than some of the other vendors. The book is exactly as I expected: sweet, cute and with an English narrator. It has the characteristic muted iilustrations so not the attention grabber of some of the other volumes, but it is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. My 19 month old daughter walked away after one minute. She liked the book that came with the Little Touch Leap Pad better. I worked with it for a little while to see if there would be anything interesting but it was just plain boring. This was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the price","review":"I bought this item for my best friend's 1 year old. Good pictures and good sound, but I would say that this particular book is for maybe 2-3 year old. At his age, he isn't all that interested in what the story is, just what sounds it makes. The sounds aren't as interesting as in the Winnie the Pooh book, or the Animal World book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed.Not advertised correctly.per recipient .","review":"I bought this for my grand daughter but apparently she can't use it because it needs something else to use it?My daughter in law informs me it needs the \\"Leap Pad\\" to play it in?There is nothing that tells you that it needs something to use it.So I have sent my grandchild something that she cannot use.Why don't you let customers know they need to purchase something else that this is an accessory item.No where does it tell you this!I am very dissapointed and will think twice before ordering from you again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns Out Too Quickly","review":"My original lamps on my Miata lasted 4 years.

While I did like the High Beam performance over the stock, low beam performance was mediocre at best, and the lifetime was abysmal. When the first set went after only 3 months, I thought perhaps it was a recent cold snap that might have had an effect. But both bulbs burned out within a week of each other.I got a second set, thinking perhaps it was just bad luck/unfortunate weather, but that set also had one bulb burn out within 3 months, so I just went and got a standard bulb set, from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time and money.

I'm just waiting for other one to blow any moment. The bulb's coiled filament didn't even show sign of use. The filament split cleanly in the center of the coil and left with half the coil intact. The bulb glass has no discoloration at all. Other than it's bad life expectancy(supposedly between 6 to 12 months}, these bulbs have vibration issues. My OEM bulb lasted 4 years exactly.

I've read most of the introductory books on fixed income, and none explain the market as clearly and intuitively as Tuckman. Anyone who is joining a fixed income desk or who seeks to learn more about this area should pick up this book before any others. The repo markets, interest rate and asset swaps, forwards, and futures are all covered in excellent detail. There are few discussions of duration and convexity that rival this one. Overall, this book scores high in all major areas and is highly recommended by all those I know who have come across it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just want to mention a mistake of the book","review":"On page 116, formula 6.1, the price formula for a bond is actually for a semiannual coupon bond, not as stated on the book, for annual coupon bond.As a consequence, the dv01, duration and convexity formula it states are for semiannual coupon bonds as well.I think both Tuckman and Fabozzi's books have their own pros and cons.

It's not a cohesive story either...but worse, I couldn't even find a single page that I thought my son would like (after he walked away uninterested).Setting 2 was especially boring, mostly naming objects & animals saying short phrases; setting 3 had a little more personality and maybe some really short songs. I suppose it could be educational for an older child, but I'm not keeping it to see.A fun book that I enjoy a lot w/ my young toddler is \\"Rainbow Fish 1,2,3\\".

The title of this book is EXTREMELY offensive to myself and anyone else who has tattoos, piercings, brands or decorative scars despite her attempt to defend her choice of words in the introduction.

I generally prefer to listen to large ensemble jazz, but when I bought this CD, I couldn't turn it off! I first heard Christian when he was on Maynard's band and I was absolutely taken back by his virtuousity. Here is one of the nouveau musicians on the scene today that everyone should keep an ear open for. Besides his great techinique on the ivories, his writing and arranging skills are beyond words! Just listen to his absrtact variation on IVE GOT RHYTHM (a featured tune on the album). Its perfect for today's jazz listeners. The balad, HERE'S THAT RAINY DAY is beautifuly done as well.

Instead they have \\"hippie\\" looking people with huge crotch bushes dancing around the fire someplace in the (Spanish) desert! Nothing remotely erotic or exceptionally worth watching. The sex scenes are really lame as you never see any body parts of the men, and rarely is there anyone doing anything remotely daring or exciting. There are some nude women dancing around in various sequences, but when the big moment comes to brutally \\"whip\\" the star, its a phony whipping sequence and they show nothing!

The solutions or recipes, as the author calls them, are well written. He explains, for example, what each SQL Server function will do and how and why it works. The author also goes into detail on Indexing, Triggers, and Stored Procedures, and frankly after reading this book, it has improved my usage of them.

I absolutely adore it -- I pick it up whenever I'm stressed or in a bad mood and it never fails to make me feel better. Ms. Lipman is a marvelous writer, and comparisons to Jane Austen are certainly well-founded. It was solid throughout with excellent characters and a great plot. There truly is nothing better than a revenge comedy. This is an excellent book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot line is way too crammed in","review":"I thought the book had a good start, but it quickly drops off.

I read this book in a day as it is that easy, that \\"fun\\" and so easy to get into. The characters are well developed, the story line is a good one and the book instantly caught me by surprise. I had never read anything by this author but will do so now as I love her style. I found myself laughing out loud on occasion as I read this fine book and am sure you will, too. Read it, you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Draws you in and keeps you there!","review":"This is my first Elinor Lipman book and I am sure it will not be the last. THE INN AT LAKE DEVINE is funny, touching and all in all perfect. The book explores anti-semitism and racism in a quirky way. Lipman does not lecture, does not get on a soap box or make a sermon. She presents the facts and lets her characters deal with them. The protagonist, Natalie Marx, is flawed, real and lovable, as are all the other characters that move this delicious story about conquering racism to a predictable but comfortable end. Besides the morality of the story, there is the perfect writing, funny, real and always snappy, that makes this book a great read. The story and the characters will stay with you for a long time and you will rush to buy another book by Lipman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewish girl pines to be Gentile says it all","review":"I agree with other lipman fans that this one was all downhill after girl grows up. Like others, I found the \\"let's marry Christians\\" Jewish theme shallow and offensive. As if marrying blue eyes and a down vest is an answer to antisemitism. Characters shallow and plot predictable and cliched. Her style still carries you through, but it left me with a sour taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book!","review":"I loved this book. It's the story of a Jewish girl who goes with her old friend, Robin, to a cabin that doesn't like Jewish people for her wedding. Something unexpected happens and it's the story the girl and an unexpected friend...there are a million twists and turns and I absolutely loved it! E. Lipman is a wonderful writer who knows how to write a wonderful book. She makes you feel like you're in love with the leading man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewish girl pines to be a Gentile.","review":"Lipman is no Jane Austen. Austen is generous with all her characters and provides her readers with a glimpse into the human soul that is rarely equaled. On the surface this novel is sweet and gentle. On closer inspection, it is, in fact, infused with a polite but pronounced anti-Semitism, that the story ostensibly abhors. The only three characters in the book who are Jewish and observant are seen as boors and liars. For Ms. Lipman, heaven and plot resolution is the marriage of two Jewish girls to Gentile men, who are, by the way, characterized merely by their blue eyes and down vests. This is a shallow novel and at its core, deeply offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and offensive","review":"I loved how this book began--the concept of getting even for the smarmy and self-righteous anti-Semitism that has lasted much too long in the world really grabbed me. However, as the book progressed and I saw what the inevitable outcome would be, I was disgusted at the trivialization of the dilemma of modern Jews--that is, to live in the world but to be true to their religion, they must marry another Jew. Natalie's family is not observant, is only culturally Jewish, yet they are horrified at the idea of their daughter marrying out of the faith. This is upsetting enough, because if the parents don't instill knowledge and love of Judaism, they can't expect their children to value it enough to marry within the faith. That said, the treatment of the romance smacks of forbidden fruit, and it is just like most TV shows which portray intermarried couples in a shallow and comedically cynical manner.I was offended and disappointed by this book and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Elinor Lipman, but certainly not my last!","review":"I stumbled upon this gem of a novel one day and decided to pick it up. It then sat on my bookshelf for over a year in the pile of \\"books i must read\\". I finally picked it up a few days ago and I really wished I had done so much sooner. I didn't have any idea of what to expect but I was immediately drawn into this story of a young girl who is taken aback by the anti-Semitism of an inn she and her family wish to stay at one summer. The impact this has on her life is far reaching and the journey she takes is one I relished to take with her. I enjoyed all of the different characters and their relationships and was thoroughly surprised at some of the twists in this delightful novel. Looking for a good beach read that's fast paced but not too fluffy? Then this book's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little light read","review":"This book was \\"Highly Recommended\\" in last Sunday's San Francisco Chronicle, and the story sounded just up my alley, so I was very excited to read it. I read the book in just over two days--a very easy read, and I found that while I enjoyed the story, there was little depth to any of the characters, and everything was very, very predictable. The most poignant moment was in the acknowledgements at the back of the book where the author thanked her mother for remembering a letter that she had received long ago. The book had the potential to be quite wonderful--it's an interesting subject and was set in an interesting time. It just didn't do too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"strong start; very disappointing fininsh","review":"I purchased this book on the strength of the first chapter, excerpted here at amazon.com. That chapter, and the succeeding 50 pages or so, were funny--a great read. Ms. Lipman's portrayal of the protagonist as a young girl infuriated by the \\"genteel\\" anti-semitism of a Vermont innkeeper really resonated with me, a transplanted Mainer who happens to be Jewish. But following a significant plot twist (which I'll not reveal here), the book goes decidedly downhill. The story becomes very formulaic, the characters introduced beyond that point are predictable and unidimensional, as is the rest of the story. It was as if Ms. Lipman lost interest in writing this book and was doing as little as she could to please a demanding publisher. If she could have sustained the energy of the first chapters, this would have been a great summer read. As it is, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lipman's best","review":"I'll reread any of Lipman's books multiple times - except this one. Boring and disappointing finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"Elinor Lipman is a full-hearted writer with a magic pen. I always look forward to a new book by her, knowing that I'll laugh hard and learn a thing or two about the human spirit. Every single one of her books is a gem, and this one, perhaps because of the Lipmanesque (read: cockeyed) view of bigotry, shines brightest of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced and upredictable","review":"Lipman's humor is great! Her tale takes you on an unpredictable, yet plausible, path. I have moved Lipman's other titles to the top of my 'must read' list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny--Heartbreaking--Until the end","review":"This book was great...It was a quick read and had many funny points...However, towards the end, it takes a turn towards the fanciful (sp?)...For those of you how have read it, remember the mushroom fiasco?

Despite this one minor flaw, I found the book to be an enjoyable read...Pick it up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point....?","review":"What an utter disappointment. After an interesting beginning, I have to admit that I struggled to read the end of this book because I kept looking for that something that was promised. In the words of my daughter, yucky. The characters became flat and unbelievable. Ms. Lipman had the beginnings of some very interesting characters yet chose to develop none of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elinor Lipman's done it again","review":"I'm an Elinor Lipman fan but was disappointed by \\"Isabel's Bed,\\" and didn't find the summary of \\"The Inn at Lake Devine\\" all that compelling. But I ended up reading this little trifle of a book in one sitting--laughing out loud on occasion. It's a great light read with some interesting points about society and prejudice, and a cute little love story you root for besides. My reservations are that the adult Robin isn't more developed, and the anti-Semitic innkeeper's views aren't explained in more depth. But maybe the latter is the point--many of these attitudes develop without people realizing them or recognizing that they're wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Paced and Funny","review":"No question but that Ms. Lipman is one of modern fiction's better writers, even if she is not yet a household name in every American home--as she deserves to be. THE INN AT LAKE DEVINE is one of her most enjoyable works, in part because it is lively and quick-moving. For a story with so many morals and so much character development, it is easy to read and usually funny. This novel comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendidly Turns Nastiness into Sparkling Social Comedy","review":"What I really admire about this delightful book is the way the author starts with a most unpleasant incident - a letter in 1962 excluding a family from an inn in Vermont just because they are Jewish - and turns it into a wonderful social comedy of just revenge and just desserts, without ever being \\"preachy\\" about it. Th touch may be light but the voice is assured and serious. This book made me want to read more by Ms. Lipman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to offer","review":"This was a difficult book to finish. I found the syle childish, and the characters to be exteremly one dimensional. I must admit that the author was able to pull me in for the first chapter (which may be due to the fact that it was autobiographical to some extent), but the book dragged on after that. At the end, I didnt care about any of the characters, and was suprised I made it through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm.... Summer Reading, If The Beach Is Closed...","review":"The protagonist is rather obnoxious, though given, her crusade is a righteous one. To fight anti-semitism is a noble thing; to set out to destroy the anti-semite, perhaps, is not. I was left wondering whether true love had conquered all, or true revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and cowardice","review":"The author would have us believe her book is an investigation into the important issues of anti-semitism and intermarriage. However, we get no insights into either subject. The anti-semetic feelings of the owner of the Inn are never explored. Three Jewish girls marry outside of their religion and we are never given any clue about the reasons for their choices, other than the fact they are controlled by their raging hormones.To tell us that anti-semitism exists and inter-marriages occur and give no insight into either is, in my view, an act of intellectual cowardice. Lipman's flightly treatment of such serious issues is not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"good beginning, then downhill into cliche and stupidity","review":"I'm a big Lippman fan. The fun breezy style is here, but after a good beginning the characters, plot and theme were all boring, stupid cliches. Also incredibly insensitive to issues of jewish identity.

The real annoyance with this book, apart from having paid for it, is that the main thesis is detailed in the first 29 pages and the next 200 pages give you more detail than you would ever wish on early chemistry and ptolemic astronomy.

When Brown writes of cows \\"knee deep in May with grassy June before them,\\" or of a lake near her childhood home being \\"three hearts of water,/a stem of land afloat/in the tweed of fields,\\" we know we are in the presence of a poet who can refresh our perception of the world. \\"Mending the Skies\\" takes us through Brown's life story, from childhood by Galway Bay, to nurse's training in England, to marriage and emigration to the U.S., where she now lives by another famous bay--Cape Cod. Her poems mingle an exquisite poetic sensibility with tough common sense and a sometimes bawdy sense of humor.

Their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is. When they do focus on the best work of the design community, their examples are puzzling. They choose work that is often genuinely awful, and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows (ComArts, ADC, Graphis, AIGA, One Club). While that would be admirable had they found other good work, most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best.

Andrew Harvey's JOURNEY TO LADAKH, and Robert Byron's THE STATION are 2 of the most noteworthy. Alas Mathew Spencer's stay at the Holy Mountain has not produced such a book. Firstly, as it is written based on a 1993 visit, it is out of date. Much of the monasteries have undergone changes, both visually and internally due to EU funding. And he doesn't convey the spiritual practice that you would think necessary to achieve some form of enlightenment. As an outsider to Orthodoxy, he never gets into the skin of its theatrics. However he does ground his writing in historical context, and provide a knowledgeable background to monasticism. A shame then that it doesn't transcend the already known."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice music for long drives","review":"husky voice, good melody and thought provoking words, this album is worth the investment of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yet","review":"beth gets better with each cd. i am moved when i listen to her music. many times to tears. over and over. she relates the challenges of her life with a rawness that is rarely equaled. the sophistication of her music matches the insight of her lyrics. buy it and wear out your cd player listening to it. beth is exploding on the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Additional Info from first review.","review":"Hi.

The audio tape is not an abridgement of the book. The audio tape is a collection of radio appearances by the authors. If you read the box, you'd see that. But the description on-line does not make that clear. I think giving the radio show transcripts the same title as the book is deceptive. The presentation is rambling because they just respond to caller questions. They emphasize the relation between depression and a chemical called ceratonen (seratonen?). This tape is not worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thoughtful yet lacking self help book","review":"Time and time again authors attempt to lead readers to health and hapiness through proselytization.

It is full of GREAT stories written by girls and women ages 9-98. (There's even a great chapter with some amazing stories written by fathers!) My favorite chapter in the book is the one about peers and friends. When the authors were collecting writings, I submitted a story that eventually made it into the book.

I VERY stronly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book bursting with dignity and love.","review":"Reading this book as a grown woman is like sitting in the living room at last, having all those desprately needed conversations you never got to have as a girl. The stories and vinettes within this collection go straight to the heart of what it means to be female. There is no blushing within this collection, but rather stories written by both women and girls are shared boldly and courageously. The entire book is a gracious reminder of the transforming, even redemtive power of adolescence. What a joyful thing it will be for girls and women everywhere to celebrate together the power of passion, beauty and desire as they puruse the pages of a book about themselves...bursting with dignity and love...Girls to Women, Women to Girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sign","review":"It's a bad sign when the publisher of a book on language doesn't seem to know the difference between \\"it's\\" and \\"its.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Kids and parents can enjoy it too!","review":"As a parent, I found this book to be a real treasure.

Maybe if you were using a very thin china cup, or a metal mug, but the heat just isn't strong enough to get through the traditional ceramic, and I've tried several different cups.It does work right away, when plugged in, there were no problems there, so at least it wasn't broken.

USB ports were not designed to provide much power. That's why USB devices that need power (external drives, colorimeters, etc.) tell you to only plug them directly into a port on your PC, not through a hub or other extension. So, sucking up this limited power with a mug heater is likely not in your best interests, especially if you are running on battery power. Add that converting electricity back into heat is both inefficient and non-Green. I'm surprised this product hasn't been banned and the designer sent to their room without their hot cocoa :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree, agree, agree","review":"I can only agree with every other review out there. In fact, if I could give it less than 1 star, I would. Not big enough for my mug and doesn't get hot enough to do anything with. The USB ports work, so I guess that is a plus.

You have to wonder if this is a plot to get Americans to overfill their landfills.Here's what WILL work:a) a flat-bottomed, small diameter metal mug. Try a camping store and you are all set.b) If you know someone with metal machining tools, you could drop in a 4 inch metal disk (tapered to fit the 3.5\\" hole). Unlikely for most people but someone promised they'd make a disc for me.Teacups have narrow bases and might work, but I do not own any.

This particular set is notable for a minimum of dialogue and production flubs, allowing you to just sit back and enjoy- with hardly any chuckle-inducing distractions- the gothic, creepy proceedings. And creepy they are, as these 40 episodes, all set in 1795, show Barnabas Collins' tragically accepting his new fate as one of the undead. All kinds of other interesting things happen, too, both in the supernatural and non-supernatural realms. Interestingly, some of the non-supernatural stuff is just as scary as the supernatural happenings... witness the final fate of Reverend Trask, for example. Anyway, if you enjoyed the previous sets of this series, there's no reason to hesitate in getting this set. Myself, I've already moved onward to the seventh collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John and wife play songs for angels","review":"According to the liner notes, John Patitucci and his wife tried to have a number of babies and his wife miscarried.

The jazz combo includes a cello as the lead in most songs. Very special, very unusual. Contemplative. Meditative. \\"Angel\\" contains strong new age/lite jazz influences without ever becoming sappy or drivel like most lite jazz. Also strong classical influence.One of the best jazz albums of 1998.All cuts exceptional except for the noisy, out-of-place, first cut \\"Quasimodo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE WAY YOU DO IT!

She misses her dad when he is away at sea. Her dad has some special rituals they share before he goes. He tells his daughter to write him a letter and stick it in the mailbox and to put the flag up. He says that when she looks at the flag and it's down he will be thinking of her. He also tells her to look and the clouds and think of him thinking of her under the same white sky. Then he tells her to look at the ocean and remember that he's not far way, just right across the blue ocean. She remembers Red flag, white clouds, and blue ocean while her dad is gone. This helps her to connect to him even when he's far way.What did you like or not like about the book?Lots of kids have parents who are way in the service of some type.

She does, however, go hide in the shed behind the lawn mower and bikes. She also tries to hide in his sea bag, and she hides his boots. Her father, lovingly, spends the time needed to reassure her, and to help her see little, everyday things that will remind her of him. The story line by Sarah Wones Tomp is very sweet, and the illustrations by Ann Barrow are beautiful, and it realistically depicts a difficult time for a family. I think this would be a good book for anyone who is having a separation from a parent, especially good for those children who will have to live with a long military absence of a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red, White, and Blue Good-bye","review":"This book covers the topic of preparing a child for a parent's deployment in the armed services to action abroad.

I felt as though I was reading the Bhavagad Gita for the first time! I became Arjuna and Lord Krishna was right in front of me teaching me and revealing Himself to me. There are no words adequate to this experience. I thank Swami Satyananda Saraswati and I bow down to him and Shree Maa for opening the doorway to this profound work, for bringing me into the presence of Lord Krishna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone can relate whether it is yourself or your mother","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I read it in one week and it was an easy read. I enjoyed learning that mostly every women goes through a money stuggle no matter what age in life. I really enjoyed knowing that my mother wasn't the only one going through my dad's wallet while he was asleep. I only wish there were excerpts of women who have took control of their finances in relation to their love life and are successful.

The useful part of the book are some of the anecdotes and stories. However, much of the book I found to be disorganized and disjointed. Also, while a woman myself, I didn't quite see the point (marketing?) why to constrain the book to women. After all, many of us have mates and relatives and friends and money conflicts and issues with those folks. The author lacks authority and credentials in the finance realm. I have to question some of the premises of the book as well. The biggest is that women don't take an interest in investing. That certainly isn't the experience of myself and many, many women that I know!I bought and read a copy of Mind Over Money by Eric Tyson and greatly preferred that book over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I couldn't get through this book.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth Borrowing From the Library","review":"Thankfully I got this book in the Bargain Books but even the amount I paid seems too much. This book wasn't really a memoir nor would I call it a self-help book b/c it wasn't really offering any advice. It had a lot of interesting tidbits of information, a few comments about the authors life and that was it. There's no point of this book.

The food comes out with unprocessed chunks and uneven consistency. When it comes to baby food, it's an accident waiting to happen, since the chunks left behind are a choking hazard.

We are satisfied over all but maybe spring for the 60$ and up if you have high hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Combo","review":"The main reason I wanted this blender was because of the food processor attachment.

We bought both and put them to an ice test: how quickly and thoroughly would each crush six ice cubes with the out-of-the box blades?The Cuisinart was first. Other than being a little loud (which we had expected from comments we read), it performed beautifully; the blender ground the ice down within a quick 3 seconds. Happy, we prepped the Hamilton Beach for the same task. Our results were far different, though. After 4 attempts at the same cubes, the Hamilton Beach failed to grind them down. After a certain point, the still large chunks only rattled around in the carafe.The failure did make our decision much easier.

There is also no real estimate of product needed so that you can estimate your cost. There are a few drawings and no pictures. The book looks like it was printed on an ancient home computer. There is more information about fixing floor squeeks and removing high heel shoe marks (no kidding)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the Day","review":"This was the album that imprinted German pop on me.... more than Nena's 99 Luft Ballons. I know a lot of people think it isn't as good as the album that came before.

Oh, I knew a few of the songs, but nearly enough of the songs performed.For the bright spots, I thought Rosie sang well. Her pianist John Oddo did do some great arranging on some of the songs.

I thought it would be a good way to brush up on my college Russian. I can say, \\"I'm going to town\\" when I see it in Cyrillic but if a beginner tried to read it in the English alphabet as it's written in this book he or she would have difficulty. If that person ever did venture to Russia he or she would be unable to read the restroom or metro signs. I can't imagine how someone with no knowledge of Russian could even begin to utilize this book. It's hard to use even if you know some Russian. I guess publishers hope to profit by selling a copy to most libraries in America. Without the Cyrillic alphabet there's nothing to build on."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be illiterate in Russian","review":"I have NO idea what would possess a publisher to put out a Russian text without anything in Cyrillic! It's a mind-boggling error that would leave one totally unable to read anything in Russian, and what's the point of learning to be illiterate in a foreign language? Luckily for me, I found this book in a store and had a chance to look at it before buying...as soon as I realized the transliterations weren't simply aids to pronunciation, I put it back on the shelf. It's such a great idea, to have a book of practice exercises, but if all your other materials are in Cyrillic, you need to practice writing it. I hope the publisher re-thinks this, and does it correctly next time--it would be so useful to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the similar edition: Everything Learning Russian","review":"Agreeing with previous reviews of this book-CD, I found the transliteration of Russian very awkward.

And besides, anyone who's going to learn Russian should begin with the Cyrillic alphabet anyway. I don't get the purpose of writing the book in transliterated Russian. I found it annoying, because it adds an extra layer of thought to the study process. You have to sound out the transliterated word, visualize it in Cyrillic, and then remember what it means, and then work out the grammar issues. This book is not for students of Russian. I'd suggest that the publisher go back, put the Cyrillic back in and then republish. You can even leave the transliteration in place, it does have some usefulness, after all. But stay away from this if you are accustomed to working in Cyrillic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony Software","review":"This software is a phony. It is nothing but a legal forms collection.

I bought the old style Miss Clavel too, and will refer to her as Miss Clavel and will probably give this doll a pretend teacher's name for my daughter.

I used regular polish and sometimes regular acrylic paint from the craft store. I also used very small painting brushes and other small tools to get the right effect. The designs are pretty intricate. If you're crafty, the book is worth having to buy your own supplies to go with it, just to use for the ideas. Having bees, bears, dogs, ladybugs, etc... on your kids (and yourself!) is so cute! I usually did just the toes - it's too much work to get rubbed off as fast as it would on fingers.

However on the cd the man who was singing with her on the video was not singing on the copy of the cd that I had gotten. When I listen to this song now I can not get Ace Of Base out of my head...\\"All that she wants is...

Although I am not a plus size woman, I appreciate Delta's positive outlook on life and excellent self-image.

I'm not saying these guys are'nt awesome, they are, but they are simply not as good as Skid Row.Sven Gali's debut record is superb, the songs are melodic, catchy, and well written. However, like most other great bands of the era, these guys were simply pushed aside for the grunge revolution of the early 90's. Just about every song on this record is a winner, from the opener Under The Influence, Sven Gali hit you in the face and never back-off.Go buy this record, and see for yourself if they are as good...or better than Skid Row.

I thought Sullivan's Island was one of the best books I have read in years and have eagerly awaited each of her subsequent deliveries. Shem Creek is the most poorly done of all the books. It seems hurriedly cranked out, as though she forgot she had a deadline. There is poor character and plot development, dialog is trite, and the ending is packaged up too neatly to be believed. Isle of Palms has a story line very similar to Shem Creek, but is somewhat better developed. It would be nice to see Ms. Frank write a book where the primary female character isn't divorced, broke, fighting with her daughter, and ultimately rescued by a wealthy ex-husband or some rich new comer.

I have a particular fondness for stories that are centered around a restaurant, and the Italian flare added a special touch. As someone in a similar stage of life as Linda, I held a special appreciation for her plight, especially in her relationships with her daughters, which was very realistically portrayed when compared to the interactions of my daughters with myself and with each other.

This one is a big disappointment.There came a scene when she meets a scientist who is dressed in fatigues, or some such. He turns out to be a \\"tree hugger\\" because he objects to pig manure filling the river.That was the point when I decided this author is letting the values of the real modern south seep through the romanticized south she usually writes about.I felt this author has disdain for anyone who does not want tons of pig manure washing into our rivers. She seemed like a tea bagger.More substantively, the story does not work. The whole setting of the restaurant and it being the center of the lives of the adult characters, does not feel like a restaurant. It feels like a gossip scene where people talk trash, talk gossip, talk feelings, talk nothing. There is no real sense of food, why one should love food or pay for it, in this story.It feels like a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought this book on a whim as I needed an airplane book.

Jeter definitely has some exciting moments as the plot of this excellent storyline thickens. Despite this excitement, the book has some relatively dry and uninteresting aspects that do not seem incredibly relavent as of yet in the series. Some of the encounters in the web of Kud'ar Mub'at seem overly drawn out, and the events involving Kuat of Kuat at the Kuat Shipyards also get dull. If you can make it through a few lulls in the storyline, you will probably find this book to be a great in depth look at the characters of Boba Fett and Prince Xizor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeter ruined the story of Boba Fett","review":"I only gave this book 1 star because it was the lowest rank allowedJeter ( along with some other authors who wrote SW novels ) should not ever be allowed to write about Star Wars again.Zahn, Stackpole, Anderson, Crispen should be the ONLY honorary SW novel authors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I recommend reading this trilogy. It teaches you many aspects that you learn, such as how Boba Fett thinks. It is interesting to see how he does things from his mind, because you always see him as a mysterious character. Many books do not talk too much about him, which is why this trilogy is interesting. It shows you how he thinks, works, and does things. It kept me turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Boba Fett","review":"I'm a Star Wars fan who has never read any of the books. I received it as a birthday present, from a non fan. Although I received it out of order, I enjoyed every minute of it. It took me three days to read, and as soon as I finished it, I ran out and got Mandalorian Armor. I finished that in two. At times I found certain passages and dialogue a bit wordy, but I can't wait for the third one. Prior to this, I didn't think twice about Boba Fett. I know he's a bad guy, but now, I'm rooting for him and can't get enough. After I read this book, I re-played the trilogy to get glimpses of him. I think this series would make a pretty decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst series that I have ever read","review":"I love Star Wars. I collect as many of the books as I can and read them in less than 2 days. This book took me almost 2 weeks. It was so boring. None of the characters acted like themselves. Boba Fett talks way too much and is too friendly. Dengar acts like a wimp who couldn't even hold a blaster without scaring himself (that never happened, but it might as well have the way that Jeter displays his character). In Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Dengar was an Imperial assassin who was stripped of almost all emotion. Bossk was never the son of the leader of the Bounty Hunters Guild. Zuckuss is supposed to be the partner of 4-LOM, not a parttime friend of Fett that will pretend to be dead so Fett can get Bossk out of the way and get the bounty. Sorry, Jeter, but read Tales of the Bounty Hunters and watch the movies. It will really help with book 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"When I originally read The Mandalorian Armor, the series seemed ok, with only minor inconsistincies. Now reading the Slave Ship, my opinion of K.W. Jeter is falling rapidly. With major inconsistinces on every page, and with a fairly poor plot, the Slave Ship rates very low in my opinion. The only good thing about it is that it's a difference from the battle after battle X-Wing series (which were far better than the Slave Ship)."},{"rating":"1","title":"also a loser amoung winners in the star wars vien.","review":"This book is pretty bad in my opinion.

I had just finished The Mandalorian Armor and was very impressed with it. About 1/3 of the way through Slave Ship I began to wonder what the author was thinking. Some of the chapters seemed to strecth from one side of the galaxy to the other and explained nothing but boring dribble to the reader. I had to set the book down several times just to rest my eyes and wonder why that chapter was even in the book. Boba Fett is what the books are supposed to be about but this book ended up being about Jeter's longwindedness. I really want to read the next in the series because Boba Fett is such a unigue character.... but after this, I think Jeter has talked me out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Dark Star Wars","review":"Vaguely, the dark tone to this book reminds me of The Black Fleet Crisis, an exceptional Star Wars series. This book, and the other two in the series are more realistically geared than other Star Wars books. While the 'Noble, infallible Republic' books are great, a dose of realism is good. This series does not completely coincide with the rest of the Star Wars universe, though only hardcore Star Wars readers will notice it, or care. In my opinion, this is one of the best Star Wars book series out there, the darkish realism (not just anti-Imperial) giving a realistic edge to A Galaxy Far, Far Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooooring","review":"I'm as big a Star Wars addict as they come.

I read the first book, then read this. I was thinking maybe this would be better than the first. Well, it wasn't. Jeter still obsessed over barves and Standard Time Parts. If Standard Time Parts were so freaking standard, why is this the only book with them. Not to mention the fact Jeter wrote Xisor was alive in the NOW section and dead in the THEN. And then there is Bossk. \\"Hi I'm Bossk, the retarded Trandoshan bounty hunter. I think I can kill the best bounty hunter in the galaxy on his ship! After all, my father was smart so I must be too!\\" And the whole renegade stormtrooper incident? How much sense does it make for Palpatine to pay millions of credits, at minimum, for a person he has no problem with?

Now if you don't want action and you want to read about Vader and Xizor fighting, and you want some sort of a braintwister, then this book is for you, but overall, i'd stick to getting it from the library, or borrowing it from a friend who had the missfortune of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPOS.

I know it's not her fault, but as someone who has some serious clout in the publishing industry, she needs to effing go and slap someone upside the head until they correct the typos in this Kindle edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"omfg i am soooo angry","review":"i have never read something thatmakes me so angry. the first part was amazing i could not put it dow. but the rest!!!!!!! omg the rest is pure CRAP!!!!!!! Sofie is so dumb her mother is so evil and self centered its sad. sofie repeatedly denies edward of his daughter when it is his right for her own selfish reasons. he misses her birth and when she finally tells him and he finds the she runs aways and he spends weeks searching for them. all because she loves him and cant bare that he doesnt love her back. she deprivedthat poor child of a father for 5 months and the poor man becomes distraught looking for them. she refused to give him a chance to be in his daughter's life from the start even though she prayed to be pregnant with HIS baby. how dumb.i cant believe i stayed up all night to read this load of craaaaaaaaaap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"Joyce did a terrific job in making one problem the main concern of both characters. There's something both character wants from each other but is afraid to give (can't tell you it would ruin it). I literally could not put the book down as Joyce did such a great job in causing one major problem between the characters that you had to keep reading it to make sure that it was resolved. I wasn't a Brenda Joyce fan before I read this book but I am now. If this is you're first Joyce book I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must agree...","review":"This book was excellent. The characters were wonderful. The plot was good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the mother committed an unspeakable act (I can't say what she did, it would give the book away) and when she finally confessed nothing more was said about it. But this was not enough to hurt the book. I just felt as if Brenda Joyce forgot about the mother. Anyhow, this was a great book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one speaker works","review":"I bought these yesterday for my computer for self-protection from my neighbor's music. One of the speakers works great but there is almost no sound coming out of the other one, so not quite what I bargained for. I thought maybe I was deaf in my left ear so I switched them around. Nope; my hearing's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad for listening to music","review":"I guess these would be OK if all you used them for was to watch TV shows or spoken word videos on your computer, but any music sounds just horrible. No bass, muffled treble, I have to say these are the worst computer speakers I've ever had. They are going in the trash soon. Quite confused by the 5 star reviews, because I have to agree with the other reviewers that these are really bad speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound","review":"Would definitely not buy again, nor recommend, these speakers. They do alright for watching movies, but music either constantly knocks out one speaker, or you get a cracking/popping sound at the absolute lowest volume. Even worse with the slightest bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"IStatic in one speaker","review":"I purchased these apeakers from Target and while one speaker works great, the other has static even at low volumes. Terrible sound. I can't turn anything up. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"Everything about these speakers is bad! Sound quality is just plain bad! Peal-off the cheap, plastic griddle and take a look at the speaker! That'll show you. It's like a piece of craft paper! Highs are fuzzy, mids are distorted and bass is putrid! And if it's not bad enough that they sound so bad, they have to look like Coneheads too! I forgot to mention the transformer is on the end of the plug. Great idea, GE. Thanks. And all this can be yours for the great price of $20! I'd suggest not buying these, unless you want to pull an evil prank on somebody you hate by giving these to them as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"They really suck","review":"I paid $10 for them to provide audio to a mobile projector and they do the job. The sound quality is very poor but if you need something for their utility and low price, these will work. I would not pay $20 (Current Amazon price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound","review":"If you turn up the volume they make a ripping sound...otherwise at a normal volume their just \\"ok\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Flirt's Satisfaction","review":"This was just an enjoyable read which I did in one sitting. Drew thought Sydney was just \\"plain\\" and out of her league by reopening Flirt near his restaurant, Satisfactions, but he found out different during the snow storm.I enjoyed this story and though the author did not let us know who Merry's stalker was, I was hoping it was her ex-husband.It was good to have other Coleman members stop in as well and look forward to more relatives to read about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces missing, but enjoyable.","review":"I love this guy, but mine had a bag missing and now I cant finish building him and i want a replacement, but I luv this guy and i wanna play with it fast, it isnt hard to build, just a bag with pieces missing makes me wanna break the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 6 bucks!","review":"This toy is a nightmare to assemble.

It came in about 800 pieces and was missing the bonus item. This item is not preassembled! My husband has been a mechanic for 10 years and it took him 6 hours to put this toy together. When put together the toy did not work properly and then proceeded to fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this Zoid!","review":"The instructions are plain and simple to follow. My kids age 14 and 15 totally enjoyed putting it together and watching as it walked, roared and lights came on! I have to say it made me feel like a kid again. This is one of the best kits you can get that teaches so many skills in building and then rewards you with so much fun after it's complete! You can't go wrong with the Gojulas Giga! /;^)"},{"rating":"2","title":"bigger than a cannon tortoise, and over 50 tons heavier!!!","review":"This zoid is da bomb!!! I love his lights and the roar and stomping sounds so real! If your a gojulas fan, or just like big, scary dinosaurs,buy this guy!!!(p.s.,IT'll take you a little while to build this guy, and parents, it's a MODEL kit, not an \\"I THOUGHT IT WAS ALREADY BUILT TOY\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality - Best Toy Model Ever","review":"I'm a parent of an 8 year old boy and he's been asking for this toy for a while now. I bought it for his birthday and it has by far been his favorite present. He's barely touched the remote control truck and remote control boat he got. I didn't realize this toy required assembly so I was dissappointed at first. I didn't want to spend an afternoon putting this thing together to be honest with you. However it turned out to be a lot of fun and my son, my wife and I all helped out. Along the way we learned about how parts can be made to move together. Also, I have to say this is the best model/toy I have ever built. Seriously, there were no missing parts, everything fit perfectly, nothing needed gluing and it wasn't difficult at all. The quality of this toy makes it every bit worth the $50 or $60 they charged originally. I'm very happy we bought this and HIGHLY suggest it for kids in the 8 year old age range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Educational, and Durable","review":"This Zoid is the most detailed zoid I have ever built, not only is it detailed, it is customizable. It is my 35th zoid I've assembled and probably the most awesome. If you add the cp unit 10 (HIGHLY recommended) it will make it look better and stronger. It also has two walking modes battle mode (Godzilla), and pursuit mode (T-Rex).FUN-This toy is great, and one of my favorites for fun.EDUCATIONAL-Any zoid could help you in education, it helps on your reading and following instructions, and best of all, you can customize it and redesign it anyway you like.DURABLE-This zoid is the most durable zoid I've ever built besides Iron Kong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Hall of Fame","review":"The Posies have at least a dozen flawless tunes, any one of which would earn them a place in the Pop hall of Fame along with The Beatles, Costello, The Cars, XTC, The Police, Elliot Smith, Nirvana, or anyone else that can write, perform and record a solid, harmonic, rhythmic, powerful song. Amazing Disgrace is certainly less than perfect, but Success is a work of art, and Frosting on the Beater a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"KICK A**!!!","review":"i love placebo, it's optimistic lyrics get me through those times when i feel like i'm going no where, don't ask me why. finally, something i can jive to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice return to form--and hopefully not the final act","review":"This is the last studio album (to date) by the Posies, who may or may not have broken up for good. This band is the Everly Brothers of the grunge world, with an effortless sense of pop melody, a keen ear for chord changes, and KILLER two-part harmonies. \\"Success\\" is a return to form for the Posies after the angry, dispirited \\"Amazing Disgrace\\". This album is full of great songs, from the pure pop of \\"Somehow Everything\\" and \\"Farewell Typewriter\\" to the synthesized \\"Start a Life\\", the full-out rock of \\"Looking Lost\\", and the wistful ballads \\"You're the Beautiful One\\" and \\"Every Bitter Drop\\". My favorite song is the careening \\"Fall Apart with Me\\". The Posies aren't the greatest musicians in the world, but they play exactly what the song needs, and they know how to use the whisper-to-a-scream dynamic range to full effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holden turns in a royal flush commentary.","review":"In BIG DEAL, Holden recounts a year in his life as a professional poker player, along the way describing his ups and downs from home games in London to the World Series in Las Vegas. Holden introduces us to the fascinating cast of characters who make up the pro poker culture, and gives us an insider's view of the game itself. Even if you are not a particular fan of the game, you will understand the book and appreciate the battle of wits and chance that makes the game of poker what it is. The book includes a high level detail of individual games that the author witnessed or played in -- perhaps too much detail for the casual reader. For anyone who is curious about the lifestyle of a professional cardshark or wonders whether they could hang with the big boys, BIG DEAL goes a long way to giving the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Balalaika method in print","review":"This is without a doubt the worst music method book I have ever purchased. Dorozhkin'sElementary Method for the Balalaikais well worth it, but don't spend your money on this one. In addition buy the Bibs EkkelMel Bay's Complete Bailalaika Book.The only redeeming quality of this method is that it contains a few tunes. It's instructional value is nil, as you cannot learn to play the balalaika with this book. Sorry to be so negative, but I was so disappointed with it that I'd hate to see someone spend their money on something that appears to be what it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Mistitled","review":"Well there's hardly any teaching here; by p. 13 you're pretty much just looking at sheet music for the rest of the 60-page book. Some tab would have been helpful. Actually a lot of things would have been helpful, and this book comes up nearly empty. I've had formal musical training, and I've used method books to learn basic skills on several string instruments, and I still did not find this book nearly as usable as I expected. The only index is a four-page, trilingual glossary of musical terms. I concur with another reviewer here: the Alexander Dorozhkin book is vastly superior to this grossly mistitled one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small book with big information...","review":"**** This self-help book can help readers locate the healing foods that are currently missing from their diets. Many people do not realize simple things, such as thoroughly chewing food before swallowing, can actually help the body extract more nutrition from every bit. Did you know that memory loss may be nothing more than an amino acid deficiency? There are foods that improve sexual performance and others that could cause hair loss.This book is packed with valuable information.

I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but this put the genre to shame! Aside from the quality of poor VHS to DVD transfer (turn the volume ALL THE WAY UP, but watch out when the AWFUL music chimes in INCESSANTLY throughout the movie), you need a PhD to follow the story line.

Most of them are Billy's pasion for music as he disaplys his musical talent. I'm sure the people who love folk music would love this album, and I can't really judge Billy's music or not 'cause i'm just not into that sorta thing.But i felt i better warn any one who are like me and purchased it expecting comedy and not having more then a whiskers of it on this album.It's a shame I cant rate it as \\"skip the vote\\" i dont want to say I hate it, it's just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"A good read.

Although Mr Thaw was crazy about Evelyn, and she made him work for her attentions, and eventually marrying him, I seem to think that she had more to do with Mr Whites demise than what the book trys to lead us to believe. Very well written and informative. Great pictures, although I wished he had added more photos of each character he was writing about.

It sets the Umi Friends in various settings that have to solve problems using numbers, math, geometry, patterns, etc. From what I have seen, this show does not present any moral dilemmas for parents concerned about that.

Perhaps the negative reviews are from the cassett version, because the CD is very good. The singing is nice, clearly understandable, and the music is very pleasant.I do wish they would have done a slower tempo version of each song, then a normal tempo version, then just music. I do recommend it to beginners of Vietnamese and those with small children to introduce them to the language. As a tonal language, Vietnamese is easiest to learn singing and chanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic","review":"It was very easy to sing along for my children and all the words in the book matched the recording.

Seriously, why would any product in 2012 come with a cassette tape?!I don't know what's more upsetting, the fact that it came with one or that there was no mention that it was going to come with one. Even my family members in a third world country would not have a cassette player nor would they use cassette tapes anymore. Is this some kind of joke? Did you expect me to give this as a gift to my little niece and have her rewind in a dinosaur cassette player in order to listen to the songs again?!This was really absurd to receive and cannot believe that AMAZON would even carry this or have this distributed without thinking about the product quality and the quality of life. Was this in storage from the 80s? I'm not looking for memorabilia but an actual product that can be used in 2012. This was upsetting enough to make me want to no order from AMAZON again. A cassette tape...omg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic purchase","review":"I will start by saying my kids already spoke vietnamese before this purchase. This product is probably more geared towards kids from Vitenamese parents. Not really a warning but an FYI, without some type of a background knowldge of Vietnamese, you will not learn the language from this book alone. That being said, you do not need to speak vietnamese to appreciate these songs. My kids love singing these songs.

My daughter would love to play some of these songs since she is taking piano lessons.-Black and white paper. Add more color illustration please.-Overpriced; I believed the fair price for this item should be no more than $7.99-A lot of these so-called songs are actually nursery rhymes, e.g. Con Meo\` Tre\`o Le^n Cay Cau.-A few of them are actually originally written in English and French, e.g., The Yellow Butterfly and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.-Please produce more authentic Vietnamese songs.

Every time I put it on, I'm dancing around the kitchen and enjoying the music. This is another of Gene Harris' great work. If you like Gene Harris' music style, this is one I would recommend.

In that regard I can also tell you that the Summit Disposer Care does a really good job of cleaning out the disposer! Usually when I read biodegradable or something similar it typically means it does a terrible job at doing what it should be doing, but I can assure that is not the case here. One caution I do have is that this is NOT an item that should sit on a shelf for a long time as the packets do harden and their effectiveness seems to lessen somewhat, as well as making it far harder to get them into your disposer. That seems to be typical for most of these disposer products yet none of the packaging mentions timeframes they should be used within. At any rate, use these rather than storing them and you should be quite pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"You need to update the photo and give an accurate description of this feeder. The picture shows a clear, solid tray in the base to catch excess seed so it doesn't fall on the ground. That was Droll Yankee's original version which they changed and have not manufactured for quite some time. The actual feeder being sold has the open mesh on the bottom, the same as the sides, and the seed drops straight through to the ground. If that's what you want, the feeder may be fine, but since that's not what you're advertising, I give it a one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel Proof","review":"This feeder does what it promises. All the neighborhood squirrels have given up on trying to \\"beat it\\" - and they have tried their best!

On the second day I put up the Droll Yankee Flipper feeder and shortly afterwards I had a large amount of birds at both feeders. The gaps in the wire are large enough for chickadees, finches, titmice, and other small birds to get through. The squirrels jumped up on it a few times, and have given up for now. The seed is too far inside the cage for them to be able to reach and shovel any out, and the plastic baffle on the top prevents them from reaching in as well. So far so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"This feeder is squirrel proof & Grackle proof. Both were decimating the seed in the previous feeder in quick time. Now just the small birds can get to the seed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Cost and Then Some","review":"Whenever I am in the market for a new bird feeder I always look to see what's new, hoping for \\"a better mousetrap\\". However, I just about always end up with a Droll Yankee product. I have bought at least a dozen over the last 15 or so years and they are all in service. Yes, they are a little pricey, but quality always is. Their products perform as promised (I have a Yankee Flipper that drives the squirrels nuts!) and their customer service is the best.As for this particular feeder, I really like it. It a simple yet effect way to keep not only squirrels but larger birds away from the seed. I like large birds too, but often they chase off the little guys (Kinglets, various Finches, Nuthatches, etc.). I have other feeders for the Blue Jays, Woodpeckers and Doves, this one is for the rest of the flock. I just wish that the capacity was a little greater but still it's a wonderful feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Product","review":"I love this feeder.

However, I found that it was mostly about congenital disabilities and those where the loved ones' personality basically stays the same. I was disappointed that still no one seems to acknowledge how difficult it is to be a spouse and caregiver to a loved one who has sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury.

I think Noelle has a soothing voice. i am almost tempted to tie this group loosely to the brand new heavies (n'dea davenport too).i think this is good evening riding music. very calming and the instruments are vibrant. I think this cd has the capability to carry you where your minds dreams. I suggest to get this cd if you are looking for a relaxing warm voice that flows over meticulous instrumentation that in whole is jazzy and dreamy, yet not the average \\"put you to sleepy\\" music.What a shame that this type of music has to be mistaken upon opposed to getting heavy airtime on these wack radio stations."},{"rating":"2","title":"sick","review":"which reviewer said \\"not a throwaway in the bunch\\"? tru dat. tru dat. this thing is hot end to end. i don't know what's gonna become of me--i can't stop listening to it. matter fact, i gotta go now--the last track is ending and i gotta go flip it back to the first track."},{"rating":"2","title":"isaac said it all...A Perfect Musical Journey","review":"Just like Isaac says in his review, this album is AMAZING! I first heard it when it was featured on an in-store new artists listening station at the old Tower Records. It sounded pretty nice, and it was on sale, so I bought it, and it has just gotten better with age. I LOVE this album!Great musicianship, great songwriting,amazing vocals, it's all here. Too bad that the band went through some personnel changes not long after 'This Journey In' was released, but I recently heard that The Rebirth is FINALLY working on a followup to TJI, with a new singer, so hopefully that'll be released sometime soon. If it is even half as good as 'This Journey In', it'll be worth checking out. In the meantime, if you love hearing music-making at its finest, this album's a steal at 2 or 3 bucks here on Amazon. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music plus thoughtful lyrics equal one great CD","review":"This 2005 release from The Rebirth is a great mix of funky, jazzy, organic soul, married with insightful, thoughtful lyrics, which are often a departure from the norm that a group of their ilk would produce. Whilst I would have had no problem with them following the tried & trusted route of their comtempories, by utilizing all things love related, I do admire artists that bring a little substance to the party.Two songs that best emphasize this are 'Stray Away'(One of my favorite songs) & 'Shake It (Feel the same)' which deal with hard times, and not letting go of your inner-bitions. Proves the point that there is good music out there: You just have to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic","review":"Simply THE album of 2005, \\"This Journey In\\" blows away the soulless, prepackaged, commercial drivel that somehow passes as r&b music today. More than just a \\"neosoul\\" group, the Rebirth blends warm vocals, jazzy chord changes, and grooves a mile wide into a sound that is obviously influenced by 70s-era soul/jazz/funk (e.g. Mizell brothers, Leon Ware, Roy Ayers) yet is not derivative, as elements of drum and bass, house, and hip hop are seemlessly infused. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic Journey","review":"This work sounded solid, interesting, and creative at first glance, that is, from the brief sound clips that are available to us on the Net. Once I got it home, though, I was disappointed. The music is not as interesting as I had hoped, for I thought, again, based on the brief sound bites, that this work might share in common some of the strong traits of Pharez Whitted's \\"Mysterious Cargo,\\" or Bluezeum's \\"Portrait of a Groove,\\" or the compilation CD called \\"Nuyorican Soul.\\" I regret that I cannot recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold your horses!!!","review":"Sick, jamming, flamboyant but at the same time ridiculously catchy math-rock.

This is the first DVD I have purchased and it is truly disappointing. The music was wonderful, but the productions were terrible. To me it took on the look of one big strobe light! There were so many flashing lights in the backgrounds, foregrounds, above, below, from helicopters that most of the images were washed out and appeared overexposed and ghost-like. Certainly not flattering to someone as attractive as Gloria. Too bad, but this one is going to be discarded. If you're over the age of 15 and appreciate good entertainment, then you're wasting your time with this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Beware","review":"I have long been a Gloria fan along with my two daughters aged 14 and 16. I always encouraged my daughters to listen to Gloria because her music had decent lyrics and I believed Gloria to be a good role model for young girls. But when I watched this new video with my daughters, I was shocked! This music video definitely breaks from Gloria's previous clean-cut image. Many of the scenes in the opening song, Oye, are lewd and crude, and at least one scene is suggestive of oral sex. This is a shame because the video is otherwise very good. If your kids insist on watching the video, I suggest having the fast-forward button ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Out Your Dancing Shoes!","review":"Words cannot express the upbeat feeling of this superb DVD.

Broke the main rotor the first day and got these to replace. The stock main rotor was a real pain to remove, I had to basically cut the plastic shaft off of the metal center shaft. Used a bit of super glue to get the new rotor to stay on as others posted. Broke the new rotor after about 20 minutes of fly time and couldn't get it off.

The introduction gives you a fine initiation into the sushi-making realm with recommendations on tools and products available. Recipies are straight-forward with easy-to-follow instructions. In fact, I didn't know that there were so many types of vegetarian sushi available! So, what's wrong with my local sushi restaurant? The photographs are also a wonderful asset to this cookbook.Definitely recommended for people who want to learn how to make their own sushi (without worrying about contamination and food borne illnesses associated with raw fish). An asset to any vegetarian/vegan cookbook collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas but NOT 100% VEGETARIAN","review":"This is an OK book for gathering ideas for vegetarian sushi, but appears to be written by somebody that has no clue what a vegetarian is. There are recipes that are vegan, and others that are ovo-vegetarian, but Brigid seems to be clueless as to what a vegetarian is, as her dashi recipes all call for fish flakes. Also, she lists seafood possibilities for various sushi types.It's not a bad read, and there is good information, but it's yet another book written by a non-vegetarian without bothering to ensure that the recipes are at least lacto-ovo.It's a disappointment that in a book called vegetarian sushi, there are so many refs to seafood and recipes that call for meat products. Especially considering that the typical American mis-conception of sushi is fish, and this book claims to provicde vegetarian recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetarian Sushi?","review":"This book has everything it needs to pass as great to the majority of the population; glossy photos, cute names, and it's about sushi.Very trendy.As a Vegan, I was not as impressed. The stock recipes include bonito (dried fish), and offered no substitutions for it. Several of the recipes called for the stock, or water. Water doesn't add any flavor to food, obviously. So it's either fish, or a substandard dish. The author also includes seafood suggestions on nearly every page. The last time I checked, fish are living creatures. Fish are not vegetables.I expected a few mentions of egg or dairy, it is a supposedly Vegetarian book. But I can't say I expected flesh to be involved in the cooking process.Before becoming Vegan, I had never eaten sushi due to my allergy to seafood. So if you have a similar allergy and are looking to enjoy Sushi, I would recommend searching elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book!","review":"This is a book full of great ideas for all different kinds of sushi. The author's instructions are very clear and the pictures are beautiful! There is a picture of each one of the different types of sushi as well as clear soups and small plates to go along with them. Sushi is very simple and quick to make and looks very elegant. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"for veg, not by veg","review":"there was little to glean from this book. it does offer some interesting ideas, and a beginner's style guide for rice, but does not really touch on all the traditional vegetarian dishes in japanese cuisine. also, which rather irked me, was that they suggested using bonito in some of the recipes, which is definitely not vegetarian! all in all, an okay book for people who like to putter around the kitchen and have to make sushi for their vegetarian friends, a little basic for anyone who cooks often at home and has a nodding acquaintance with vegetarian cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six-Year Old Loves Her Hello Kitty Barbie","review":"My neice asked her Nana if she could get a new Barbie with pretty hair for her birthday.

Scott Hamilton's saxophone is smooth and sultry and his rendition seems effortless. Such quality is achievable only with the precision and clarity of great musical technique - and it's a testament to Hamilton that the technique never intrudes on the mood. The piano of Tommy Flanagan, bass of Bob Cranshaw and drums of Lewis Nash all meld together into a coherent whole. As the liner notes by Peter Straub read, the performance gives the listener \\"... a transcendent relaxation which evokes the profoundly communicative, almost autumnal atmosphere sometimes achieved late at night in a club ... the music is set free to express itself with joyous, unforced abandon\\". I heartily agree and recommend this CD to anyone who loves mellow tones and music guaranteed to \\"put you in the mood\\". I'll certainly be looking at other Scott Hamilton recordings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd had an all star cast, but came up short.........","review":"What happens when you assemble an all star cast? Usually you get superb results. In this case this project came up a little short. It apears, despite this brilliant cast, that the repertoire was the down fall of this project. There were too few really good songs performed here.To defend this all star group, I would like to say that all the musicians did a great job with their performances. They all measured up to their super star billing. If they would have choosen a better repertoire, then this would have been nothing short of a great cd.This cd is about average, but nothing close to being great. Once again, I think repertoire is everything, just about.Recommendation: I wouldn't buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a great vocal album!","review":"By the time this songs are recorded, Ethel Waters was more a popular singer than a jazz singer. The songs here are not the best ones she recorded in her long career. In this cd, you can hear some of Ethel's greatest hits like BREAD AND GRAVY, CABIN IN THE SKY and TAKING A CHANCE ON LOVE but the rest of the songs are not enjoyable like her 1920's recordings. But this songs are singing by the great Ethel Waters so if it's not an essential cd, is a very pleasant one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday gift","review":"I got this item as a birthday gift for my 6 year old who is very much into magic.

The magic box is a good value for the price, considering they start at about $300.00 on web site for magicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice set for the intermediate magician looking to go pro!","review":"This set has some really nice, stage sized (and quality!) props. The props are quite nicely designed and don't look like cheesy, kids' set props which makes the larger pieces a cost-effective way for the stage magician to add some nice tricks to his act without spending a small fortune (where can you get a square circle effect for under $30?). As for the close-up tricks, there are plenty and all are perfect for the beginner magician. Again, the design is nice and none have that cheesy, kids' set look. Lots of classics here, like cups and balls, money machine (made in clear plastic which really creates the illusion that you're seeing everything that's going on), a nicely designed coin coaster and much, much more. The quality of this set exceeds almost anything else out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased","review":"I bought this for our grandson's 8th birthday.

When I was moving on in the eighth grade, our library held a book sale to raise some funds and this same book was on the table!

And religion comes back with this character, reminding Chris and Cathy all too well why they didn't want anything to do with religion. As a part of a series, Seeds of Yesterday doesn't contribute overmuch to the Foxworth saga, which is sad, because it'd have been nice to learn more about the Foxworths.Just one plothole - in SoY, it's 1997, but in the next book 'Garden of Shadows' (prequel to Flowers in the Attic), Olivia Foxworth's will included a letter to be opened 20 years after her death (which was the story of GoS) and her death was in 1972, so Chris and Cathy should have read GoS by now and already be aware of what happened between Malcolm and Olivia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I hated this book.

I had read the others in the series and slogged through this one just to see how it all ended. The dialog was incredibly bad - NO ONE talks like that! And why did this amazingly disfunctional family keep on living together when every encounter led to bickering, hurt feelings and family secrets revealed? And everyone continued to \\"love\\" Bart even though he kept the family in constant turmoil and was downright mean. Plot lines from other books in the series were repeated. We never find out who was responsible for all the mysterious things that happened. And the ending! Simply awful. Who wrote this thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain depressing.","review":"The final installment in the Dollanganger saga is just plain depressing.

This book was probably necessary, as everyone would have been wondering, \\"what happened next?\\" after \\"If there Be Thorns,\\" but I think that the Dollanganger pond had pretty much been fished dry by the time this book came around. There was so much stuff that was just repeats of things that happened in the previous books. It was like the author was thinking, \\"well, that worked before, let's try it again.\\" Jory is paralyzed, just like his father Julian was; Bart is once again under the control of an older, evil man, just like in the previous book; Cindy is basically a regeneration of Cathy; along comes a set of blond boy-girl twins, just like in the first book.

It is Baroque religious music (these motets were published in 1702), but rather unlike any other such music I have heard. Bonporti's writing has neither the austerity of the Germans, the pomp of the French, nor the usual bravura showiness of his fellow Italians. Rather than having the feel of a penitent, reverant worshiper, Ellen Hargis gives the impression of a charming young woman in love for the first time, full of longing, tenderness, joy, enthusiasm, and willingness to feel emotion. She is excellently supported by the Ensemble Ouabache (two violins, 'cello, theorbo, and organ) who shine like stars while she soars in front of them. Truly a desert island disc; the first aria, \\"Vos cheles\\", once caused a house guest of mine to come from the next room literally with tears in her eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Well as Expected.","review":"I was dissapointed in the way it released the angle food cakes from the pan.

His voice is amazing; I want to turn it up loud and sing along although I don't understand a word! The only downfalls of this otherwise perfect album, are the electronic backing music, which lacks the sincerity his voice requires, and the gospel quality of his English songs. I hope he releases something in Britain soon so I won't feel so alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST TOASTER I'VE EVER OWNED","review":"Once you get past the price, this toaster is great........it works ever time with bagels, english muffins, homemade bread, toasted to perfection & it is NOT made in China........It is a STANDOUT product and worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect it to last","review":"The clockwork timer on my toaster has broken so that the toaster does not turn itself off. It burnt toast so severely that my smoke alarm went off and we had a visit from the NYC fire department.Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it works reasonably well, but it does not LAST.Dualit's warranty is for 1 year only and my broken toaster is outside the date. It's amazing that a product as expensive as this has such a short warranty. Surely a toaster 10 times the cost of a regular one should stand the test of time? I would not dream of replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifespan, expensive to repair","review":"I've had mine for about 3 years. The timer knob sticks more and more everyday. If you happen to be away from the toaster you could easy have a fire on your hands.Repairs aren't cheap. The toaster is over $200. To replace the timer knob, it's $149 from one USA supplier, or $60 ordering it from the UK. The repair labor is up to you.Something to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this toaster too!","review":"I don't understand its hefty price for its subpar performance. It will literally burn one side of the toast while barely toasting the other side. Plus, as mentioned by other reviewers, I've never been able to successfully toast a half-bagel without it getting stuck AND heaven forbid you have a slightly taller-than-average piece of bread. This was a gift, and I felt terrible about the expense they paid in relation to the loathe I feel for this contraption.We use my husband's 6+ year old, $35 Black & Decker toaster oven, and it's perfect every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the hefty price","review":"I bought this high end toaster about 5/6 years ago. It is simple and I thought it would last forever,but a few weeks ago the heating element in one slot failed and it is now worthless. This toaster has no amenities (like auto lift), it is not particularly fast and is quite inconsistent in the darkness of the toast. Kitchen Aid makes far superior (and less expensive) toasters.Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced junk.","review":"I purchased this toaster at the end of December. I only used it lightly for a few months, when it broke. The lever will not go back into the down position. I have to stand and hold down the knob in order to get a piece of toast done. The slots do not allow for bagel sized or large slices of bread. I am just so disappointed in this, but mostly when I wrote to Dualit, they did not make an attempt to have this fixed for me, and now the return time is expired. Don't buy this product. I had my cheap toasters for years, never a problem. Big mistake. Price does not equal quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looking but Poorly Built","review":"I have owned a total of 2 Dualit toasters at different times. I purchased them because I figured all toasters are going to work in about the same way and these looked particularly nice in my kitchen. Unbelievably, I have had the same issue with both toasters...the heating elements on one side fail. I use them very rarely so I don't know why this is happening. My first one failed after about a year of light use and I returned it to Williams Sonoma with no problems. I figured this was a fluke for such an expensive machine so I bought another one from Amazon in Nov. 2011. I now have the same problem with it. Amazon's refund window has passed so I guess I am stuck with this expensive POS. I am writing to Dualit to see if they can help me with this but whatever happens with me, I recommend staying away from Dualit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costly repairs are an unfortunate surprise","review":"I've had mine for about 3 years.

This product looks sturdy and people love the \\"legend of the Dualit\\". One side comment is that I find it very amusing that a manual toast lever is considered a winning feature.Anyway, back to my review. Bread does not toast evenly. After time, the problem only gets worse. No real way to easily clean the inside of the toaster.Bottom line is I love this toaster. What else can I say about a toaster that cost $300. The toaster either works great or I am bloody crazy for spending that kind of money. I choose to love the toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poulan Chainsaw sprocket Woodsman 2000","review":"Worked great, no real articles or instruction on how to install it though.

I've had this record for a year and I never had that impression. This music is too unique for such a general comparison.I say the record sticks because I've had it for a year and I still love this record, still find it a powerful experience that increases in depth with each listen. Its an ambient record, though, without question- and thereby essentially background music. But, given that, its the kind of music that I put on when I want to read on a rainy day- and, its perfect for that, in my opinion. And sooner or later, the music gently starts to seep into your consciousness. This is music that will follow you around if you give it the opportunity. The record is an experience that doesn't end when your speakers go quiet. *Highly* recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a chance...it's a winner!","review":"Kranky, eh? Doesn't sound cranky to me! This is a wonderful, essentially instrumental, dark, ambient beauty. Actually, just look at the cover - that's what it sounds like! LP length only. That seems to be their philosophy as I have since bought \\"E Luxo So\\" and it, too, is LP length. I have no problem with that, 40 mins has always seemed just right for most albums. I recently bought \\"The Unstable Molecule\\" by Isotope 217, by the way, and it lasts just 31 mins - now that's pushing the friendship! Anyway, back to \\"Mi Media Naranja\\"; the Amazon editorial describes it well. If you think it sounds like you, buy with confidence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be lovely, but high pitched noise is terrible","review":"I have a feeling this could have been a lovely album, but the high pitched noise (some sort of high pitched chime or something) that plays through a lot of the tracks renders it almost unlistenable to me. From other reviews I looked into it seems some people have no problem with it, while many do. So maybe you will be lucky. Just beware. The album was ruined for me by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!!","review":"My 4 yr old received as an X-Mas gift last year. The wings do fall off and are sharp. However, it was my husband who we took to the emergency room less than a week later with a stabbing injury requiring stitches. I do have to say it is durable, however. When my husband frantically pulled the base of the plane (not the wings) that was stabbing and protruding from his body and threw it against the wall, the wall dented. The plane was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batplane Review","review":"I bought this bat plane for my son, it looked like a very good product, but when he started playing with it I was quite dissapointed...the wings fall off easily-many times with out even touching them, the rocket launchers and grappling arm fall off all the time too! The figures don't fit the plane very easily (u have to twist and jam them in)and once you do it is difficult to close the cockpit. This is a cool looking toy but was VERY POORLY developed as a play toy.

I have two of the exact planes by Hasbro.I was completely disappointed in this item. Not only is it the SAME plane by Hasbro; there's NOTHING different. The least they could have done was add something. Anything.Well, they did improve the packaging. So, if you are one to keep items in the box, it will look great on display, over the Hasbro boxes.Not much I can say on this. A real disappointment from Mattel.Bottomline:Pros: The box is an improvement over Hasbro's.Cons: It's Hasbro's leftovers, repainted.Score: 0. When one took credit for someone else's work in school, it was called cheating, and plagerism.

I didn't see any bad reviews on this out of 27 reviews, so I thought that maybe this one set was somehow flawed and so I bought another, and the same problem. So I contacted Amazon and they gave me a promotional consideration for the MP3 download and the quality on the download is perfectly nice. The voices on this Rosary are so beautiful that I give 5 stars, it makes me weep its so beautiful, but 5 stars only on the MP3 download. If you love the Rosary as I do, you have to get this because it is beautiful beyond belief, angelic, heavenly, and far nicer than any other I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recites Rosary too fast!","review":"This CD is fine in terms of the audio, but the Rosary is said too fast for me to pray along with it.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosary CD","review":"I really like this CD and think it is very nice but it falls short of 5 stars. I thought it would all be recited by Robert Kochis. Instead the decades are alternated with a women reciting and unfortunately her voice is not pleasing to my ear. I was not aware when I bought it that there would be anyone other than Kochis reciting. I do LOVE the fact that they keep the pace slow enough to truly be able to meditate on the prayers, and they seem heartfelt when reciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use kindle fire version","review":"Kindle Fire version does not group the mysteries properly. You'd get the Gloryous Intro followed by the Joyful 1st chaplet, then Sorrowful 2nd verse ecetra.

Actually thinking of asking for my money back. too bad to because the prayers themselves are fine. Sorry Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have CD to Pray the Rosary","review":"I'm a non-catholic and recently taught myself to pray the Rosary. The CD is absolutely magnificent. Robert Kochis and Helena Buscema alternate reciting the msyteries. Each mystery is followed by song. A must for those who can use a little assistance to pray the Rosary. I've prayed daily while using the CD. Excellent for car use as well. Perfect for guided meditation. While the CD contains the Mysteries of Light versus the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries, I still find it an excellent purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Rosary CD","review":"I love this CD. It has been a great way to pray in the car on the way to work. My only complaint would be the changing of pace/rythm that takes place from one decade to the next. One time it is a relatively fast pace and the next decade will be much slower by comparison. That aside, the CD is a wonderful invoker of praying the rosary meditatively and with conviction. It is easy to stop and pickup where you left off. They recite the rosary completely for each set of mysteries so there is no jumping around to find anything. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Every Catholic should own this CD (2 Disc.) It is a great way to encourage the praying of the rosary on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"newport rocks","review":"You have to love any release that has Clotrane and Davis playing together.

However, this is MUCH different. \\"Kind of Blue\\" is laid back, cool. This is very agressive. \\"Ah-leu-cha\\" gets your feet tapping, in particular, and the whole set is enjoyable. I liked \\"The Theme\\" and \\"Fran-Dance.\\" There are a few problems: Chambers' bass is not quite loud enough, so some of the songs have a weird, unaccompanied feel. Miles sometimes goes out of his range, and I didn't always get what Coltrane was going for. And Evans seems to get lost a few times. But still, good music and worth a listen. But I wouldn't necessarily call it essential Miles. More for the Miles fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"España 82","review":"La verdad yo esperaba una mejor imagen de video ya que se trata de un DVD.Con esta compra lo que estas pagando no es calidad si no un recuerdo de lo que fue España '82.

Though the 3rd arc is my favorite, the conclusion of the 2nd arc is still excellent and leaves lots of room for discussion. Perhaps, these episodes are some of the most psychologically taxing in Utena, which only makes them more exciting to watch!The reason that Utena holds the title for my favorite anime is because it is not only stylish, beautiful, and meaningful, but the characters are rich with life and are all interconnected in a plot that is bigger and broader than all their lives. The talk of revolutionizing the world and the jealousy and pain one might go through to gain that objective is very much parallel to people in real life, despite the fact that most of us don't go around screaming \\"I want to revolutionize the world\\" with our kendo stick and dueling uniforms.

As for the uninitiated, this is a brilliant album full of humor, great hooks and excellent vocals. This, along with Dizrythmia (their follow up album) are two of my favorites.

What if Adolf Hitler had been incapacitated when his aircraft crash-landed in 1941? German generals might have pursued their preferred option on the Eastern Front, concentrating their advance on the capture of Moscow. Downing goes on from there, describing alternate outcomes in other theaters. What if Rommel had received the reinforcements he needed to defeat the British in the Egyptian desert? What if the Japanese had won the battle of Midway? These scenarios are well thought out and generally convincing. Downing concludes that the Germans and the Japanese eventually would have been overcome by superior allied resources. But the world might look different today because of early Axis power successes. This book, originally published in 1979, includes a few diagrams of battles and a disappointing dot and line map of the Pacific."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the books is called \\"The Moscow Option\\"...","review":"...then why do we spend the majority of the book everywhere but the Eastern Front?I won't deny or disparage the actions in the Pacific and the role of the British, but if a book is supposed to be about the German war in Russia, perhaps it would do well to spend some time in that setting.Instead, we get exceptional detail regarding British actions in North Africa, followed by hour-by-hour reworkings of American actions in the Pacific - and then we get sweeping generalities regarding the German actions in Russia.The premise and title of the book are largely sidelined, as if they are of secondary importance.

This is a book in point. I can see no earthly purpose that this book serves. The premise is what might have happened had the Nazis taken Moscow? The rest of the 200 pages is pure conjecture that makes no logical sense. Just because the Nazis successfully capture Moscow has no causal relationship to this book's fictive account of the Japanese attacking Los Angeles or the Panama Canal. Just because Moscow falls does not have any particular causal effect which would have put the Nazis three miles from Jerusalem.

The book is a thinking inspiring presentation on how modest means can bring about dramatic changes. I use the phrase \`thinking inspiring' instead of \`thought inspiring' because you will be contemplating how you can change the world around you before finish reading this book.The Tipping Point identifies the three little ingredients necessary to bring about changes of epidemic proportions. Because some may find the principles of the Tipping Point controversial, Gladwell supports his arguments by drawing from the analysis of empirical research in the social sciences. The application of the principles presented goes well beyond the arena of social sciences however, and has significant relevance for businesses considering product placement and marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic read","review":"What an interesting read!

Something that should have taken 5 hours ended up taking 10+ hours ( I finished the book long before we touched down!) It didn't go into enough detail nor did it neatly tie all the \\"stories' together so that the reader could put it to use in his or her life.I would like to see the author revisit this book as it was written almost 7 years ago. He could easily expand it and delve into more of the details.It opened my eyes and has made me more interested in applying the \\"hypotheses\\" he has suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easily understood book","review":"The Tipping Point does an excellent job dividing up trends into simple explanations and then giving anecdotes that support the root of the idea. It is easy to find yourself flying through the pages, nodding along to ideas that seem so blindingly obvious you can't believe you missed them.Be wary though, most of the points made are purely in terms of the author's belief and some examples to back them up. In one instance he quotes a study on separated identical twins and actually misreads the conclusions that the researchers arrived at.But as a book on personal philosophy, and common sense ideas, this book is a great lens to view the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"How self-promotion and excessive behavior start trends","review":"A book about word-of-mouth and how trends get started? Within the tasteful cover and generously-spaced type, is a sophomoric analysis of social dynamics and their possible influences on generating critical mass.Praised by so-called literary elite, the book's authoritive prose gives merit to a 'certain point of view' about social behaviour and overall trends. Beneath the fluff is simply an exercise in book publishing and maximizing profit. Save your shekels."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I don't understand the hype about this book. He states very obvious facts clothing them in fancy buzz words. Also, it is annoying that he repeats the same (not very good) examples over and over to prove his point e.g. the hush puppies, paul revere etc. enough already, we got the point the first time you stated it, and it was not a very good point to begin with!I gave it two stars, since it was good in parts, some concepts like the connectors, external factors affecting trends and events etc. were interesting. but one gets the feeling that none of his ideas are his own, just culled together from various articles and research studies into a shiny marketing package and a catchy title to fool readers into thinking a brand new concept has been created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the New Yorker article instead","review":"Superfically intriguing ideas, better and more concisely (and concretely) expressed in Gladwell's original New Yorker article -- as well as in (heaven forfend) the decade-old academic articles upon which Gladwell's book is based. The book feels stretched, like an article press-ganged into a book by a large advance.As for the ideas themselves ... well, let's just say that pop sociology is like Japanese food -- good fun, but leaves you hungry for something more substantial shortly thereafter. Put another way, connectors and the rest are interesting ideas, but to the extent that they are empirically demonstrable, these are old ideas; and to the extent that some of the things Gladwell talks about are new, they are largely untestable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book spoiled","review":"Gladwell has several fascinating ideas. However the book suffers from poor writing, and from considering many issues closed (ie the theory of Judith Harris on how peers influence children more than parents are presented as Gospel truth) Its a pity, since for The New Yorker Gladwell is a witty, thought-provoking author with a quicksilver intelligence, but in this book he takes 200+ pages to tell us something which can be summarised on a A4 sheet. Actually, what the writing style reminded me most was of a book like \\"Unlimited Power\\" by Anthony Robbins - I think the marketeers have had a heavy influence on the dumbing down. Gladwell's basic thesis - that tiny things not only make big differences, but make the biggest differences - has the makings of a fascinating book - if it was better written and, ironically, didn't take itself as seriously as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read","review":"Most books of this type can have their main theories wrapped up in two or three pages, and spend endless chapters \\"selling\\" a book you've already bought. Gladwell's premises, however, are not just \\"bumper sticker\\" ideas, they are carefully crafted and their limitations are detailed as well. I don't really think of it as a marketing kind of book; more like Social Philosphy. His case studies are compelling, and while some may seem obvious, it is nice to see \\"something you always knew\\" described in such a comprehensive way. After reading the book, I came away with the feeling that we can change things for the better; that a small push in the right direction might do a lot of good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Real Substance","review":"The Tipping Point was a word-of-mouth referral. Once the concept of the three influencers, salesmen, mavens and connectors have been explained, which is right at the beginning of the book, there remains very little of substance.The bulk of the book goes on and on, ad nauseum, with anecdotes which are somehow supposed to demonstrate the concept of a Tipping Point. I get it, I know what a tipping point is, as do most of the readers.What I don't get, and the reason most people buy the book I suspect, is how to create such a tipping point. You will find nothing on this point.Frankly this book reminds me of one of those motivational speakers that has come up with three fancy ex post metaphors, weaves it into a presentation and then tries to get us all to buy the \\"new way of doing things.\\" I found it a total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shudda been an HBR piece","review":"Obviously there was/is a lot of hype around this book, so I had very high expectations. I found the premise interesting, but the science isn't there, at least to an extent that warrants all these pages. Thus, the author just seemed to keep repeating himself. I gave up halfway through out of boredom.

A critical phase transition looks the same, whether it is an outbreak that becomes an epidemic, a stock that becomes the next Google, or a symbolic act that unleashes a cultural transformation. There is always a highly turbulent period and then a point of bifurcation . . . and then the shift. Mavens, connectors, salesmen . . . these are the word of mouthers that create the critical mass.

He's a master teacher and synthesizer of complex ideas and (seemingly) disparate trends. Tipping Point is fun to read and you'll learn a great deal from it. I'm shying away from 5 stars, however, because I don't believe there is as much practical application as fans have imagined (or wished) there was. The Tipping Point is more of a post-game wrap-up, showing how ideas, trends travel, but it isn't really going to teach you how to make your idea/product/self into the next big thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the must reads","review":"I've read Outliers and now Tipping Point. Gladwell is entertaining, accurate, interesting, and very intelligent. What wonderful insight.

For, \\"word of mouth\\", is the most important marketing tool- at least for my book sales. I sold more books that any other for my publishing house in November, 2004. All I did was hand out business cards or tell people in stores. The fact that, \\"who you know\\" is also correct.

Maybe it was an overdose of this show called Sesme Street and its mind mapping techniques? or maybe just too marketing for me. The initial parts of the book gathers the interest of the reader and keeps you going.. and then it goes downhill from there when he gets into the details of cases and never tells you what pushed any situation to a 'tipping point'.Sivaji the boss, the new Rajinikant movie, would be a good example of a tipping point. No rationale. Just a mad loyal adoration.I have seen Malcom Gladwell speak in public and he is a darn good thinker..his analogies are good and he is quite obviously articulate. But I cant seem to figure out why maybe he didnt quite hit the 'tipping point' with me on this book.

No, we just didn't do what had to be done to reach the TP.And of course if something doesn't spread, well, it just didn't reach the TP did it?Superficially profound, it is profoundly superficial.

He then attempts to magically weave them together into a kind of Unified Theory of group behavior. His assertions are suspect, not based on fact. ALso, many times his conclusions do not logically follow from his premises. They may be AN answer, but they are certainly not the ONLY answer.In the end, the author sees patterns where he wishes them to be. Consequently, he develops theories to explain these \\"patterns\\" and almost embarassingly attempts to explain the workings of the entire world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already.......","review":"Obviously I am in the minority here - but I was sorely disappointed in what I read of this book.As a Sociology Major I was excited and all aquiver to read this facinating book.

I feel the information in this book shouldn't be taken at face value, though: if you want to base any business decisions on the information in this book, you should check and double-check everything, because there's more than one way of interpreting facts and figures. Still, a very entertaining read: I'm glad the book was recommended to me and glad that I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientific optimism","review":"For every major thing, you can go backwards and determine the little things that made it happen. This gives the reader a false impression that their meandering day-to-day lives have real impact in the world.

What the author fails to account for is that for every little thing that turns into a big thing, there are billions of little things that amounted to nothing.So, do you enjoy playing the lottery? If you do, you will enjoy this book. If you think playing the lottery is a waste of time and money, you probably will see the primary fundamental flaw in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm Gladwell.

I am surprised that although I have seen the book quoted umpteen times, I have not seen its findings touted as much (max 150 number people circle, etc). I think its concenpts could be great for marketing people who could depend on 'connectors', 'mavens' and 'salesperson' concepts to extend the reach of their marketing arm with minimal effort/cost. However, the book introduces a significant knowing-doing gap for the average reader.

But, if it isn't science it's art. Not art in the sense of a literary masterpiece, but art in the sense that Gladwell nails down the way we make decisions, explains it in readable terms and creates a map we can follow to replicate the process.As someone who has made a living in marketing communications, I've found this the best, most accessible explanation of what we attempt to do in marketing a product or service. Gladwell also makes it clear why our efforts are successful or not as the case might be.Much of this is old news, but no less useful for being made accessible.\\"The Tipping Point\\" will make you a more effective marketer or a more savvy consumer.

That's the lesson of \\"The Tipping Point.\\" Want to lower crime in New York? You could address all problems of poverty and alienation. Or you could just clean up graffiti and start arresting people who pee in the street. Gladwell's premise, which he states interestingly and for the most part convincingly, is that small social cues, linked with group effects, can produce major social changes. The book can be read in an evening, and offers an interesting departure from conventional wisdom. My only complaint is that Gladwell's analysis overlaps considerably with the study of memetics, which he unaccountably doesn't mention. But this is a quibble.

My overall opinion is that the two are too similar and that either by itself is interesting, but both together are not too interesting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"When reading reviews, I think it's important to take the reviewer's background into consideration. Having said that, I think the book was shallow but I have studied social psychology for years so many may or may not agree with me. Like other reviewers have noted, the book is more along the lines of a protracted magazine article rather than anything really substantial. It was a nice overview of some famous social experiments but I thought my head was going to explode after he repeatedly referenced Hushpuppies and extrapolated on STDs for the nth time. On the bright side, I was hoping for an interesting tidbit to investigate further for a dissertation topic and I found it when he mentioned Robin Dunbar's anthrolopogical studies on the social brain so I'm delving further into that now. Side note: the audio version uses a very dreary narrative voice (the author, I think) with a slight attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome and Repetitive","review":"Tipping Point is a painful book to read, painful especially to contemplate the patchwork of fill that turns what at best is a pop magazine article into a poor excuse for a book. Gladwell stabs at any theme he can possibly use to support his by no means new theory of tipping points. He hits one, perhaps, when he covers Rudy Giuliani's results in the City of New York, buts the rest are paler attempts. His comparison of Paul Revere with Dawes is over-romantic and downright silly. There's something profoundly patronizing about his tone of writing and his lack of any kind of wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasure to read","review":"Malcolm puts together a very interesting read. He has done plenty of research on the topics he addresses, and does a fine job of connecting them. Tipping Point has helped add a level of awareness to my everyday viewing the world and the choices/trends around us.Malcolm Gladwell discusses and breaks down different social habits of people, and makes me want to work on changing some minor things about myself.I do not think all of the conclusions are perfectly reasonable or well connected, but this book is still deserving of 5 stars in my mind because of every 20 books I read there are usually only 1 or 2 this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived And Artifical","review":"Mr. Gladwell's ideas are really not all that original: many are based on old sociology academic work.

I agree with the negative reviews below. The author's premise doesn't really add up, and he seems to make so many suppositions (none of which are supported by footnotes, and many of which seem like a stretch to me) that I just don't buy how he tries to piece it all together. This is not a great scientific study of this supposed cultural phenomenon, \\"the tipping point,\\" and I don't really buy into the practicality or reality of such a concept in the first place. Buy at your own risk. I did not like this book at all. I did, however, read his other book, \\"Blink,\\" and thought that was much more interesting and compelling. This book was just too implausible and is overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gladwell 's point?","review":"What was Gladwell's point? I found the information in his book actually quite obvious and mundane. The study which the Danish scientist did is factually incorrect regarding HIV transmission occurring centuries ago and coming back to haunt us and that people actually get more venereal diseases when they sleep with bisexual men, promiscuous men in summer months, wow there is nothing new there.I was not terribly impressed I could give and exhaustive critique but I will pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tippping Point","review":"After having read \\"Blink\\" which I found absolutely fasinating this book was a disappointment. For me, there was nothing new in the book that I had not discovered myself or read about previously and it wasn't a different perspective on how the public or society reacts; word of mouth or the power of knowing the right person to give the important message to such as Paul Revere getting the credit vs Dawes. As to that point there may be some historical inaccuracy and the conclusions that Gladwell made regarding why we know Revere and not Dawes are based on some assuptions that Gladwell made rather then a detailed study. What Gladwell is good at, is taking research that others have conducted and explaining it to the general public. This book was a bit too simple and basically a re-write of other people materials and a poor one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Loved this book, and I'm certainly not a numbers person.

His books have introduced new words into the language--even if he didn't coin them himself, he will get the credit for capturing the public's attention like Al Gore did with global warming. It is easy to see how this science writer worked for a number of prestigious publications; Gladwell can deftly break down complex material into bite-sized morsels that any layman can understand without being condescending to others more in the know, and does so with an infectious (pun intended) enthusiasm. He covers a lot of ground that the math-nerd in me found riveting and I was eager to discuss what I took away from this book. Although he weaves together a number of previously unrelated theories with ease, he doesn't dive too deeply; like Wikipedia he gives us a nicely researched jumping off point for further exploration. At least now I know I'm a Maven..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I found parts of the book to be pretty interesting. I do think there's probably some merit to Gladwell's discussions about The Law of the Few and the Stickiness Factor etc. I liked the business examples of how products like Hush Puppies and Sesame Street tipped. But Gladwell spends too much time on human behavior like smoking and suicide etc. But I think there's a difference human behavior like smoking and chosing between numerous products to settle on Hush Puppies. I was disappointed because I thought The Tipping Point was about how make a product or service more popular not an extensive and exhaustive study of human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"The book took a little while getting to me but it was in great condition like they said it would be in when it did eventually reach my doorstep.

Most importantly - what starts and sustains fads and buzz - this is of great importance for the common business person as well as government officials.Although I found it in the business section - the underlying concepts are valid on a much wider scale. This is so because human behavior is the primary force that results in the phenomena called the Tipping Point.The matter could have been condensed - but once you start getting the essence of what the author is trying to stay, you may be able to skip certain paragraphs and go through the book faster.

It in fact does nothing of the sort and is actually just an amusing collection of stories.It is well written as a social history, and has a light, journalistic style good for dipping into, but the reader is left absolutely none the wiser as to why any of it happened. I would therefore class it as pretty much a waste of anyone's time.One thing that particularly annoyed me about this book is that chaos theory - a branch of mathematics almost 40 years old, for the analysis and prediction of exactly the sort of thing this book is wondering about - is mentioned only once: as a footnote.That's like writing a book about why planets stay in orbit around the sun, and mentioning astrophysics as an aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a social scientist","review":"Fluff, pure fluff.

In the process of building his case, however, Gladwell takes us on several fascinating journeys into the world of behavioral research. I found both aspects of the book to be fascinating reading.Figuring out how to bring something to its tipping point is hard. Few have done it successfully on purpose.

For example, Dutch researched Jaap Goudsmit proposed that a pneumonia outbreak in the 1950's amongst premature infants in Sweden was caused by underlying HIV infections. This \\"idea\\" is completely untested and is not accepted by mainstream scientists. Goudsmit makes an extraordinary claim which is not supported by any concrete evidence. He has not isolated any portion of the virus from samples drawn from the victims.

It's that the New Yorker magazine for years was a source authority. Now, in the magazine's effort to appear vital, interesting, and compelling, they are eager to support authors whose conclusions are merely speculative-as Gladwell's clearly are.I am grateful to be exposed to ideas like these. I would be far more grateful if there was more rigor attached to his conclusions. Instead, I am left with the sense of ideas that may or may not be signficant, and with the sense that I wished the new New Yorker and its best writers were more like the old ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tipping Point Tips","review":"The Tipping Point does a good job of focusing on the fundamentals shared between things that spread like wildfire- viral infections, ideas, and trends. In particular, three aspects of transmission are explored- word of mouth, stickiness, and context. The research disclosed about these aspects is solid and useful.Unfortunately, the author makes some major philosophical mistakes towards the end of the book. At one point, he implies that because people take context into account in their decisions they are somehow less consistent and less virtuous for doing so. At another point, he assumes that people are like paper clips in front of a magnet, able to be manipulated any which way by marketing or other influences. The truth is that given more information, people may make different choices.I'd recommend reading the first five chapters (about 75% of the book) to get the best parts of the book, with a minimum of the bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"tipping point","review":"I enjoyed the book very much.

There are some interesting anecdotes throughout the book. However, the general thesis does not seem well supported by the specific examples. There are numerous factual errors and claims unsupported by the data he cites. In addition, there are a large number of conclusions drawn from data that seems to support the opposite conclusion. Much of the book is devoted to providing new names to common behaviors and activities and then attempting to justify the notion that some new truth has been discovered. I think Ross Johnson, erstwhile CEO of RJR said it best, Gladwell has provided with numerous BGOs (Blazing Glimpse of the Obvious).What I find especially puzzling is the tremendous popularity of this book and his subsequent book \\"Blink.\\" I certainly am not interested in reading anything he writes in the future.There are far better ways to spend 4-5 hours of your life than reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For Marketers","review":"This book should become required reading for marketing professionals. While an interesting read from a social studies perspective, The Tipping Point reveals how big-time marketing campaigns can be a lot less important than more creative word-of-mouth and viral marketing techniques. Gladwell uses numerous examples from history, health care epedimics and the world around us to illustrate how making a product or message 'sticky' can be far more important than spending a lot of money on traditional advertising. I loved the illustration regarding Paul Revere, as well as the description of the chapters on the power of context. Maybe I liked this book because Gladwell proved that my instincts regarding really good marketing are true; we all love to be proved right. Good marketing is more a function of creativity and good testing, and not how much money you spend. The book also is easy reading and makes great dinner and cocktail party conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this condition \\"used:very good\\"?","review":"Be weary of the description this company uses. The book I purchased was not what I would describe as \\"very good\\" condition. There is writing in the book, the cover is dirty and the over all appearance is \\"good\\" at best.

There was also a dark pencil line across the back, which made me doubt how new the book actually was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"I bought this book on the basis of its cover and meant to read it on a flight; there is no way an intelligent, literate person can justify Tipping Point for more than a quick skim. The Hush Puppies example is particularly irrelevant. Who cares about fads? The overlong exposition on why \\"Sesame Street\\" is \\"sticky\\" has no relevance to the book's purpose; it's truly gratuitous. This book really insulted my intelligence. In fact I take umbrage for the benefit of the entire class of literate Americans who deserve something more than this stitched-together re-hash of tired old ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisified!","review":"I ordered this book in early January. As of 2/9/09 I had not received it. A week before that date I had contacted the seller, but got no response. I e-mailed again, and threatened to contest the charge on my credit card.

Has the author ever addressed his ommision??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Society is not that simple","review":"The book is about how little events can trigger major tendencies, leading to social-epidemics.As you can expect from books that explore social behavior, the author tries to convince you that his theory can explain human conduct and, thus, modify it. He deals with such diverse issues as crime, teenage smoking, education and other critical subjects. He tries to point out the little events that can change them but do not expect great insights, just \\"tips\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tipping Point","review":"I haven't read this book but, I will. I would like to explain a tipping point that shows how this works.... Reaganomics, the idea that people with money should get all the breaks, so they can trickle down their wealth to the lower class. This got Reagan elected twice, and the Bush's elected 3 times. Even with the crash of the economy this year the Conservative Right were still preaching tax breaks for these idiots. Reagan was the pitch man, Baker, the Maven and Milton Friedman the idea man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fluff","review":"This book has no substance. There is one central idea - if a phenomenon reaches a certain critical mass, it will grow exponentially. Gladwell then \\"backs up\\" this idea with anecdotal fluff that is mildly entertaining, but a waste of the reader's time. If your'e interested in viral marketing or similar ideas, read \\"The Anatomy of Buzz\\". It has far more substance.Gladwell's success lies in knowing what people want to believe and finding a gimmicky way to title his books. His new book \\"Blink\\" tells us that snap decisions are better than considered ones. I should have applied that to the purchase of this book. Every time I scanned it in a bookstore, I thought it wasn't worth reading beyond the introduction. Finally I bought it. I read it, and made a snap decision. It's the only book I've returned to the bookstore in 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've been a magazine article","review":"Gladwell makes a few vague connections and comes up with some interesting points, and then fills the balance of the book with fluff and name dropping (it could've been written in 28 pages instead of 280.) This would've made a good feature article in a magazine, but a complete book it should not be."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this book","review":"dozens of fascinating stories and theories about why ideas travel the way they do: why one idea will die an obscure death, while another--maybe no better, intrinsically, than the first--will catch fire and inspire enormous change. we tend to think that ideas spread in some mysterious, unpredictable way, but it turns out that even national trends can often be traced back to just a few people with strange, unusual, wonderful qualities, or to tiny, clever adjustments in how a message is communicated. there's a terrifically interesting chapter on how Sesame Street was created (communications theorists scrutinized every minute of the show to see what held kids' attention and what didn't), another one on why attempts to prevent teenage smoking have all failed, and a third part about how even something we think of as entirely private and self-determined--suicide--can in fact spread through a society like a virus. can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"really interesting book,","review":"This was a really interesting book which was an easy quick read.

The author's Outlier is much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the point??","review":"If this book has a point, it is one of no significance of how these ideas can be applied, harnessed or can be useful in any shape or form. IF you appreciate random thoughts that now in the light of hind-sight and the present can be translated and shaped to mean something, then this is a book for you. I would not recommend it, if you have nothing else whatsoever to read or do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read if you enjoyed Blink","review":"I find Malcolm Gladwell's writing style inviting, and his anecdotes excel at showing ordinary everyday interactions from a viewpoint that questions most assumptions.This book, The Tipping Point, presents an original way of understanding what causes social phenomenon to tip, or to spread into a larger-than-life social context. The most interesting ideas for me were the sections on the power of context. Too often complex social problems are tackled and solutions attempted without a good understanding of the nature of why the problems exist in the first place. Hence, elaborate solutions fail to cause meaningful change and the attempts become the solutions themselves causing one to lose sight of the goal. The power of context gives the problem solver a virtual pulley-system to use which allows big problems to be tamed by small changes. One needs only to discover where to make the change."},{"rating":"1","title":"clever self-marketing at work","review":"This publisher is clearly benefiting from having a splash-page blurb -- I'm sure it's getting lots of clicks -- but take a careful look at the sample pages before you buy. We got suckered in -- what author doesn't want to know more about selling his or her own book? -- but there's really not much here. Buzz is one thing, but having a quality product to create a buzz about is even better. This book is a perfect example of the former without the latter. Without some sort of underlying substance, buzz is just a lot of noise. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want to keep reading the same thing page after page...","review":"you get the gist of the whole thing in the first couple of chapters...later on its the same thing over and over and over... to know what really tipping point is, please pick up this book, you will know it when you drop it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This is a wonderful little book. Thought-provoking, very interesting and entertaining - all at the same time. What I liked most about it is that it challenges the conventional ways we think and makes us look at things from a totally different perspective. I've already recommended it to several friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept but a simplifed view of life in general","review":"I liked this book a lot. However, its repeative and it's a bit oversimplifed. People are not just one of three catagories, but each of us are some of all of them. However it a good way to frame a discussion if you are into marketing of ideas or things.What is interesting is how often folks ignore the feedback that they get from early adopters. This book clearly says that what they say and who they talk to will ultimately determin the fate of your idea or concept.And the sales of this book itself are a good example of the tipping point principle. First a few, then some more, and then an explosion of sales. Harry Potter is another example of this. Clearly though these books would not have taken off if there wasn't any substance behind them.Anyway, one reading is enough, so a used copy is probably worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tipping Point","review":"A good and interesting read, explaining the phenomenon of the social epidemic.

Skillfully written with numerous anecdotal examples, this book is a compelling read. Although I was not fully convinced, I remain fascinated by the impact of mavens, connectors, etc. introduced in this book. I recommend this book along with the author's newer book,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinkingif you are open to new options and willing to evaluate them with reflection, research or execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for anybody","review":"First of all, this book is very well written. It catches the reader's interest immediately and makes it hard to put it down. Gladwell uses a lot of interesting studies to support his findings. What I find most compelling about the book is that it's a fun read for anybody. Whether you're in advertising, sales, marketing, sociology or just like reading: This book is fun to read, engages your mind and will have you think about it for a long time afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and engaging read","review":"Malcolm Gladwell has a wonderful gift for discussing social processes in an accessible tone and language. In this book, he draws on a fascinating collection of cases concerning the mass diffusion of certain phenomena. The reading is very engaging and enjoyable.One shortcoming is that at a deeper level, there is no overarching theory that really explains why any particular phenomenon takes off and another doesn't. That is, while we know a tipping point is necessary, it is not clear why in some cases events lead up to a tipping point while in other cases they don't. So while entertaining and informative, the description of the various cases does not add up to an overarching explanation, which is somewhat frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen","review":"The most significant item to come from Tipping Point was the identification of three types of people - Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. Very insightful information here that has real world application especially for marketers looking to have a word of mouth phenomenon. For the most part the examples given throughout the book of tipping points for various situations were great. Felt the book started to drag a bit at the end, however would still recommend the Tipping Point. If you like Tipping Point, also check out Gladwell's Blink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, well thought out","review":"This is a great book that shows how small, seemingly insignificant things can add up to something significant; or how something which on the surface appears rather mundane can serve as a catylist in a great discovery. Sometimes the connections between the \\"insignificant\\" and \\"significant\\" are so incredible that Gladwell's book almost reads like a work of fiction. And it makes it all the more incredible when you realize that you are reading non-fiction.The Tipping POint is a well written, well thought out book and a must read for history, science, and sociology junkies.Another book (which is a work of fiction) I enjoyed that shows the significance of seeming small, everyday actions isChristmas Gifts, Christmas Voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Great insights and Stories!","review":"I am glad to see that this book is still on the bestseller list. And why not! It is filled with great insights and stories. I particularly liked the 150 rule, which states that in any organization once you reach 150 people, you should start a new division independent of the other ones. This rule allows for each division to work closely like a family, enhance communication within the division and achieve great results.Also his story about the Broken Window theory and how it reduced crime in New York subway system is very encouraging. I think we can all apply this concept to our own problems at work and at home. Broken Window states that by resolving small issues we may end up solving bigger problems. Study this book carefully and apply its lessons.I recommend this book highly to organizational leaders, which includes parents since they are the head of the family organization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Smells Here","review":"Look, every time someone writes an objection to this book, someone else writes a lengthy--and annoynomous tribute that appears to be the work of a professional. It seems to me that it is not only casual readers who are contributing their comments here, but publicists and promoters. As an earlier critic pointed out, this book is being pushed mightily by its publisher, who invested heavily in it. Making this a best seller is job number one for these folks, but as many commenters have noted, few serious professional critics have taken more than passing notice of this book. (Rather than reading the isolated blurbs offered here, I suggest readers turn to the full text of reviews appearing in, for example, the New York Times and Salon.) It seems to me that someone is making sure that any criticism of Tipping Point on this site is blotted out by a stream of raves. This is neither fair to the reader nor, for that matter, really honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much repetition","review":"I am not sure why all the good reveiws about this book. I found it quite repetitive. It talked about Sesame Street and used so much child behavior examples that it became very boring. I was waiting for him to give me a reason for reading this book, but it didn't happen. I think the book would have been much better if it were about half as long and cut out the repetition. Give us some examples of adult research as well. I must say that there were a couple of small portions of this book I did enjoy, but not much. I have his other book \\"Blink\\" I hope I didn't waste that money as well.

It was interesting to read about a different view of a common story (Revere's Ride, and why he was successful). I like to analyze personalities and what makes people who they are, and Gladwell did just this. By classifying people into three categories, he was able to break down fads by the people who spread them. Gladwell also analyzes the success of certain presentations by their \\"stickiness\\" factor. This, I thought, was extremely intriguing; he studied childrens' behavior and deciphered their body language to formulate the perfect, \\"sticky\\" childrens show. Even though I don't completely agree with all of Gladwell's conclusions, I respect his process of achieving them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"This book gave my team and I some ideas about how to market ourselves.

Good book for becoming more effective. Great info from a Behavioral Research standpoint. A very quick read. Just very fascinating. A must read.Great insight on word of mouth marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word of Mouth","review":"Perhaps due to the hype surrounding this book, and Malcolm Gladwell generally, I was expecting more from this book. That isn't to say the book was disappointing; in fact the exact opposite is so. However, it did not quite meet my high expectations. But don't let that discourage you.People who work in marketing or advertising are those who will directly take away the most from this book. By embedding the appropriate context in a campaign and targeting the right people, Gladwell explains, and backs up with scientific studies, how products and ideas can spread extremely quickly, like a virus.As Gladwell himself notes, he wasn't quite sure what story he was telling with this book. The Tipping Point, though, grows richer with each new reading, triggering enlightened observations from the readers themselves. It is that effect, perhaps, that brought The Tipping Point to the tipping point, and which also makes it worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explaining the unexplainable","review":"This book, in itself, is an epidemic. It is like the Energizer Bunny: It keeps going and going and going.... Explaining the unexplainable! The author tries his best to explain the frenzy that is, at best, unforeseeable. Predicting \\"The Tipping Point\\" of any social craze is harder to foresee than a meteorologist taking a WAG at when and where it is going to rain. They do not KNOW, they just take a \\"best guess.\\" Whether it be a website, a YouTube video, a book, a stock, the Pet Rock, the Hula Hoop, or anything else, no one can be certain if and when it will take off. The great thing is: those that are lucky enough to get on the bandwagon before everyone else does gets rewarded handsomely for their forethought. Hopefully we all have our chance to start something that hits \\"The Tipping Point\\" eventually or to be involved in one BEFORE the rush starts. Good Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"This is not a good book. The author tries to make the book longer by talking about the same simple idea again and again. Just search on Google and you will get all the ideas in the book. I am not recommending anyone to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listened on Audiobook, fantastic on a long car trip","review":"Very thought-provoking read! Gladwell clearly outlines what the 3 main things that make ideas and products tip. Loved all the real world examples-it makes his lesson applicable to your daily life. Gives you the tools you need to identify how you can make your own ideas tip but it's certainly not a business-y read at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost one of the best...","review":"This is a great book with lots of information about how social epidemics are spread. If you are in a field where reputation matters and word of mouth can make all the difference, you need to read this book.I was a bit put off by the over long discussion on Seasame Street and Blues Clues, it was almost as if the author was trying to stretch things out to make the book longer. This is the only complaint I have on this book and what keeps it from getting five stars.The section on the \\"Law of the Few\\" is probably the best and offers the best insight, although the \\"Power of Context\\" chapters are solid too.There are a number of other exercised included that will lead to ahas, wows and a few chuckles too. A great read for marketing types and those interested in how fads/trends spread.If you like Harvey Mackay, Harry Beckwith and/or Pat Williams, you will most likely like Gladwell too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at what makes trends grow and who makes 'em trendy","review":"I readThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differenceexpecting lengthy description of historical change and the causes of broad, global trends--not totally unlike Jared Diamond. Instead, there are a ton of interesting examples in business, marketing, entertainment and disease. I don't believe Gladwell's book is a theory so much as an actual description of natural phenomena broadly applicable anything that catches the eyes and ears of a group. It's 300 pages are always concise and engaging. If you're a smoker, it will make you rethink why you began smoking and how you became addicted. If you watched Sesame Street as a kid, you'll understand more on that. And if you ever wore popular shoes, there is new insight into how corporations brand fringe-groups' footwear into behemoths available at ever local mall.Far more than his newer, more popular book, this one will actually make you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faded in and out...","review":"While the first two chapters were extremely interesting, I felt that Gladwell would elaborate for too long on his examples of tipping points.

Take the author's slam on Sesame Street vs. Blue's Clues for example. He notes that kids scored better on problem-solving after some watched Blue's Clues and and some watched Sesame Street.No kidding?? Really?? Could that be because problem solving is the sole focus of Blue's Clues?? Have the kids recite the alphabet or test their grammer skills afterward. Hmmm....Basic cause-and-effect....nothing more.

But after the 2nd chapter, it was hard to continue reading. The anecdotes were interesting and I could see the points he was trying to make. But I felt like I was reading a college student's final paper who, in trying to get a point across, takes a psychological study and says, \\"this study shows why my theory is right\\". I would have been more sold on his theories if he did his own studies to make his point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is this guy?","review":"What a thinker! The tipping point is that focus around which, trends, whether in fashion or technology explode into the mainstream.

He's a journalist, not a scientist, so hard evidence is not what you'll find in his book. Mostly theory, but justified and well thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting and Thought Provoking","review":"I found this book to be more than an interesting read. I came away from it with new ideas, and how the things that make a difference might not seem to be so big, until that word of mouth, and how far that travels, bringing sometimes positive revolutions among humanity.This is a great book if you are interested in seeing the difference something can make at a grass roots level.It's a great book to see how small changes can and do have a lasting and positive impact, many times for many generations.I recomend this book.

Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated. He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory. Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parts Greater Than The Whole","review":"A fascinating compendium of research that doesn't necessarily seem to support the conclusion that Gladwell proffers. I enjoyed the research reporting but found myself with question after question as these disparate elements are then weaved into an arcing theory that seems a bit untenable as it stands. Gladwell may be correct in his assertions but the argument as presented here was less than a clincher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subjective Science?","review":"I had high hopes for the book, and had spoken to others who had heard good things about it. However, it just didn't do it for me. Reading the author's subjective input on topics discredits the message he is attempting to convey to the reader, even after he has spent whole chapter giving sub-par data and information. It seemed as though the only data which mattered to the author was the data which proved the point he was attempting to make.In short, I would not recommend this book. After I was about halfway through I was ready to quit, but I finished it just in case it might happen to improve; it did not. The author's opinion on social matters and subjectivity in regards to research were enough to turn me away from this book and any other book he has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"This is a very interesting and informative book, It makes you to think a little differently about how information spreads and things get done.

I have read elsewhere that Mr. Gladwell 's theories have fallen somewhat out of style, and have been outright dismissed as being too light, or painted in too broad a stroke to be taken seriously.I disagree. The writing is wonderfully accessible. The examples relevant and timely.This book is well worth the time and intellectual effort of anyone who wants to explore different perspectives on what fuels the advent of all sorts of social trends.Got something to sell?

Gladwell asserts that there are three types of people who have the capability to produce a social epidemic: mavens, connectors, and salespersons. I thought Gladwell took a creative approach in his arguement and his examples used to support it are extremely well thought out and articulated. Gladwell is widely considered one of the best (THE best in my opinion) writers within this genre.If you are looking for something interesting I highly recommend this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"I always wanted to know a little about Epidemiology!","review":"This book is great!

Gladwell examines issues and subjects that have led to setting trends. He explores various subjects from history to sociology within a case study format that relate to his premise of the promotion of an idea or message by \\"word of mouth\\".THE TIPPING POINT is by no means an intense scientific study. However, it is an interesting study on how small ideas have drawn few followers, and later attracted a wider audience. Gladwell emphasizes the power of communication, and the appropriate channels that help to \\"spread the word\\" -- connectors, mavens, and salesmen.THE TIPPING POINT raises interesting points that may allow readers to further ponder. It may also inspire those who may have innovating ideas that they would like to share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"\\"The Tipping Point\\" by Malcolm Galdwell takes a look at various social phenomena and examines the how and why of their success. Gladwell uses examples from the rise in popularity in Hush Puppies (yes, the shoes) to the decline of crime in New York (yes, the city). In examining the \\"tipping point,\\" he discusses his research on how a fashion statement by a few can become a national trend, or how seemingly simple changes in law enforcement can affect urban crime rates.

As someone who is very involved in sales and working with customers to adopt new concepts and ideas the idea of Tipping Point is fascinating to me. However, the book did not deliver any depth or explanation of the concept of Tipping Point.This book is a collection of examples and clever stories around the idea of social epidemics and trends. The book provides us with many specific examples of trends the author associates to Tipping Points. I found these examples to be entertaining and made for good dinner conversation. The book does not however provide much insight and exploration into Tipping Point. I kept waiting for the author to bring it all together in a consumable and usable way, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn for the brain","review":"Like another reviewer pointed out, this book is filled with junk analysis. It's very short on analysis and very shallow on depth. It's just filled with a lot of anecdotes on a popular theme and never makes any assertions or logical conclusions.

Malcolm Gladwell does for social studies what Jim Cramer does for stock market research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was wrinkled","review":"The book that I bought was new, and was a gift for my husband's boss.

To me, both appear redundant but this book has more interesting theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now part of our culture","review":"I just read this book now, 3 years after it was published, and after I was through the first chapter I became aware that TV and Radio news columnists were using the phrase \\"tipping point\\" all over the place. Selective awareness on my part, or is the book becoming a self fulfilling prophecy of itself? Seriously, this book will make you think about all types of issues, fads, trends, and makes me feel compelled to do the 'little things' in my own small environment to see if I can change the world! (maybe my little review will help!)If you are interest in people, or why things happen, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A half-baked rehash of other people's ideas","review":"It's not that Gladwell has taken so many other ideas and mixed them, context-less, into one volume, it's that he takes credit for them that is so galling. If you want to be entertained and read about strange attractors, read Connie Willis' outstanding Bellwether. If you want to learn something about the subject, pick up any book on basic chaos theory.The afterward, comprised entirely of shameless self-promotion, is particularly offensive. Gladwell is the Michael Crichton of pop sociologists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A question (while joining positive reviews).","review":"How, when and where did the present \`scooter' craze start? Is then a second edition on its way with the answer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This might have appealed to me in college.","review":"Not a book for thinkers, but rather a tome for those who prefer to be told how to think, what's important, what's profound. If you are an intelligent reader, I suggest you pass on this bloated attempt at insight. In addition to being trite, the book is poorly written, almost like a term paper: a, b, c, d; with little journalistic asides of the most pedestrian kind. Those of you who have favorably reviewed this book should stop to examine your powers of discrimination and original thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfounded and unproven","review":"While the whole idea of tipping point is quite interesting and captivating, having 294 pages of unfounded concepts, mostly unanswered questions and overall poor cohesion was irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tipping Point","review":"Awesome book everyone should read. In fact it is a must read. Recommend it be read in all business schools and classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Baltimore Consort Romp","review":"This album is yet another early music collection by this group, and the phrase \\"yet another\\" should be taken to indicate joy rather than resignation. Twenty-two tunes come on this disc, whose theme is billed as Entertainment Music of Elizabethan England. Four are songs, the rest are purely instrumental -- some familiar, such as My Lord of Oxenfords Maske and Robin is to the Greenwood Gone, with perhaps a few more obscure pieces here and there. As always with these individuals, the performances are exquisite. Another reviewer praised the disc but complained that it pretty much sounded like many another release by this ensemble, recommending other albums from their catalog instead. I won't dispute that person's principal assertion, though I'd note that personal favorites do tend to be, well, personal. If you've not sampled the Baltimore Consort before, this disc is in my view not such a bad place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was expecting a lot more than just 20 minutes of (relatively) poor quality news comment/coverage of Grace Kelly's funeral.

If you have any expectations of using the digital copy in iTunes, you will not be able to do it. UltraViolet is an online streaming service.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT A REAL DIGITAL COPY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been great of it weren't for the digital copy nonsense","review":"Why in the works would Warner brothers release a digital copy that is not compatible with the most popular music service in tHe world iTunes? What a huge mistake and by the looks from the reviews on here I'm not the only one. Don't mess with the digital copy! If its not broke don't fix it. No more Warner brothers titles till they fix this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy and Playstation download - Hoax","review":"I know some people are already commenting on the Digital Copy issue with the movie which is horrendous not to mention a security issue that I am trying to address with Amazon not to mention the Wi-Fi requirement. The other issue is the Playstation download of the Batman/Sinestro suit for Arkham City. There is NO code on the back. It has the insructions but no code. Amazon's response is just to return the DVD and they will send another but that does nothing to solve the issue of the digital copy nor does it help with the code for the game. Does anyone know another place to get this with a genuine digital copy and that might NOT have the issue with the Playstation code."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good start for a favorite DC hero","review":"First, I own the non-3D extended-version. As with any movie, it could have been better. The special effects were amazing, and I loved the 'making of' features on the disk. Ryan Reynolds did a great job as Hal/Green Lantern, I must give him credit for that. The writing of his character was a bit loose, though. Blake Lively was excellent as Carol Ferris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainly kid oriented","review":"I watch other movies of this kind with my 16 y.o. son, but this is the most 'weak' and younger kid oriented in my opinion amongst those we watched together."},{"rating":"2","title":"green lantern","review":"this is a fun movie for the whole family great special effects and some moral issues for thought it's great to be able to escape into make believe for a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lied to about the Digital Copy","review":"Supposedly this comes with a Digital Copy. However, it does not. I know others have already mentioned this, but I was so furious I had to write my own review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Much","review":"I rented this film primarily because Ryan Reynolds was in it. That turned out to be its only selling point. This movie is a special effects bonanza, but for the first time, I found them distracting. Character development was minimal and I can actually remember very little of the story. I am glad I didn't invest in owning this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended cut","review":"Now, I didn't see the theatrical version as it was bombarded with bad reviews. Not a single positive thing about the movie. I watched the extended version and well, I find the movie a total opposite of the reviews. Now, I'm not a GL fan, I'm a fan of movies that's well made, and this is one of them (extended cut). I didn't think it was rushed nor the SFX was cartoonish. Yes, I agree that it should have been a longer movie to get more action and character development but the movie was good enough on it's own pace. As usual, like the first Iron Man, there wasn't a lot of action scenes but still it was good. I'm getting this on BD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining movie","review":"This was an entertaining movie that could have used more science fiction and less romance. Growing up with comic books, it's been a great few years seeing production companies promoting Marvel and DC superheroes to the big screen. Reynolds is a good Green Lantern, but I feel they're bending the character to his persona versus the other way around. CGI is good and storyline was informative to the GL newcomers. The story has been set for number 2, so hopefully producers make the most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No iTunes Digital Copy","review":"I like buying BluRays that come with an iTunes copy, I get the HD BluRay and then the iTunes copy which is easy to add to iTunes and then effortlessly works on AppleTV or any iOS device. I'll pass on any BluRay that comes with an UltraViolet copy and just buy my digital copy directly from iTunes. Oh yeah, saw the movie in the theater, AWESOME movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"After reading so many depressing reviews, I had to add my two cents.

Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra Violet is Horrible...","review":"Ultra Violet is horrible.

Ultraviolet a SCAM!!!","review":"I mistakenly bought this thinking I was getting a Digital copy. I now know I was scammed.Now that I know what they are trying to sell, I will NEVER buy another DVD with the Ultraviolet.Somebody needs to tell WB that this a big management mistake, along the lines of New Coke and Netflix raising rates by 60%. Netflix's decision cost them 70% of their market value. Here's hoping WB has an equally painful lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie worth a rental, ultraviolet digital copy is horrible","review":"While the movie is a passable version of the GL universe, the ultraviolet digital copy is virtually worthless. You can't transfer the UV copy to itunes unless you rip the DVD on your own. If you want an itunes compatible digital copy then you're pretty much out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"WB not GL","review":"Wow... WB has issues.

This is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet Digital Copy is a disappointment","review":"I specifically choose Blu-Rays that have digital copies so I can load them on my iPod. The Ultraviolet digital copy is unlike any of the others I have purchased and I found it extremely frustrating trying to load it onto the player. This technology is not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh and digital copy","review":"This movie did not live up to my expectations. Compared to movies like Thor and X-men First Class it has little that resembles a plot.If you love CGI, this movie has a lot of that. If you want to watch an actual movie and not simply a compilation of CGI with dashes of a storyline, you are SOL.If you are still curious, save the $25 on this DVD combo and rent the movie. IF you decide to buy the blue ray combo for the digital copy please note that this copy IS NOT COMPATIBLE with iTunes.... rather they make you join flixter. How the @@@ do I watch the movie if I have no internet connection say during an airplane trip you monkeys?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was okay","review":"From all the negative reviews before even seeing the movie, I honestly thought I was going to hate this. I wouldn't say that I am in love with this movie but I did enjoy myself. My fiance loves Green Lantern and he loved this movie so much he put it on his Christmas list. The effects are a little hokey but considering the story, I would say give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Lantern","review":"I know critics did not like this movie, but I thought it was a great super hero movie. I love super hero movies and this one had everything a good super hero movie needs. It has a great hero , who has alien contact. He turns from a regular guy into a great hero. Then. He accepts the duty to save the universe. After some great action he wins . Critics I think always gives super hero movies a hard time. I think this movie is one they wrongly reviewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy Not Compatible with iTunes","review":"This release of Green Lantern claims you get a digital copy of the movie, but instead you are asked to create an account to Flixster which then streams the movie to your device. You don't get an actual copy of the movie that can be stored on your iPhone/iPod/iPad. Streaming doesn't work at 35,000 feet, which is where I typically have the time to watch a movie. There is nothing about this digital copy that is iTunes compatible, so it's unlikely you can stream it to your Apple TV. Overall a big disappointment. I'll have to reassess paying additional money for movies from Warner Brothers that claim a digital copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memories of Green Lantern comes to life","review":"Over the years I have watched other comic book heroes come to life and wondered when and how they could bring Green Lantern to the screen. To generate the mental constructs without looking cheesy always seemed to be the biggest obstacle. Well this movie was mostly faithful to the story line. The constructs were excellent. The aliens in the corp were true to story. This was an excellent origins story, I hope there will be a sequel. The GL suit was a bit overdone, a faint green glow might have been more true to form. An a note to the \\"professional reviewers\\" it's not a magic ring it is tech, it shows a lack of grasp on what you are reviewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Blu-Ray version only!!","review":"I liked this movie. What ticked me off was the crap Ultraviolet digital copy that doesn't work on iTunes or anything else but their crappy service. This is very misleading.

Please stop it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money paying for the \\"digital copy\\"","review":"The digital copy would not work on either my iphone/ipad and I could care less about this flixster thing.

I COULDN'T ACCESS THE DIGITAL COPY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The digital copy that never was","review":"Don't be fooled by the almost fraudulent claim of a \\"digital copy\\" included in this package. It doesn't exist. What you get is a streamed version of the movie IF (and only if) you download an App (Flixster) & sign up to TWO different subscriptions (Flixster & Ultraviolet) & even then - according to some reports - it may not work.The movie is brainless fun. The packaging is a crafty con job. I returned the item & paid for my copy through iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions gone horribly wrong!","review":"Like a number of reviewers here I bought this combo-pack for the digital movie too. Trying to support the legit ownership of a digital copy. DC Comics and Warner Brothers have failed miserably here with their partnership with Flixster and this so called company UltraViolet. To \\"own\\" your digital copy you must register with Flixster and somehow link an account into the UltraViolet website. After a few days of trying this - complete failure! There must be no one at either company supporting this. We are being forced to support another portal, another format and very few devices (if any) that can play ultraviolet content.Amazon is pretty liberal with their return policies, and I am considering returning this combo-pack.As for the movie - I give it a five star. Its a fun ride. But for this releases utter lack of respect for the consumer a solid one-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet is a massive joke and waste of time","review":"I have hated and despised my Ultraviolet experience. You have to sign-up for at least two accounts (UV and Netflix is my example). Neither of which seems to be able to show me Green Lantern (can't even find it to stream it).

Couldn't Hollywood use SOME OTHER STORYLINE for once?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie bad digital copy.","review":"This movie is great but don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray with digital copy. The digital copy requires you to install third party software and input personnel information just to get the copy. And then it runs on the third party software not via iTunes.

RIP OFF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - \\"Digital Copy\\" Fraud","review":"Movie was better than I thought it would be, however, the \\"Digital Copy\\" is that UltraViolet crap and it doesn't download so it can play on my iPad or iPod. I will NOT buy another blue-ray disk with this bogus Digital Copy come-on. Shame on WB for cheating the public with this. Movie gets 3-4 stars, Digital Copy = 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not actually have digital copy","review":"Beware, the \\"digital copy\\" included with this combo is NOT an actual digital copy. It is access to a STREAMING copy, which you can only watch through Flixter's proprietary player. You can download it, but that's still not a real digital copy. That is still only watchable through Flixter's player on a computer. There is no way to watch the downloaded copy on a tablet or ipod. I wanted to watch it on my tablet, which does not have an internet connection. I paid extra for the combo pack because it was a good value to have a digital copy, only to discover there is no such thing with this combo.If you're buying this because it's a good value to get all three copies, do the math for just the two copies, unless you are okay with having a streaming copy as your third version and not a real digital copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The actors are prettier than the CGI","review":"Terrible writing. The actors do what they can, but their performances are lacking, especially under directing that feels like it's just following the formula. Skarsgaard does the best job.

This movie has things created by the Green Lantern Corps's ring to be mainly human thoughts, making it a little disappointing. I recommend trying the Green Lantern first flight animated movie by DC Universe it is much better and truer to the real Green Lantern.Sorry but this major motion picture was a huge disappointment. The movie was just OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The two biggest problems with Green Lantern...","review":"All great superhero movies have a origin story that has you rooting for the hero before they finally transform into the hero they were destined to become. Superman came to Earth as a child and learned to balance his powers with human kindness. Spiderman over-comes guilt over the death of his uncle to become New York's savior. Here's the first problem with Green Lantern: the origin story is basically \\"Hey kid, here's a magic ring!\\" Boom, we're done. The second problem with the movie is Blake Lively. Yes, she is a beautiful woman but with the incredible ability to slow every scene she's in to a dead stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"item came as promised and speedy. watched it and its as if i got it new. no scrathces or any sign of ware and tair"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Worst Green Lantern movie.","review":"This movie could of been great.

Warner Brothers is now trying to pull a fast one on us consumers thinking that every device we own has the ability to have some type of \\"app\\" and we have wireless everywhere we go. I feel cheated. And I am pissed. To top it off, I thought \\"ultraviolet\\" was just some type of marketing ploy to have some extra features with the digital copy, only to find out it isn't a digital copy at all. I just paid extra to watch a crappy intermittent streaming of a movie on their device of choice, not mine.

I've discovered over the years that those that can't do, critique.I don't think the lead actor portrayed Green Lantern as a silly irresponsible fool. He was dealing with his own very human weaknesses and I appreciated not having him be a one dimensional caricature. I made sure I waited to see the 'real' ending. I could see the train wreck coming and I hope they do a sequel.If you want light, fast paced entertainment watch it. You can't beat Amazon's deal on the rental.

Hal Jordan is nothing like he is in the comics. Who is this goofy, irresponsible person that becomes Green Lantern and eventually (I assume) learns to be responsible? It was painful to watch, and I had no investment in the characters.Maybe it would have been better if I'd never read the comics, so be warned if you're a geek like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel asleep twice - does that tell you something?","review":"i watched this movie expecting a big pile of crap and boy did I get what I thought it would be. As I mentioned in the title I feel asleep twice and then woke up and watched from where I left off and still I dozed off again. The movie is all special effects and despite the hotness of Ryan Reynolds - even his hot body couldn't keep me wanting to see this pile of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GreeN Lantern","review":"A poorly Made Film. Lazy Acting, Cheesy and just plain bad. biggest waist of money, The CG is bad and the decision to basicly turn hall Jordan into Kyle Raynor just highlights what a bad Character Hal Jordan truly Is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Please, avoid this film at all costs. Special F/X were bad, acting and writing were down right pathetic. The movie seemed to be one big rip off from other films such Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Superman and Spiderman, just to name a few. After 5 minutes, you can pretty much predict how the movie is going to end. It's sad that Tim Robbins was in this. The CGI Lantern suit looked horribly fake. They should have put Reynolds in a body suit and just made the chest emblem CGI. All in all a horrible film. Thankfully I didn't pay full price for this. It'll more than likely never be watched again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service","review":"Case was empty. There was no disk inside. Big disappontment when kids opened on Christmas only to find an empty case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like the movie and don't like the way I got the digital copy","review":"The movie is graphically okay but the story is boring. What I really hate is that the digital copy is not through your iTunes or Media account. You have to join Flixster. This is a sucky app. In the past you could redeem your digital copy and it would download to your iTunes account. You then moved your copy over to your iPad or iPhone. You could move things around. Now you have to download it twice and this takes a lot of time. You are allowed to download the video 5 times. Really! Downloading it once was bad enough. When I received the Green Lantern in November I was notified that my digital copy would not be available until December 20. Now - I had to remember to download it. I am NOT buying anymore combo packs. It's way too much trouble. I want my digital copy to be my copy not Flixsht. I don't want to be prompted to have my poor-chase connected to Facebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"what? this movie is NOT bad.","review":"OK Both my wife and I enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch. The bad guy was super evil and cool looking. GFX were really nice. Action was cool enough. What else do you want from a movie with green super hero aliens? Be realistic! anyway, rented and would recommend to anyone that enjoys kicking back to super hero movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good telling of the original green lantern story","review":"went and saw the movie in the theaters. really enjoyed it. thought it was a good telling of how hal jorden got his powers. they did a superb job in choosing the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO UltraViolet","review":"The UltraViolet digital copy included with this film is WORTHLESS! Do not buy films with UltraViolet and force the studio to put this format to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best Super Hero! (2011 Classic)","review":"I have waited a long time for the Green Lantern to be made into a movie. It is my favorite super hero movie of all time. The colors in the film are great. The cast did a good job acting and the movie was a thrill. It is my top movie for the year 2011. I hope they make more Green Lantern Movies. A must have forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very \\"meh\\"","review":"The special effects are good, and the acting is good. But the storyline feels generic, and the dialogue suffers the same. After awhile I began skipping ahead a lot, just to see the predictable ending. There are enough films with great special effects, and good acting, so I cannot recommend anyone spend the time or money watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"My brain hurts.","review":"It was not quite as awful as I had heard, perhaps owing entirely to low expectations. It wasn't as \\"pretty\\" as I am sure they had hoped it would be, and \\"pretty\\" is about all it had going for it. The plot is forgettable, the actors are clearly forcing it, and ... Yeah, that's about it.Buy it if you're a comic book nerd and want to encourage the studios to keep trying. Then stick it at the back of your shelf and watch something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice try DC Comics","review":"Not a bad movie but not in the same category as Marvel's efforts to bring their comics to the big screen. I enjoyed the movie from an entertainment point of view but it wasn't anything special. If a sequel is made I will watch it but I won't buy it - then again you never know - with all the Green Lantern background out of the way (which was hurried in my humble opinion) it may be better than this one. Still worth watching if you are a comic book fan and I am sure kids will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy it for what it is...","review":"There are so much written on it so there is no need to give my review on the movie. It is a great film? no, it is a bad film not really. One has to take into consideration what type of film it is its a movie based on a comic book character. So, if you enjoy the movie & lavish fx then its serve its purpose as long it entertain you for 90 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digitial Copy with Ultraviolet Sucks","review":"Well this movie is a pretty good superhero movie, but the bigger problem is that the Ultaviolet download does not work. It is hard to work to begin with, and then won't let you go through the steps to claim your Digital Copy. Why can't they get rid of Ultaviolet and let us have a digital copy that we can download for our mobile devices. If you have a mobile device that is not connected to the net good luck watching movies with ultraviolet. Now I am going to have to digitize the DVD and add it to my ITUNES library on my own. What a waste. My suggestion is don't pay the extra money for Digital Copy, your throwning you money away. Warner Brothers needs to get this fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy is not compatible with iTunes, iPads, or iPhones","review":"I rarely if ever take the time to write product reviews, but I have to point out that the so-called Digital Copy included with this disc is completely incompatible with iTunes and cannot be downloaded to iOS devices (iPhones, iPads, iPods). The disc requires you to sign up for two obscure services (Flixster and UltraViolet) in order to \\"stream\\" the movie to a third-party app on your device... i.e., you have to be connected to the Internet to view it. There is supposedly a way to download the movie to your computer, but this required installation of yet another software application. I cancelled out of all of these useless installations/services as soon as I realized I needed them to watch the movie.Amazon needs to warn buyers that this Digital Copy is incompatible with iTunes and the very devices the Digital Copy was created to work on. Calling this a \\"Digital Copy\\" is blatant bait-and-switch false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, terrible product","review":"Agree with other reviewers that the \\"digital copy\\" is nothing of the sort. Maybe if they'd said \\"cloud copy\\" or something, it wouldn't be so bad. I often turn to Airplane mode to watch a film with minimal interruptions, and drain less battery. With the awful UltraViolet thing, I have to basically keep my iDevices plugged in and hope my connection stays decent, or I've gotten nothing at all. Definitely won't be buying another UltraViolet movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet Digital Copy","review":"As with some of the other reviewers, I am extremely upset with the new Ultraviolet Digital Copy. It is not a Digital Copy at all, but a way to stream the video over the internet. After some effort, I was able to get the streaming video to work, but the quality of the video stunk. It was not on par with a standard DVD. I have already cancelled my accounts on Flixster so that the Digital Copy is no longer any value to me.My biggest disappointment was that I cannot watch the movie on an iPad unless I am connected to wifi - including on a plane and when I go camping. In my opinion, this is a blatant misrepresentation and I am personally hoping that someone starts a class-action lawsuit against Warner Brothers. This will be the last DVD I purchase with Ultraviolet Digital Copy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIgital Copy not allowed on iTunes ruined this release!","review":"Just like other reviewers the Digital Copy of this release is the WORST experience ever! You can't just download it to iTunes like almost all other digital copies. You have to go through this nightmare of setting up an account with flixter in order to stream to your phone or tablet device. Then when it gives you the option to download to your computer you have to download some adobe flash junk and it still does not allow you to move to iTunes. You have to log in to flixter to view it. I enjoyed the movie and the blu-ray looks and sounds great, but I am sending a clear message to the studio with my 1 star review. They need to include a iTunes digital copy not some hot mess release like this. When we pay extra for the digital copy we expect to work as it always has. So sad what could have been a 4 or 5 star review was messed up due to the HORRIBLE digital copy included on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy a big disappointment","review":"One of the reasons why I buy these Blu-ray combos is the digital copy (for use with my iTunes library and Apple TV) and imagine my disappointment when I realized that the only way you could view the digital copy without streaming via the internet was to download the Flixter application and then on top of that when I tried to view the movie using Flixter (what a ugly piece of software to use) it crashed multiple times to the point where I eventually gave it up as a bad job. So now I have one lonely movie sitting out in Never Land and the rest of my collection in iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - Not A TRUE Digital Copy","review":"This review is based on the package for sale, rather than the movie quality. The package comes with an \\"UltraViolet Digital Copy.\\" What does that mean? It means you will not be able to take the movie with you on your digital devices - you will have to stream it to them whenever you want to watch them. You better have wi-fi or have an unlimited data plan to do that! You can download the movie on your computer, and there it will sit trapped.Had I known it was like this, I would not have paid the extra money for the set with \\"digital copy.\\" I believe a digital copy is something I can take with me (a copy) on my digital devices without having to stream them each time I want to watch them. And I also was not happy that I had to download two separate programs to even be able to download the movie to my computer. I will never purchase a set with \\"UtraViolet\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie but Ultraviolet Digital Copy is a Garbage","review":"Buyer beware... this is not a normal digital copy, this is an attempt to force yet another set of services on customers to further control digital content. Everyone was fine with Windows / iTunes choice... on a few recent discs from other distributors than WARNER BROS i was even able to choose vudu or amazon video as options, very cool... more choice for digital copy is better. this is restrictive and garbage, it is a waste of resources requiring the movie to stream only, and according to many accounts if flat out does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed the Movie, Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks","review":"My wife and I enjoyed the movie (3 - 4 star), but the Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks. It will not work on my HTC Inspire and half the time my copy is not showing on the Flixster website. Hopefully, the new Harry Potter 3D Blu-ray at Best Buy will not have an Ultraviolet Digital Copy. If it does, I might have to pass on buying and just renting the 2D version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay extra for the digital copy!","review":"The Flixster digital copy was difficult to redeem and I still can't get it to play on my laptop. Don't waste your money for the digital copy. I will never buy another digital copy redeemable only with Flikster. If the digital copy isn't ITunes don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A REAL DIGITAL COPY","review":"Though the digital copy is not the biggest thing in buying this movie, I personally like to expand that library as well and well this movie does not provide that. You cannot put it on your phone or use it on any tablet. You can use it on the ONLY PROGRAM it will let you which I hadn't heard about until I bought it. Ultraviolet. And well this program will let you use your other digital copy files, it will not permit you to use the property you bought with any other program. it is not a \\"Digital Copy\\" it is an \\"ULTRAVIOLET digital copy\\" ie. worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word ...Fun!","review":"I loved this movie. I've read poor movie reviews before only to discover after viewing the movie myself that it was entertaining. I took that into consideration after seeing numerous mediocre reviews about Green Lantern. Wow, was I ever happily surprised. It was a fun movie. I hope there's a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE IS A THRILL TO WATCH","review":"The writers did their very best to stay true to the Comic book series of the Green Lantern. It was extreamly well done and the Acting was outstanding. Nothing like the \\"GREEN HORNET\\" which was sorely disappointing in both story and acting. This movie tells the story of the Green Lantern's beginnings and how he came to be and how he saved Earth & the Gallaxy from an evil mennace. The story will catch you up, and not let you go till the very end. I might also add that they left it wide open to a sequeal and if they can get all the original cast back for it, I would look forward to seeing that. I highly recommend this move.The Green Lantern Chronicles Vol. 1.RICK BURK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy - Not Really","review":"I always make it a point to buy discs that include a digital copy that I can import into iTunes and take with me on the road. If this is also what you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. Their \\"UltraViolet\\" digital copy is only available via Flixster and there is NO WAY to import the movie into your existing iTunes library.

Very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra Violet Rip off of Digital copy name","review":"Not much to state but the obvious, the movie was not that great compared to say Captain America the 1st Avenger. The real stinker is this horrible means of a so called \\"Digital Copy\\" - Amazon please have these Studios sell an alternate Blu Ray with the means of a true Digital Copy, one that will store on a Hard Drive, that will transfer to popular devices such as an iPhone, iPads and other portable handhelds (Really seems like Apple doesn't want to play ball). This UltraViolet maneuver is a sham..., marketing, tracking usage, when and where you're viewing and sharing this info with their affiliates. Note that the feature also expires in the future.

It's SUPER SERIOUS like one of the new Nolan \\"Batman\\" movies. Then the Green Lantern uses his powers and it's very silly, like something from \\"Roger Rabbit.\\" A runaway helicopter is settled onto a racecar and a track built in mid-air for it to run along. To fight a giant monster cloud, he boosts up a fuel truck on giant springs and then shoots it with an anti-aircraft gun. A number of the visuals and science feel borrowed from Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" while there are story references to the original \\"Superman.\\" In \\"Superman,\\" though, you know the director really loved the comic book. In \\"Green Lantern,\\" everything feels like they were worried people would think the Green Lantern mythology was too silly and outer space, so they just tried to make it as realistic as possible and never embraced the big cosmic themes and feel.\\"Superman,\\" it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet Digital Copy doesn't fly","review":"Amazon's listing for this title is \\"Green Lantern (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)\\". I don't remember the 'Ultraviolet' being in the listing when I placed my order. In any case, if you read the specifications, this is not a Three-Disc product, there are only two discs in the package and accessing the digital copy requires \\"an Ultraviolet account and a Flixster account\\". I don't need any more accounts floating around in the cloud so the digital copy is a non-starter for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Brothers and Flixster Suck","review":"The movie was very good. However, my review is of the product. After paying extra for a digital copy, I find out that I can only watch it through flixter's crapy app and that it does not down load to iTunes. In order watch in on a mobile device you have to have an internet connection so you can stream the video. It kind of defeats the whole purpose of a digital copy. If you are planning on buying this for the digital copy don't. It is false advertising.

I do nothave a clue who Ryan Reynold is, and that helps watching this movie cause idid not have flashbacks to all the roles Ryan Reynold did which could have affectedthe way i saw him on screen, that was bonus one. Bonus 2 instead of having abad guy with more super powers...we are introduced to a different kind of evil...he has a face...but also lots of tentacles making it quite a monster. hey...monsters that does not have a human body are much better i think.

Hal Jordan is just totally miscast. He was not some irresponsible dolt, but instead was a serious and tense character.The Character of Hector, secondary villain was total unnecessary. His point in the movie was what? So he can read your mind, and throw stuff around like some second class Jedi, no match for anyone. He was just killed off anyway, lame.The whole movie was just too campy. Should have taken a page from the \\"Dark Knight\\" and made a franchise like character out of Green Lantern.

This disc package includes a code to stream the movie to a limited set of devices and only with a network connection. This set DOES NOT include a version that can be played while off-line. To me, that does not meet my expectations of a digital copy. On a related note, I also experienced problems with using the Flixster service to watch my \\"digital copy\\".

They, like all of us, know what is meant by \\"digital copy\\" and they did nothing to differentiate between our assumptions and what they delivered.The movie itself was okay. Its the kind of story that appeals to children and maybe younger teens, so in a lot of ways, you get what you expect from it.

Once the window closes, audio is restored to the film's playback just fine. Contacted Sharp who manufactures my BD unit. No update to firmware since last May.

The Ultraviolet digital copy only lets you stream the movie using wifi to your devices and after signing up for two different services. Worst thing is that you cannot use the movie with itunes and to watch it on an iPad or iPhone you need to be connected through wifi. 3G is just not enough to be able to watch it (in fact, it says you need to connect to a wifi source to watch) and, at least for me, makes the purported digital copy basically worthless. You therefore can't watch, for example, in an airplane or while driving to keep the kids occupied. If I am connected at home I'll use the dvd or blue ray.

Why did the scene with the helicopter take up so much time when it was so lame? Why was there wind in space?Save your money and watch Thor or Captain America again, or wait for the Dark Knight Rises to hit theaters this summer.

It didn't even flow right and the editing was terrible. It was all over the place, and really a bit obnoxious. Based on this version, I still don't understand how or why Hal Jordan was chosen to be the Green Lantern?

That being said expect some bad romance to get in the way of your hard hitting action adventure. I will say that the movie did have some fun (though completely transparent) characters that kids can enjoy. The Blu Ray itself highlights some of the more obvious visual effect flaws with the film including the in ability to create an environment that allowed \\"real life\\" and CGI to look good together.

Thor has the look of an epic fantasy film. Captain America is sort of retro-WW II by the numbers. Green Lantern is an inter-galactic hero.Perhaps one problem people have with the Green Lantern is his powers and their limits are not really well defined.

UltraViolet is no great deal for consumers and should probably be shunned. I returned this falsely labeled product and cancelled my pre-orders that included \\"UltraViolet Digital\\" Copies.Years ago Sony used music CD's to install root kits on PC's, that was actionable. Sony had to make users whole. Time for Warner Bros. to do the same.For the record, as a fan of comicbook movies, SF and fantasy, I rate the movie 3 stars.

Personally I preferred the extended version which I was wondering why it was not shown in the theaters since the character development was much better.The BD and DVD are nice.However, if you prefer a digital copy and you are always out of the USA area. Then the UV copy is something you should not consider to get. You can access it within USA but when you go out, so long viewing it from anywhere else.Personally I prefer an iTunes Digital copy which you redeem you get downloaded and no worries where ever you are.Which I kept wondering why in the world do this movie companies make their own way of letting get content.

You don't think I would recognize you because I can't see your cheekbones?Of course, it is said by Blake Lively as Carol Ferris, ace fighter pilot and successful business woman. Blake tries her hardest, but she's not very convincing as the tough-as-nails Carol. She comes off as a bit of a marshmallow. As for the central character . . .

I wasn't expecting much going in with all the negative reviews and what not but man don't listen to those critics. I believe most of them must have been watching a different movie. This movie is pure entertainment and the special effects are amazing, especially on OA. Personally, I was delighted to see some of the corps members rendered with such detail. As a fan of Green Lantern and the Corps I was very happy with this adaptation. It's not perfect and has the standard super hero origin story going on but this doesn't hold it back in my opinion.

This movie in a word: sucks. With a little editing, it could easily be ready for broadcast on The Disney Channel in prime time! Story is weak and the extensive use of CG effects renders this \\"Green Lantern\\" pretty much dead on arrival. Not even hunky Ryan Reynolds can save this beast. My recommendation? Save your money and rent or buy Ryan Reynold's earlier release \\"BURIED\\", directed by Rodrigo Cortés. \\"BURIED\\" is way better than this turkey...IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of 2011","review":"Sure it's a pretty film. The greens are really quite stunning, but that's all I can say about this film that has any sort of positive resonance. Hal Jordan is a whiny, reluctant hero whose only real super power is the ability to annoy the viewer with his wishy-washiness. The plot is about as thin and improbable as it gets--and that's with the full understanding that I'm talking about a super hero-based universe that doesn't really exist. There are plot holes with enough gravity to create their own singularities: not even disbelief can be suspended by their power. What little action takes place is short and scattered, little islands of activity floating in a sea of dull characters, bad writing and a serious lack of contextual consistency."},{"rating":"1","title":"DC blows it again","review":"Green Lantern is one of my all time faves, so needless to say I was a little disappointed with this abomination. There was way too much cgi and it wasn't even that great looking, plus why did the film makers think it was necessary to make Hal's uniform and mask cg too? The acting was god awful at best and the writing didn't help either. I felt bad for Ryan Reynolds, of whom I am a fan of, because he was dealt a bad hand with this one. Ryan go back to Marvel and do the Deadpool movie!Overall the movie was rushed along, too many characters not enough time or substance. Lets just say not nearly enough Sinestro. Mark Strong was the only redeeming factor of this terrible film. I don't know why DC can't make a good movie unless it's Batman or Superman. The Emerald Knight deserves way better!

Ryan Reynolds plays a goofy Hal Jordan, nowhere near as serious as in the comic books--this was done, I suppose, to appeal to teenaged males and more especially to bring women to the theater to see the film. But it was bad. The dialogue was so bad you create a drinking game where for every clichéd piece of dialogue you have to take a shot. You'd be in your cups by the second act. The acting--not good. The special effects, for a film of this nature, looked cheap.To be honest, I hated everything about it, right down to the color green they chose. I could go on, but it's like reliving a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Just came from seeing the Green Lantern. It was horrendous.

The \\"real\\" ASIA must have Wetton, Palmer, Downes and Howe or, at least, the former three with another guitarrist.The result is a bunch of great songs played in a unintersting way by a strange band, with a faceless guitar player, a \\"I've Played With Them All\\" drummer (Chris Slade), a potent new singer and a sleepy Downes.

The guitarrist is a joke, his stage presence is equal to zero. Chris Slade on drums is a remarkable drummer and, as with any band he's ever played, he plays with conviction, but this is not enough to save this dumb DVD.

It was passable after Steve Howe left, because Pat Thrall filled in so admirably, but this collection of hacks are just a waste of time. The band always had enough of a monkey on their back being collection of progressive musicians playing mostly pop songs, so they had a hard enough time earning the little respect they ever got, but the monkey has bit the head off now and all that remains is a lifeless corpse being propped up by Geoff Downes' need to pay the rent. It's hard to believe that it's been 20 years for the band. Lets hope this act won't be together another 20 minutes. Stay away from this skunk.

I do not agree with the comments from the other review. I think this cd is a masterpiece and demonstrate that the band has the capabilities to grow and adjust their style to hard edge rock influenced by bands like Dokken. The album is just pure genious. Some songs sound like their trademark sound while others explore into a more Dokken feel like the title track. Highlights of the album include I DON'T KNOW (In my opinion the most catchy track of the album), AGAINST THE WORLD, DESTINY, MAN WITH A BROKE HEART, and TIME STOOD STILL...If you want to really see what this band is all about and not just Journey want to be's buy STATE OF ROCK, AGAINST THE WORLD and SEVENTH SIGN...In depth the album is just a great mix of Journey, Hardline and Dokken...I consider this album a classic amonth the new german hard rock bands...Their old material tends to be boring and sometimes uninspired..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scots Baroque","review":"Well performed lively quality Baroque music, another illustration of how widespread Baroque composition style was through all of Europe, not just in the major cities of Germany, Italy, France, and England."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was varied and kept me fascinated to the end.","review":"I have read this book three times and would love to read it three more times.

I crept as far down the bank as my leather loafers would let me without slipping then I pulled up a slah of rock and beside the Harlem River.

Her father died a few years back and she says that she still misses him and still thinks that she sees him. She has had troubled lif .

Jazmine's mother is an alcoholic in rehab. Her father died in a car crash a few years ago. She is a smart girl that writes poems and things about her life in her notebook. The plot of the book seems interesting but the way it was written wasn't very good. I wouldn't recommend this book to teenagers. Jazmine's Notebook doesn't have any big events that take place, it gets boring because she basically says the same things over and over again. When you read the book her dad already is dead and her mom is already in rehab. The whole book is just about how she deals with it all. There isn't a big ending to look foward to like in most books. This book could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deseree:Jazmin's Tough Life","review":"Jazmine is a 14-year old who lives with her sister, CeCe, in Harlem, NYC during the 1960's, where danger is everywhere. She's smart, strong, and talented with a poetic gift. Her mother is in the hospital for drug use, and they don't have enough money to buy food, but she fights through it all, and tries to find her purpose in life.Jazmin's Notebook was not a very interesting book. It didn't catch my intrest at the begining. There are some parts that caught my interest because when she was smoking and almost got raped, I continued to read to see what happened next. Overall the book doesn't have the spark for today's youth to read and enjoy.I would recommend this book to kids in the sixth and seventh grades. The literature is realitvy easy to read. This book is for entertainment, and to show how people who don't have much money live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing use of word images","review":"I have a nine-year-old daughter, and am reading books just ahead of her to see what she'd like.

I've read a great deal of teen fiction recently, including many Newberry winners, and this one stands with the best of them.

At this point in ILSA-SHE WOLF OF THE SS Ilsa had already banged a guy and chopped off his dip stick, but at that point in ELSA there was just a bunch of talking. Finally after some lame nudity I started the 2x play hoping to get to an exciting point. Thirty minutes later I was finished. Nothing had caught my eye. Boring nudity, deaths only by gunshot and two tame torture scenes. THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM starring Lance Henriksen had better violence.

This is a movie for those who want a low budget exploitation movie that is mainly exploitive in regards to soft core sex.Attractive women agents of elsa try to trick soldiers on leave in their sex train. the poor soldiers who speak of defeat are then killed. In real life during the later war years the NAZI's were indeed executing those who criticized hitler and other party ideals and especailly they died if they talked of defeat.I don't know if they used entrapments with beautiful women though. But it's a interesting idea and this bottom budget movie is at least tolerable if you aren't expecting violence exploitation as well as the sexploitation. The filmmakers were also hoping for a sequel as well with the open ended ending. So if you want mild sexploitation without alot of extreme violence then this may be ok for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best metal band out now","review":"I own all their stuff, and vinyl, saw them from row and even better live.

Why in the world is the author advocating faith, belief, and worship of an extraterrestrial being named Yahweh? Yahweh may be a god but he is not God- with a capital G. He may be an advanced spiritual being but is certainly not the Creator of All. God- with a capital G- does not have a son by a human female. God does not browbeat, threaten, trick and kill his \\"children\\". Something is wrong here.Much of the book just reasserts the Ancient Astronaut theory (in which I do believe). But by saying these ancient aliens are God is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The only interesting points in this book have ALL been covered by other authors and with better prose and evidence.

The information appears to be well researched and is presented in such a way that the average person can visualize the events depicted in the Bible but with new eyes. The \\"Yahweh Encounters\\" offers the reader a more logical understanding of how mankind came into being, rather than those promoted by \\"simple\\" religion. It brings to light that there are historical facts present allowing one to appreciate a more logical estimation of what the authors of the Bible were trying to explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things I didn't like.","review":"I found the dialogue laughable when Mr. Woods didn't intend it to be. The climax lasted about two pages. I figured out the \\"secret\\" of the twins before I was halfway through the book. There was so much fluff in this book that had nothing to do with the central plot that at the end I felt like I had been snookered into reading 300+ pages for a plot that actually took up maybe 50 pages. It took a willing suspension of disbelief to believe the villian turned into a vicious serial killer simply because his wife left him while he was on steroids. The cops in this book were comical characatures whose detective and interview skills matched that of a 10 year old. Mr. Woods should read a Michael Connelly novel before he tries writing cop scenes again. Woods is hit or miss and this was one of Woods' worst books. Stick with Chiefs and White Cargo. I read this book based on the reviews posted here and I was really, really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"It had a few slow spots, but all-in-all it was very entertaining.

The sample was deliciously enticing, but once I purchased the book it went quickly downhill. The characters were insipid and the women were incredibly weak. After all Liz had been through do we really believe she would fall right into bed with Keir. Also the racism was sickening slave quarters, uneducated black people on the island, the usage of colored? Really? In a 21st Century novel. Anyway, this is my first and definitely last book by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Chief's by Stuart Woods instead.","review":"I can't imagine anyone giving this book 5 stars, or even 4 for that matter. The plots were unbelievable. The characters were unbelievable. The writing was mediocre at best. I found the book to be a waste of time.

Of course, I *do* enjoy the Harry Potter series (which, in passing, is mentioned negatively in this book) but I understand the message presented by the authors.Because of some scary descriptions and images, I'd recommend this for the 13+ crowd. It *is* worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"Whilst not being a teenager, and maybe not the target audience, I enjoyed reading this book.

I always look out for Novels by Mr Alcorn, and I look forward, God willing, to read more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\" MUST READ!! \\" for every teenager","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. This story colorfully warns and demonstrates how evil and crafty the devil and his demons are. It uncovers how they are overcoming many teenagers lives today. It also shows the reader how the lessons you learn throughout the book, can be applied in everyday life. Although the book is about the actions of many teenagers that are slaves to the devil, it paints an even brighter picture of how a Christian boy or girl can, with God's strength, overcome the evil one. This book can be read time and time again and each time it will reveal something new and unforgetable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"This book is, contrary to popular belief, not good reading for people of all ages. In fact I thought it would be more suiting for a teenager that barely reads and is looking for something to support Christianity. It's so formulaic, simplistic, and in several cases just dumb. Every single chapter is the exact same length and each ends with some lame letter written by a demon to which they describe how tight their pants are getting as these kids sin. It's quite predictable as well, which doesn't make it overly exciting to read. After a few chapters I began to question the reason for living, it was so boring. I hate it. I hate this book so very much for taking as many brain cells as it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"smut disguised as christian reading for young adults","review":"If you care about your children you will not let them read this book-it is full of sexual references and references to drugs and alcohol.Amazon requires at least one star for rating- I would consider this book to be a NEGATIVE 5 StarsYou have to ask your self WHAT EVIL influence the authors were under when they wrote this book-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Stirring","review":"I initially purchased this book because I thought the cover was pretty awesome. When I started reading it, I was drawn in and impressed at how the author incorporated a positive aspect of Christianity through letters of the evil. I finished the book about a half-hour ago, almost in tears. Since May I had slipped away from my strong faith, and reading this book made me realize that when I die, I want what happened to one of the characters happen to me (I'm trying not to give out the ending!). I'm very blessed that I \\"stumbled upon\\" the book because it reminded me, in obvious AND subtle ways, of the spiritual battle being fought over for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alcorn Hits one out of the Park!","review":"The Ishbane Conspiracy is an eye-opening waltz through the lives of our teens. As a mother of a child this age, I was compelled to share it with my teenaged daughter when I finished reading it.The Conspiracy kids were put in tough but realistic situations and then artfully brought through in a way that kept the reader at rapt attention and on the edge of their seats.A character that I grew to love died, which was a surprise and a heart-breaker, but as an author myself, I know that sometimes we writers kill the ones we love for the greater good...The Screwtape-type demon letters were placed perfectly and provided needed spiritual input. When my daughter finished the book, she was incredibly edified and I believe better off. And MUCH LESS LIKELY to be deceived in this way by demonic advice.So read it. If you like Peretti, you'll like this too.Ellen C Maze, author(a new kind of vampire tale)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"One of the best I've ever read.I recommend this book to parents. It is about teens, but not only for teens, as the message will speak to the parents as well.The demons letters were disturbing, but I wouldn't be a good mom if I wasn't at least a little bothered by what is going on in the world and how it effects our children.Where else will you read anything else like this, that boldly takes on spiritual issues and the insight of demons? It is definatly a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read story addressing the occult's influence in our culture","review":"This book is compelling and startling in that it depicts the immense influence that the occult has on the current generation of young people. Teens as well as parents would enjoy this story. I actually ordered several copies to distribute to some young people and youth counselors to give them insight into this pressing issue.I love Randy Alcorn's books, both fiction and non-fiction (Heaven is a classic) and Deception is a \\"must read\\". His books are well-crafted and each one delves into a serious social issue, while centering around an absorbing, fast moving, character driven story.Youth pastors, parents and young people alike would find this book an important read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Novel With Many Important Ideas","review":"'The Ishbane Conspiracy' is a great combination; it is a highly entertaining novel that contains many important ideas and food for thought. I would recommend it for any adult or teenager.The authors did a great job of combining a Christian worldview and spiritual truths with a great story. This is a sequel to 'Lord Foulgrin's Letters', which I would also recommend. I think this is fine as a stand alone book though. I don't think it is necessary to have first read its predecessor.Along the way, the authors touch on many very relevant issues to young people - teen pregnancy, abortion, drugs, alcohol, the occult, etc. This is done in a way that is very loving to those struggling with these issues.This is a great book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and practical","review":"An excellent summary of little and big things foreigners might like to know about Britain.
