But Peyser is equally maliciious about admirable episodes like LB's glorious tenure at the NY Philharmonic or his famous Harvard lectures on music in 1971--nothing escape's her bilious outlook.You would never know from this book that Bernstein was a beloved figure, or why. Peyser doesn't discuss Bernstein's music-making in any detail. She cannot even grant him his stature as a condcutor, and her overall lack of sympathy has given birth to pure character assassination. This is one of the few books, on music or any other subject, that made me want to take the author to court. The sad thing is that Peyser advanced her career substantially by \\"bringing down Leonard Bernstein.\\" In a better world she would be deeply ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It reads like fiction.","review":"If Ms. Peyser would check her facts and do her research she just might have written a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah...hardcore.....good anyway","review":"schlong is the weirdest punk band ever. dave mello from op ivy was in them, but they sound nothing like that. it's just really goofy, dorky punk. if you like all you can eat or one eye open you should get this. this is a collection of 7\\"es and comp songs. my only problem with this is there are too many 3 finger spread songs (their bluegrass alter-ego). check out the entire cover of fleetwood mac's 'rumours' album, cleverly titled 'tumours.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glyphs!","review":"Glyphs are wonderful for enhancing data collection and graphing goals in the primary classroom. This book gives us ideas for seasonal glyphs and even provides reproducible patterns and legends for each one. Extention activities are also included.

If you are a fan you must definitely buy it. My favourite songs on the album are Nix is Fix, Papa und Lowin und Lamm. If you like Austrian Music like Wolfgang Ambross, or pop music and if you love the Austrian Accent you must definitely have this CD. I loved all the albums of Rainhard Fendrich and am already looking for the next CD brought out by him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Fendrich at his best","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to see so many Fendrich CD's available here at amazon. I chose to review the Nix Is Fix, because I think this is the CD that best describes Rainhard's talent. I pretty much have all of his CD's, have seen him live many times in Austria, but the one CD I always come back to is this one. I don't think anybody who has not heard of Fendrich will go out and buy his CD's, but if by freak accident any of you are interested in some really good songs by this Austrian artist, go and buy Nix is Fix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad acting!","review":"I bought this DVD actually thinking I was buying a different movie that I loved a few years ago. Besides the disappointment that it wasn't the movie I thought it was. STILL, the acting is just plain BAD. Ice-T was even a terrible actor in this film. And I like Ice-T as an actor! 95% of this film takes place in an abandoned warehouse and just drags on and on. The plot is so simple, how can anyone screw it up? BAD ACTING! Don't waste your time. Unless you have too much time on your hands..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Heist DVD","review":"Ice T was starting to improve with his acting in this phase of his career.

I ordered it because it is organic, and the only ingredients listed are Olive Oil and Black Truffles. When my order arrived, I noted that there was no indication on the labeling that the product was organic. Also, the ingredient was listed on the label as \\"black truffle aroma\\". Black truffle aroma is a manufactured product, not natural, and is chemically induced by bubbling chemical gases in the oil. There are no truffles used in manufacture. I am not an expert on what is \\"organic\\", but bubbling chemicals into an oil to induce an artificial flavor does not seem \\"organic\\" to me. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poem for all your moods","review":"I first encountered \\"The Black Poets\\" as a college student back in the 1970's.

How horrible that someone can call themselves \\"Dr.\\" and pass on information such as this. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Anyone in today's horse society should know better and be smarter. If you want to help your problem horses, this book is not the answer. Sorry, I just can't say enough bad things about this book.

Very solid and secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tie down","review":"Not much to say about these. They are made of good quality material. I use these to tie down my GSXR1000 in my ranger and have not experienced any slips, cuts or loosen.

But having used many straps and tie-downs before, these feels as if they will provide a very secure tie-down for heavy objects and will not fail. I won't know for sure until I use them, but I have no concerns based on my examination of the product.ADDENDUM (15 OCT 12): 8000+ miles later and my assessment of the strength of these tie-downs was spot on. All 8000+ miles on the front of my truck through lots of rain, dirt roads and construction zones. Heavy straps did not show wear even when they spent the last 6 hours rubbing against metal edges. I wouldn't not hesitate to trust these straps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging Nightmare","review":"Anything that require heavy cutters to dismember the plastic packaging nightmare this came in is ridiculous. After plowing through that I find little or no instruction on usage and assembly but tons of safety admonitions which were obviously written by the legal department.

When searching amazon, I came across these straps and took a chance. They arrived when there were supposed too and packaged correctly. The straps are the perfect length when using the four points on trailer or truck, with room to spare. The tie downs are actually thicker than they appear on the picture, which is good, along with the wrench. What supprised me was the thickness of the d-ring and the hooks that clamp onto it. The d-ring is very thick, not thin or flimsy and the hooks are large also. It really gives you a sense that whatever you tie down is not going anywhere.After tying down the HD in the trailer and arriving at my destination, they tie downs barley loosened. The only recommendation I can give, is if you have chrome on any part you are placing the strap on, like the front forks, put something between, because the thread on the tie down will cause scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE!","review":"Best motorcycle tie downs i have ever seen, I'm sorry i didn't order several sets of them the 1st time!

Total was a three-day drive of 1200 miles, give or take.Bottom line, the straps worked perfectly, with one exception. The snap-lock on one of the hooks bent a bit on the trailer tie-down point and had to be forcefully pushed back to release the hook, rather than gentle pressure with the thumb. (That's why it's down one star.)Some of the straps required slight (1-notch on the rachet) tightening after initial use, but that's to be expected with new straps.Overall it's a good set, and I'd definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome tiedowns","review":"These tiedowns are great.

This helps to set the flavor of the world in which the story is based...a world where things take time and waiting is necessary.The story highlights many inequalities in traditional Japanese society - with a strong focus on the inequality of women - using believable characters. Enchi shows us both sides of the coin, making us understand each character's actions even when the action evokes outrage.Enchi is one of Japan's foremost female authors and this book is a fine example of why.Very highly recommended for all but those who need a fast paced yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"A bit more difficult to use than I would have liked, and stops working at times.

The books, of which I have seen a few other titles, always have an upbeat mood even when one of the characters has a problem. This text features Clifford, as usual, dominating the illustrations with his massive size. In some of the books he frightens people around him save for the child who owns him.In this particular tale Clifford and his two little dog friends Cleo and T-Bone resolve to spend a warm day at the beach but they lose one of their toys--a beach ball.The ultimate moral lesson being communicated in this story is to be altruistic enough to give away a toy to somebody lacking one out of a spirit of generosity if the child has others at home. However, this may not be a realistic goal for small children, who have an inclination to be self-centered at their early age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"It comes with the puniest and stupid rock.

Having worked at the Little Bighorn Battlefield as an interpreter in 1985, I personally know how this interpretation changed, i.e. before the archaeological digs of 1984-85, most of us believed that Custer's men fell mostly to arrows. We now know that the U.S. soldier's were outgunned, thanks to this field work and as reported in the book. Since Scott's final report, headstones on the battlefield marking where \\"unknown soldier's\\" fell have been replaced by actual names, e.g. Mitch Bouyer. This reality came to place thanks to the forensic work of Dr. Clyde Snow (his complete report is included in this book).

Unfortunately not. But to Naxos' credit, this particular recording is fairly comprehensive, touching on most of Khachturian's ideas and thematic material. After a long search, I finally located a full 2-CD recording of the ballet with the USSR Radio and Television Large Symphony Orchestra under Djansug Kakhidze on the Russian Disc label. The ballet in its full context is beautiful, whereas the suites turn the pieces into small, individual concert pieces (Sabre dance is the epitome of this). Does the ballet really need to be cut into large suites in order to salvage the music, or will the recording industry one day realize the demand there is for a full, attainable Gayaneh recording? While the suites are nice, hearing the ballet in its context and entirity is essential to the Khachaturian lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcus gets serious about love and life","review":"Marcus gets a little deeper and darker on 'Tales'. I love the interludes by all the cats; it adds depth to the musical experience. Since this album is more concept-based, its kind of unfair to pick out favorite tunes. However, 'Forevermore' may be the greatest Bass Guitar Ballad since Jaco did 'A Remark you Made' on Weather Reports' Heavy Weather LP. I mean, it just stays with you, its so hauntingly beautiful. 'Ethiopia' and 'Eric' also stand out, probably because he's using a different sounding bass. While the record doesn't seem to be necessarily geared towards radio formats, 'Tales' is a little more polished than 'The Sun don't Lie'; the tunes are more structured and laid back, and I do like that Bass Clarinet! Mature ears are probably best suited to hear this set of musical 'Tales'."},{"rating":"2","title":"another phat cd","review":"This guy is amazing, the quality of jazz he is putting out there is so deep, he has lots of great help, but he wrote the songs. \\"rush over\\" is a favorite.

Not only do I think it's just as good as the popular Nonesuch recording with Upshaw, I think it's better hands down. Kilanowisz voice is just outstanding for this piece, blending in with the breathtaking harmonies and emotion of the piece rather than sounding like she's performing an opera aria. The Warsaw Symphony orchestra is rich and thick and produces an amazing harmonies and overtones that won't hear on the Nonesuch recording. Kilanowisz voice is up to the power of this full size orchestra from the lowest notes to the highest. Together, they bring Gorecki's symphony to life in a way that will be tough to surpass. A must have for any fan of Gorecki's 3rd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert island disc","review":"This is a sensational version of Gorecki's masterpiece, rivalled only for top spot in my music collection by the Kord version of the same piece on Phillips. The sound quality is phenominal. The third movement in particular stands out, there is a delicate and subtle piano touch not present in the other recordings that give it a measured focus. The singing is simply sublime, I cannot understand the popularity of the Dawn Upshaw recording with the superior intonation and diction of the native soprano so readily available on recordings such as this. Uplifting though sombre, thought provoking though repetitive, this is as good as it gets !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorecki - Symphony #3 - great recording/great price","review":"Outstanding recording of works by Gorecki - deep and dark at times, but also calm in the midst of the storm.

It follows a standard ballet recipe of toys coming to life, of course depicted through various dance numbers including a couple with \\"local color\\" (Spanish and Chinese). It is all very pretty, oversweet and thoroughly unmemorable. Same goes for the excerpts from Sonne und Erde, inconsequential, tepid and oversugared. I don't think I could under any circumstances possibly want to listen to it again.

In many ways I feel we will see a strong resemblance to the current upcoming President and what the people of the 30's and 40's saw. Obviously, we as a people have not learned our history well.A great read. I'd suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of Recycled History?","review":"Although 628 pages in length, this book is concise and flows along nicely, and ACTUALLY PROVIDES A FRESH VIEW of a period which is usually made dull by fawning historians. BTW, Fleming is not a crazed liberal-basher (Truman comes off quite well). But theauthor is aloof enough to actually give a balanced account of FDR's role as a living, breathing politician. However, if one-dimensional books with FDR atop Mount Olympus make you feel good, look into Goodwin and the countless other rehashtorians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative Propaganda","review":"I am an avid WWII reader/amateur historian and was very anxious to read this book when it was released. However, after I reached somewhere around page 30 I quickly realized this book was a attempt to manipulate facts in order to put down liberalism and instead actually encourage isolationism. I found Fleming's non-stop attack on FDR as arrogant and petty. I also thought of FDR as an arrogant man who manipulated situations and people but Fleming takes this theory and simply makes every situation appear that FDR was not a great leader instead of one of the reasons the world is safe today. I would highly recommend passing over this book, unless you are a conservative looking for false justification for why World War II was not a noble cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Roosevelt Hater posing as an Historian.","review":"Fleming reveals himself as a sterotypical Roosevelt hater, the likes of which should be extinct by now. Fleming manages to put the worst possible face on everything Roosevelt did, and gives credence to all of FDR's enemies. There are always nay-sayers about any administration, especially one which actually attacks problems and does things. FDR, with all his pros and cons, was a complex, subtle, and yes, devious politician. Fleming fails to find the good because he didn't look for it. I rated this one star because the zero option was not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scurrilous is not a strong enough adjective","review":"I did get get through 50 pages of this pseudo-history before giving up. I had hoped to find new insights into an intriguing period of history but instead encountered a continuous re-hash of half truths and tired stories. The invective used by the writer would discourage any person who is trying to learn the truth. I did learn one new thing! Another species of ideologue was identified-an \\"interventionist\\".

It can charge quickly but not fast, has no over charge protection, most of the parts are on the low end (ie wheels, handle, cables, clamps). It seems to be twice as large as it needs to be. But the 2 biggest issues with this is the poor performance of the 200-amp start and the cables literally melting every time you use it. I have used this 15 - 20 times over 2 years and the cables have ROTTED off. First the cable insulation would melt and smoke when I used the 40 or 200 amp settings, then, when I could see the wire I realized it was corroded and soon broke. Its obvious the cables were the cheapest they could get away with and thats just dangerous. It makes me question whats inside. I wouldn't mind all the trim being low end but when you cut corners with the core product thats just not safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit, a few shortcomings, nothing critical","review":"It does what it is supposed to do. It supplied cranking power to a dead battery on a flooded engine in below zero conditions, no problems.

When we first got it, it was one of the first ones out there, so we were really excited. Compared to other options now, though, this one certainly is not the clearest. The picture has always been very snowy although the receiver and camera are in close proximity to each other. We've used this in two different houses (and we do have a lot of electronics - cordless phones, cell phones, computer with wireless internet, etc.) and have had a very large amount of interference.

Many of the chapters were originally published as a series of newspaper articles and left me wanting more detail, especially the one on \\"Illinois's Most Heinous Murderer: Herman Webster Mudgett\\".

She goes on to say that, \\"for every diagnosed celiac, 89 go undiagnosed.\\"This comprehensive resource really puts it all together. Divided into three basic sections, the book covers everything from: a definition of the disorder, related/associated disorders, how to talk to your doctor, lists of safe and unsafe foods, all about grains, menu planning, recipes, nutritional requirements, testing, the emotional side of CD and a host of other invaluable topics.For some, a gluten-free diet is just a healthier choice. But for just over a million of us in the US, it isn't an option, it's a necessity. This book is a lifesaver in a health care environment that isn't as knowledgeable as it could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This book is a must have for celiacs. Since my husband was diagnosed, we have read many of the more popular books on celiac disease, and none of them have been nearly as helpful as this book. The tone the author uses is positive, and she doesn't use scare tactics to convince celiacs that they need to be careful with their diets, as many of the other books do! This book also contains more scientific information than any of the others, which will be appreciated by people who want to know exactly what is going on with their bodies. I would purchase this book first, and then follow up by ordering cookbooks, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"wheat free worry free","review":"This is the best book that deals with Celiac disease that I have read so far!

From the start when orderng off thier website, it won't let you just complete the order. I must have gotten 10 additional pages of \\"buy this, buy that, this would be a good accessory.\\" Just let me order the thing. Then once they got my card number, with in 2 days I had 3 phone calls \\"confirming my order\\" then signing me up for 30 day trails of other stuff which I would have to call and cancel.

In fact, I can't remember the last time I reviewed a product. But I felt compelled to warn others of the Water Jet. While the unit itself is ok, the add-ons are junk. The \\"free with shipping\\" scrub-brush stripped its threads on my very first use (and I'm not some moron who tries to force things together). The \\"free with shipping\\" soap dispenser started leaking a huge water spout on its second use. Regarding the unit itself, it did not deliver the results promised on tv. It was very little better, if any, than a standard head on a standard water hose gun. I kept the unit, only because the price of returning it, minus shipping, would have netted me about $10. $10 out of the original $35. I've never been any more dissappointed with a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I bought one of these and took it back the next day.

I have used this product for years to get relief from osteoarthritis. I've tried pills and other similar liquid products and this is the easiest and best tasting on the market. It is also one of the few that combines all four supplements in one. Perhaps the only down side is that it must be refrigerated, but other than that it's convenient.

I bought her a bag of this on a whim and gave it to her the same time I gave her some wet food. It was quite amusing to see her go from one bowl to the next, trying to decide which to eat first! She grabbed some wet, went to this, went back grabbed more wet, back to this, it was quite comical! She loves the taste of this dry food, however, it's terribly hard for her to eat it. The kibble is quite large and I'm trying to figure out if the makers thought they were making this for dogs! She mostly has to swallow it whole unless I put some in a plastic baggy and whack it with a hammer. They're just too stiff to snap in half with your fingers.Other than that, I do recommend this, but if your cat has a small mouth like mine, you might want to try something else. She likes it so much that I keep giving it to her, but I'm still trying to find ways to help her eat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler rubbish.....","review":"Ingredient list speaks for itself.You pay for what you get...do your cat a favour, spend a bit more on him/her.

Recently the company has redone their kibble and my cats do not like it as well. This was listed a :\\"original Whiskas\\" and one of the reviews even said they had the same experience. they were glad to find the older version and so was I. If I had wanted the new kibble,, I would have bought it at my grocery,,, incidentially cheaper than on this site. Surprise,,,, guess what was sent,,,,, the new version. Since I suspected it was the wrong thing,, I had to open the bag to verifiy it. Of course,, it was the new smaller kibble I could get anywhere. So I guess,,, you all are not very careful of your orders or you just think we are dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Great Series","review":"First, I'd like to take exception to Gigei's review. I have read well over 200 books.Now, I don't review often, but this series is so unique I feel I have to say a good word or two about it. The violence and magic are very well done, as is the sacrifice one must make for power. The battles are very detailed and well thought out. The sex is, um, very arousing. This is the ONLY series I've ever read that has combined sex and fantasy successfully. I think the end result is a very good series, but I wouldn't recommend anyone under 13 reading it.The only flaw, if there is one, is that there is no second series to carry on the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply wretched","review":"The Seer King offers but two things: graphic sex and detailed descriptions of strategy and battle tactics. Character, world-building, even plot -- all the finer points of literature -- are mostly glossed over or outright ignored. Fine. This is a book that knows its limits. What is objectionable is that its trite. The sex scenes are stale, unimaginative and not particulary evocative. The battle scenes are straightforward descriptions of standard tactics lifted, one supposes, directly from the manual. One is left with the impression that the principal character is a competent soldier, but not the budding Napoleon that the author is attempting to describe. Overall, the novel lacks vivid descriptions of either sex or violence, its supposed strengths. With nothing else to fall back on, the reader is left to regret his/her purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book,a bit porny (or erotic novelly perhaps)","review":"It is good, particularily with the millitary and magic systems. The first person POV leaves you less then surprised that the main characters going to live through everything.That and Damastes EPIC FORESHADWING of the future betrayal. Meaning it pops up and hits you like a brick every fifty to hundred pages (possibly less).Then theres the sex scenes that just pop up. Didn't surprise me much as it seemed a bit GRRM, with less pretense.A quick read with few surprises and not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless sex scenes, fun politics, ok battles","review":"Too much of this book reads like \\"Letters to Penthouse\\". Don't buy this if you don't like graphic descriptions of sex. I enjoyed the political intrigue tracking the rise of the \\"Napolean-like\\" Laish Tenedos. However, I was totally turned off by the sex scenes sprinkled liberally throughout the book. They added nothing to the plot and seemed to exist only to please those who \\"read\\" porno. You can simply skip the porno sections and you won't miss a thing in the story. What was the author thinking? Most of the battle scenes were ok but a bit on the short side. Unfortunately, I bought the second book in the series at the same time as the first and I'm debating whether to throw it away or use its pages as a cup coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The 'Seer King' is an excellent book written intelligently and interestingly, a break from those yarns by the likes of Gemmel who all try so hard yet fail to emulate Eddings. The sex scenes are graphic yes but the idea that this is not how a fantasy book should be written is only held on to by those not wanting to read something a bit different and trying to regain again and again the \\"quest around the fantasy world\\" formula. Bunch brought something new to fantasy, not just the sex but accuracy and realism. The battles were described in a fashion that made them stand out from those of other authors - and in a good light. The plot was well devised and again different. The only criticism I would make is that the characters were not well developed even by the standards of the Gemmels and the McAfferys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed . . . but worthwhile","review":"Overall, a well-written fantasy novel; refreshingly refrains from being either an \\"epic\\" or a \\"romantic fantasy. Two flaws drag it down it somewhat. First is the narrative style, first person from the end of the story -- which we're told in the first few pages. (There are also an annoyingly large number of gloom-and-doom predictions that don't seem to quite bear themselves out, in the main body of the text.) Second is the overly graphic nature of the sex scenes; they don't match the tone of the rest of the novel, and I found them distracting.Don't let this stop you from reading the novel, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"If you enjoy reading detailed histories of military actions, then this book is certainly for you - especially if your field of pleasure is military action prior to the 18th Century. The detailed description of military life, strategy and battle may suit you down to the teeth.That being said, however, I must confess that I found this book excruciatingly boring. In my 42 years, I have only left two books unfinished, regardless of how poorly written; had I not felt obligated to finish this one, in order to write a fair review, this would have been the third.

Lesser known symphonies are just as good, such as those by Borodin, Kalinnikov and those by Rimsky-Korsakov. The latter wrote three of them, with the last being the least well known. This is unfortunate as it is probably the most accomplished, and closest to being the full, rich, evocative symphony written by his peers in the 1800s. The last movement especially invokes joy and wonder, similar to the final movements of Glazunov's 1st, 2nd and 7th symphonies. The 3-part Sinfonietta is also very good, on par with any symphony. Both are recorded well on this album, which seems to be going cheap via secondary sellers on amazon.

As they grow up, I'm glad we'll have this little memory...As for the actual DVD, who knows if they'll do a great job or not...and I'm sure they'll be plenty of reviews about it. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful, awful idea","review":"Wait, you got into my apartment and noticed I don't even OWN this dvd set? What you didn't know was that I didn't NEED TO own it. Right after I read that there are Ace and Peter \\"look-alikes\\", I realized this was not WORTH owning.I've been a Kiss fan since '83. I know what makes Kiss. The Elder is my favorite disc. I've seen the many faces of Kiss, but to put Eric and Tommy (which I know are good musicians) in Peter and Aces faces totally cheapens what Kiss is. It's THE PEOPLE that make Kiss not the make-up. Remember the second \\"Darrin\\" on Bewitched? Exactly. You can't just mix and match people as though they are hardware, people MATTER TO ME.I've had my eye on a bootleg Kiss DVD on eBay from '79 and I just might go ahead and buy THAT instead... when Kiss was Kiss. This set is an insult!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cue snoring sounds....","review":"Wake me up when Gene the huckster decides to release some vintage era concerts on DVD. If I wanted to see a KISS cover band I could go to a local bar and pay $5 instead of $20 for this garbage. Everyone that touts Eric and Tommy's superior playing are missing the point. Its about playing with feeling and emotion. If I want technical proficiency I will listen to Rush, Yes, etc. KISS have never been about superior musicianship. I'm suprised Gene didnt include some hair from his wig and raise the price to $250 so that all of the die hards could help build another wing on his mansion. Whats next a KISS coffin.....oh wait!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one...","review":"The DVD is not even out but fans are giving 5 stars just because they like the band. Since I don't like the band anymore, I guess that gives me the right to do just the opposite. I'll give it one star. Ace Frehley rules!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not out yet!","review":"How can you give a review to something you haven't even looked at yet? So let's balance out this review rating..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this concert DVD","review":"This concert is absolutely incredible! I saw KISS the first time in 1977 when AC/DC (with Bon Scott) was their back-up band, and I was skeptical about this concert DVD because Peter and Ace weren't there, but I was so blown away by Tommy and Eric!! This concert is worth far more than the price! I've watched it five times in the last three days!! It's so refreshing after watching these so-called \\"rock stars\\" today like Britney Spears and Chris Brown who are nothing but lip-syncing gymnastsl!! KISS are the best MUSICIANS ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over Ace and Peter","review":"I like the original band as much as everyone else. But lets face it, Peter cant play drums anymore & Ace cant play his guitar that great anymore. Eric and Tommy are so much better. I've seen both shows with ace & Peter and with Eric & Tommy. Eric and Tommy win hands down. Although I agree they should cut some new music. As for the makeup, who cares. Leave it on, take it off. Dosen't matter to me. I am in it for the songs (Gasp). Yes it's true, I like KISS for the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"For starters, learn to spell ridiculous correctly. That may give you more credibility or explain why you only rate it a 1. I think it's safe to say that anyone who saw the concerts certainly has the right to give it a rating. I've seen several concerts and the DVD's have yet to let me down. If you're a KISS fan, you can certainly understand the ratings of a 5. The band is better now with Tommy and Eric and the concert was awesome. Plus, you get extra footage that you won't get at a concert. Five is easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"People are you going deaf?","review":"A lot reviews keep saying that this DVD has great audio. Come off it, this stinks!!! I'm a kiss fan and always have been, but I would be embarrassed for nonkiss friends to hear this. This concert doesn't have a solid sound; in fact sometimes it sounds disorganized. Just compare this mess to AC/DC \\"Stiff upper lip live\\". Now that's a concert! All the theatrics and great camera work in the world can not make up for a lousy sound, but that's why I gave it one extra star."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 KISS","review":"I have seen these guys in the 70's and during the 90's for the \\"farewell\\" tour. The key issue with this DVD and the band line up is its only 1/2 the original band.Why is Eric Carr wearing Peter's make up and the other guy wearing Ace's spaceman costume?Eric was in Kiss before as the \\"Fox\\". Why change?Tom Thayer was a tour manager and in a Kiss tribute band.This is only 1/2 of the classic Kiss line up even if it appears otherwise.The DVD has a good mix of classic Kiss tunes and Paul and Gene are the heart of this band.But without Peter and Ace you won't find \\"New York Groove\\", \\"Shock Me\\" or \\"Beth\\" on the set list.Most importantly the band's best stuff was made as Paul, Gene, Ace and Peter and that's not the band anymore even if an attempt is made to portray that. Let it be known that Ace Frehley is a great lead guitarist and that is clearly missing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Wanted The Best...You Got The Worst!","review":"WARNING!!! This DVD sucks! I give it a star just for production quality...nothing else!!! Obviously by now, greed for money and power have taken the best of Gene and Paul. Their ego went too far this time by stealing Ace and Peter's stage persona. Who wants to see other guys dressed up as KISS anyway. I see that enough during halloween, HA HA HA! That's too bad. This move was unnecessary and distracting enough to ruin the whole show for me. Actually, it would've been way better if they had no makeup at all.After reading a lot of these previous positive fan reviews I understand now. If you have no respect for yourself and like KISS just for tradition, be like these other suckers and get this DVD, HA HA HA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss rock the nation live","review":"i have loved kiss for a while and this dvd has great quality and great sound quality.It's a keeper.I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"Overall, a pretty good DVD. Theres alot of rare songs that the band hasn't played for a while. And I will agree with some, it would be great to have Ace and Peter, but give Eric and Tommy their props. They are both unbelievable musicians and do a great job replacing Ace and Peter. Honestly, I like the Alive IV:Symphony DVD better than this, but it is still a great DVD and is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 healthy band members = GREAT SHOW","review":"Finally, Gene and Paul decided that it was enough of Ace and Peter, the were both replaced by the talented Tommy Thayer and the great Eric Singer. They are great musician and can play any song in the KISS catalog, unlike Ace and/or Peter. This tour was great because there was nobody complaining, it was pure and simple rock and roll. KISS rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it NOW!","review":"Lots of great live footage, which is why I wanted it in the first place.

I had the fortune to see this tour and this is the best souvenior you could possibly get. I also loved the ability to single out your favorite star and watch just them. And the sound is incredible! This is a must have for a KISS fan and anyone who is into rock music DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS-OFF","review":"Let me start by saying I love KISS! There it's out of the way... Now about Rock The Nation Live: This is video attempts to bring all the energy of a live KISS concert to the home viewer by employing multiple ( and I mean MULTIPLE!!) cameras to record every aspect of the concert. What The viewer actually gets is an editor gone wild in the cutting room! There is barely a shot that is longer than 5 seconds long of any band member at any given time, unless you use the feature that follows individual members of the band. Add to the problem the fact that there are more shots of the audience than there are of the band and you get real tired real fast. Skip this DVD, you'll find better shows on YouTube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best KISS Live DVD, so far","review":"No doubt, this is my favorite KISS live DVD. My other favorites are Konfidential, Unplugged and Symphony. I have been a fan since 1979 and have travelled to New York and Australia to see them perform live. The rhythm section by Eric Singer, Paul and Gene is the tightest of all KISS line-up. That makes this line-up and the Revenge era my favourite KISS line-up. No particular set list can makes every fan satisfied. Rarely performed KISS classics? Not really. 15 of the 20 songs are from the Revenge tour set list. The new ones are Making Love, She, Got to Choose, Love Her All I Can, 100000 Years. And they dropped 10 songs from the Revenge tour including Watching You, Cold Gin, Heavens on Fire, Creatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helping to balence this out","review":"Agree with the latest 2 reviews.

Those are the good ones to understand what is not good on a product and see if those bad things make you give up buying it. 5 stars reviews are always \\"this band rocks\\" \\"I love her..\\" and that kind of s***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock The NAtion!!","review":"I am eagerly awaiting this DVD!

My forst Kiss show was in HAmpton, VA back in Feb 1984 on the Lick it up tour. The power they played with that night and in the Va Beach 2004 concert are very much alike! KISS is back! And you can't do anything about it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take off that make-up!","review":"It is blasphemy to dress someone else in Ace and Peter costumes and pretend like we're supposed to roll with it. Gene and Paul, you know better. Just take off the make-up and keep calling it KISS like you used to.

The next Kiss Tribute band will feature Anton Fig and Bob (or Bruce) Kulick. Eric is a great drummer, but he doesn't belong in Peter's makeup. Be original dude.

This DVD is unnecesary and stupid. The two new guys on stage look like trained monkeys with no individuality at all. Anybody from a KISS tribute band can do this. KISS is becoming their own tribute band. Let these guys look, act and play like themselves or even write new material for the \\"band\\". Actually, I don't see them as band members at all. They're more like temporary employees hired by the KISS corporation (enjoy employment while it lasts guys!). KISS was great in the 70's when music was their driving force and money was side effect.

If this is the \\"new\\" kiss, as quoted from Paul Stanley, how about getting new costumes/outfits for Tommy and Eric. Leave Peter's and Ace's original make up alone as for when Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent did.....Gene has done nothing but embarressed himself with his solo album and I'm pretty sure Paul will too.

If you walk under the bikes, make sure you don't bang or rock it, because it may fall off the hooks. They're more like 90-degree brackets than hooks. Anyway, the directions are clear about not standing/walking under the bikes while hoisted, but these things happen from time-to-time. Especially in places like sheds/garages where things are stored beneath.2) The included screws are junk and they strip easily. Do yourself a favor and use proper 2\\" wood screws. Consider pre-drilling pilot holes and use washers as well.3) The directions are a tad lacking, and the pictures aren't the greatest either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, and at great price","review":"Added pictures so everyone can what it looks like.Pros:- Easily holds up my road bike- Cheap at under fif-teen dollars- Easy to install- Directions are sufficient- Does the jobCons:- Plastic pulleys that feel \\"cheap\\", but I guess you dont need anything better for under 50 pounds and reflects the low price point- Takes a lot of \\"pulls\\" to get it up there- Would replace the basic rope that comes with it.Some People complained that the screws that came with the device were \\"cheap\\", so I decided to use my own. Well I guess my own were cheap too because my impact driver(screw driver) ripped two screw heads right off. In the end, I should have just used theirs.Only modification I did was I replaced the rope that came with the hoist. The rope would definitely work fine for all uses, but I actually wanted something to looked and felt more professional.

My only complaint is that the hooks are not really hooks. They are more like \\"L\\" brackets and as a result they don't \\"hook\\" the bike seat particularly well. I have to be very careful with my trek road bike as I'm lifting it to make sure the brackets don't slip out from underneath the seat. I actually tried to bend them to make them more like a hook but they are too solid (I guess that's a good thing).My garage ceiling is high enough that I don't bump the bikes at all when they are lifted. If you think they will get bumped occasionally, you'll probably need to rig something to make sure the hooks stay put on the seat.All in all, I'd say that for the price I paid it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sky hook","review":"The hoist is well made and works well when it is configured properly--read the directions. I am using it to hoist a kayak over the car, and raising the thing is a little tricky because one end wants to go up faster than the other. One person can do the job, but it is easier with two. I imagine it would be much simpler to hoist a bike. After a couple of months now, it is still holding up fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaaly good product","review":"I ordered this particular product because it had a bigger weight load than other brands. I am using it for a 24 foot ladder that is now off my garage floor hanging horizonally. Unlike other reviews, I thought it installed easily but do agree that the instructions need to be clearer. Also for the weight I am hanging, I thought it wise to use longer screws. Also I had to rig small pieces of chain to the hooks to make them useful for the ladder. All in all, easy to use and not much change needed to make the product work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for many uses...","review":"I bought two of these and mounted them side by side. For the winter, I hang my bikes and in the summer time I use them to hang my hard-top for my convertible. They're awesome! The very simple to use, sturdy, and clean looking. I would recommend them to anyone (and have to many friends and family)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great value and functional bike hoist!","review":"The assembly onto 2x4s is pretty simple and straightforward. Make sure to THREAD the rope before screwing things in. For some reason, this is on the back of the instructions, and it'd be easy to mount first then find yourself in a bind. When mounting the brackets, save yourself some time and go buy some decent wood screws. The ones in the packaging are throw-aways, as they strip almost immediately, even if you've drilled pilot holes. Otherwise, great product and value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Efficient method of getting your bikes out of the way, cleans up the garage floor. Brackets could be a little more effective in grabbing the bike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to store bikes!","review":"This was a great solution to getting bikes out of the way during the winter months. I ran 2x4's perpendicular to the rafters and mounted the base plates to them. Installation was a little difficult because the screw holes on the mount are 4\\" apart. So you have to angle the screws in at a diagonal to get them to bite. You can use center line holes as well, but the base plate does not sit flush with the board because the center line holes are designed to tie directly into exposed rafters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this and spend the extra money on the rail mount version","review":"I installed it exactly as the directions specified with the exception of using larger lag screws to hold it in. The hooks are the main problem. They don't hold the bike with much stability at all. The handle bar hook wasn't too bad, but it did not inspire confidence. The seat looked the least stable and failed the first time I tested i,t and several times after. I wasn't willing to chance parking my care under this for that reason and returned it. If they made the \\"hooks\\" hook shaped it would work, but I'm not willing to spend time modifying them or adding bungie straps to make it safe as some buyers have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"We picked up two of these for $11 and change, each. For the price, they are great. I used the 2x4 method for mounting, just so that we would leave less holes in the ceiling (an interior room) and so that we could fine tune the location after installation. Side note: if installing at an angle compared to your joists, run the 2x4 long (in the tune of 6 feet) to make sure you hit 3-4 joists.Like others have said, the hooks are bent at right angles. I left the mounts a bit farther apart to give a bit of an angle on the hook. I may also go back and attempt to bend the hooks on the seat side.All an all, you can't complain for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"The installation was a breeze.

I knowcked it a star on the review for the poor quality of the included screws. In the age of torx and square-drive screws, Ihave no idea why anyone uses phillips/straight screws any more. Particularly these soft-metal screws that sill round off if you look at them sideways. and then after they have rounded off, you will find that they are not long enough to go through d=a sheet of drywall anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Hoist","review":"I purchased a different brand of bike hoist months ago and when I needed two more this looked like the best one.

Bent handlebars and broken bar end. The hooks on this product are an L shape and have very cheap rubber like end pieces that do not stay on. If the hooks where more of a \\"fishhook\\" or U shape this item would work out. I may have to drill a hole on each hook and put a bolt through it to keep bike from slipping off the hooks.Also the pulley system doesn't work that great, theres a bit of binding and the rope slips off the side of the pulleys sometimes. + when hoisting the bike up, the front and rear doesn't go up evenly but at an extreme angle where for example the front of the bike will be pointing down at like a 20 degree angle and sometimes i have to pull on the rope from the rear hooks to even it out - i hope that made sense :>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rad Bike Hoist","review":"This product was easy to install.

I didn't need to worry, it is much better than I was expecting. I just installed the lift this weekend and even my wife loves using it - she only complained about the bike not lifting evenly and that was easily overcome. No more of the cheap hooks that you have to lift the bike upside down to use - she was never able to do that and her bike was always in the middle of the garage because of it. Easy to install (without using a 2x4 like mentioned). More than worth the $ and we will probably buy 2 more for the kids bikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installation and Safety Tips","review":"IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION.Get some chain with a quick release connection so you can create a safety cable. The way the hooks attach to the bike, it's too easy for it to slip off. The bikes have already slipped off and were saved by the safety cables I had. I happened to have a safety cable lying around and I wouldn't have it any other way. The hooks that come with the system already have the holes to attach the cable to.INSTALLATION TIP.Whether you are setting up the system parallel or perpendicular to the studs, first \\"build\\" the system using a 2x4 as suggested with the perpendicular stud drawling (Drawling 3). Then lag the entire unit as one into the ceiling. It's much easier.Other than that, I like the system very much. It works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Great product.

Well, it did open up space, and they are easy to get up and down (we use them for our moutain bikes)...however, the space left under them is wasted. You cannot store under them because 1) you need to be able to lower them to the ground and 2) the bikes still hang pretty low so you cannot walk or store anything of height under them.

The hero supposedly dreams of becoming an architect yet can't even create a warm or stylish living space? A house that somehow the heroine livens up with a checkered placemat? Dumb. Even a small amount of research would have informed the author that a great deal of rigorous training and time goes into being an architect and one isn't just handed a partnership and a client (particularly without supervision of an licensed and therefore legal architect) without first several years of actually doing the grunt work.

They also need to develop a sense of music composition that includes melody.There's very little melodic composition here, mainly justcool sounding riffs they probably came up with while jamming.But as I said, this album would be pretty good if thevocalization was improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little angry...","review":"For a rhythm you can bludgeon someone to death to, no one does it quite like Meshuggah. It isn't their heaviest album, but still the best thing I've heard lately in that choppy style. It's better than Emmure's new album, which lacks heart; but less harmonious than the new Suicide Silence album. If you don't know those two bands, I recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meshuggah At There Best","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Meshuggah. I think that this is Meshuggah's best album. This album is a mix of some death metal with alot of hardcore thrash metal. This album sounds a little like Metallica is how I would say it sounds, but better.I think that this album is underated. You always hear people talk about DEI up to Obzen \\" which are also great albums,\\" but I don't hear alot of people talk about this one.HIGHLIGHTS:1.Paralyzing Ignorance2.Erroneous Manipulation3.Internal Evidence4.HumiliativeBut every song is great.

And most of the \\"technical\\" is a naive (boring) displayof some Jazz technique (chords, rhythym). The new Metallicaalbum is way better than anything Meshuggah can produce (probablywhy they sold > 1 million copies in a week? ...)Generally, the technical aspects of music are really just theunderlying mechanics and not much else. This group soundslike they're practicing for the real thing (as many of thethousands of Heavy Metal bands sound !)"},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Is this the same Meshuggah? What happened t the mindblowing Polyrythems? the structures? all the kickass timing? and the strong vocals? Jens Kidman is horrible on this album. The only awesome, most kickass thing ever is the inclusion of the None ep. Which you can't find anywhere. The none ep gets a 5. Contradictions collapse gets a 0. overall 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-release? Why not.","review":"This was originally released in 1991, and I must be honest and say I like their newer stuff better, simply because it's more complex. Part of the reason, I think, is that the vocalist is also a guitarist on this album. However, this is a very good progressive metal album, and if that's your thing, I would HIGHLY reccommend it. If you're not really into progressive stuff, I'd still reccommend it, 'cause these guys got mad skillz. If you can, catch Meshuggah live; they put on one helluva show, and reproduce their material and their sound extrememly well live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting SciFi premise","review":"As always Vance conjures up a truly original and interesting premise written in his own outlandish style. The story is intriguing, however I couldn't stop thinking how much better it would have been if it had been written by Philip K. Dick who would have given it so much more psychological depth. Perhaps that's not a fair criticism but I'm sticking to it.I love Vance because he is so original with his ideas and unselfconscious with his writing. You really can't ask for more than that from a good Science Fiction story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Vance's worst","review":"I am an avid Vance fan, so it pains me to say this, but this is one of his worst efforts. Since other reviewers seem to completely disagree with me, it's obvious that everyone has different tastes. However, I found this book to be very amateurish. The characterization is stale, the basic story is pretty outlandish, even for Science Fiction, and the ending is nothing short of silly.If you want to read some of his better books, pick up the \\"Demon Princes\\" series, the \\"Alastor\\" series, or \\"To Live Forever\\".

My wife and I were glad when it was over, hoping that it would become more positive at the end.There was too much stupid and pointless physical fisticuffs between the families. The lighting was miserably dark and drab. Helen Mirren was wasted. Helena Bonham Carter acted like a piece of wood throughout the film, or like someone who didn't want to be in it in the first place.

What this comes down to in overly simple terms is that we need to be aware that other people have points of view that are not identical to ours, but are not all that distant, either. In other words, we should pay attention to, and take seriously, what others have to say. Saul believes that when we make wealth our primary goal, we ignore the differences presented by others and force the world into our vision of it. This makes for dullness. He has a great point; we don't reach the good life by marching to our own beat. We get their by sharing shoes with others. The book can be frustrating at times, since he digresses every now and then.

This book seems to go into minute detail about how you use the tools, get the effects, etc etc. I can hardly wait to try it out! So, I'm not at all sure why it got a bad review. Yes, it teaches by walking you throughh projects, but obviously you can apply the knowlege any which way you want.

Although this book does have some basic techniques I thought the book was adapted to making art. The stamping section left a lot to be desired. uses everyday objects to make dots. In the stamping section which how large yardage is usually made she drew a farm scene. I would of like to known how to use blocks to repeat a pattern not just a single dot. Keep looking if you can only draw stick figures, but if you are already a painter or good at drawing and are looking for a new medium then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing introduction to technique of Batik","review":"Rosi is an extremely talented artist but her book is not a good introduction to the techniques of Batik.

It would be if it wasn't extremely noisy. In my experience (a trial run before the party) it was so noisy as to be distracting. It was impossible to get it exactly level so the chocolate did not flow correctly. It was an expensiive toy that needs a lot more work in design and function. I returned it.

I had first heard this Requiem as a live small ensemble performance, and then purchased the full, Romantic-scored, de los Angeles version, which wasn't too bad. I also listened to the Kathleen Battle on DG version, which I didn't like so much because of its pondorous tempo. This Naxos release is, as mentioned, a much purer, less bombastic performance, and more moving because of it. The balance of instruments, vs organ, vs voice is excellent (in the other recordings mentioned, the organ gets swallowed up), and the voice quality of the soloists is fantastic. I especially liked the bass-baritone. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Audible","review":"Do not buy this recording. The quality is very poor.

Most sites that mention this album describe it as an \\"industrial/experimental noise\\" type of venture.

This is not to say that the songs are bad, taken for what they are, However, this does not save this album form suffering from a very dated late 80's new \\"alternative\\" sound.

I usually turn it off when I'm not using it but I've forgotten it on for few days and it didn't get terribly hot as I read on some other review about it, it was slightly warmer than usual but not even in the \\"hot\\" category.overall it's good, I have nothing to complain about (yet) and I would buy the same brand if I need more space especially that it has a very good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Hard Drive","review":"I looked at a lot of hard drives and this one is doing a great job.

Now I have a current back up for my iMac and I don't have to think about it. Great product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic hard drive add-on","review":"This was my sixth Iomega and I've been pleased with all of them. Because of the FAT32 formating the drive actually comes with about 465 usable gigabytes. This was the first Iomega USB drive I've bought that didn't come with any backup software, but I didn't miss it. In fact, I stopped using the Iomega software that I already had, since the backup programs built into the XP operating system works just as well. If you just want inexpensive plug and play extra storage at a nice price it's hard to see how you could go wrong with the Iomega 500 gigabyte USB hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value....Better than expected...","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing, but bought anyway. I can tell you, the complaints I've seen on here were farthest from reality with what I received. Noisy? I can't even hear it. Overheating? Not mine. Plugged it right in, reformatted to NTFS, which took no time at all, and started backing up files. It was as simple as that. No problems, no noise, no overheating. Great looking brushed aluminum case. Probably the best value I've received on Amazon. If you're on the fence about purchasing, I'd say go for it. Consumer Reports ranks Iomega at the top for a reason. This drive is just another example of a great quality product at a good price.UPDATE: Just purchased another one of these hard drives. Works perfect for use as an external drive to my DVR. HD movies require additional space as compared to Standard Definition movies. This drive works perfect for this application, especially considering the space available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Unfortunately amazon.com wouldn't let me give it zero stars.

The drive lasted me about 5 months. I noticed a warning sign when my OS said it had to index the drive after it was working fine all those months. The following day, the drive would not mount. It would turn on and make a cracking popcorn noise but never show up on the desktop. This was my easy method of backup. Fortunately I have data stored on both external drives and DVD data disks, so no real loss of data occurred. However it is taking me days to get all of my data back onto my main hard drive to begin the Time Machine Process with a new drive from a well trusted company called Western Digital. I have never had a problem with Western Digital and have four of them on my computer now. This was my first, and LAST IOMEGA product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems, Problems","review":"This drive does at great job of keeping you data. It is a hassle and a half getting it to work.

I bought it to use with Apple's Time Machine feature of OS X 10.5.It was difficult to get it to work with Time Machine because you do need to repartition the drive as an Apple partition and the supplied USB cable may be too flimsy: I was getting a lot of \\"device was not properly put away\\" errors. After switching to a sturdier cable, I stopped getting the message. Of course, I also repartitioned the drive, so I can't swear the cable was solely to blame.But once everything was set, it works fine.

Actually, worse than useless because they have large amounts of data locked up in them so they are really quite a liablility.

The whole cd sounds like he either lost his edge or he was just looking for a crossover cd. It kills me to say all of this because I am a huge fan of Peter Tosh.

The production design is very stage-like. The first time I saw it, I felt I was watching a tightly, but perfectly composed piece. It was, of course, adapted from a stage play and unlike other film adaptations that use the medium of film to break out of the proscenium, the design of this film is contained. It serves to contain the dramatic tension and the pressure the characters are under. The script is beautifully taut. There is a good lesson in this classic, questions on which we should reflect when it comes to putting our people in harm's way. It shows the terrible burden of the few who are at the fulcrum between the policy makers, always far away from the battle, and the men and women on the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic study in leadership","review":"Another classic in leadership ... not as good as 12 O'Clock High ... but a close second."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspiring acting","review":"What struck me most about this movie is the uninspiring acting. Many times it seemed that the actors were just reading their scripts. Little or no emotion and empathy; they didn't become their characters. Clark Gable included.For example, the plane that was coming in for a landing with both pilots injured or dead. I believe the navigator was flying. The tone of his voice was like Ben Stein. If you're not used to flying a plane, it's all shot-up, and your crew is dead/injured, then you're probably a bit on edge. This fella sounded as bored and nonchalant as can be.In my opinion,Twelve O'Clock High (Special Edition)is a MUCH better movie. Superb acting. And it has to do with the same kind of war situation.Command Decision was so lackluster that I dozed off a couple of times; and near the end (maybe 20 minutes left), I just turned it off, because I didn't care how it ended.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on \\"Listmania!

He's freaking rich, he's changed the way television does business, and he doesn't seem to make a wrong move careerwise. But unlike other self-help authors who use adventure anecdotes without having any experience of their own, Burnett has put himself out there. I was surprised to see that he was on the front lines in the Falklands War, finished ninth in the Raid Gauloises, and personally scouts each Survivor location and pre-runs each Eco-Challenge course. The guy's not a wanna-be, he's the real deal. His words on success are worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for Mark Burnett!","review":"I'm wondering if \\"Mooresville, NC\\" even read this book.

I'm on chapter four, and I personally see Burnett's life-view refreshing. Unlike other self-help/success stories I've witnessed, so far I see no signs of self-pity or \\"martyrism\\". Burnett seems to sincerely appreciate whatever opportunities he's had in life. Obviously, he's doing something right to have created/produced Eco-Challenge and produced \\"Survivor\\".

Only results count2.) Have the courage to fail3.) Choose teammates wisely4.) Perseverance produces character5.) Be right or be wrong, but make a decision6.) Set achievable goals7.) Try to go above, beyond, and then even further.Mark writes how his life didn't go as planned, and while he received some big breaks, they were more about positioning himself to receive them and make them happen than simply luck. If he wasn't willing to try anything, he'd have let opportunities pass.It's a good read. The man was a soldier, a nanny, a t-shirt seller, an insurance agent, a credit card banker, a three times competitor in the Raid Gauloises, the producer and scouter for the Eco-Challenge race, and finally the mastermind behind Survivor.

Lovely illustrations.The only downfall is that the book is a little too complex and long for young children. There is no actual story - just a relaying of possible scenarios you might encounter with a new baby. It would have been nice if they wove a story around the events to keep young children engaged. My son was bored (3 yrs) and disinterested in this book when I read the original text - so I wrote a short rhyme for each page instead and he enjoys the book much more now.I would probably give this book 3 stars for the story and text but the attachment parenting illustrations and depictions of baby breastfeeding, cosleeping etc push this book over to a 4 star book for me. Overall, it is a comforting, positive depiction of a new sibling and worth putting in your shopping basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fabulous, realistic book!","review":"I love this book! It explains to older siblings why mama always has to nurse the baby, hold the baby, sleep with the baby.

After rolling like a ball and single leg circles, Mari leads you right into the series of five, increasing the intensity by adding a second set of faster repetitions to each move. Other exercises included in this workout are leg kicks, back stretch, child's pose, the neck pull, the jackknife, swimming, several teaser variations, heel beats, and some of the side kick series. You'll end with a few additional side kick exercises performed on the knees (tough!) and finally the seal.

At the same time, while I found many of the secondary characters nicely developed and interesting, I was left cold by two of the main characters, Arthur and Maria, and perhaps they would have meant more to me had I read the whole trilogy. The gypsy angle seemed forced and would better have been edited out.In any event, the major reason for reading this novel is the sparkling conversation, whether it be about the personal, or about painting and especially opera; aesthetics, criticism, music, theater, myth, current and historical perspectives and stagecraft are all discussed in a fun manner, and all are germane to the plot. The novel is truly an intellectual romp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Indeed","review":"After having read The Rebel Angels and What's Bred In The Bone, and enjoying both of them immensely, I was terribly disappointed in this final book in what finally wound up being the Cornish Trilogy.

Words like \\"shady, nebulous, sordid\\" appear on every page, but the actions described are pretty typical/boring and not that crazy. i.e, some treasurer in Connecticut gets caught in a bribe involving a 750 Million dollar investment, and 10 million gets eventually funneled to Carlyle group, who cares? If anything it shows a witch hunt against the firm.Despite the language, the book either implies 1) Briody could not find any real dirt or 2) Carlyle Group may have a tremendous conflict of interest but to date, it has not done anything that bad..that can be proven.A poor treatment of an important topic.

However the author's case would have been much more compelling had he simply stated the facts and not editorialized so much. The result makes you feel like it's a crackpot conspiracy theory. His liberal use of adjectives and obvious melodrama to make us think something horribly sinister is afoot made me bitter toward journalists, rather than his intended target, the Carlyle Group.

Facts stated in the first few chapters are often repeated later on in the book and you end up asking yourself, ''yeah so what?''. Not clear what the author's angle is, he doesn't appear to have any special information on the interworkings of Carlyle and remains just an outsider compiling information easily available from various sources. Ultimately the book fails to tell a cohesive story and instead results in a semblance of newspaper articles or magazine features with the author's views often repeated and reiterated throughout the book in a monotonous and droning voice with not the slightest bit of climax.However, if you are rather simple minded and a non business oriented individual, you may find the book's lack of factual basis and meaning is quite just your speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iliterate writer and editors","review":"This is ,without comenting on the content,is one of the most poorly written books in the current catalogs.Our concern should be focused on the educational system that turns writers, editors and publishers loose to clutter our intellects with this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I found this book in the business section of a local bookstore.

Though it's subtitled \\"Inside the Secret World of the Carlyle Group\\", the author never actually gets inside the company. In fact, he plainly states that anyone even remotely associated with the Carlyle Group refused to speak with him. What he provides, instead, is a summary of the any public news clippings about the Carlyle Group in the last 15 years and a lot of supposition and speculation about what was going on behind the scenes while the news was happening.On top of the lack of data and facts in the story, the author tends to repeat himself, describing the same situation over and over again, often using the same language.Overall, there's not a lot of meat to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vast Left Wing Conspiracy","review":"First, this book is not for business types. The book glances over the financial details of every deal. Only midway through do you even get a hint of the group's profitability- rumored at 46% year over year.Second, the author is very biased. He uses so much innuendo and makes so many slippery slope arguments, that I am unsure what is true and what is conjecture.Ultimately, if you are an anti-globalist, this book is for you. Believe me, all your fantasies are confirmed in this book. If you are a level headed, this book isn't worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"Just when I thought What Should I Do With My Life was the worst business book of the year comes this truly nauseating \\"examination\\" of the Carlyle Group. When people think negatively of me living in NYC, it's often because they imagine people living the life so carefully dissected in this smarmy book. The big question is: why would people CARE about the inside story of this nasty organization? When will books celebrating the successes of humanitarian organizations get the marketing dollars the publisher is devoting to this nasty piece of s--- get?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it before you vote","review":"If you've ever wondered why a conservative like George W Bush enjoys spending so much money, this book will make it perfectly clear. Through his father's association with The Carlyle Group, our nation's 13th largest contractor, today's government spending turns into tommorow's future inheritance for the President of the United States.In this book, Dan Briody lays down the history of The Carlyle Group and its all-star lineup (Iran-Contra era big-shots like Bush Sr., James A. Baker, Frank Carlucci, et. al) from their first scammy tax deals to their watching the September 11 attacks with Osama Bin Laden's brother!This need-to-know information must be seen by all before the November elections, so read the book and decide for yourself, then get the word out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4-year-old daughter LOVES Princess Dinosaur","review":"We have been in love with Princess Dinosaur at our house for over a year now--and now we get to enjoy her in a second book! The illustrations are what make these two books so wonderful. They perfectly capture the energy and personality of the Princess Dinosaur character. The stories are simple and straightforward. It's the character that brings us back again and again. I'd recommend this book for anyone with an energetic 3-6 year-old girl in their life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This movie was such a waste of my time even watching it.

But rounding up from 1 minute to 15 (as the authors claim is \\"OK'd\\" by the ABA), is totally unethical. Beware of following the authors' advice on this point--round up to the nearest minute=ok.

Yes, it does contain a large number of excellent illustrations from artists who obviously know how to get the best out of illustrator, but there is very little information on the techniques used to produce such illustrations for the novice user. As someone trying to get to grips with Illustrator, I would recommend Deke McClellands \\"Real World Illustrator 8\\" as a far better (and wiser) way to spend your money. It has an excellent hands-on approach to getting to grips with the complexity of Illustrator.

Socio-political stories, geared towards appeasing left-leaning professors, that do nothing to enhance the topic at hand found in many of today's \\"business\\" textbooks are thankfully wholly absent here.

The brushes are recessed, with only a quarter inch or so sticking out from the plastic casing. The thing that really got to me about this product though, is that it did not come with doggy toothpaste.

The Ross & Adler score (same team that brought us \\"Damn Yankees\\") is tuneful with great singing and dancing (thank you Fosse) from everyone. I never get tired of Pajama Game because it is timeless. Sure, no one hardy ever wears pajamas anymore, that's the nostalgia aspect about this musical that is so endearing. An Old fashioned love story surrounding a factory labor dispute makes for good theater with a lot of laughs to boot.

Even though the people at Pioneer had little to work with, 2\\" 38 year old videotape and monophonic sound, the results are simply breathtaking.

These 2 movies were just fun, enjoyable entertainment for an evening. The Great Outdoors would be great for any ages and good family entertainment. Uncle Buck is fun for older kids as very young children might not understand some of the humor. The 3rd movie in this collection, Going Berserk, was just plain awful. It seemed like they made it up as they went along with alot of very juvenile jokes about certain male anatomy. It was just plain stupid. John Candy was just too talented for the likes of the movie Going Berserk. I recommend this DVD because of the first 2 movies, Uncle Buck and Great Outdoors.

F1 fans in the US of A will know of Steve from his commentating of F1 races on Speed Channel (with Bob Varsha and David Hobbs). Steve demonstrates the same level of skill in describing technical detail to the 'amateur' in this book as he does on television.Anyone who has dreamt of working for a F1 team will enjoy reading the details of Steve's professional life and his trials and tribulations in getting into an F1 team. His descriptions of the working conditions for mechanics would surely put some folks off the idea of being an F1 race team mechanic.All-in-all, a good read - well recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, interesting, patient and adaptable!","review":"Mr Matchett is already one of my favorite commentators for F1, along with Mr Hobbs! This is a great book that reveals the true life behind the scenes of a formula 1 team; it displays the team members realistically, dispeling many of the myths and assumptions. The technical aspects are very well explained and extremely interesting, presented in a simplistic way so that even novice fans will understand. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author's view on how all problems in life can be solved by being patient and adaptable should inspire anyone to pursue their dreams. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the scenes","review":"Well written and captivating. I could not put the book down. If you want to know Formula 1 as it truly is, then you must read this book, which is full of anecdotes and funny as well. Steve Matchett opens a window into a world that we would otherwise never really suspect. Behind the glamour of F1 are the people who work insane work schedule to make it happen. The mechanics are the very core of this elite racing industry, yet we hardly ever hear from them so this book is a little gem in its own right.He does write about the team managers, technical chief director, the drivers etc...but always from his own personal experience, which makes this book truly special. There are stories about Patrese, Piquet, Mansell, Schumacher, Stepney, Briatore and many others. I am still laughing at Martin Brundle's comments about the car's \\"speedboatiness\\" and \\"stage-coachy\\" quality!If Mr. Matchett decides to write another book, I will put it on my To Read list without any hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, fun, easy read--just as expected","review":"Great book about Steve Matchett's early years as a mechanic, how he got his start in F1, and his successful career working with names like Schumacher, Brawn, and Mansell. Easy, fun read for any F1 fan. Steve Matchett seems like the kind of guy I'd like to drink a beer with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worthy read for the F1 buff","review":"I really enjoyed this book.I've read a lot of books on F1, and as Matchett mentions in his book, most center around the drivers and the race action. There's very little very good material that allows one to explore what happens with the rest of the team, especially, the mechanics, those men taking care of the car.I found this book to be an excellent read. Matchett is a rounded individual and quite a well developed personality. These qualities empowered him to write with a very insightful point of view. With a point of view that successfully reaches the heart and minds of non-technical readers.I highly recommend this book for all those with a deep interest in the sport. I'll no longer be looking in the pit garage at the mechanics and the ongoing work around a pitstop in the same way. Much respect is due to the mechanics and the hard work they put into a successful F1 team."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining F1 read","review":"Finally, a book about life in F1 that looks at the mechanics and operations side of this business. Enjoyable story telling, without the reader being led down overly technical back alleys of the sport.

I was unfortunate enough to have taken a class taught by Shenk himself with his own text book - always an ethically questionable situation anyways.

Perhaps he is just that much more intelligent than the rest of us, but in any case, this book a less than ideal tool for learning calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have osteoporosis and have been using OsteoPeak for over 2 years. My recent bone density showed a worsening in my numbers after 2-1/2 years, from -2.5 to -2.7 for the hip and from -2.0 to -2.3 for the lumbar spine. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Perhaps it would be worse if I wasn't taking OsteoPeak, but I thought this product was supposed to increase bone density, not just slow down the loss. Because I'm not sure what effect it has had, I can only give it 2 stars. My doctor wants me to take Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, or Miaclacin, but I said no. I am now taking 1000mg a day of the mineral strontium which is proven to increase bone density. But don't take it with calcium, because the strontium won't be absorbed if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even NON-Disco Fans Will Dig This. Surprisingly Excellent!","review":"I was never a particular fan of disco music. I liked some of the songs...many of them were just awful & in our faces for too many hours of each day...BUT...the songs that were selected for this movie were superb. They pulled what was quite a cheap film into a different stratosphere.Boz Scaggs' best songs, Donna Summers' best songs, Diana Ross's sexy: 'Love Hangover', whoever chose the music for this movie knew what he was doing. Shame the guys who made the retrospective '90s movies about the '70s disco scene, didn't take a leaf out of his book.I especially liked the wonderful Bill Withers song, 'She's Lonely' & still love it to this day. It was originally just a 'B' side, but it was brought to its well deserved life by this film. I'd recommend this album to people for that track alone. Plus the FANTASTIC O'Jays, also their best song, 'Backstabbers.'The excellent theme song by Marlena Shaw is melancholic & powerful.A top notch collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A goodbar soundtrack","review":"Practically all the tunes are catchy.

If you're an absolutely die-hard Peter Tosh fan, you may want this. If not, you're better of getting these albums first: \\"Legalize It,\\" \\"Equal Rights,\\" \\"Bush Doctor,\\" or \\"Complete Captured Live.\\" Don't waste your time or money on this unless you absolutely can't live without everything Peter Tosh recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful book for all levels of writers and editors...","review":"This cogent little volume lays out the essentials of writing good prose.

No revelations about fashion, body type, or style, and actually very little of any substance. Nothing that a woman with an ounce of common sense hasn't already figured out. You get more actual fashion advice from the average Oprah magazine.(And oh by the way, when Eleanor Roosevelt said \\"You must do the thing you think you cannot do\\", I doubt she was talking about trying on tops.)In a nutshell- don't buy this book!

SonyStyle originally refused to take it back because I've had it for more than 30 days. Finally, they have called me back and accepted a return.

See Arnold Dallimore's marvelous biography of Whitefield. The fact that Whitefield and the Wesleys could maintain such warm Christian fellowship to the end of their lives, even in the face of significant theological differences, is a fact much to be commended.Apart from a few minor points understandable in light of my differing theological perspective, I would recommend this film to all, evangelicals and otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air Force","review":"Bought on Black Monday for $18.98, about half the $10 less the price of \\"Air Force\\" (1943) alone.

Being that it was made during the uncertain days of the war, it takes some license with the circumstances of events, but it is an entertaining, spirited and flag-waving film that carried the underlying message that we need to work together toward achieving the goal of winning the war.

This book is very readable for what was originally, I beleive, a master's thesis.

Riddle was known to tailor arrangements to individual players. Then there was the studio craft of the Capitol Record engineers; in the later recordings that sound featured lots of reverb & a fat bass guitar. Riddle went to the studio with an ear to recording hit instrumental singles, & he had a number of them in addition to many releases that didn't chart. Albums were assembled around them. Everything got the Riddle studio treatment, from classics of the Great American Songbook to TV themes & corny novelties. Riddle was a pop artist.

The author is only too willing to assume the worst about any real or imagined discrepancies between Acts and Paul's letters while rarely making any allowances for cultural, geographic, or age related causes of these discrepancies.

Her husband (David Niven) is a playwriter who has been hired by a newspaper as a play critic. Not everyone likes him now, but now that he is getting publicity he prefers to stay in the city. Doris Day's dream is to buy a house in the country. That is what they have been planning. They finally buy a big house in the country, but adjusting to country life is different for everyone. Kathryn Card (\\"I Love Lucy\\") has a small role. Doris sings \\"Que Sara Sara\\" which she first sang in \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" (1956). The song was later used in the tv series The Doris Day Show.Please Don't Eat The Daisies became a tv series (1965-67) starring Pat Crowley and Mark Miller with Kim Tyler, Brian Nash, Jason Fithian and Jeff Fithian. Ellen Corby played the maid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"While I remain a fan of Doris Day in her great comedies (Pillow Talk, Send me no Flowers, Lover Come Back), I must say this one was a big disappointment!

When watching it you see a bunch of unruly kids and a toddler whom gets locked in a cage most of the time. I can't recall laughing at anything during the movie. I couldn't stand her husband especially when she is left alone at a party and he is staring at another woman's butt on screen. It just rubbed me the wrong way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Don't Eat the Daisies - DVD","review":"Love all the Doris Day movies. I also love David Niven. They make a great pair together.

David Niven is so divine, and together he and Doris D, tell a great story of marriage, money, and what popular really means!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Getaway","review":"This reviewer always discounted Doris Day as a Gidget like character, but in this role she is charming. Her acting reminds me somehow of Cary Grant, with all the physical quirks and she comes off as not a daisy dreamer but a real person. Niven is of course charming. Roles are not as uptight as expected. And the story somehow is quite modern: How success can sometimes come between a couple. Ask anyone who has had a successful spouse. There is always a price. But in this movie, the ending is perfect. And I loved the kid in the cage... but you'll have to watch it to understand that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doris & David a No Show","review":"I like both of these actors but disappointed in the the miscasting of David Niven. He hardly shows up as a father which is a major theme in the book.J"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Hideous film. The whole film is about poor Doris Day and her \\"challenges\\". What challenges? This film was not at all funny or engaging. Rent/buy it only if you're a Doris Day or (yawn!) David Niven fan. Fans of the great comic actress Patsy Kelly beware - she only has a small part and that role is wasted. What a shame, perhaps had Patsy Kelly been better utilized, this would have been a funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daisy flowers with affection","review":"Doris Day has done many fun movies.

It's a good enough entry in the Doris Day canon, and there is unmistakable chemistry between Day and Niven. That said, it falls short of Jean Kerr's bestseller on which it is based by missing the tone. The later TV show to my mind more captures the sense of the book, although usually movies come closer with the follow up TV shows a pale imitation of the original book.My title comes from the book Kerr wrote after Please Don't Eat the Daisies, both books being unaccountably out of print. Both books also, in my opinion, being well worth tracking down. With this film out on DVD, the TV series, and maybe even the revival of Kerr's books, may not be far behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Losing Dad, Daisy","review":"I have a confession to make about this film; I had the appreciation for my local library having this on the shelf only to be recognized by my daughter. In turn, this became a favorite overnight. Being shackled by the time and cinema regulations, the film is unable to address the realities of choice, and I sure wish it had. \\"Please Don't Eat The Daisies\\" stars Doris Day, David Niven and Richard Hayden (Sound of Music). Unfortunately in the 1960's characters portrayed in films were viewed as asexual yet the film is based with the very possibility of an affair and revenge gone awry. Had this film been created today, an affair would have occurred and the effect would have been devastating. Day, Niven and Hayden are magnificent as are the four children, the move and the dog. Doris Day's chemistry with the children is like Julie Andrews in \\"Sound of Music.\\" David Niven's temper and act are a riot coupled with Richard Hayden's oh so subtle revenge. So, try it you just might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners and experienced both","review":"This book gives readers a thorough understanding of what Flow Blue is, when it was made, how it was decorated and what it is worth.

Read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that you cannot put down","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. When I first tried reading it, it took me 3 attempts to get past the first 2 chapters. But, once I made it past that hurdle I got so into this book with it's wonderful cast of characters, the time periods it covered and the setting of a small town that was growing that I wanted it to go on and on even though it was a pretty hefty book, over 1,000 pages. I have just purchased another copy because in some move or another I lost my original copy. I am ready to re-read this wonderful book - January is a perfect time to do this - the rush is gone, life is quiet and it's a wonderful opportunity to get into a book such as this one that just transports you right out of your living room into another time and era and mingle for awhile with some very interesting people. I cannot recommend this book enough for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a relaxing read! Love this book!","review":"I bought this book simply because it was thick and I wanted a good long book. That was probably 9 or 10 years (and 3 kids) ago. I just love this book. It is a long, lazy, relaxing, easy read. It's warm and fuzzy. It's historical. It's timeless. There's romance and gossip. It's a non stressful read - if that makes any sense. There is no great climax, there is no point in the book where you already know exactly how the rest of the book will read. I don't know how many times I've read this book. Too many to count. I have read the book in half, which is fine, because its kinda heavy on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stroll rather than a race","review":"I read this book in 1984 when it was first published in paperback. I loved it. I found a copy in the discard area at the Library (in good condition) and I am starting to read it again. The Berkley addition published in 1984 has everything the original hardcover edition had. The original front and back covers were beautiful and I am sorry that the reprint version put a different cover on it. This is a long story but it is more like a stroll through the park rather than a race down the hill. I loved the beginning of the chapters that list the old and new members of the Waynesboro Women's Club. It gave me a sense of excitement knowing that I was going to meet new characters. Give it a try - you might find it very enjoyable and hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have read this book twice --best family tale ever!","review":"Anyone who loves history and who loves good writing will love this book. I rarely cry whenI read but there are many times in Ladies that propel one to tears! I'm an avid reader and don't usually read anything a second time but ten years later I couldn't resist getting re- acquainted with the beloved characters again. Today's Oprah book club is a sham compared to the level of intellectualism that these women enjoyed in their reading club!

The characters and plot were uninteresting and flat and the story never picks up the pace you expect it to. It just meanders slowly through the lives of the townsfolk, with hundreds of pages of unimportant detail in between each occasion of interest. Although many reviewers have called it inspirational, it didn't find it to be so. Certainly many things happened in these women's lives, but their emotions and the impact of the occurances was rarely discussed more than matter of factly.I would not recommend this book. If you're looking for something inspiring about women's lives and relationships, try something by Alice Walker or Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a \\"Lifetime\\" made-for-TV movie","review":"Very unchallenging and lightly pleasant.

Pick a long lazy summer to curl up in a hammock and emmerse yourself in 50 years of history and culture. Now don't get me wrong, this is not a boring history book, it is the story of a small town and the people that live there.

This is a must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Ladies of the Club","review":"I ordered this book because my Grandmother was one of those ladies who was in a book club in the time of Helen Hooven Santmyer.I found it a wonderful book.

I, too, didn't want to see it end. Fantastic til the very last sentence. I feel Santmyer had to have a flow chart to keep all the characters straight, but it was so wonderful. Considering it's length, that's quite a feat. I have actually read it twice now. And I wouldn't mind reading it a third time. Now how many books can you say that about that are over 1000 pages?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read over and over","review":"I occasionally \\"inherit\\" a book from friends or family - this is one of those books. Most likely I would not normally have chosen to read this book. The title, cover, and description on back tend to make me think it is a ladies' romance novel, when in fact it is an amazing story of real life set in by-gone days. Yes, there is romance and passion; However, that is a path through the story, not the story itself. The book is, indeed, a little slow to start...but once you are in the story, you understand why. This novel follows the lives of characters from High School through Grandmotherhood, with enough depth to give the reader a sense of real life during several past eras in America...and what life must have been like during each transition from one era to another. The best recommendation I can give is that this book sets on my bookshelf because I read it again and again - about every couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santmyer delilghts!","review":"This epic novel envelopes your heart from beginning to end. She weaves a story of strong women whose lives take different paths after graduating from a finishing school at the end of the Civil War. It is wrought with tragedy and triumph. It spans the lifetime of the characters and shows the quiet strength and influence of women in a small town. If you like epic dramas, this novel will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Piano Sonata is Amazing!","review":"And I will repeat myself: The Piano Sonata is Amazing! I can't understand why this amazing piano piece, from all of grieg's piano music, is so forgotten. Each and each movement is so unique with it's rhythems, the way Grieg spreads all over the keyboard (mainly in the second and fourth movement), and much more. Each movement carries you into different worlds and moods. I bought this performance mainly because of the price, and because I wanted a reliable performance of the sonata (Einar Steen-N?kleberg is the editor of Greig's piano music for Henle), unlike the perfrmance of Glenn Gould that I already have, which is also great but not so accurate, and I didn't regret! This is a recommended purchase for everyone interested in great and not so well known Classical Music (My piano teacher, for example, didn't know this sonata, until I lent her the Glenn Gould performance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future Pulitzer Prize Winner","review":"Claire Davis, up and coming novelist: I've read the advance edition (though it hasn't been released yet) and barring any changes to the final text, I have to say this book will be worth your time: not only does Ms. Davis brilliantly grasp the fundamentals of poetic compression of language, she has a sense of narrative flow that, as I run around my kitchen making coffee, making cream cheese & avocado sandwiches, the sense of the joy and tenuousness of life is heightened: highly recommended.

He was obviously eccentric and probably difficult to get on with, but his vision, genious and charisma are truly remarkable. His discoveries and inventions were so staggering and so important, that they shook the world then, and still do today.It is most interesting to note that much of the technology, he discovered and pioneered, seems to have disappeared and gone underground. . .

It's higher on inspiration than on information. I'm a Maxwell fan, and typically enjoy his style and insights.It's not that the material is bad, but the book's description and some of the other reviews here led me to expect a lot more meat on the hard work involved in choosing, building, developing, empowering, and leading a team to do something significant. After reading the book I found it gave very little concrete information on any of this - spending far more time pitching the need for teams. Even scanning through it quickly a second time I had a hard time coming up with a concrete takeaway idea to put into practice.If you can get it here at a bargain price (as I was able to) it's not a bad read, but just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Cheap price... but horrible formatting","review":"A little while ago, I bought the E-book version of this for my kindle for something like $2.99.

For the first 6 mos or so, It worked like a dream, and it took great pictures. I was elated! About the 7th month in or so, it just fell apart on me. My dream camera turned into a nightmare.I will 2nd what many others have already said. THIS CAMERA CANNOT FOCUS, ESPECIALLY INDOORS, THUS PICTURES ARE BLURRY AND UNCLEAR MOST OF THE TIMES!!! Even when the subject is sitting as still as a statue and I am holding the camera still, the pictures look as if I had been swinging it back and forth as I took the picture.Also the delayed reaction is terrible! It seems to take more time to capture a picture than most other cameras, I have compared it to. ( I tested out cameras of my family and friends.)For this reason, you usually miss the moment you were attempting to capture.Consider yourself warned before purchasing this camera. It is a financial risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focusing problems","review":"Overall, this is a decent camera, but its problems focusing are an issue and so I would NOT recommend buying this camera. Before I start, let me state that I have read the directions and gone through all the settings in the camera. I've done my best to rule out the human error.The picture quality and colors look good, when they are in focus. However, any time that the light, inside or outside, is a bit tricky the camera cannot focus. As an example, I took 5 pictures of a lit christmas tree and all came out blurry. I took another 5 pictures using a Canon Powershot S500 and all of them were perfectly clear. I'll admit that this is a tricky item to focus on, but the Sony DCS-P73 has trouble focusing whenever there is glare. It has ruined a number of shots... easy shots.So, if you are buying a camera for point and shoot... this one isn't it. This camera is a - (cross your fingers for a clear picture) - and shoot camera.I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory pictures","review":"I bought this camera after reading several positive reviews. I found that this camera has good features, is easy to use and has a battery charger. But to my dismay the picture quality was below par and didn't meet my expectations. The picture brightness with this camera is lower than a Nikon I had bought 18months ago. Most of the pictures appeared dim and a little dull wheras Nikon pictures at the same spot were brighter. I'm returning this camera. I will probably spend some extra dollars to buy a canon or a Nikon"},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret I bought this.","review":"For quite sometime lured by media publicity I thought Sony a good brand. But this was not at all true for digital cameras. I bought this P73 for myself and an HP 4 MP camera for my cousin much cheaper than Sony. Both 3x Optical zoom. The HP one was far better in image quality. Main problem is that photo quality is not so good. It lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. Also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera!!!","review":"I've had this camera for over 2 years now and it still takes beautiful pictures!

I returned it the next day and bought a Canon instead. The [sony] camera was *okay* but if you're picky about your photos like I am, don't get this camera. The quality isn't that great, neither is the flash. A semi-lit area would come out blurry and brown-tinted, if that makes any sense.

That's a life well-lived in the world of reading.It's all a matter of opinion, but a few of her suggestions were outright bombs where I labored to get to page 10 (Amazon probably will strike me down for saying so, but thank God the library's free). Then again, there were a few which more than made up for them-and which I'd never have tried otherwise. I was delighted to find a few of my own favorites among her lists, and some that I'd found to be blatantly missing.The important thing is to keep reading once you find an author or a style you love.

The book \\"Swimming in the Congo\\" is said to \\"give a picture of pre-independence Africa\\" when she means the Congo, which is now Zaire, and in \\"Continent for the Taking\\" she speaks of how \\"the West has abused and misused Africa for its own ends, with dire consequences for all Africans.\\"Africa is a continent, with 54 separate countries, each with their own histories, their own languages, their own struggles, their own governing or occupying bodies, their own cultures. All Africans are not the same.

It was impossible to tell from what she said which of the books I would actually enjoy reading. (Amazon lists and reader reviews are much more helpful.) Also, from those of the books she recommended that I had read, her taste is too all-inclusive for me. She seems to love everything, a lot of which I don't think is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I was so excited about reading The Book Lust having heard it reviewed on NPR. Bought the last copy at my local book store. HOWEVER, I became quickly disappointed immediately. There is no way to quickly reference countries or cities one might be travelling to or interested in learning about. I was interested in Spain and Portugal, so I went to the Table of Contents and the reference list in the back of the book. There was nothing listed about Spain or Portugal. Ms. Pearl might have written about one or both of the countries but the countries were not listed by name. One would have to read the entire book to find information pertaining to any particular country of interest. I'm sure she has interesting info to share, but the book is not organized in a way that would be user friendly. It's too bad that Ms. Pearl's vast knowledge of books written about particular parts of the world can not be utilized by the interested traveller easily.Dana"},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but terrifying","review":"This crib was wonderful, beautiful, and something my wife and I thought was a great investment. Then one morning we woke to a terrifying scream from our babys room. Running in we found our 7 month old baby standing at the edge with his leg stuck between the slats unable to get it back out. We had to lift him up slightly, twist his body, and then turn his leg in order to get his leg free. This has happened a couple times and is really scary. We have tried bumpers and now drape heavy blankets around the entire crib trying to prevent this from happening.

Laura Doyle succinctly describes some of the most cancerous aspects of modern marriage, and the negative consequences of feminist achievement that are generally taboo to mention. Her description of the inherent incompatibility of a woman maintaining the same type of control of her marriage as she has of her children and profession could have been written by our former (and failed)marriage counselor. The fact that so many women who have reviewed this book have found it threatening makes it all the more timely and topical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous and insulting to both men and women","review":"I struggled with anger during reading this book. It might say that it will help women to give up being a control freak but what it really does is telling them to give up all responsibility for their lives and be a blind follower. I am sorry but that is utter BS. If your only way to stay in your marriage is to follow the advice in this book, then you are not in a marriage. You are enslaved. Marriage is about partnership, about sharing the good and the bad and having an equal voice. It takes work and not surrender.I am now going to burn this book in the stove... if I can figure out how to turn it on!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Womanhood Circa 1801","review":"Doyle blathers on and on about how women need to give up control, abandon the myth of equality, relinquish the finances (if I took this particular piece of \\"advice\\", we'd be bankrupt and living in a tent!), etc. If a woman does everything in this book, the husband is the one who reaps all of the benefits, and the wife gets nothing!

I could not have been more disgusted. This book is a bunch of bunk. It supports the idea of dominance in a marriage and whether that dominance is on the part of the man or the woman it is wrong. Marriage is about a partnership. If you need help in your marriage this is not the book to read. Please people be partners and helpers to each other and not submissive or overpowering.

My couples therapist recommended I get The Surrendered Wife to support the work I'm doing with my boyfriend in therapy. I read the whole book, during which I I threw it across the room on more than one occasion, whilst writhing in laughter at the absurdity of the writings. The author assumes that all women are controlling witches who need only to cow tow to their mate to \\"make it all better\\". It gives advice more appropriate to a geisha than a woman in the 21st century attempting to solve relationship communication issues (unless of course you live in the middle east and are simply looking for advice on how to trim your burkha and serve your master).

The author seems to think that either of her two modes of marital practice--bitchy control freak [former] and submissive doormat [now] are the only two states married couples can function in. How about leaving the realm of the dysfunctional and try a healthier approach--mutual respect? A man who can recognize that the woman he married is intelligent, might know directions better than he, or has some expertise in finance or raising children, is not a man, he's a EUNUCH pretending to be a man. On behalf of my wife, a brilliant, funny, secure and loving woman with whom I am privileged to share life, I'd like to say BAH!

Ms. Doyle, should I ask my husband if its okay if I take the pill? What about shaving me legs? It is absurd to think that someone should have that much control over another person. There are ways to improve a marriage: communication and compromise; NOT surrendering! The women that believe what is said in this book must truly believe that women are CHATEL!

And you know that the minute he realizes you didn't tell him to turn, he'll blame you you for letting it go so far! Oh, and my husband doesn't want to do the finances, so, I guess I can't surrender that. I think this book was written with good intentions, but without a grip on reality!

The author apparently believes the only way to a healthy marriage is for women to subsume their own selves under a passive, agreeable facade.The section on submitting to sex at least once a week regardless of whether or not a wife is in the mood - and even if she has a medically-based problem getting aroused - was the point at which I concluded this book would hold the honor of being the first book in my life I ever threw in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrenedure Your Soul?","review":"I bought this book and read it simply because I wanted to see if it really was the biggest load of horse hockey that it had been described as being... and it was.Please allow me to tell you where these principles, as described in this book will lead you:You'll lose your soul and become someone you're not. Better to end up divorced and happily alone than to become the automaton of someone else.

A Surrendered Wife bravely and couragously commits to making a loving, nuturing marriage the most important goal of all -- and she will receive that and so much more. This book is easy to read, practical, and best of all it WORKS! Laura Doyle presents a way to get what you really want out of your marriage (intimacy) without compromising your true self. This is about giving up control in some areas of your relationship and in turn gaining the relationship you have been wishing for, working for, and trying to control for all a long. Do not mistake this book for backward or anti-feminist -- it is the exact opposite. This books allows women the freedom to be feminine and powerful.

You follow the formula and he will begin to transform within days (so will you)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too extreme","review":"I understand the premise here. However, every relationship is different and the approach this book describes is not really beneficial for either the wife or husband. I do agree that we at times forget to recognize all that our husbands do and feel they should be appreciated more (which is why I gave this a 2) but the book is behind in times. I recommend if you are seeking advice on how you should approach your relationship with your husband... talk to your hubby or Pastor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Just Disturbing...","review":"Upon hearing the title and the suggested content, I had to have a closer look at this book, and it was even worse than I had imagined. Its stuns me that in this day and age, some women still think they have to let men have all the power and make all the choices just to get along. Of couse your marriage will go \\"smoothly\\" if one of you submits! But, is a marriage that requires manipulation and some odd power game worth saving? I truly pity any woman who tricks herself into thinking that this absurd view of love makes her happy. How about trying an actual caring relationship between two thinking, feeling adults?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and try it before you reject it","review":"I saw the show that Dateline did on this author and book and I thought that it really made sense but seemed a bit extreme. I bought the book, read it and thought what have I got to lose? I have a very happy marriage, but it seemed that this would just make it better. The hardest thing for me to do was to turn over the finances. I've written the checks and handled the finances all my life, so that was the biggest step for me. What I've found is that it has been a great relief and altho my husband complained at first, now he is taking pride in handling it all. I am in my second marriage, but I think if I had read this book I would still be in my first and could have saved a lot of pain and heartache. Ladies pay attention, this book dares to say things that are not popular in our culture right now, but they work.

My husband wanted to simply wanted to put in a new phone plug one day and I did not understand why he got angry with him by saying \\"You can't do that!\\" I look back and realized he should know whether he could or could not, not I.This book is not about going backwards, its about seeing that its ok to respect the one who should be the closest person to you in the world!

Respect and submission are NOT synonymous. While there is no need to argue ALL the time, women should not be forced to censor themselves when they have an opinion. Compromise is the key word, not submission, by any means. If you love and respect your mate, then compromise, meaning fifty-fifty decision-making, is key to making any relationship work. Manipulating and playing mind games with your mate is not the answer. Grown-up communication is so much more than that, and is the only foundation for a solid and mature relationship.

And that's the way it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Gray's Sister?","review":"If I understood Laura Doyle correctly, a wife should treat her husband as if he were both child in need of constant reassurance of his competance and a father who knows best.

This may be the solution for violent criminals who require imprisonment for life ,however, I would hardly consider this an optimum condition for marriage.

When we are open to and respect the differences betewen husbands and wives, we will be awed by the foresight God had in creating a union such as this; a critical principle to making God's plan for marriage work. Critics will say this book exploits and demeans the intellect and conscience will of women--yet this narrow and short-sighted. This is not only about a wife 'surrendering' to her husband, but a husband surrendering to the needs of a wife.

For goodness' sake, both of my grandmothers handled the finances in their homes and both of their marriages thrived! And as a happily married woman whose marriage doesn't remotely fit the contours of Ms. Doyle's recommended version, I'm living evidence that other methods work. Why should all marriages follow the same rules? Everyone is different, and so are all relationships. Do what works for you. Not every man yearns to pay the bills. The key is to relinquish attempts to control other people in general--husbands, children, family, or friends--but, unlike Ms. Doyle, I don't believe that means you have to allow someone else to control you instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cannot be serious!","review":"The very thought that women should give financial control to their husbands even if they aren't good with money horrifies me.

Laura Doyle had a weak marriage and tried something that worked for her. GREAT! Much luck to her. That does not mean it will work for everyone. The biggest reason WHY 50% + OF MARRIAGES END IN DIVORCE IS DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATION. Period. This book advocates to \\"zip-the-lip\\" even more. Marriage is a partnership, not a one-way power-struggle.

The book starts off great, the cover is a nice composition and the circles are actually die cut circles in the white cover to show the colored circles underneath. After that about 2/5 of the book is devoted to critical analysis of Kandinsky. I could have done without this part in exchange for more artwork. The book itself is small in size for an art book which is a problem considering the complex compositions of Kandinsky's paintings. Once you get to the plates there is, unfortunately, too much white space around the images. So you effectively get reproductions that are postcard size---much too small to really enjoy the artwork. Because of the small illustrations I'm giving this just 1 star. There aren't a lot of Kandinsky books so you don't have much choice out there. I ended up passing on this and give it a recommendation only for the die-hard Kandinsky collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Fit.","review":"We have used a lot of these vents and have never had any trouble, but these do not fit tight and are already starting to come off.

The story held my attention from the first page to the last, and I reached the point at which I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it. Ms. Stout has done her homework well, and her portraits of the homeless, the cancer-stricken, and those who turn to alcohol for escape, ring true. As a commercial airline pilot, Ms. Stout brings a special authenticity to those parts of the book which involve flying, and some of the most gripping moments take place on board an airliner. I recommend Aardvark Memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very please","review":"I have bought several melissa and doug puzzles for my nieces and have been very happy.

Few books are able to draw you in and make you really care about the characters. This book had a ring of truth that let you feel for the heros and hate the villans. As simplistic as that sounds, isn't that what we are looking for in a great book? To be really interested and intrigued.Another great aspect of this book and the writer is that Mortensen takes you back in time. You feel that you are living that era and it helps to justify everything that the book is about. You say to yourself, this could really happen. Even in today's modern ship travel, you won't look at the operation of a ship the same.

If you don't think about your own values or don't care about social questions than this is not your movie. I liked the movie because it let me question my own values, about how much someone can push someone before that person snaps. Yea this is supposed to be based on a real life experience, but if you are watching it to try and get your thrills living via some type of murder this is not your movie, I don't remember once seeing blood. It is more about the Bernie, and what lead up to the incident, and how people responded to that incident. I personally feel the producer put a strong spin on the movie and would guess that the real life Bernie was somewhat different, but I will never know for sure. So I would recommend the movie, but only if you like movies with a social spin. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mockumentary Style","review":"I really don't like programs wherein the story is driven by fictional interviews about the main character.

You'll love it. However, this was our first time to stream a movie using the Amazon system and we were totally NOT impressed. This was supposed to be in HD but the picture was grainy and pixels blurred; nowhere near the quality expected or what we get from Uverse. Additionally, the pause, start, stop features were cumbersome and trying to backup or replay something caused the system to reset - not acceptable. The price was right at about $1.00 which I thought was oddly low but I'd rather pay more and get what I expected. We previously gave up on Netflix due to similar issues and lack of content.

I think this is Jack Black's best performance so far.The movie is presented in a documentary style, where comments about Bernie are made by real people who really know the character. But being a true story, it is unfortunate that the story must end the way it is. Had it been a fictitious story, a bit of twist in the end could make it a happy ending movie, because we, too, love Bernie so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that interesting","review":"Story line seems silly, I did not have any connection with the characters. lost interest in film pretty quickly. would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"made for t.v","review":"Awful movie, great acting.

If you are a fan of small, independent films, you will enjoy this one. But do not expect the typical Jack Black manic comedic performance. He is quite subdued here and very effective in portraying Bernie Tiede, an adored small town Texas mortician who befriends a wealthy widow, played by Shirley MacLaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. found it free on netflix after purchase","review":"Jack Black is a gift to the entertainment industry.

I enjoyed it partly because I remember the actual investigation and court case and also because I knew personally some of the local members of the cast. That was the first \\"reason\\" I wanted to see the movie. Jack is not one of my favorite actors, but he did an excellent job of his role in this film.

I'd love to see a Documentary about the same material (as it's a true story) . I'm keen on the whole cast really . If you are a Jack Black fan , i strongly suggest you see this picture . This may well be Jack's best performance yet ? It's unlike any other role he's done and he truly carries the film (in my opinion) .

It's like watching a metronome that speeds up occasionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This has got to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. A friend recommended it to me since I just moved to Texas. This is a clear example that men and women have different views of what funny is. It is based on a true story; one that really isn't funny. I'm not sure why someone thought this story would make a good comedy. It should have been make into a documentary, not made into a comedic movie. The best part of the movie...is when it was over. If you're a guy...this might be funny, but ladies...move on to something else; something with substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a documentary than a comedy","review":"While there were a few humorous moments throughout the movie it was definately not a comedy. I read the reviews out there which influenced my decision to buy the movie vs waiting until the rental was available. I would definately wait until the rental is available.

While interesting, again it is no comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to death!","review":"I went with my wife and another couple.

Please read about this film before you rent/buy. Because unless you enjoy a pointless non-climactic snore fest, this movie is not for you. It should be classified as a documentary that uses actors to recreate all dramatizations making up the film. To top all of this off it uses real people (directly interviewed and filmed with less quality i.e. no HD) who knew Bernie himself, which in my opinion makes it even more intolerable. What a waste of time. Fortunately it was forgotten from my minds eye as soon as my physical eyes where relieved of duty. However I must give it two stars as the acting, and only the acting made me stick it out to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"So long to get funny","review":"I did not buy it, simply rented it.

It wasn't a boring read. I grabbed this from the library and since it's a few things in there I wanted to keep up with, I'm just purchasing it used.

Although witty in a few places, it read very much like someone trying very hard to create something that just wouldn't come together. I'm a Brit living in Canada, and excused the parts on electronics that would have little value for anyone on this side of the pond, but the rest of the book was so utterly juvenile that it seemed written for a child.

We've been married for over 25 years and are looking forward to the next 25. And he's not a liar :) I'm assuming the never wear heels under 5\\" bit was tongue-in-cheek.

See some of the greatest minds of our times wrestle with this issue. Too often, Americans base very strong opinions on very little thought, background, or data.

The producers traveled the continental US and Japan to bring us conversations with those most aware of the incredible destruction of nuclear bombs. The US government continues to claim there was valid reason to drop not just one, but two, of these devices on Japan. I left this documentary with the thought that, sooner or later, someone else will find a \\"valid reason\\" for using a nuclear device.I highly recommend The Forgotten Bomb.

It is an important reminder of \\"what happened\\" at the end of WWII and how the impact of that has not stopped in 2012.

That aside, the photography is very nice and the plant descriptions are thorough and informative. I especially liked how each of these plants were used by native peoples was included.

It's easy to mock Shatner's infamous \`\`Shatnerian'' acting style on \`\`Star Trek'' and \`\`T.J.

When in close quarter combat, the enemy uses an extraordinarily annoying banzi charge that cannot be avoided. Coupled with the weak weapons, jungle environment that offers very limited visibility and long reloads, and EA has produced a repetitive and dare I say irritating game.That being said, the opening level was very cool - Pearl Harbor, Dec 7, 1941.

I said that I would remain dedicated to this series, but have since followed all the others & have switched over to the Call of Duty series. I still prefer the gameplay & storyline of the first three MOH games, but it would now take a lot to convince me to return to future releases of the MOH series.

I also want Call of Duty Finest Hour for PS2. I cant wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEED THIS SOO BAD!!!!","review":"I will keep this short and sweet. I absolutely need this game in my Medal of Honor arsenal. It has been way too long. I have resorted to starting up a new mission about a week ago on the older MOH when I say this I mean Allied assault + the two expansions, I swear that it is the only way to get enough MOH at one time because I can play for two hours at a time easily. That doesn't sound like much but I am also playing the Call of Duty-United Offensive expansion pack and have also been deep into Doom 3 (about 2 or 3 levels remaining), Painkiller, and Far Cry (also about 1 or 2 levels remaining),I am also greatly into the Age of Mythology series and the C&C Generals series, so I am truly doing whatever I can to get by until Pacific Assault gets released and like always with the MOH series I am sure that this will also be a great investment in both dollars and time taken from my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault","review":"This game is just awful. Extremely long load times, and choppy game play even on the most powerful of PC's. The forced registration took almost 12 hours to complete because EA's servers were down, and I could not play online until I registered. The multiplayer levels are rich in textures, but poor in gameplay. Having been a HUGE fan of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and Spearhead, I could not be more disappointed by the game. Call of Duty offers a much better multiplayer experience. I don't know what the folks at EA games were thinking, but they have a lemon on their hands with Pacific Assault. Its just a poorly designed game, and I don't think a patch will save this one from being $19.99 in a bargain bin in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game for a powerful computer","review":"Overall I really enjoyed the game. I just completed it over the Christmas and New Year Holidays. Like the original Medal of Honor, it ends abruptly, leaving you wanting more (hence the expansion packs). The graphics are good. All the effects are great. Historically it was awesome, from the campaigns to the weapons, everything (which was the reason I got it). The only thing I did not like was the fact that it includes a lot of video, which seems to slow the game down a lot. I was using a laptop with a 1.8Ghz processor and it took a long time to load in each level and to reload after being \\"killed\\". I have heard that laptops generally aren't a good machine to run a game on, but it's all I have. In addtion to the slow loading speeds the game would also stall and get stuck when there was increased action, such as many characters or a lot of shooting, explosions, etc.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over Substance","review":"My SYS SPECS: P4@3.0/800fsb ...RAM - 1gb DDR2 ...

Choppy/Jerky/Slow gameplay and the graphics weren't all that great. MOH:PA almost brought my machine to a slide-show gaming experience.I have virtually nothing running in the background + turned down my desktop resolution to 800x600.Games like Line of Sight:Vietnam; Deadly Dozen:Pacfic Theater and Marine Sharpshooter 2: Jungle Warfare all did a nice job with jungle/foliage, while keeping the SYS REQ within reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"something missing","review":"This game is about WW 2 in the pacific as the title indicates. In this game you follow your character from Pearl Harbor to the southern most point on the Japanese Islands. The major downpoint of this game is that you are more watching a Movie instead of actually playing a video game. Although you get some good playing time in, it isn't completely worth having to watch the videos inbetween playing time"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the European Medal of Honor","review":"I was expecting a huge gaming shoot-em-up on the Pacific side of things, since the first three \\"trilogy\\" of the European side was a blast. But this game left me with my mouth open, wondering what was that? This is more cinematic storytelling with lots of videos, and doesn't have the shoot-em-up excitement like before. All they had to do was recreate the same game play for the Pacific side. Maybe it couldn't be done without the buildings and ruins and the snow effects, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Medal of Honor on the Xbox/PS2, so I thought I would give this a chance. As an experienced gamer, I had high expectations for this game. Big mistake. Took forever to install, and the load times are horrendous. I start playing the game, and I get to a part where I need to rescue a wounded soldier. I can't even get through the doors below deck because of the fires, and everytime I attempted it, the guy I was trying to rescue was burned to death.This game is terrible, not what I expected. I uninstalled it and got rid of it. I do not recommend this game to anyone except diehard military fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!!!!","review":"Good game...

Not like building a PC from a Zenith kit in the early 1980s (which would be a good parallel to a helpful book on trailers), but like learning CP/M, integrating motherboard and all components YOURSELF, and calculating, calculating, and calculating.If you still want to see the few directly useful pages in these books, pursue through interlibrary loan, which your library will be happy to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drifting off focus","review":"I got this book to obtain the trailer specific structural design considerations.

The first was too simple and failed to address any \\"how to's\\", this one would make a good engineer's text. I am a graduate engineer, but I pass on computing the moments of inertia for each potential design. The tables are there, so it would make a passable textbook. If that is what you want to do, this book may be for you. I assume that because of potential liability the author refuses to say (for example), \\"Here is the type and gauge steel you need to make the frame of a 7,000 lb GVWR 16 ft car hauler\\".

Even for a beginner this dvd is not worth buying- you could learn more from reading on line how to do a dance rather then attempting to watch this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too painful to watch","review":"This has got to be the worse introduction to Latin Dancing I have ever seen.

It will surprise you what can be causing your health issues.

Unfortunately, I'm allergic to everthing on the second list and nothing on the first list. So, most of this book wasn't very helpful for me.However, if dust mites, mold, or mildew trigger your allergies, you will find this book quite helpful. Each chapter addresses one room and ends with a list summarizing what you can do to improve that room. The book contains numerous stories about houses triggered allergies of these sorts, why, and what can be done about it -- the presentation of these stories was too mellodramatic for my tastes, but the advice appears to be sound and well considered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical, but not beautiful.","review":"If you are going for style you're looking at the wrong flush lever.

As long as you are not holding it you would swear that it's chrome, but while holding it (which you wont be doing after it's installed)you can tell the material is pretty cheap.

Hopefully you aren't an aggressive flusher as this thing should last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really universal","review":"This is supposed to be \\"universal\\", meaning for both side and front mounted handles. But if yours is a side mount, you need to physically bend the plastic with your hands and hold it until it reaches a 90 degree angle. That's difficult, and in my case, it keeps bending back toward straight. The result is that it doesn't fit right, and ends up getting stuck in position against the side of the tank - leaving the water running.

It plainly says \\"4 DVD Set\\". They do have the same photo on the front which did add to the confusion. This was my mistake, however.

I watched this before I started my first batch of homebrew and it gave a lot of information not found on most websites. It was also very helpful being able to watch the process before I undertook it myself. Another thing I really like about this is that while it's made by the 'Learn to Brew' group, it is strictly a how-to video rather than an opportunity to advertise themselves and their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the few truly creative punk songwriters/poets","review":"It's not a case of whether you like it or not. If, like me, you grew up in the wake of postpunk / new wave, this collection of early recordings and demos represents a true landmark of punk ideology and creativity. The honesty and simplicity of some of the tracks speaks straight to the heart of the 'disaffected youth' I grew up amongst. Tracks like 'Life at the Top', 'Live out my Stars' and 'Safety Pin...' have earned an almost iconic status amongst those in the know; 'Little Fishes' is perhaps one of the few truly great songs of that era. Patrik's music is not for everyone; it's raw, it's rough around the edges and both idealistic and morose, yet without the likes of Fitzgerald, I'm sure The Comsat Angels, The Chameleons and so many others would never have been the bands they were. If you ever wanted to know what Punk was truly about, buy this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke before I got it on my head!","review":"I got this ear muffs just because I love DeWalt products and try to have the Yellow gadgets around my workshop.

These are very comfy, with a particular +1 for the soft foam that goes around the ears. I didn't notice any fatigue, or hurting of the ears at all.Worked great for the handgun range, and blocked a decent amount for my .45acp. Albeit, not so great for long rifles/shotguns as it doesn't allow for a proper cheek weld. This was even on the highest possible setting for my stocks cheek rest, with some tall scope rings. The bottom of the muffs gets bumped when you try to align with the cheek rest, and will leak a bit at the bottom of the muffs letting most of the sound in.Great for everything else though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality headset","review":"These earmuffs are very comfortable and well made, the padding on the ear pieces and the top part is very comfortable.

I was outraged to find them very poorly constructed at the point where the headband connects to ear muffs and in the headband covering. I also discovered these were severely overpriced by over $50.00! I then found many other brands (like ECHO for example) with NRR29 or better ratings and and far superior quality ear muffs for as little as $14.00, and without shipping or tax charges to boot.

I played it to death, wore it out, and just got the CD for Christmas, to my exultation.This is Horner at his best, and he manages to convey childlike wonder and awe with just a few notes. From the opening notes in \\"Through the Window\\" to the last sweeping orchestral magnificence of \\"The Ascension,\\" there's perfection. The final track, \\"Theme from Cocoon,\\" is worth the price of the CD, as you get a little of every theme, but the main theme is as heartwarming and glorious as your grandma's hug.I dropped one star for the Michael Sembello's \\"Gravity,\\" which would be fine on another CD, I suppose - but its inclusion on this one is like getting electric shock therapy in the middle of a relaxing massage. Otherwise, a well-loved classic. I'm happy to have it back in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, and derivative","review":"Interesting hearing the inspiration for Silvestri's \\"Mac and Me,\\" as well as several note-for-note precursors to \\"Titanic.\\" It is not as much of a patchwork as I thought, and Horner manages to keep his 'references' to his three favorite composers: Khachaturian, Prokofiev, and himself. On the downside, the music has that unmistakably shallow JH sound. As one critic so aptly said, \\"It has a top, a bottom, and nothing between.\\" Likewise, the \\"Star Trek\\" references are more than a bit much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I had checked out this book from our local library before ordering it from Amazon.

It's not a book for beginners but one that adds something new to long-time crocheters. It starts out with the more solid designs and then shows you how they are connected with mesh stitchs. Each page gets a little more intricate until you are doing the \\"fancy\\" stuff. There are drawn designs in the back of the book that help with designing your own or you can just follow that written design to recreate what they already have done.

Way wrong. My son watched the video in his room with a confused look on his face, and said, \\"Dad, I dont get it\\". So, I decided I would sit down and show him how to \\"play\\", and after watching an adventure all the way through to the finish, we were both decided that this was a pretty BORING video to watch. The animation was ok, but the story was FAR from engaging, and the characters were, I don't know how else to put it, dumb. (including the character YOU play). I would have had more fun reading him a book ,(which is ultimately what we did), and like I saw another reviewer write, \\"it's a good first attempt\\", I would not recommend buying it.

To succesfully complete the game your best bet is randomly pick your choices without any type of thought, or knowledge of race, class or alignment. (They all lead to the same finale anyway.) Wrap it all up by killing an old friend who saved your life! Yea, that was fun!

Linear.

It has a very, very, very bad, and extremely linear plot... It's extremely boring. The animation was decent, but not good. I really don't see myself watching this again and again. I own the Dungeons & Dragons movie DVD (another one i regret buying) and being the bad movie that it is, scourge of worlds is even worse... and that is saying a lot. And once again, i am a fairly easy guy to please, i've never walked out of a movie theater yet, but i'm sure i'd have walked out of this one. Even the way they animated the characters...Mialee is extremely different from the illustrations in the core rule books...

Symptoms of the affliction include a fondness of trance music, habitual 'rolling' on school days, the waving around of glow sticks and of course uncontrollable cravings for Tootsie Pops. Exposure II provides an insight into the US trance sound, which for the most part is a darker, more moody product than most of the cheerier stuff shipped out of Europe. Purveyor of new school, Christopher Lawrence gives us his monstrous Rush Hour and Cruise Control. Other tracks of note include a nice Vegas Soul remix of 808 State's Invader as well as the punchy Way U Like It, courtesy of the man who introduced raving to Americans in the first place, Mr Frankie Bones, take a bow.

This film is a prime example of sensationalism without any redeeming qualities at all.Back in the 1960's there was a film named: \\"Mondo Cane.\\" At that time, the images shown on screen were shocking to me, but now, it could qualify to be shown to kindergarten children if this film (being reviewed) is to be considered as entertainment.How can anyone say they are repulsed by the savage tradegies suffered at the World Trade Center on 9/11 if they seek out the brutality represented in this documentary.For educational purposes?

I loved the movie Dune, and upon reading the score reviews on Amazon decided to purchase. For pure listening enjoyment, I was very disappointed. Yes, the music captures the harsh conditions of numerous film elements, but becomes overly strident and often disconnected. Moreover, this score IS NOT a combination of \\"classical\\" and electric guitar...as some reviewers have commented. To say that it contains \\"classical\\" modalities is a major stretch. It's rough to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this music...","review":"Toto's score from Dune -- especially the brooding main titles -- is really the work of the great Dimitri Shostokovich (his Symphony #11), with a little of Khachaturian's Gayne Ballet Suite adagio thrown in, dumbed down of course, and developed with little imagination, and a lot of bombast. Nonetheless, I loved the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stereotypical, with a slow-moving, uninteresting plot","review":"The only thing saving this book from a one star is the hero, McKenna, who is so genuinely realistic, he doesn't belong in a very weak stereotypical book.The \\"damsel-in-distress\\" plot is getting very old. I wanted very much more emotion and vulnerability from McKenna. His situation with his daughter is the only thing that made this book worth reading. He was the only character that shook me emotionally, especially when he visits Houston, and what occurs.The plot was slow moving and predictable. It's not suspenseful, and the heroine isn't someone I particularly liked.I just wish more male characters like McKenna end up in better books, where there characters can fully blossom and be explored.As a final note, I believe most men who suffer a great loss are not sex-starved. They rather be held and comforted, not seduced in a shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild!","review":"These wild sessions, with more than twenty players on most cuts, are not nearly as chaotic as its sounds upon casual listening.

(Roy Campbell-T, Cooper-Moore-P, Rob Brown, Assif Tsahar & Chris Jonas-Reeds, & Susie Ibarra-D) Greg Bendian really stands out on vibes throughout these pieces and Lisa Sokolov adds some wonderful vocals to three tracks.The only downside to this set: Parker only plays on three cuts!

Perhaps I would have found the information beneficial ten years ago, but being that I am fairly knowledgeable about hair, I was not blinded by the (simplistic) info and saw through to her tone and diction, which were horrible! I was actually in shock reading some parts of the book because I can't believe her editor would have let it be published like that.

From reading the website I found a lot of good questions but I did not find any real answers. I was also put off by her manner of relating to people. She is often abrupt in her responses to questions and instead of answering the questions she urges people to read the book and use her products. In addition she is very critical and demeaning of other authors. It comes accross as if she is better than everyone else and that only she has the true answers. I thought there would be some indept knowledge to be found in the book that maybe she could not summarize on the website. What I found instead was common sense and a pitch for her hair products. I was dissapointed in the information presented as well as the products (which I did purchase as well), neither the book or the products are revolutionary.

THANK GOD I'M NATURAL is a MUCH BETTER book."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I liked this book but I didn't like how she advertised her own products through withholding information. For example, she recommends a conditioner that stimulates but never talk about what other products can be used to \\"stimulate.\\" Instead, she sells her conditioner as seemingly the only product on the market that does all of the things that a conditioner should do. That makes me distrustful especially because her other products contain ingredients that aren't so great for your hair. Good try . . . but I think the book Grow It was a lot more useful.Also, she straightens her hair way too much for someone who really wants to grow Black hair to its maximum length and health--whether through chemicals or heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Not Need To Put It In A Book","review":"When you get down to it, I just wanted to know basically what I was doing wrong and tell me what I SHOULD be doing.

It was poorly written, there were grammatical errors, and the information was very limited. I found that the author spent most of her time boasting about research that she had done to write the book, however after reading it, there was little evidence that such research had been conducted. I felt just as ill-informed about the subject of black hair care after reading Ultra Hair Growth II as I did before I read it.It was just terrible! I would not recommend this book to anyone, in fact, it is my recommendation that it be removed from the shelves, it does nothing to educate the reader on the subject it attempts to address, AND (this may be just me) but the author gets way too colloquial with her readers, I dare say even presumptuous. Just because I am black doesn't mean that I am ghetto.

It takes about 20 minutes to read through the whole thing, but you can get comprable information from any website about hair care.

They find themselves prisoners in the lost kingdom of Atlantis. The Atlanteans are being aided by Professor Zaroff in their plan to raise the island back to the surface. But there is more to Zaroff's plans than even the Atlanteans know...About the only thing we are spared is the over the top acting of Joseph Furst as Professor Zaroff in this fairly straightforward adaptation of a Doctor Who series that should never have been made.

I have to go try and fish out some CD, attach the CD player to my laptop and try to navigate around until I find the reference list for that particular chapter?How about just adding two pages at the end of each chapter with the reference lists?

Naxos deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the quality of the restorations and their publication, especially at a reasonable price. Friedman's interpretation of Mendelsohn's Songs without Words is unequaled.

To give Dobson some credit, he does talk a little about rule setting, listening to your child, and creative discipline ideas (some that he learned from his Mom). He also relates that traditional discipline methods should seldom be used after age 6.

This book was very helpful in getting me to understand that 14 year old girls are going to need a somewhat different approach than adult and high school players and gave me great ideas to help me be successful with them.

He changed everything and opened the door for Swedish films dealing with the same issues but in a more graphic nature. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I had no idea this movie existed. I have many of Cary Grant's movies but it wasn't until i ordered another Cary Grant movie, this one was suggested to me. Cary Grant steals the show and he portrays a character not often played by him, other than in Suspicion with Joan Fontaine. Cary's character starts off as a selfish character trying to hold a gambling facility and initially tries to engage a charity to help him under false pretences. His character goes through a transformation, slowly but effectively and in a believable fashion. He plays a wonderful part and truly suits his charming and carefree disposition....Loved it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cary Grant","review":"What else do you need to know?I bought this for some older friends who remembered the movie.Guess I need to buy myself a copy now...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music levels dangerous to young ears","review":"My mother in law bought this for my son's second birthday, but I heard on the news today that the decibel level on this toy exceeds recommended levels for small children and can actually damage hearing . .

However - I absolutely cannot tolerate the volume. You cannot understand how loud it is - I believe one of the other reviewers when they say it exceeds recommended decibel levels. I just went to check for the \\"hidden\\" volume control - it does not exist on ours. Perhaps I will \\"fix it\\" with tape and cardboard, but for the moment, it is staying in the off position!

So I feel she is beyond this toy on the intelligence scale and might not learn anything new. She loved playing with it at the toy store display, pressing the button to change the screen and the mircophone. I however, had to walk away (a bit) because of the extremely loud volume. Must of been designed by an engineer with no children! I think the main attraction for her was the the screen changing and microphone. For me it's not worth the $34.00 price tag plus $10 each for additional software. Only one cartridge comes with it. I would however recommend this toy to anyone with a child just learning the basics. Don't forget to buy some ear plugs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun and Very Durable!!","review":"My father bought this for my daughters first birthday. The age recommendation said it was for a little older of a child but she just kept pointing to it even when we tried to distract her attention to something else. There are no small pieces and the cartridges are large and durable so I don't think it is a safety concern for small children. She is 18 months now and does not understand the game concept or microphone just yet. However, she loves to push the arrows to advance the pages and dance to the music that it plays. We have had the toy for six months now and have had no problems. I have not even changed the batteries yet!!

She is not too concerned though because she rarely could stand to have her children play with it because it really is too loud.I said \\"LOUD!\\" I originally bought this as a nice car toy, but once in the car, the music reverberrates and can give you a headache in three minutes flat--it's that loud.

It is very moving and tells the story of slavery from the point of view of the slaves. Beginning with Alex Haley's book, which is wonderful in itself, this miniseries is still the most popular show to have ever aired on TV. It might take some getting used to because of the difference in TV production values but you quickly forget about it after awhile and learn to appreciate the beauty and sincerity of the production. It isn't about the amount of money spent but the effort and a job well done. The actors are superlative. The writing is wonderful. It made me cry at the end because it was so moving.The DVD isn't the highest quality and there is a lot of times the picture stopped and I had to scan it rapidly for a couple of seconds to get it going again. The commentary is well done and highly recommended. I learned a lot and it made me feel closer to the production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This product arrive in excellent condition for a Used item.

The case folds and nothing is protecting the discs from the cardboard. I have never seen a big movie company be so cheap that they can't even use decent packaging. Most DVD buyers are buying them to last a long time, but apparently Warner doesn't see it that way. I give this a low rating because of the poor packaging.

Many famous actors. It is hard for some of the younger generation to watch it now and I think it is because of that 70's feel to the production and not the message.

I remember watching the series with my parents when it originally aired in 1977, and I'll be doing the same with my own children in a few years as well. And for those who have not read the book, please do. You won't regret it.There's no question that the mini-series itself was unforgettable. This particular DVD version, however, is a little disappointing. I guess I was expecting a little more by way of restored/improved video and audio quality, but this version definitely shows its age. There are one or two new extra features on this dvd that are very interesting, but I would not recommend purchasing this version if you already own the older DVD version.Perhaps we'll get lucky some day, and they'll give this mini-series the proper restorative attention it deserves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the story, but sorely disappointed in DVD quality","review":"I thought I was losing my mind.

It's for any woman that wants to move her body, learn to love the body she's in and make it something sensual for her partner. This video allows for a lot of self expression and self interpretation. After doing this video a few times, your body will begin to have it's own movement and rhythm...perform these movements for yourself or for a lover and WOW.

Let's put it this way, I could have made this video and sold it to you all. I cannot send it back to the seller because I am not happy with the video, but I am going to honest and let the next person know my opinion. Again this is just my opinion. I am putting it out to re-sell on Amazon, and despite the fact that it may hurt my chances of selling it, so please be buyer conscious. This is my first video by Hemalayaa, bought the 'Beautiful Belly' DVD as well and again not the best. So that was the last DVD by Hemalayaa.

Very few calories will be burned. This is a slow dance with yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for meditation, not for much else","review":"If you are viewing this to learn more about the Kama Sutra, or for a workout, or to learn some dance moves, you will be disappointed. The eye exercises gave me a headache and I had to shut the DVD off and watch the rest of it later. I think this dvd WOULD be useful for meditation, if you are into that sort of thing. Hemalaya is so blissed out and adorable--I'll have whatever she's on! I do enjoy her as an instructor, but I prefer some of her other DVDs over this one.What I was able to take away from this is her flirtatious glances, her smiles, and how she looks toward and then away from her audience, drawing you in. This DVD is well-made and beautiful and is more about channeling yourself then about a particular move or exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great...","review":"It shredded paper until I started doing a whole load of it...

On one hand, it's a little strange to read about a game that's changed so much since the book was written it's practically unrecognizable now. On the other hand, what a delight to read about baseball players you can care about and root for. Big difference from what's in the headlines these days.The romance was so sweet I wish there'd been more of it, but I suppose that given the constraints of 1984, Kluger got away with as much as he could for the times. But the humor hasn't tarnished over 24 years. Sometimes I found myself laughing so hard I had to put the book down just to recharge.After spending almost 300 pages with a fictional team I wound up falling in love with, it will be interesting to see how I feel about today's baseball once spring training starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and underwhelming","review":"I've loved all of Kluger's past work, but this was a real disappointment.For one thing, the epistolary format totally fails in this book. In previous books, it was illuminating and brought the reader into the life of the character. Here, it was pointless and boring. I didn't see the news stories, notes, and other materials giving any real insight into the character.The protagonist was also quite boring. In his past work, Kluger has had strong and sometimes over the top protagonists. In this one, the main character was boring and poorly written. He was a cardboard cutout of a failing baseball player. I had no empathy for him or his loathsome teammates.I'll give Kluger another chance, but this was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookie Cutters","review":"My sister is having a baby so my mother and I decided to make cookie favors.

It is soft-core EMO, and a notch above TRL. However, if that is what you're looking for you will certainly like this album. The songs are well written and often a pleasure to listen to, though there are no surprises for those who already own More Betterness.

All the blink 182 wannabes would make their quick buck releasing an album like this. It's full of simple and catchy melodies that are easy to sing along to. Sounds good, right? The problem is that No Use For A Name has been in the scene almost as long as anyone, releasing quality punk rock the whole time. After all that it is an insult to release an album so watered down with shallow lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I do listen to this and enjoy it. But I can find the same enjoyment from the riddlin kids, bowling for soup, or simple plan. Atleast those bands are being themselves. Who knows? Maybe times were tough for NUFAN and they needed a quick buck. But when I put in a record from a veteran punk rock band I want to hear some real punk rock. This was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camille Claudel","review":"Camille Claudel was a sculptor who trained under Rodin.

It breaks metal down to modal structures shifting between tone centers along the fretboard, creating harmony from similarity and melody from proximity. This nihilism makes for stunningly basic and deconstructive music, which is their aim as artists and political thinkers: to tear down the centralized structure of human control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hebron Stories DVD","review":"Unfortunately, a person may not be able to play this DVD which depicts the changes in the city of Hebron \\"from a bustling city center to a Ghost town\\" as it will not play in your DVD player.

We have the Blue's Clues book that came with it, and purchased the Elmo's Scavenger Hunt book too. I really like the Elmo book because it goes through the ABC's and phonics. My husband also loves this toy, but more because he can shout in the microphone and be heard all over the house (sigh). I personally like the fact that even when there is no book in the toy it will still play music if the buttons are pushed. On the down side, I have to agree with one of the other reviews that the lights are a bit on the bright side and can distort the images on the screen.

Often I found myself left in the fog. The book sometimes assumes things without explaining. For instance, for simple functions like the following (p. 113):>> import jarray>> jarray.array(['crystal', 'ball'],java.lang.String)you need to import java.lang.String before calling it. I didn't know that but the book doesn't explain that.Also the book doesn't make clear that to import some java classes you have to include .jar file in the sys.path. It does mention .jar files but should make clear and emphasize that you must include it as a necessary step and also show how to do that.

Gerber makes a superior product. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Snaps","review":"The snaps on all three of the onesies that we received do no stay snapped. A onesie is not very useful with defective snaps. Quality control appears to be lacking on this product. I would advise for others to look into other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"soft, but not a great fit","review":"I love how soft the fabric is on these onesies. But, I won't be buying them again for a few reasons: 1. the neck is really wide so the onesie doesn't cover the upper chest and neck area very well 2. the shoulder flaps never lay flat 3. they run pretty small"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"We returned these because the material wasn't soft, the construction was poor, and the size was WAY off.

I don't use them unless I'm in a pinch with no other clean ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"shrinks a TON","review":"Very disappointed. These looked nice, but after an initial pre-wear wash and dry (cold water, medium heat), these shrunk a TON. As in about 2 inches shorter than a 12 month Carter's onesie. I don't think these will even snap on her now. I might be able to still use them as a sleep shirt if I just cut the crotch portion off at the bottom, but I'm annoyed. Also, the reviewers who mentioned the very large neck were right. Would not buy these again.It's SO hard to find 12+ month onesies! If you're looking for smaller sizes in plain colors, I HIGHLY recommend the Disney Cuddly Bodysuits. I just wish they came in bigger sizes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Fit","review":"These bodysuits fit terribly around the neck!

They still have a chemical smell. I'm not sure what's going on. I had previously purchased some long-sleeve body suites from the same company, which didn't have this smell. I do not like putting something on my baby that smells so strongly of the chemicals used to process the fabric. If I cannot get the smell out, I'll have to donate them to Goodwill and hope that their laundering is more effective than mine. Other than the smell, the quality of the fabric seems good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sized very funny","review":"I read many reviews and did my research before I purchased these. I read that the sizing was a little off, so I ordered a size larger. My daughter only weights 19 pounds and usually wears a 12 month onsie. I purchased these 18 month size. They barely fit. They are WAY too short. They barely fit her now, but they definately wont fit her when she is 13 months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft material, that's it.","review":"Material feels great!

If you are looking for current up-to-date advice on Aqua Design Amano tips and trick look elsewhere. Almost all the techniques used in this book are old, and some inaccurate. This is a TFH book not an Aqua Design Amano Publication.It would have been better if TFH had translated The Nature Aquarium / ADA Concepts from Japanese to English.

It seems to be more of an overview of \\"What is....\\" rather than \\"How to\\". Don't buy it for training.

I like that he doesn't belittle people by saying that you have to do this or have to do that. Even though he gives a ton of \\"real\\" information in his steps, he never stops saying \\"It's up to you to go do it.\\" It's so encouraging.

I've read other books and none of them seemed to catch my attention or explain a process as well as pete does in this book. I would recommend it to anyone considering the acting career, not only does it help you decide wether you have the courage to act or not, it also gives you a step by step process to help keep you on track.

I bought THIS pump to keep in my bag as an emergency back-up, etc. I never got a drop out of it. I checked every connection. There was some suction, but it was the equivalent of a mouse sucking through a coffee stirrer. I suppose if you're incredibly engorged and leaking through your shirt, you might not need that much suction. But I try not to let myself get to that point, so it didn't work for me.

My first few times trying to pump with this thing I struggled to even cover the bottom of the bottle. I felt that the suction was very weak and the handle on the pump is just plain horrible? I spent over 20mins on the phone waiting for customer service and they basically told me no returns or refunds. So I try and try again and finally after several practices I can pump about 4oz in 30mins. Not to mention if the bottle or valve is a little wet... then it wont drop anything down into the bottle. I would just recommend staying far away from this product. Its not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Pump","review":"I bought the Avent Isis when I first had my son (now 5 months old) for occasional pumping but eventually got tired of the fact I had to transfer all the milk since Avent pumps are only compatable with Avent bottles, which, in turn, are only compatable with Avent nipples that my son hates. So, I bought this pump to save me time. The first time I used it I realized how inconvenient the pump handle was and how weak the suction was. I decided to give it another chance the next day and halfway through pumping the suction completely disappeared. I followed all instructions and even tried reassembling it but it's completely broken after only 2 tries.

This comedic story concept could have worked but it seemed like the writer(s) settled on the first half-baked concept they thought of at every story line turn. Especially the goofy, head-scratching ending. My one-word review for this film: Moronic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, crap quality disc","review":"Sat down to watch my new DVD of Hot Fuzz and lo and behold, it only plays about two-thirds of the way through before seizing up. I tried playing it in three different devices. No dice. Crap quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"It becomes what it spoofs","review":"I had high hopes for this one given the glowing reviews everywhere for it, but it suffers from the same problem as Club Dread: it became the very thing it was spoofing. The first half or so of this movie is great. It's hilarious and spoofs so many police and action movies and TV shows that it's a good test for a movie nerd. But when its own story began to take the lead, the gruesome death scenes and tired shootouts, while not without comic nods, were virtually indistinguishable from what the first half lampooned. It devolved so much, my wife and I turned it off with 10 minutes left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story and great action","review":"Hot Fuzz is a fantastic parody of the Hollywood buddy-cop movie (Bad Boys (Special Edition)etc.). In a similar fashion toShaun of the Dead [HD DVD], the movie's attraction comes from the tongue-in-cheek nature of the humor. There's no laughter track just great scenes that are funny by their absurdity. For example, imagine watching a Robert Rodriguez gun battle(Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)) set in a small English country village.On the HD front, the video presentation is five star with great colors, sharp definition and no encoder issues. The audio is also top quality with a great mix which really comes to the fore in the more explosive parts of the movie. This disc also has the most number of extras that I've seen yet on a single disc HD release, including one of the more interesting ones that I have seen which follows the movie from its original conception through to the final form."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that funny","review":"I actually live in the UK and like a lot of British films, but I just did not find this film that funny. I got the jokes, they just weren't great. The film is an action/comedy, but the unique blend just didn't work for me. The action wasn't great action and the comedy (mostly) wasn't great comedy.I do like the general story idea (of a small, traditional, moral town being exposed as evil to the core), but the way it was told just didn't click for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"overload of gore superimposed on ridiculous narrative","review":"I think it tries to spoof action movies.

I would pass on this for a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:With none of the wit and sharpness that characterized Shaun of the Dead, to say nothing of that film's hilarity, Hot Fuzz is a slow and plodding comedy that somehow lasts for over two hours despite its flimsy plot and lack of enjoyable character interaction--what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 15 minutes are funny. The rest is more like any other regular action movie.","review":"The first 15 minutes are funny. It has quite a few tickling dialogues. The rest is more like any other regular action movie. I mean it contains lots of action, explosion and nonsense.It's worth watching once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as Fuzz","review":"Yes, I understand this movie is supposed to spoof action films but it is not that funny. The pacing is very slow. I kind of felt like the movie was just a build up for one big joke. The first 3/4 of the film was very mundane, and then last part of the film did a 180 degree turn around and become over-the-top ridiculous. I believe that was supposed to be the big joke. Personally, my favorite action spoof is Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's Team America. I suggest that movie instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but sweet review","review":"Ok seriously, you don't have to read all of the other reviews out there. I promise you... except for a small percent, that this movie is amazing if you loved Shaun of the Dead. You have to be open minded when you watch THIS movie and you shouldn't think of SOTD while watching it.The great thing about HF is the running jokes and that it is a joy to watch it over and over again to find new things that you didn't catch before.I have seen it 4 times now and I look forward to find new things that I didn't notice the first time around.That is all I can say, the movie speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great funny should be Classic","review":"Like Shaun of the Dead, this movie is hilarious and fun and I loved it.

People were saying good things about it so I gave it a rent. I was under the impression it was a comedy, but there are few funny moments in the first half. In fact, the plot drags a bit and I was getting restless. But momentum built and the ending of the movie was darn near hilarious. The picture quality was excellent-especially for a combo disc and there's a lot of bass that gave my Buttkickers a good workout. However, I have no desire to see it again so for me this one is just a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Comedy!","review":"If you likedShaun of the DeadandSpaced - Definitive Collectors' Edition [Region 2 Import - UK] you will love Hot Fuzz!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here Come The Fuzz","review":"This is one of the best action movies of the decade. Not only does it purposefully follow other action films but contains tongue in cheek references to the other greats. Simon Pegg is brilliant as Sgt Angel and Timothy Dalton is absolutely despisable as a villian.

But the second half is completely action packed and hilarious! I recommend this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"I watched Hot Fuzz on the strength of 'Shaun of the Dead', which was a marvellous breath of fresh air from Hollywoods bloated excesses. HF has a great cast. One of my favourite British actors from any era Jim Broadbent. Simon Pegg who has an intensity in his acting that is very funny. Bill Bailey, Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton etc etc, but somehow it just doesn't work.The idea behind the story has the makings of a successful comedy. Sgt Angel is sent to Sandford, a small sleepy English town, because he is too good. As Angel Simon Pegg is perfect for the role but is let down most of the time by lines that just aren't that funny. To be honest after an hour had passed I had started to lose interest and at an hour and a half I gave up. It is too long.Maybe on a 2nd showing I will enjoy it more, but its not a film I'd recommend anybody buying just because they liked 'Shaun of the Dead'. rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Simon Pegg movie!","review":"This film is along the lines of dry humor. But if you watched Shaun of the Dead or other movies like it, you will love this movie more, if not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savor Every Line","review":"To put it simply, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are comedic geniuses. Words cannot express the profundity of and breadth of their prowess. Hot Fuzz is a buddy cop action/comedy but doesn't slap you in the face with blatant, tactless humor as so many of its predecessors. All of Wright's movies are meant to be watched repeatedly so you can catch ALL the times he re-uses lines that were used previously in a different context. It's brilliant.Ps: The soundtrack is amazing as well, but did you really expect less? If you're looking for an orgasmic soundtrack with hilarity and geeky, college-age awkwardness, hit up Scot Pilgrim vs. the World next. It'll blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"Good movie, funny, and didn't expect the plot to go in that direction. Would recommend.Though kind of pricey for the age of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Fuzz","review":"Fresh from making the classic Zombie comedyShaun of the Dead [Blu-ray] Pegg and Frost presumably had offers of significant funds to make a more mainstream comedy (after all, Zombies are not exactly family viewing). The result is Hot Fuzz which in spite of its broader market retains the trademark Pegg and Forst comedic appeal.Mixing off-beat comedy with elements of spoof Hot Fuzz mixes Hollywood with rural England to excellent effect. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fuzz is Hot and The Movie is Great.","review":"Hot Fuzz marks the second movie from the guys that gave us Shaun of The Dead, a fun romatic-comedy-zombie movie.Hot Fuzz is a story a story of Nick Angel, a great London cop who is so good he is sent to a sleepy little country town, in witch he relises big time crime can still happen in a small town.The comedy in Hot Fuzz is to take every movie clice and put them in a movie, not as a parody, but to simply take notice of them. A long montage of quick cuts show Nick processing paperwork, for example. The movie is fun and full of energy. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg do a great job and provide the movie with the right amount of charm to the screen.The DVD does a good job in the audio and picture quality. The bouns features get the job done but aren't as extensive as most DVDs now released.Overall if you enjoy comidies and/or action movies you'll find some enjoyment in this picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"fuzzness","review":"Over all great actors with british satire and even alittle slap stick comedy.

I don't think this \\"comedy\\" even deserves one star, maybe a minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MOVIE","review":"I thought this movie was totally rediculous. Not in the least bit funny, poorly acted and directed, and it does not help that it is being released on the dying HD-DVD format, but then I would not buy on BLU-RAY either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie","review":"Everything about his movie is crap. It's supposed to be funny but it's not, the story is idiotic and has been told a million times before in other movies, the acting is awful, and the movie has been edited like an MTV music video.Shaun of the dead was average but this is really bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUMOR GONE AWRY","review":"This movie started with great promise and ended with considerable disappointment. I thought I was in for a bout of dry British humor and satire. But the plot got wilder and wilder, weirder and weirder and less and less funny. It ended in total unreality with a welter of comic-book violence. It was also way too long. Someone should have told the director that sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Seriously, the hype over this film on DVD is unreal. I was not that impressed with the previews but I decided to check it out anyways. I usually laugh pretty much at everything and anything and I thought maybe the comical approach this film had would be to my liking.Other than a few funny general spoof plays on London police procedure, this thing is a waste of time. I just did not see any value to it whatsoever. Am I being a stick in the mud? Perhaps I missed something, but considering I have loved films that range from comical to crime drama, this one is at the bottom. What it does is TRY to be funny, and nothing could be more revolting."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS.","review":"I love this movie. It is a fun, funny, and easygoing movie that's a satire of both comedy and horror flicks. Hoity-toity movie critics will probably find it less than adequate in all the typical movie quality categories. But if you just want to have a good laugh from a movie that pokes fun at small town life across the pond, you will certainly enjoy this one. Totally worth the $5 plus shipping I paid for it. Make sure you get the correct Region Code for your purchase of this fine British export."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Cop. Movie. Ever.","review":"Not only is this movie *hilarious*, it's also an homage to police movies from noir to boom-boom, with a bit of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" thrown in for good measure.One minute you're hearing an echo from \\"Chinatown\\" (\\"Forget it, Nick...It's Sandford.\\"), then you're hearing from SotD (\\"What, haven't you ever taken a short cut before?\\"), seeing action from \\"Point Break\\", and who'll ever forget the penultimate scene, complete with birds taking off, a la John Woo, in any of his action movies.These guys took every cop movie cliche, put it into less than two hours, didn't demean the sources, made it funny *and* tense (my wife actually *screamed* at one scene), and ended up with a movie I'll see again and again.Best. Cop. Movie. Ever.BTW: Anyone catch \\"The Wicker Man\\" reference? Yes indeed, these guys went out of their way to include police movie references."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of HD DVD's best visual feast","review":"Not only is the movie entertaining and satisfying, but the video transfer is gorgeous, the audio packs significant punch, and there are approximately eighteen hours of entertaining supplemental materials.Judged in comparison to the standard-def DVD, the video and audio packages are both significantly improved, and this HD DVD even includes ten hours of features that aren't even available on the US-released DVD.Simply put, in my opinion, this is currently the best overall high-def release on the market -- especially when you factor in the price. Purchasing 'Hot Fuzz' on HD DVD is a no-brainer for fans and an easy recommendation for newcomers. This is what high definition is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, funny, furious","review":"From the brains behind Shawn of Dead, Hot Fuzz is, by turns, dazzlingly witty, frenetic, and surprisingly gruesome. You need to know that, because some people in the audience were shocked to see several people die in, well, clinical detail, shall we say. When the second half of the movie descended into all out war, many (myself included) were swept away by it. Others, unfortunately, staggered out of the theater a bit ... shell-shocked. Visually smart and filled with winks and homages to other films, this is a fat-free film. Everything's a set up, and everything has a pay-off. So pay attention class! (Okay, pay attention the second time you see it. There's enough gold to be mined that you'll be back.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"I will start off by saying this movie was good enough for me to buy it, it was funny and a good comedy, as most of the movies with these two guys.Having said that I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would based off of Shawn of the Dead. The humor was mostly on, but some of it just missed the mark slightly which detracts from the overall movie for me.It is worth buying if you can get a decent deal on it. 4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Marple, Riggs & Murtaugh, everything in between","review":"Now for something completely different...from Shaun of the Dead.

I actually found this even funnier than SOTD, and it was definitely a change of pace to see Simon Pegg playing the no-nonsense straight man to Nick Frost's bumbling but hilarious funny man.

A series of shocking accidents upsets the village, and Angel is certain that the village is not what it seems.Brilliant acting, well-directed.Yes, some scenes at the end are gruesome, but they are well done and quite funny.Filled with car chases, gun fights, explosive bodies, this is a hilarious comedy.(Many thanks to a friend for recommending this movie to me; I wouldn't have watched it otherwise, and would have missed on a great British film.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, good original story, but a bit long for a comedy.","review":"I liked shawn of the dead, and so this one was a no brainer to buy. Well, its good, but a bit long. I really wanted to see how the movie ended, so the story was good, and the humor was there, but about mid movie, I had figured it out and just wanted to see the ending. The movie revolves around London's best police officer getting transferred to Samford because he's to good, I.E. he makes the rest of the cops look bad. Well, little did he know he was going to walk a nice country villiage and discover a hidden secret about the population and the smoke and mirrors the town is built on.

However, let me get this straight: it is not as funny as Shaun of the Dead, the first movie this great group came up with. However, it is still much better than most of the movies out there.Shaun of the Dead is much funnier with each successive viewing. I think this flick might be the same. There are some great bits that I won't give away here.So let's talk about the HD DVD, since that is the version I got (I don't think it is out on Blu Ray). The transfer is awesome... the best I have seen thus far. No visible lines or... er... fuzz. Sound is excellent. I hear the extras are to die for, but I haven't had a chance to dive into those: four different audio commentaries, lots of shows, and other bits. Also, of course, Picture in picture extras which Blu ray just can't do right now.Movie 4.0 (it's a bit predictable-- but still fun to watch)HD transfer 5 (It's perfect)Sound 5All in all 5.0.

Well, it's the most fun movie I've seen in years. If you like naughty British humor with a bit of gore thrown in, this is for you. It reminded me a bit of \\"Waking Ned Devine\\". Very witty and a great story with camp spoof thrown in. A village of wackos hiding a secret that only an over the top officer OF THE LAW can handle. The police force--er, police SERVICE of Sandford is something to behold. Get this movie asap. It's a hoot. Don't worry too much about the dialog, I thought it was fun even not being able to get every word. The extras on the DVD are not to be missed. \\"Trivia facts\\" are great and the \\"TV show\\" with the dubbings is a riot. I'm ordering it for the collection today. Oh, and of course, I must get \\"Sean of the Dead\\" asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this movie getting over the top reviews???!","review":"I am perplexed as to why Hot Fuzz is earning such praise when it is only mildly amusing at best. Some of the funniest jokes in the movie play dead on funny, but the same tired joke being played again and again for more yuks just gets on people's nerves (\\"so what is it that makes you think this is a murder??!\\")The movie reeks of unoriginality from the getgo save for the city supercop transferred to the idyllic countryside, yet even that premise gets weak if it is the only avenue for jokes, as is mostly the case in Hot Fuzz. It's as if the writers had an idea for a short film of 30 minutes and stretched it out another additional hour. I'm sorry for being a naysayer, but even if a movie's main premise is slightly different than the norm, a good film still needs to deliver a whole lot more, and Hot Fuzz simply doesn't.

Then the movie becomes absurd, then it just dies, but its undead carcass wastes another 40 minutes of your time.What you think is going to happen is that this by-the-book, overachieving cop--who is sent to the country from London because he embarrasses his more average colleagues--will find himself in the right place at the right time to solve a series of murders in a quiet country town. What actually happens is that the movie dissolves into absurdist, surreal nonsense, and nonsense which is not funny to normal people.

And the whole movie is like that. But I'm not complaining!And there's more extras here than you'll be able to watch in one sitting. One of the extras is the second flip book drawing that Nick Frost's character shows off to Simon Pegg that we don't get to see in the film.

The acting was good, the actions scenes fun and I especially liked the way they edited it to flash 4 or 6 pictures in a row to quickly move ahead the story point.

I also bought an extra \\"Dora\\" cartridge. My daughter played with this toy in the store and I was surprised at how LOUD they had it set. I figured I'd be able to lower the volume when we got home, but I was wrong! There IS NO volume! For the price of this toy it should definitely be able to be turned down to a more comfortable level. My daughter can't play with it long because she doesn't like anything loud. After a while, it's very annoying. If it had a volume control, I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice","review":"I almost bought this for my 18 month old but after seeing these reviews and it broken in the store... no thanks! It was stuck in between the screens and twitching while playing music. I guess this is the \\"Leap Pad\\" solution to a child under 2. My daughter loves my son's Leap Pad so we just bought the pink one for 3 years + but they also sell other versions for younger and older. Anyway, hold on to your receipt, you may need it. Amazon has horrible return policies (they take a good chunk) so buy it at a store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was excited to buy this toy. My two year olds love music and many of the characters in the cassettes. In a short time when the pages advanced they were unaligned and where calling yellow, blue. Nothing like confusing a child. Then it stopped responding altogether. I bought another because I had all of the cartridges and my children liked it when it worked and the new one does not advance properly either.Great idea but needs a few bugs worked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy but - get new batteries right away","review":"Learn Through Music has been a great toy for my two year old. We love the scrolling cartridges with all of her favorite TV characters. My daughter uses this while waiting for the doctor, in the car, during her brother's soccer games, etc.I would recommend that all parents buy new C batteries for this toy immediately upon purchase. It will not have enough power to scroll the pages for very long after purchase. One may think the toy is broken, but it really just needs batteries.I have a few suggestions for Fisher Price: Make a carrying case for this toy, put in a complete volume control/headphone jack, and make the screen brighter.Otherwise, it is a great toy with educational as well as fun value for the money. The extra cartridges sell for 9.99 each and are very affordable gifts from extended family."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME","review":"We really did love this toy, except for the fact that it was very loud, but 2 months after Christmas the pages were jamming. I changed the batteries, put in a different cartridge. But alas it was broken, so I bought another one and exchanged the broken one...well the new one broke within a month (same problem). My kid didn't even mistreat it because I would supervise him while he played with it (his idea).So I got rid of the cartridges and then he would play with just the lights and sounds but the lights were too bright. So now it's in a closet somewhere. I'll throw it out when I clean out the closet. Just trying to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this toy","review":"My twenty month old loves this toy. It has all his favorite characters blue, dora and elmo. He enjoys playing it while he eats so it has been covered in everything from strawberries to peanut butter and it cleans easily. I have had it for 5 months and have never had any problems with it. The volume is annoying but my husband put some duck tape on the speaker and it muted it to an appropriate level. My son has started singing the alphabet song thanks to elmo and knows all the colors and the sounds animals make. I have only changed the batteries three times, considering he plays with it daily its not bad. I would totally recomend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning through music by fisher-price","review":"This toy is an excellent toy.My son takes it everywhere he goes.The only problem the toy might have was that the battery were dead by the time the hit the stores.with a dead battey the frames will not advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen has a mind of it's own...Frustrates your little one...","review":"Just a few weeks after my daughter got this for Christmas last year, it started freaking out, for lack of a better term. The screen would rewind back to the beginning for no reason. She would get upset and tell me it was broke. I thought the batteries were dying but it wasn't that. Tried to wipe the screen cleaner thinking it was reading \\"fingerprints\\" but that didn't help either. The pages trun whenever they want, and now it will only advance a couple of pages, then automatically rewind. We have the Elmo cartridge and a Barney cartridge, and both do it. She uses it now just to sing into the microphone.My sister-in-law says the same happens with her daughter's, too. So I have to beleive it's the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very wrong.","review":"This toy was bought as a gift for my daughter's 2nd B-day.(December) She loves the toy!!!!!! We have to bring it everywhere. Without the volume control I would have died. The only bad thing about this toy is that it only lasted until early February. Some of the buttons you would press wouldn't work. The mic cut out all the time. And then finally the page would freeze. Now the toy has just stopped working. Changing the batteries didn't help. We're in the process of getting another one from fisher-price. However, I do recommend this toy. Maybe we just had a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DARK!!!!","review":"The screen is just too dark....makes you feel like you are going blind when you try to distinguish the colors.

The problem is that for some reason Mattel decided to tint the unit screen a dingy yellow, which means that anything you put into it is very hard to see. It's a shame because it actually is a pretty entertaining toy and seems durable otherwise.If they were to fix this, I would have given it 5 stars all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"This toy is as the other reviews have stated. First, it is way too loud of a toy. When buying it for Christmas and trying it out at the store, we assumed there would be a volume control. There wasn't. Usually with noisy toys, you \\"get used to it.\\" Not with this toy. It is obnoxious. Exactly the same problem with the advancement of the pages. They either get stuck or play a different page. As for the screen, it is definatley too hard to distinquish. My 2 year old does play with it, but doesn't hold her attention for too long. Maybe because it is way too loud for her too! And like the others also stated, I wish that I read the reviews also before buying. My loss..."},{"rating":"2","title":"attention keeper","review":"My daughter got got this toy when she was 2.

The only complaint I have is that the microphone broke on ours very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted","review":"This was great while it lasted - hasn't even been a month since Christmas and it's broken. The cartridges don't move forward or backword anymore - if they do move once in a while - they are on the wrong page so it asks the child to push a number, my daughter will push the number 4 and it says 10. REally disappointed in the quality for the cost. The only thing that still does work is the microphone which my duaghter (age 2) still has fun talking into. My advise: save the box and receipt so that you can return it when yours breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy!!!!!","review":"Contrary to most of the reviews that I have read... there is a volume control on the toy. It is located on the back. I do agree that it is loud, but there are 2 setting that you can choose from.

The Learn Through Music system was wonderful. He loves Elmo and Barney so both of the cartridges were wonderful. It is really loud if on the loud button for sound, but around here he needs it. He loves singing along with the songs and will get up and dance. I think this is a must for any Elmo, Barney or Nick Jr. fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea that needs to be reworked!!!","review":"I want to add my two cents to the unsatisfactory reviews. I was really excited about this toy, as my 2-year old daughter really loves music, singing, Elmo etc. I would, however, give it a zero rating if I could, because we couldn't even use it. I read the reviews and figured the odds would be with us regarding its performance, but I was wrong! The screen is very dark (why??), with those annoying dots of light behind, and it wouldn't advance properly as soon as we began playing. Hopefully, FP will get the hint and pull this toy until it can be revamped. 30 days refund policy or no, I will be getting my money back for the toy and the two extra cartridges"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"We thought this would be a great learning tool for our daughter, plus she loves music. This is very hard to see. The colors are very dull, so it is hard to tell which color it is for a toddler. The songs are cute, but the whole toy needs re-evaluated."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Great Until It Breaks!!","review":"My son got this for his second birthday last month. Within a week, it broke. The microphone did not work and the screens would not advance. I took it back and exchanged it for another one. Again, within a week that one broke. My son really loved playing with this when it worked, so I exchanged that one and got a third one. Within four days that one broke!!! My son does not play rough with his toys and I can't believe that Fisher Price would make something that can't stand up to a toddler. I usually love Fisher Price toys, but I am very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend it. We purchased the Fisher Price Power Touch learning system for our son for Christmas and I really hope that it's more durable than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is a great toy!! I bought it for my 19 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!! Without a doubt, she has played with this more than any other toy.

This toy is loud and obnoxious. I agree with the reviewer who felt the screen was dark. I also feel that it is hard to manipulate. Also, the quality is not what I would expect from fisher-price. Even after a battery change, the screen refused to advance. Returned to the store within days."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Learning Here","review":"How can Fisher Price teach shapes and colors when you cant see the screen? It is so dark... NOTHING like all the brightly lit screens on the box and in ads. I feel scammed with deceptive advertising.

Shame on Fisher Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Daughter Loved It But.....","review":"I gave this toy 5 stars as far as how fun it is and it's educational value, but after about three weeks the toy stopped working properly. The loudness and the dark screen didn't deter my daughter from playing with it when she got it shortly before her 2nd birthday, but after three weeks of what I consider gentle play the pages stuck and would not move. I changed the batteries but that didn't resolve the problem, and she got so frustrated and was begging me to fix it. Well we got a replacement and the same thing happened. I would buy it again because she loves it so much and still uses the microphone and sings the songs, but for long term play don't count on this toy. For those reviews that say the toy was extremely durable I would love to know where you got yours from so that I can purchase one from there and hopefully get better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"We can't get it work out of the box","review":"We bought this for our 20 month old for Christmas. As a mother of 2, I know how disappointing it is to have a toy that doesn't work on Christmas morning. I always check all the toys as soon as I buy them. The first one that I bought worked in the store, but as soon as I got it home to make sure it was ok it stopped working. I returned that one and picked up the last one in the store. When I got home that one didn't work either. I change the batteries twice and still nothing. I wish I would have read the reviews before having to return this toy twice. I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price for the lack of quality in this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy mom in NJ","review":"I LOVED this toy in theory but now that it is home and doesn't work it was a HUGE waste of money. Let alone all the time spent on the phone with FP and back at the store trying to get it to work. It is affectionately called the \\"mommy melt down toy\\" by my husband because that's what it always causes!!! You'd think FP would help, they were actually quite snotty about the whole thing and if used \\"properly\\" it would last. HA! I just was at our local Toys R us and even the display is broken there! Wish it would have been broken before I bought it. This toy deserves NO STARS but I can't figure out how to do that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My, Grandson loves this toy.

Her vocabulary has increased tremendously, she's putting words and pictures together in her mind, and she is now recognizng alot of the characters more. She especially loves the Oscar song, Big Bird, Cookie Monster and Tully. We just purchased the Blues Clues cassette and she is already in love with it. She uses the microphone and tries to sing along. She knows how to push every button and she is not easy on this toy. The durability has been great. My husband and I know Sesame Street backwards and forwards and I'm actually looking forward to Blues Clues. I am desperately trying to find the Barney cassette after my mom bought the Dora cassette. I totally would recommend this toy to any parent with a child with a curious imagination, a love of pushing buttons, and a love of music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Toy I ever Bought","review":"This is the biggest waste of money I have spent since we had our 17 month old!

My 2 1/2 year old will play with it for hours. There are so many great learning activities on each cartridge, and it sort of \\"grows\\" with him as he learns to do more of them as he gets older. His microphone no longer works consistently (I think Fisher-Price should have taken into consideration that a toy for 18mts & up might be carried around by the mic), but that is the only problem we've had. Also, it would be nice to have more than two volume levels. But it's such a great value for the money, and there are a variety of really neat cartridges available."},{"rating":"1","title":"La, la, la, laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","review":"Received this toy as a birthday gift for my 2 year old. After only a few weeks (and not constant use/abuse) it broke. Either the slides would keep moving or they would studder and stop in the middle of 2 slides. Also read a report on the toy safety website (toysafety.net) that warned this toy could cause hearing damage because of the noise level and how close the child has to be to use the microphone. Anyway... this toy was returned for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this toy locally for 49.99 CAD, and what a waste of money. The screen is so dark that the different colours on the Blue's Clues cartridge are completely indistinguishable.Also, I find it very loud even on the low volume setting. I also feel deceived by the bright colourful packaging, and the website demo is equally misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Volume and a Dark Screen","review":"I think the concept is great. My son (3) likes it. However, this toy is LOUD with no volume adjustment. This may be good for a play environment with lots of background noise (like jet engines, jackhammers, etc.) The screen is DARK and produces a horrible glare when used in a normally lit room. It's a good toy, but it needs improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased this toy for my 2 year old this Christmas. I returned the first one that I bought because the pages would not advance. This happened before I even took the toy out of the package. I thought that one might have been a \\"lemon\\". After playing with the new one for only an hour, the same thing happened. I also thought that there was something wrong with the lighting, but also discovered that the toy is just really dim.It is sad because my son really likes the toy and we also purchased two additional cartridges to go with it. I am hoping that Fisher Price will find a way to better this toy and offer a new and improved toy to those kids how are now attached to the disfunctional ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I think this toy is a wonderful concept, but on the first day that we bought it, it was malfunctioning. Like other reviewers have stated, the screen did not match up with the sounds. Also I did not care for the picture quality on the screen. The lights in the back ground made it difficult for my child to see the pictures. I bought the Dora cartridge, and my two year old showed very little interest, which is strange because she normally loves anything with Dora. I am returning this toy, and the two extra cartridges that go with it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Disappointment","review":"Unfortunately this toy did not meet my expectations. I bought it for my two year old for Christmas. Within a few hours, the screen did not advance properly and the page did not match up with the narration. It was difficult for my son to understand when to advance a page and what exactly he was supposed to do next. Even with my help he became disinterested quickly. I will be returning this product and replacing it with something similar. I thought because of the music factor this would be more fun for him than some of the other brands, but it turns out it was just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This is a total piece of junk. Me and my wife bought this toy for my son for xmas but the toy has already broken and it is only 2 days old. I wish I had read the reviews before I had bought. The problem with the toy I think, is that the gears inside are cheap plastic that wear out fast and allow the toy to not advance as it should which makes the speak and games mis align with the correct screen. either way I love fisher price toys but this one is a big upset and a waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. It would be quicker to flush the money in the toilet than to buy this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!!!","review":"I bought this toy for my 1 year old son for his birthday in August. And it has been a great toy every time we have visitors there kids love it. My son loves to dance to the music and he can advance to the next page easily without help.

Besides the noice level this is a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broke after 2 weeks","review":"My 19 month old son loves this toy. He got it for Christmas and has been playing with it everyday since. Until this afternoon when it stopped working. The pages stopped turning. I called Mattel and they are sending me a new one. Their customer service was excellent! I sure hope it is the newer version with the volume control on it since our old one wasn't and was so very loud!!! And I also hope that it works a bit longer than 2.5 weeks!!

I now have a 19 month old daughter too, and she loves the toy just as much. The youngest bops to the music, and the oldest sings away in the microphone. I have not yet changed the batteries, the \\"pages\\" don't stick, the volume is a good volume since it can be adjusted with the \\"high/low\\" switch on back. I find the toy to be plenty durable since my youngest seems to stand on it quite a bit and has not damaged the screen or any part of it yet. I also plan to buy more cartridges this weekend for them since I just still have the one it came with. I'm hoping the others are just as fun for my kids as the Sesame Street one.

I would not have minded spending the money if only the toy would work properly. I bought the first one which both my kids loved.

When it broke, I took it back and exchanged it for another one hoping it was just a fluke. Now the microphone on the second one is broken after only 2 weeks! I have given up and decided to go with a karaoke machine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I had seen the ads for this toy and rushed out to buy it for my 25 mos old daughter.What a dissapointment.

Third..we have the Elmo cartridge and it is very hard to make out the sounds and understand what they are singing or saying because of their voices (in character).I would not recommend this for anyone. It is a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"This toy has been excellent for my son. I first purchased the age appropriate Leap Pad and was extremely disappointed to open it on Christmas Day. The Leap Pad was difficult for him (1 1/2 a the time) to navigate on his own. There was no way for the machine to know when he was flipping the pages unless he followed the directions (yeah right!) and hit the button with every turn of the page. It also had paper pages and every one know that thise don't last long with a 1 1/2 yr old!

We will be returning the cartridges today so we don't have to deal with it again. Although we are very disapointed, my daugher was looking forward to enjoying this toy for a long time.

Elmo pops up to sing at all the wrong places. The music is great though and she follows along w/the singing of the alaphabet and sings right into the microphone but as far as the page being in the right place when talking about the letter its not.

I would expect for the price it sells for that a volume switch would be standard. What were they thinking? If I didn't get this for half price at a discount store I would be pissed! My daughter still plays with it, but it's got to be my least favorite toy in this whole house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"This toy would be great if you could see what was going on on the screen.

As someone who already owns a dozen Ronald Reagan movies (two of which are on this disc), this \\"collection\\" is quite poor. Santa Fe Trail is a good movie, but I don't know why the other two were picked of all the movies he has been in. I bought this disc because I didn't know what was on it.

This album was supposed to be a tribute to British composers, and two other tracks were recorded, another lyric to \\"I'll Close My Eyes\\" and \\"Good Night, Good Luck, God Bless You.\\" When M-G-M got the finished album, it began reconsidering the commercial appeal to the U.S. public of a British music tribute.

They strut. They preen. They boast. Their values are cars, houses, sexual conquests. They make decisions on what movies people will watch. They cannot utter a sentence without profanity.Why anyone would find this series entertaining is beyond me. The production values are good, but that's about all one can say for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"Great story of a guy from Queens who is the new it boy of hollywood. Jeremy Piven's Ari is the high point of the series - he will have you laughing out loud at least once an episode. Every character in the series is intersting and fun. Guaranteed good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Best Show on TV","review":"This is a great Show, it is very funny. I only started watching entourage durring the second season and had to go out and buy the first season. The second season is better so far but this is still a great season. One of the funniest parts of this show is all of the cameos. The funniest has to be Gary Busey. Over all I highly reconmend these DVDs, the only problem that I have with them is that each Show is 25 minutes where as the Sopranos and Oz each show is 55 minutes. But still well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Show","review":"If I could I would give this show zero my brothers love it but I just think it is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bring myself to care","review":"I had heard a lot about this show... its popularity, its acclaim. We don't get HBO so we rented it. The disc had a glitch in it and we were unable to watch the last 5 minutes of the pilot, but we'd had enough. The characters live a lifestyle that we just couldn't care about; the only one I actually liked was the Eric character, but the rest were so stupid, boring and unappealing that it became too painful to watch.I am going to move on to \\"Six Feet Under\\" and hope for the best. It will be something to do while I wait for the next season of \\"Scrubs\\" to arrive... now there's a show whose characters I can care about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst show on television.","review":"Unoriginal.

If you want a rich melodic album, then by all means, buy this album. If you dont like to think while listening to music, do not buy this album. This album forces you to think and feel about what is being said, and what is being played. When you are alone at night, with the person of your dreams, put this on, and listen to it together. You may come away with a deeper understanding of how music can effect people emotionaly, and spirtually. Then again, I could be wrong, its only my opinion. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm missing something....","review":"There seems to be a lot of glowing reviews for this CD. I guess maybe I just don't get it. I bought this CD (used, thank goodness) because I really like the song \\"Fade into You\\", always have. I know I shouldn't have expected the rest of the album to sound the same, but I confess, I did expect it to at least sound similar. I have tried time and time again to listen to this CD in its entirety, but I just can't. The only time it makes it off the shelf is when I want to hear the one song. I think it's the fact that she just seems to talk through the music.I almost feel guilty slamming the CD. A lot of people really seem to get it. I gave it two stars because of \\"Fade into You\\", if I hadn't liked that song I probably would have given it one, or better yet, not reviewed it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Mazzy Star have their schtick down, don't they?If you liked their previous stuff, well then, have another helping of melancholia, world-weariness, simple chord changes, and mostly sloooow beats.It's music to slit your wrists by. Or at least would be if it didn't lull you to sleep first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring cd ever?","review":"I hate to be a spoilsport, but I just got done with my upteenth attempt at listening to this cd without thinking of everything else. Mazzy Star's first album, \\"She Hangs Brightly\\", is a true masterpiece, definitely on my Top 10 Best '90's Albums list. But this...after 'Fade Into You' (an awesome track), the songs just become an endlessly monotonous drone. It is easily the most boring and listless album that I have ever heard. It's not bad, it's just boring. I can't even recall one single moment of energy. It may be your cup of tea, but it's not mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed","review":"I bought this cd because I love the song, \\"Fade Into You,\\" and hoped there would be other, similar songs. Instead, the rest of the album drags, the lyrics are monotonous and hard to understand, and the mood is downright spooky. Hope Sandoval has a beautiful,unusual voice, but she could use some better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I am SO blown away with this album. It is truly amazing if I can say so myself. As an R&B; and Hip Hop lover, male at that, I must admit that this album's music hits a whole other spot. I can't wait to go and purchase (listened to most tracks from free downloads) because I have to support such outstanding art. While everyone raves over the amazingly beautiful song, Fade Into You, i am so surprised that almost no one has mentioned my current second favorite, Into Dust. That song I can listen to over and over and over and...This album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"the epitome of beauty","review":"I first heard the song \\"fade into you\\" in the movie Angus during the scene where Angus and Melissa shared their first dance. I remember being struck and thinking how beautiful the song was. Years later when my taste in music began to mature I stumbled upon Mazzy again and rediscovered the song. Hope's voice is in my opinion the most beautiful and ethereal voice in rock and roll. \\"Blue light\\", and \\"Five String Serenade\\" are both hauntingly beautiful songs and whenever I hear \\"Into Dust\\" I feel as if I could cry. \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" is a nice little psychedelic number with a cool Celtic feel. Not ever song is perfect though, \\"Wasted\\" seems a little misplaced. I own every Mazzy album and there's just something about this one, like a certain tone in her voice that puts this album just a step above the rest. If I had to pick three cd's to save this would easily be my #1. A must have for any true fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Is a great way to describe this cd. A decade after I purchased it, I still have it in some form of regular rotation. Mazzy Star filled a niche in music that no one else to this day has tried to fill. Some say it is an acquired taste. I say it is just Mazzy Star. Hope's voice is hauntingly beautiful, and when entwined with Dave's guitar work, can make you forget about the world around you. That is a sign of a classic. Who knows, 20 years form now, teens could be treating Mazzy Star like they admire the Doors now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Every time I was with my girlfriend, I suddenly heard this really calm and soothing, romantic music. I wasn't quite sure what it was, but it was really nice and I used to just grab her and slow dance with her because that's what the music made me feel like doing. After some time on the internet, I found that this soothing \\"slow dance music\\" was in fact Mazzy Star's So Tonight That I Might See album. I immediately knew that I had to have it. I gave it to my girlfriend and she loved it. She actually confessed that she heard the exact same music on repeat in her head as well. Now we listen to it in the car, in the bedroom with candles, while taking a bubble bath together (with candles), on roller coasters (with candles), and while baking our favorite sweets (cookies).This is simply a MUST HAVE CD.

Mazzy Star is one of those bands that you either love extraordinarily, or you hate.As for So tonight that I may see, Five String Serenade is my favorite....but there are no songs on this album that I do not love, after all, I am a Mazzy Star fan, and as I said before, you either love Mazzy Star without reservation, or you hate them.Check out the sample songs on this one before you buy it.

I should've seen it coming from a mile off. A singer named Hope Sandoval, in a group called Mazzy Star, with an album titled <So Tonight That I Might See>... It has all the making of one bloated, pretentious, alternative phenomenon that proves everybody eventually gets their fifteen minutes, regardless of whether or not they deserve it. This album is slow and boring, with little or no variation between songs. The lyrics are uninspired and reminiscent of the bad townie poetry written by people who wear too much black. Your money would be better spent on sedatives; you'll get the same effect without feeling cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy if you like just the first song","review":"i've never heard any other songs of this band, except the first one. when i bought a cd, i realized that other songs are in different style and i hate them. so if you like the first song, don't expect other songs be in the same style; just buy the first song for $.99"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fade Into You we know is a suicide note","review":"However, I did hear some more of this back in my days of working at a trucking company, and I would go to this corner store to buy stuff for the people, and this 17 year old girl who was called \\"Flower\\" would play this, and now I think she's near 30. I know if you wanted to paralyze me, and make me docile as a pussycat, or make me curl up in a fetal position is to play \\"Fade Into You\\". I remember hearing this after May 27th, and after my car accidents, and I just fell apart. The slide guitar, the soft singing, and the slow movement it just made me think of girls/women laughing at me, and this is from where I know that a couple of girls had stood me up a couple of times, and it just reminded me of this. The rest is just as bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star Mazzy","review":"This is one of those CD's that you can play forever and enjoy it every time. I'm sure I've played this hundreds of times to fall asleep to or just to wind down. It's like someone decided to put lyrics to a rain and thunder CD and it works because it's the same mood. Dreamy, acoustic, soothing. Tracks 1,4,5, and 9 are sweet. Their first and third albums are just as good. I also recommend Hope Sandovals solo album \\"Bavarian fruit bread\\". Very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD PRESSING great album","review":"I had high expectations for the Mazzy Star reissues on vinyl, unfortunately the pressing is terrible.

In the background of this commercial was a beautiful-voiced woman singing with a simple guitar chord accompaying her. I re-ran that commercial three times (I don't know how I ever survived without DVR). I went to the computer and googled the words 'into dust' and this album came up. I clicked on the song and knew I had the right one. I immediately dowloaded the MP3 album from Amazon and have played the heck out of it ever since. Oh the days of instant gratification! I have never heard of this group before but now that I have, I will be downloading everything from them I can get my hands on. Wonderful stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scanner Darkly","review":"As a product of the 60s, born in the early 50s, when I first heard this CD of what seems a decade ago, I found it to be utterly addictive. The melancholy narcotic droning of Hope Sandoval's voice, is a hook that's impossible to quit. I'm not quite sure how to describe its lyrical qualities. Some of it reminds me of early Dylan in his wide belt and work shirt folk days of the early 60s, combined with a strong dose of Janis Ian and Lenord Cohen, and a dash of Janis Joplin. This, however, would be an incomplete comparison of the bands unique lyrics, sound, and tone. Mazzy Stars \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\", will continue to be listened to well into the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book and price!!!","review":"Even after 15 years of its original publication, this book is THE most complete reference concerning the application of advanced random functions in earth science problems.

I skipped around once I got to the long section on FrontPage. The coverage of Design-Time controls is disappointing and lacks the in-depth detail that was present in the early chapters of this book. I used it with Visual InterDev from the Ground Up and the two compliment each other fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one.","review":"This book is not a Bible at all. It's a introduction for beginners to Visual Interdev at best. It hardly talked anything about Scripting Object Model or Design-Time Controls. Most other Interdev 6.0 books at least attempted on these topics. This book simply avoided these topics. In that sense it's merely teaching people to use Interdev 6.0 like Interdev 1.0, even beginners should probably avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book.","review":"I have learned more about InterDev from an article in Web Tech magazine (distributed freely)than this 700 page book. The book goes blaa blaa wala wala about nothing important. All I need to know is how to create databases on sql, web projects and connect the two, other Db connectivity and the tricks to present Db output as I like. A section for trouble shooting would showoff the writers expertise, but may not for $49. Buy this book if you want to learn FrontPage, you'll find about 150 pages packed with info about FrontPage. Too bad the writer forgot he was writing for InterDev."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thorough VI6 supplement!","review":"This book is NOT the Bible for VI 6 - it is more about general web development.

I'm sorry I spent the $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the beginner or before you have serious problems","review":"Interesting book though several things keep it from earning more stars.Apparently the book was last updated in 1993. So, comparisons using more modern inverters, 400+ Amp alternators, newer wind machines/solar cells are not compared.Personally, I am more interested in the ground up construction of a marine electrical system. The book deals well with the repair and maintenance of an existing one, as well as small projects. The book is more suited to an existing boat owner rather than a builder.Lastly, explanations go from basic to advanced with little time spent in between. Though this isn't a major problem.My recommendation?.. If you need serious help with your boats electrical system.. keep shopping.. But, if you have minor problems, wish to understand the systems better or wish to prevent problems by all means buy this book.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but the best there is for new installation","review":"I have them all from Calder to \\"Living on 12 Volts\\" to \\"12 Volt Bible for Boats\\" and this one is the one that sits next to my breaker pannel.None of these books will take you from start to finish wiring a new boat but this one does it better than the others.

It could have been so much more effective to have this book written by someone with more legible printing. The photos are at times compelling, but others are too obscure for children to interpret.

I understand he remade all his previous hits for his autobiographical movie in 2000. He also added a few from other artists.His voice is still smooth to the ears but in a mature way and this CD sounds great. He sings a song by Johhny Ray called \\"Cry\\" and as soon as I heard it, it brought back memories of when my mother played it by the original artist back in the 60's.

Buy the orginal albums on CD.","review":"This album is multi-millionaire Las Vegas Lounge Lizard David Cassidy's attempt to put more money in his own pocket by re-recording songs from his Partridge Family days (with absolutely awful arrangements...causing the songs to lost about 90% of their charm) after suing to prevent the legitimate owners of the orignal albums to profit from re-mastering and re-releasing these albums on CD. (Evidently Cassidy doesn't realize that most albums must sell a huge number of units before the artists see a single royalty check.)My strong recommendation: Buy the ORIGINAL albums, still available on CD, before millionaire Cassidy forces everyone to buy only his versions of these wonderful pop gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"David just gets better and better!","review":"You mention \\"Partridge Family\\" and people look at you funny, but you know what? This is actually bouncy, feel-good music - and who wouldn't want to \\"c'mon get happy?\\" As much as he wanted to drop the Keith Partridge persona, he seems to have come to terms with it and he actually sounds like he's embracing the songs that made him a teen idol. If you're waxing nostalgic for all things Partridge, then run out and get this CD! You'll be pleasantly surpised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More please, David!","review":"The collection of songs on this CD are excellent, each and every one of them! They'll take you back to those Partridge Family days and more importantly remind you (if you need it) of David's outstanding talent. He's still making magical music and all I can say is rush and buy this CD, you're in for a real treat.David, to you I say, Please let's have more, and soon. You're the best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Then and Still Wonderful Now!","review":"A great new cd from David. David sounds as wonderful as he ever did, especially on all the old favorites like \\"Cherish\\", \\"I Think I Love\\" and \\"Woke up In Love This Morning\\". I just received this CD yesterday and have listened to it at least four times already, and it is responsible for the big smile on my face and song in my heart. Many great vintage pictures of David inside. The sound is as beautiful as it always was...and the smile on his face is still as bright as ever. Thanks David for the new CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Fine Wine, He Just Gets Better With Age!","review":"Okay, what female out there in their late 30's or 40's can't remember having a David Cassidy poster, lunch box, loose leaf notebook or, for that matter, a great big crush on David Cassidy, himself? Well, the good news is that he's just continued to get better as the years have gone by. These songs bring back so many happy memories of the Seventies and David Cassidy. If you were ever a fan, you can't miss buying this album. It will put a smile on your face!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Then songs-Now recorded","review":"This CD is a rip off of the UK version. This watered down version contains 15 tracks including a new version of C'mon Get Happy. It also contains a new mix of No Bridge I Wouldn't Cross which is the best. David also recorded his version of his brother Shawn's remake hit Do You Believe In Magic. Aside from a decent remake of Ain't No Sunshine, this CD is not worth much. The originals are far better. The arraingements are weak and sound like a parody of the originals. True fans will love hearing David re-sing these classics, but others will be disapointed that it is not an Ultimate Collection.The UK version has 22 songs on it including the original version of The Last Kiss. It also contains 2 versions of Could It Be Forever. Covers of Daydreamer, Some Kind Of A Summer, If I Didn't Care and I Write The Songs.For those of us interested in original material from Then and would like to hear new material Now will have to wait til the next century when it will be free."},{"rating":"2","title":"This gentleman really tells some inconvenient truths. Bless him.","review":"Hard-hitting facts and inconvenient truths are what you will find in this book. Every black woman should have this book in her library. I am so glad to see that one of our 'black brothers' wrote this. This guy really 'gets it'. I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he was saying and saying 'tell it!' and 'preach it!' as I read. I also did a LOT of underlining in my book. Needless to say, I could not put it down. I very definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase!","review":"If I could give this book a rate of 0, I would easily do so. I am a woman, and I understand that women are not equal to men in present time. I can also sympathize with Black Women, that it is difficult to compete with other members of society in this day and age. However, Michael Porter does a terrible job defending this as well as educating his readers on the subject. Much of the book is based on his own opinion which does not hold up very well in my mind. He resents White males in this population and his hatred towards Whites basically plays out on every page in this poor, poor book. Take my word, do not purchase this book, you will be displeased, angry and ultimately embarrassed for this man upon completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"Not very practical appetizer recipes.

It seems that you cannot turn a page without coming across one typo or error after another.An example that sticks in my mind: the basis for an accident is called the \\"root\\" cause, not the \\"route\\" cause! Numerous examples abound of incomplete sentances, or sentances cut off or missing information mid-sentance. This makes it hard to place faith in the remainder of the book's information.As I said, still an interesting book, but for a guy who claims (on the dust jacket) to be a noted author for other venues, I would have thought that the quality would be better.Worth buying. . .probably. Worth quoting as a factual basis for further research, not likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"A complete history of the Strategic Air Command is long overdue. As a twelve year veteran of it, four years in the 22nd Bomb Wing (B-47), and eight more in the 55th Strategic Reconnasance Wng (RB-47H),I really looked forward to reading Mr.Lloyd's book. Many good things, but for the most part a major disapointment. Some great photographs and details of the early years in SAC, but despite the errata sheet, typographical errors, mislabed photo's and tales of a B-50 with 1,440,000hp really ruined the book for me. I have Mr. Lloyds book on the B-47 and it is excellant.

For example, the following sentence is from the book:\\"When the heart has already a tendency toward God, we can easily accustom ourselves to suspend the hasty movements of nature, and wait for the second moment when we can act through grace by listening to God.\\" [What does this mean????]Although I don't have the original French in front of me, Fenelon probably was saying something like: \\"If we have given primary place to God in our hearts, we can learn to curb our impulses and wait for the grace of God to direct our responses.\\"The muddled, literal translation found in this book does a disservice to Fenelon, who is a clear thinker on spiritual topics.

I don't know about other brands but I don't see the point in spending the $ (Iomega costs more because of the name) if the drive is barely going to last a year, unless it's so that Iomega can offer me their \\"data recovery services\\" at ridiculous prices.

So this Christmas I bought \\"That's Not My Monster...\\" and is it ever a hit! It's super colorful, has lots of varying textures and the pictures are cheery and vivid. If you're familiar with the series, you don't need to be warned that the text is VERY similar within all the books :) Regardless of the repetition (which I think babies really do like), these books (and especially this book) is a winner that makes my little girl smile over and over again. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book great for my 11 month old!","review":"My daughter loves this book! she loves the colors and the different textures, she's 11 months old and I will sit with her and read it to her, lots of pictures, and different things for her to touch and experience! well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the monsters!","review":"A very simple, cute, and fun book for our one year old who loves it and brings it over, crawls into our lap, starts to turn the pages and touch on all the \\"touch and feel\\" parts.

I have loved \\"The Immigrant\\" series of books since they first started, and have read them over & over again. The characters have always been well-written and highly believable. Sadly, I do not feel that I will be re-reading this book anytime soon and cannot recommend it to those who have read the series. I felt that this was not in the same caliber as the other 5. The thing that I was most disappointed in: People that had died 2 books earlier were now alive (one glaring example: Stephan Cassala's wife Joanna). It was almost as if someone else wrote the book instead of Mr. Fast. Did the editors of this book ever read the first 5? If so, wouldn't they have checked for errors in chronology/family history/content?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad to see her go","review":"Ten minutes ago I finished reading 'An Independent Woman.' Saddened at the untimely death of Barbara Lavette, I feel the book was aptly titled. The book, to the end, portrayed a woman with incredible character. I can't share in the disappointment of the previous reviewers. It was a joy to share in the Levy/Cohen/Lavette families again. My only complaint - the walking tour of Jerusalem seemed to be filler. A great wrapup to a great set of books. Read them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A First Draft.","review":"I glanced over the array of new books and saw Howard Fast's Independent Woman. His entire series have been exciting, wonderful. Didn't think he would write another. I read everything he wrote and was always entranced with his San Francisco sagas. And here was yet another to take the story further. He had done it again. Except he hasn't.

This will be my very last Sony camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly the digital camera I was waiting for.","review":"This camera has all the features I've wanted in a digital camera and is easy to learn. There was only one disappointment. I was hoping to be able to place the memory stick into my Sony PDA and view the pictures there but alas it turns out not the case. My Palm JPG viewer was not able to access the photos on the MS. You'd think Sony products would have some compatibility here. I do recommend you get a larger memory stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best camera I ever bought!","review":"I just bought this camera and I have had the best time using it. It takes wonderful crisp pictures and is easy and fun to use. It works great in all conditions.

After that, it didn't turn on, or it worked for a while and then turned off when you took the picture, leaving the lens outside. Too bad I couln't return it, but it was definitely a waste of money. Don't even bother.Strange to find a sony product this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabid compression of images damages overall value","review":"There's no question the DSC-P93 is a great value. It is probably one of the lowest priced 5MP rated cameras. It is loaded with features and gives the user the capability to manually control more settings that most of its competitors, but it does not give the user the ability to capture uncompressed, RAW, or otherwise loss-less image formats such as GIF.This would be less of a problem if there was a way to turn up the quality of the jpegs that it produces, but there isn't. So if you are taking photos that include human hair or of a bird the hair and the feathers are captured with disappointing lack of definition. Fine for snapshots of your kids birthday party though. If I had it to do over I'd have purchased a different camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner's Review","review":"This review is specifically written to contradict the review for beginners saying you must read the entire manual to use it or get horrible pictures.I don't know much about photography, but use this camera often at college (I take a few about a hundred a month). Only 6 months later did I finally crack out the manual b/c I wanted to learn about the more advanced features.For non-beginners, you might have to crack the manual before using (?) because you know about different features, but not a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used Junk","review":"When I took it out of the package I wondered what \\"acceptable\\" meant to the person I purchased it from. It looked like it had been through the civil war. It had no cord, and it needed an adapter to hold the memory stick. When I turned it on the screen was broke.

It would make a great soundtrack for a futuristic/sci-fi adventure flick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not all voices","review":"I love the MercyMe version of \\"What Child is This\\" from the WOW album and it is the reason I bought the song book. I wanted the choir I'm in to sing it for Christmas this year.However, I was very dissapointed to find that the song book only lists the vocal part for one voice and did not include the harmony part. I'm sure that we could figure it out, but we are short of time and this means we won't be able to perform it this year.Otherwise the book is nice. Very large in size, big print, and all songs listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the motivation?","review":"As a longtime Joy Division fan, I approached this film with trepidation. Knowing that Anton Corbijn is a huge JD fan eased my concerns, but the film is a bit of a mess. Yes, it looks good and the black and white photography plays to Corbijns strengths, but I kept saying to myself \\"If I didn't already know this story (and why is is so monumentally important) why would I care about it?\\" I could not identify what was motivating the characters in the movie and I think most people would have a difficult time generating much empathy for Ian. You're better off getting the recently released Joy Division documentary, which is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Breathtaking.1st time Director, an unknown cast in the title role.Excellent supporting cast - I still smile every time I see Tony Wilson being portrayed.Beautiful black and white photography.And a heartbreaking brilliant story.What more do you want?This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who still remembers buying \\"Love will tear us apart\\" from the Arndale Manchester."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good film","review":"I watched the movie only, none of the extras.

It is written by the main person who was closest to him in private moments at this time in his life. There is always a difference between a book and a movie, and then between a movie and reality. I love this movie if only for being able to give me a brief glimpse into this awesome life. Sam Riley is uncanny in this role, I think that has been said over and over. Don't believe the negative hype written by people who never met the guy and make your own judgment. His daughter has his exact eyes and lips and he loved her. Beautiful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I go to B-school?","review":"This book boils all of the marketing concepts I learned while in B-school(and some I didn't) into an easy read format.

I've listened to this cd at least a billion times and it's never grown old on me. Although I love Something Cool and Duet, this is my favorite June Christy cd for it has the right mix of slow and cheerful songs.Why is June Christy my favorite singer? Because she is unique. She stamps her identity upon her songs, not only with her sincere singing but also with her music, which I've always have found to be peculiar. I can't think of another singer who uses the oboe so much in her work.There are songs in this cd that still give me shivers like The Wind and Round Midnight, which Christy sings the definite version of. Her songs aren't just songs, they're stories. You can see June pulling up that collar!Also look out for the last track Intrigue, sadly hidden. Sing Something Simple is adorable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime and Silky","review":"Yes indeed there is a sublime misty quality to her voice. If you like Mel Torme, then June is for you. There was a wonderful and unique tone to American women singers of the 40's and 50's. They possessed a power and perfect pitch that rode high on the wave of a full orchestra. June is no exception and whatever you are doing you have to just sit for a while to listen to her wonderful interpretations. I'm not sure why she never made it as big as her counterparts, perhaps her voice was a little too unique for her time. But today, judging by the wonderful reviews she receives here, there is a new appreciation for this artist. One of the greats and if this is your first album there can be no finer introduction. God Bless you June."},{"rating":"2","title":"second review","review":"My earlier review remarked that the trouble with this cd is that it contains 14 tracks whereas the one originally released in Brasil contains 49 tracks on two cds.

Ben Stiller provides a humorless part, I doubt he read the script because I don't know why he would choose to take a role where the supporting cast provides the humor and he is just the \\"feel sorry for\\" guy who gets cheated on during day one of his honeymoon. Debra Messing is much too likeable to play this part. We're suppose to hate her for what she's done to her new husband, but I just didn't. Now for Jennifer Aniston. She doesn't do to bad for playing a character that's about 25% developed. Need I say more? As for the romance in this romantic comedy.. Where was it? Did they even fall in love? Who knows? In the end Polly seemed unsure of what she wanted. I felt that the film was elevated above one star HOWEVER, because of Azaria and Hoffman. They played their roles superbly, too bad no one else on board was up to their par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively painful","review":"This was a horrible movie and after a while, I just couldn't force myself to watch anymore. Unconvincing acting, weak story line and worst of all, unending junior-high humor, prominently featuring bodily functions. Not worth the time or the money to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy; Great actors","review":"I expected great things from this movie. Jennifer Aniston is an excellent actress (Her performances is \\"The Good Girl\\" and \\"Office Sapce\\" were spectacular), and Ben Stiller is, at the least, a talented comedic actor, who seems to be going the way of Eddie Murphy (talented comedic actor; starring in garbage movies).Even so, the only parts of this movie that are any good are the parts that involve Alec Baldwin and Hank Azaria, who are hilarious, in spite of the plot.The movie itself is incredibly cliched, and the lead characters are thoroughly uninspired, and intensely one-dimensional. If you enjoy laughing at sucky movies, then go for it; otherwise, avoid this one. Honestly, it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polly should have kept moving ...away","review":"I like both Stiller and Aniston but saw absolutely no chemistry between them in this blatant attempt to raid the box offfice. If the preview looked funny to you - you saw all that really was funny in this movie. Otherwise, it just plods along and seems to go nowhere without any real laughs or charm. In fact, for a comedy, it is not funny. Hank Azaria has the best bits in a cameo at the beginning and again at the end. Watch it only if you are really bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This movie pretty much follows the same pattern as \\"There Is Something about Mary\\". We've seen it before and we've seen it much better. The attempt to keep it within PG-13 bounds probably hurt, as well. Once you get into R territory, all bets are off, and perhaps then this movie could have gone all out.The supporting cast is the best thing about the movie. Alec Baldwin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman bring the best parts for this movie. This movie isn't as good as \\"There Is Something about Mary\\", not even close. I'd almost put this film into the \\"chick flick\\" genre, but it's not bad enough to do this. Although it follows the usual pattern (guy meets girl, they get into a fight, they make up again, the end).Anyway, if your a fan of Jennifer Aniston, you will appreciate this movie (i guarantee). If you want some good laughs without too much thinking, get this, or better, \\"There is Something about Mary\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Even Bother...","review":"Along Came Polly is a complete waste of time. Like Zoolander, the only funny parts were in the trailer for the film. Don't get me wrong, Ben Stiller was really funny in Meet the Parents, but don't even expect 1/92nd of the laughs. Dont rent it, dont buy it, or you'll be just like me, warning everyone else not to make the same mistake. Take your money, and if you havn't bought Return of the King, do yourself a favor and buy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Well if you're expecting any kind of Something About Mary/Meet the Parents quality comedy, it aint here. Stiller and Aniston appear in this although I would like to think when they read the script (if they did?) they rejected it and were then offered more money than they could turn down. Maybe Stiller has turned into another Adam Sandler thinking that him just being in the movie makes it a quality comedy, I hope not. Another animal oriented automatic laugh producer falls flat with this time a ferret being the actor, which is an awful failure. Did I mention the atrocious \\"salsa\\" dancing bits? The only decent bit is Phillip Seymor Hoffman playing the sidekick to Stiller that still doesnt make up for the rest of the generic comedy witnessed here. This one was obviously shot out of the meatgrinder too quickly and it shows......Waste Of Talent for an hour and a half anyone? No, I thought not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Along came Polly....and there goes my lunch...","review":"Wow, another Ben stiller movie, MY FAVORITE! Hey Ben, you played the EXACT SAME CHARACTER in Something About Mary!!!! Wake up! Too bad the dog from that movie wouldn't even be seen with you again, they had to get a ferret to attack you this time! Do us a favor and cover yourself with honey for your next remake \\"Gentle Ben\\". Ugh.If you like Ben Stiller please \\"See all my reviews\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ALONG CAME POLLY","review":"Yet another romantic comedy about unlikely people coming together despite themselves, and this one's worse than most. The premise is fine and you'd think that Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston would make it work, but not so. The two leads are talented, but somehow there's never any believable spark between them, and neither's character is particularly likeable anyway so it's hard to see what they might see in each other apart from sheer desperation. The script is terrible and relies heavily on bathroom humor and other juvenilia. This is an unfortunately crude, crass, blatantly unbelievable and highly unfunny film."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BOTHER!!!!","review":"Nope, didn't think it was that funny. Too cutesy. Not a really good movie. Expected more, got less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awlful","review":"This may be the worst movie in the history of the world. Bring it on was better than this. I am sorry but this movie stunk. Extremely boring and anoyying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Average in Every Way","review":"Do not waste your time on seeing this movie...You've seen the best parts in the trailers (with the exception of the crude humor of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The plot is completely predictable and the comedy is squeezed into the story in a way that makes it un-natural and uncomfortable to watch...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Polly is barely worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!!","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. I figured with Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller it could not be anything but great. The only actor with a humorous presence was Ben's geeky friend - a childhood actor still trying to cash in on the one good movie he starred in (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The \\"relationship\\" between \\"Ben and Jen\\" was so far fetched you didn't even want their characters to end up together. Ben played his usual role of an anal geek (which I usually laugh at). I kept waiting for the \\"meat\\" of the story line to kick it, but it never did. I still love this Ben and Jen but this movie was a complete flop. Save your money - wait for this one to be released on DVD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALONG CAME CRAPPY !","review":"This movie is as funny as, re-electing George Bush!It's a boring stupid comedy, with Ben Stiller thedork in it! If you want to laugh, see Elf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two funny-ish scenes. Not much else.","review":"Ben Stiller can be very funny in a hapless sort of way, and Jennifer Aniston could become a fine comedian at some point. That said, there's not much to this little bit of fluff. The story about very mismatched people who meet and fall in love is not convincing for a moment. The movie feels like a rerun of something I've seen a number of times in slightly different formats and with different actors du jour. Appropriate for pre-teen girls. I'd feel ripped off if I paid $10 to see it in the theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeech and double-yeech!","review":"Hands down the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen . . . and I'm a Ben Stiller fan. Or was.They seemed to have shoehorned Aniston's character into the script. At no point in the movie did you ever get the feeling that Stiller and Aniston's characters loved each other or had much in common. The only reason they seemed to start a relationship was that the script instructed them to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the chemistry?","review":"I've never written a review of a movie, but this one deserves it. I am a big Ben Stiller fan as well as a fan of Jennifer Anniston (especially Good Girl). I am very disappointed in both of them. This movie will make you laugh...if you enjoy potty humor and old gags...or if you are 10 years old. But there is no intelligent humor here. Most disconcerting is the lack of chemistry between the main characters. No character development whatsoever. Ben and Jennifer's character (I don't even remember their character's names...shows how much of an impact this \\"film\\" made on me) never mesh in this movie. We don't know why these two would EVER want to be together.RENT this movie. I hate the reviews of other people. You need to see it for yourself. Just don't BUY it until you've seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"Jennifer Aniston is an excellent, natural actress. Ben Stiller is from one of my favorite comedy families, Stiller (Jerry) and Meara (Ann), who are his parents. He has definitely inherited their talents. This movie is funny, touching, sad, and quirky. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"I expected more from Ben Stiller and Aniston is certainly a good actress. I believe the story line could have been funnier. He's trying to change his ways for her, but I just didn't think it was all that funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Cute \\"Date\\" movie","review":"It's Ben Stiller, it's funny. Jennifer is always adorable. With a cute story to boot, but trust me guys, it's not a chick flick, it's funny, you will enjoy it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was funny","review":"This movie had it's funny parts and then it's really funny parts. Overall I think it was a good movie. Ben Stiller almost makes anything funny. He's a good actor. It was pretty entertaining, I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"This was a fun movie. So what if it has a lot of bathroom humor bathroom humor is funny!! And NO! its not immature to laugh at it!I loved the part when his friend told what 'sharted' was. ~ha!! Good movie. Good love story opposites really attract!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.","review":"If you like toilet scenes and enjoy humor below waist, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Stiller Fans Should Give it A Try","review":"I love this movie and it is more than I hoped it would be. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that Philip Seymour Hoffman felt really out of place in this movie and did a really bad Jack Black imitation. The entire time, he acts just like Jack Black, it is almost if Jack turned down the role that was written for him. If you are a fan of Ben Stiller, you need to see this movie because I couldn't stop laughing and I have a feeling that it will be the same for you. I've seen this movie many times and it is still as funny as the first time I watched it. Overall, maybe not as good as some of his other films, but still really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer Aniston saves the day....again!","review":"Along Came Polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely Jennifer Aniston makes this film almost worth while. I probably would have turned this movie off if it wasn't for her. Aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one, she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. Ben Stiller is another story, he always picks the same, stereotypical role. I guess Stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part. Oh well, Along Came Polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon. I recommend The Good Girl or Reality Bites instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"You learn to love it...","review":"...and by that I mean; I usually have to see the typicall Ben Stiller-comedy (like indeed this one is) a couple of times before I notice all the details that makes this kind of romantic-comedy funny. Take Alec Baldwin, Stillers' characters' annoying boss, well, the first I did not really \\"notice\\" him, but now; Every time I see \\"Along came Polly\\" I'm able to laugh out loud even watching it for myself when the movie gets to the toilet-scene. He he, what a pig -and who doesn't recognize themselves in that situation. I mean, These people do exist, the people who never clean their hands after a visit in \\"the white room\\" and have their nasty fingers all over. Also the other \\"pig\\" who \\"sharted\\" at the party where we first meet Polly is hysterical. I somehow just had to get used to the \\"rhythm\\" of this comedy, today being one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing...","review":"It truly boggles the mind that movies like this continue to attract an audience...which is exactly why Hollywood will never stop making them. This script was written in about a day. Take all the usual stuff...fill in with flatulence...and crank it out. Usually the endings of movies are predctable...this movie was actually predictable scene by scene. Stiller can be very funny...Aniston is also usually good...this movie was horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dull....","review":"Ben Stiller maybe in this movie but this is NOTHING LIKE 'There's something about mary' which is great. The movie starts off with Ben stiller (Rueben)getting married to this woman who has s** with another man while on their honeymoon. Yes they divorce immediately and what a surprise 'Along came polly'. There is absolutely NO ON-SCREEN chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller + the dull script does not help this film. I got a question for the script writer of this movie: how is a man talking in a french accent funny?!!!?Note: I recommend 'Our house' (Drew Barrymore, Ben stiller). This movie is better than 'there's something about mary'. It's about a couple who are tricked into buying a home that comes with an old woman who drives them CRAZY. It's so funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"$40+ dollars just because it's a blu-ray disc??????","review":"Why would ANYONE pay over $40 for this movie that's almost a decade old when you could get the DVD for under $10??? Do the studios think we believe there is such a huge difference??? Do they think we're idiots? Don't answer that lol. This movie was moderately funny, but in no way is it worth spending the extra $30.00 just because it's the blu-ray version. Two words sums this one up... \\"BIG DEAL!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Weak movie. Kids thought it was boring. Parents too. Not as bad as Starsky & Hutch which was the worst of the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE.","review":"This is one of the worst films I've seen recently. It was a complete waste for me to buy the DVD. Sometimes you win, sometimes not. I bought some other DVD's this year because people told me the movies were winners. Kill Bill was a winner, Welcome to Mooseport was a winner...this was a loser and a flop.Along Came Polly bored me half to death before it was halfway through. The story was dry and predictable, with only one good joke through the whole thing; and that one joke was crude. Unfortunately the person who recommended this to me has a much different taste in movies than I do, and the rest of my audience seemed to agree with me. It was a disappointment and one of those movies you see once, and don't plan on ever seeing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I couldn't believe that Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston could ever be this bad in a movie together. Of course it had some cute little funny parts that made you chuckle quietly to yourself, but I saw this movie expecting it to be a hilarious comedy. The movie was long and drawn out and it was extremly predictable. The only thing that could describe this movie would be a HUGE YAWN. This is a good movie to rent for a night when you have nothing else to do. I would strongly advise against buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More ammunition for those who don't like Jennifer....","review":"More ammunition for those who don't like Jennifer... That's one of the main consequences of this movie, where she has no chemistry with Stiller at all, and, once again, she is on a secondary role (like in BRUCE ALMIGHTY), and playing once again a slightly \\"empty brain\\" woman. I think all the deserved credit she has received by \\"The Good Girl\\" are going useles due to movies like this, where she can't hold the audience's interest in her character. Although the Polly character has its name in the title of the movie, this is a Stiller movie from beginning to end.There are good points, mainly Hank Azaria, but this is definitely a movie to RENT, not to buy at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Ben Stiller Ever Be a Big Star?","review":"Not if he keeps making these ho-hum dumb comedies. OK, part of it is cute. The feret is cute. Jennifer Anniston is cute, but thats about it. Its a one joke sitcom of a movie. Actually, another sitcom star is in this movie, Debra Messing. She's not cute when she leaves good ole Ben during the honeymoon for a scuba instructor with large equipment. Ben is good at playing the loser, but lets give us all a break. Play a killer, a gay guy, a female impersonator, something interesting, but please!!! No more loser in love roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sharted!","review":"This movie was a complete waste of my time. There were some funny scenes but I never bought Polly being attracted to Reuben. The funniest scene was the basketball pickup game, with the hairy guy sweating all over Reuben's face, and Philip Seymour Hoffman saying \\"I sharted\\" and then walked away funny. I liked Jennifer Aniston, too. I agree with my other half that she reminded me very much of Ellen in her early days. Hank Azaria looks great & has a great rear end, but Along Came Polly is just too stupid most of the time. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Disposable Movie","review":"I call this a disposable movie because it is one of those movies that you watch once but once you've seen it, it's not a movie you will find necessary to re-watch or purchase. It's not a terrible movie, but simply o.k. I think it could have been a lot better if they did away with the bathroom humor. A joke or two is funny, but this movie goes overboard to the point it is nauseating and childish. I found the \\"SART\\" scene especially offensive. If this had been toned down, I think the movie would have been much better. I did LOVE the adorable ferret though. For this alone, I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disppointment","review":"I love werewolves, and I eagerly bought this book though wanted to return it when I was finished. This book, though beautifully written, has flat, one-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and majorly underdeveloped relationships. Kern and Ainsy barely knew each other and they rushed into sex just like that. Ainsy started out as a strong female character, sometimes snappish but a sweetheart on the inside, and she ends up a helpless damsel in distress when I expected her to tell off the harper and give him a good slap. The plot was thin, with not enough emotion, and the characters simply go with the flow, never developing their own characteristics. But the prose is excellent and breath-taking; I'd like to read other books from this author, though I'll check them out from a library first. The author has a fantastic way with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fictional book I've ever read","review":"Wolf Moon was the best inspirational story I've ever read. This was my first time reading one of Charles De Lint's books and it won't be the last.

But the other 2 CD's are mostly, hard banging tek-trance, sometimes even surpassing hard trance and going into hard core tekno. There are a couple of \\"so-so\\" tracks sprinkled here and there.

I work in graphics and computer sales, so hopefully my advice will carry some weight. Most disappointing is the fact that HP continues to crank out printers which CANNOT load a piece of paper straight.

HP tech support is terrible. They are hard to understand and did not know until more than an hour on the phone that the driver wasn't written for double sided printing anymore. Their advice was to wait for the updated driver (still not available though it has been over three months). Most of the features on the panel of the printer will not work in conjunction with the computer, for example the button that would allow you to scan at the printer without going back to your computer each time to tell it to scan to the hard drive.

Other than this constant clicking noise coming from the scanner the machine worked fine. Had a few paper misfeeds in the document feeder but never really had a cartridge problem. I suppose I will continue to buy HP but factor in only 1.5-2 years of performance. Have a Deskjet 960c and 970cse and they have been at it for at least 5 years.

Love the faxing and the scanning. Color copying is also a major plus. Running on Dell with XP. Setup was easy.

Follow that with the constant arguments we shared about the bloody door being open when the doors were all closed. Then the idiot finally turned into a vegetable... Literally. The firmware corrupted... failed suicide attempt maybe. Point being, after three years of substandard, and quite frankly pitifully poor performance, I will not buy another HP multi-functoin, or laptop for that.

Mechanically nice, but what good is that when the software is so poorly written that every print job is an adventure?You may find that a perfectly routine print job simply stops printing, forcing you to go into the print menu and restart the printer. Or that your grayscale presets have changed to color. (When I complained to HP about this, they said it was a known issue but they had no useful solution.) I have had the printer for about a year at least, have upgraded the software and used it many times -- I see no improvement.

Paper type being wrong. Images not scanning. Multipage documents being unfeedable because the feeder grabs everything on the diagonal. Reset function not working. The list is endless--there are unlimited ways this machine can confound itself, and the user. The end result is that your enemy will be stuck with a very large paperweight on his desk, and no printer, scanner, fax machine, or copier.

I sent it back once under warranty only to be sent a re-manufactored unit. Then along comes another problem and I can't get new cartridges to align correctly...brand new cartridges!!! I called the obviously India based HP tech support folks and they said they could help with the problem, but it would cost me $30 because the printer was now out of warranty.

Their web support page went through a series of suggestions, including cleaning the cartridge slots, which I did. Their final suggestion was to buy a new set of cartridges, and if that didn't work, the unit would need servicing.

Sometimes the same thing happens with the scan function. When it worked, I was happy with the scanning until recently. Now black lines are appearing on all the scanned pictures. It appears that the underside of the glass needs to be cleaned. According to the HP website, cleaning the underside of the glass should NEVER be attempted by the consumer. Thanks a lot!

The printing -- when jobs actually went through -- went from very fast to cranking out one page every three minutes (reserve a few hours if you have any large documents to print). The copier was temperamental. The scanning function has never worked properly.

Overall ok.","review":"I gave this light 2 stars for a few reasons:1) Sensor is terrible at detecting things directly below the light. I wanted to install this light for my porch right outside of my door. I installed it about 7' high in a 4'X4' porch. The sensor would not pick up any motion anywhere 3.5' (radius) from the light. I have to stick my hand up and wave at the sensor to wake up the light. I think part of the problem is that the sensor is flat (perpendicular to the ground) which prevents the sensor from detecting things right below the light.2) The build quality is mediocre.

He just lists and describes them. Very dry.I eventually stopped reading the book and just used it as a reference when doing our open book online quizzes. This worked well.

(His opera vocal coach must cringe to hear him close his throat to sing in that style, though.) Unlike Pavarotti who sings \\"pop\\" with full opera voice, Bocelli can actually sing \\"pop\\" style like a pop singer. I like it. I do miss having more than one full voice note on my Bocelli pop album, though (the end of \\"When I Child is Born\\"). I wish they wouldn't leave cool tracks like Semplicemente (released on the International version) off the North American version.

The voice is not used for maximum potential as with a singer of this calibre. The over all production is very scattered and very unprofessional in places. The duet with Stell does feature a nice yet unclear sound from the young singer. With better songs and a good production team Stell could have a career on her own. It is unfortunate that she has to showcase her voice with a song where the chorus sounds much like music to vacuum your house by. Very disappointing effort from all associated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with delivery (or non delivery) of this item","review":"When I ordered this on 12/04/2006 they said I would have it before Christmas. Then right before Christmas the delivery date was changed to mid-January. So I had to cancel my order and go, at the last minute, buy it at a store because it was a Christmas present. I wasn't happy about it and won't be buying from amazon for the holidays any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Bocelli's Album - Andrea","review":"I listen to him in my car. His voice relaxes me and sometimes I sing along. Since I lived in Italy for a while, I can even understand some of his words. I've lost count of the number of his albums I have. When he came to my home town to perform, I bought tickets up close to see him. He's great!

All the songs to me sound the same, like one long song. His voice is like he's using only 30% of potential. Many times I was not even sure whom I'm listening to: Andrea Bocelli or Enrique Iglesias.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion of the Heart","review":"With his latest recording \\"Andrea\\", I had no difficulty finding songs that surpassed my previous exposure to his music. Although I was disappointed that the \\"Andrea\\" CD omitted the english translation in may of the songs. I was still moved by the recordings which appeared to be a blend of pop, classical, and opera, a special gift to the listener. \\"Sin Tu Amor\\" with Mario Keys blended beautifully with classical guitar and \\"When a child is born\\" it brings sweet memories the dreas I have had for my own children. \\"Go Where Love Goes\\" brought me full circle to my first exposure to Mr. Bocelli. What better way to find calm and tranquilty in my thoughts but to listen to the angelic voice of Holly Still and the soul and passion of Andrea Bocelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Singer - My Favorite Collection","review":"Bocelli is my favorite artist and this is my favorite collection of songs. I am enjoying every one and have gone so far as to document the words in Italian so I can appreciate them more. The words are included in the cover insert, but are in small print and on a print background so it makes it very difficult to read.Harmonies in duets are excellent and Bocelli gives so much expression to each song, it is inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"This product does not work at all. Do not buy it. It is complete junk. And \\"warranty\\" service from Belkin is non-existent.Save your money for a quality product from a quality manufacturer. Belkin is not one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only reason I haven't returned this item is that I bought it bundled with other Belkin products that worked for me.The TuneCast II is perhaps one of the biggest wastes of money out there for your MP3 player. I tried it in my car... I am unable to get even *marginally* acceptable sound quality no matter which radio station I use. I tried Belkin's \\"Best Station\\" web page and none of their suggestions worked. Maybe I would need to put this device a foot away from my car's antenna for it to work -- but that's a bit impossible given its cord which is a few inches long. This little gizmo would be great if it could transmit with more power and actually work. All I get is broken-up music full of static. I own a different FM transmitter I bought maybe 10 years ago and that one works much better. Don't buy this unless you can duct tape it to your radio antenna."},{"rating":"2","title":"TuneCast II","review":"Good universal FM transmitter. It covers the full FM spectrum. The instructions come with a link to find the best FM signals in your area - I am able to stay on the same station from Baltimore to Dulles. The sound is no better than FM quality but of course, it can't be.It eats AAA batteries - I have to change them once a week. However, I have rechargeables and always keep a spare pair in the car. I've never experienced my TuneCast II's memory erasing itself when the batteries died - my presets remain after I insert new batteries. Of course, you can skip the batteries and use the included DC power but I don't have all those spare DC outlets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK Within 3 Feet for the First Month or Two, Then Nada","review":"The unit must be right next to an antenna for it to give a rather low quality sound.

If you have money to throw away, then this is for you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"some help with the static","review":"the first day with the unit i wasn't actually using it in real world conditions, just sitting in the garage trying to find four stations that appeared to work ok to put into the memory. that done, i put it in the glovebox and went back inside. the next day on the way to work, i found that i was getting a lot of static on all 4 of those channels.. except when i reached over to pick it up to change stations (an accident in the making, as another review stated..) as long as i kept a hand on it, the reception was not cd quality, but probably about the same as radio quality. after a bit of thought, i looped the headphones a few times around the transmitter's cable, then strung them over the passenger seat's sun visor, and i haven't had to mess with it since.so, clearly the device wasn't tested very well, it does need a longer antenna, but you can makeshift a reasonable solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Be Warned","review":"I received this as a gift for Christmas and at first it was fine, at first.

Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the one that comes with the power cord instead","review":"A lot of people have been saying this transmitter doesn't work like it's supposed to. That's not necessarily true; it's crap if you use it with batteries, but works well if you get the mobile power cord to go with it. I couldn't believe the difference. The transmitter DOES provide you with near CD quality sound through your radio, but since you must have the power cord to get that sound, I give it a low rating for misleading package information. Plus my cord that connects the transmitter to the power cord has a short in it after only three months, so if I move the transmitter at all, it clicks off. You're better off buying the Belkin kit that comes with the power cord; you'll save yourself a lot of money and grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"This unit is TOTALY WORTHLESS! Please don't waste your money! Heck, you can have mine if you want it, but it's not worth the postage to send it to you. Sounds like your speakers are stuffed with wet socks, if you can find a station that isn't pure static, which is nearly impossible. I'm shocked that they can actually sell a product that is this poorly designed. I made an oath never to buy anything with the name Belkin on it again. Are you getting that this is a really, REALLY horrible product?! No kidding. No axe to grind. Thought it was a great idea. Gladly paid for it, and eagerly tried it out. EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED!!!

I didnt get a chance to use the item till I moved to India in early June. That's when I realised that the product was not working as it was supposed to. Basically, the thing refuses to Auto-OFF, and thus drains the 2-AAA batteries, overnight! Unless, of course, I remove them after listening to songs on my iPod. According to the manual, the product is supposed to Auto-OFF when there is no signal for 30 seconds...Clearly since it was more than 30 days, I could not return the product on Amazon. So I tried writing into Belkin Customer Service to see if anything could be done. I received a prompt response from Belking saying this product is not meant to be used outside of the US (which wasnt mentioned anywhere when I purchased the product). When I requested whether anyone from Tech Support could help me with the problem, I havent heard from them since (over 3 weeks).Has left a bad taste in my mouth:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good after you modify it. Mediocre out of the box.","review":"I was disapointed with my purchase of this product. When checked it momentarily after opening it seemed to work satisfactory. But when I really began to use it I discovered how difficult it was to keep it tuned in, and keeping it static free was almost impossible. I have high end eqipment so that wasnt the problem.Since I had thrown away my reciept and packaging I decided to take it apart and see if I could hack it in an attempt to get better signal output, and work better it does. I posted what I did at pcawesomizerdotcom. If you are stuck with one of these, this will make the performance far superior to what it is out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"If you are looking for a way to play your ipod over the radio in your car or home, do not even consider this. The sound quality is horrendous and is staticky even close to the antenna. Your speakers will recieve almost no treble. If you actually want to listen to your music buy a cassette adapter. It will make life much easier on the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, at best","review":"I absolutely LOVE my I-Pod and decided that I had to take it everywhere. Unfortunately, I do not have a cassette player in my car. Solution: Belkin's Tune-Cast Transmitter--it would be easy and perfect.I was in for a suprise. If you live in an area where there are many unused frequencies, this can be a wonderful idea. However, my commute is along a major highway in the Boston area, and it is impossible to find a frequency that will allow my music to transmit with minimal static. I was constantly adjusting the radio, then adjusting my Transmitter to find low frequency stations. Finally I decided to leave the I-Pod and transmitter at home. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I wish the store I bought it from would have taken it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin FM Transmitter","review":"I read in the description this was in very good condition. When I got it, I found out that it was at best in fine condition. It was a little beat up, had corrosion in the battery slots, and some sort of gunk all over it. I was not told in the description it needed the car power attatchment to make it work, even if it did have batteries. I was quite disappointed to learn that it was not in the condition it was made out to be. I cleaned it up, and it works fine. I am happy with the product, but I am not happy with the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the answer to traveling w/ your ipod...","review":"I live in a fairly large metropolitan area and many of the lower FM frequencies that would be available in smaller towns are filled here. That being said, it's difficult to find a frequency to tune into with the Tunecast II. The second problem is sound quality...it's not terrible but it's less than cd-quality sound. Third is the Tunecast II's monstrous appetite for AAA batteries. On one car trip (a total of 6 hours of driving) I changed batteries twice. The secondary problem with this battery hog is that it loses its programmed memory when it loses battery power, forcing you to reprogram the frequencies over and over again. Don't waste your money, I'll be returning mine to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"The Belkin TuneCast worked okay for the first couple weeks I had it. After a while I couldn't get it to turn on no matter how many new batteries I tried. Even when it did work, the sound quality was not very good. I bought the Griffin iTrip and found it had much better sound quality and was easier to use than the Belkin TuneCast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound was really bad","review":"I had a terrible time getting a station to come in even close to FM quality. There was always a bunch of static and the stereo buzzed between songs because I had to keep the volume too high. The high band of frequencies seemed to work best, but then it led to crackling speakers everytime I turned something electrical on in the car. It also seemed to kill batteries at a surprising rate.On a positive note, I loved the fact that it would also function for my son's DVD but in the end, it had way too much static so I hunted for another"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound--very short range","review":"I purchased one of these from Walmart. When the input is at higher volumes, the sound is faithfully reproduced, but the transmit signal strength is very weak. With a sensitive receiver, the range is around 4-6 ft.; for typical, consumer FM radios, expect a good range of around 24 inches.I have two other FM transmitters, an iRock Beamit and an older analog tuning model; both greatly outperform the Belkin.The unit transmits quality sound as promised, however the effective range falls far short of the 10 and 30 feet promised in the User Guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"this item creates so much static in my music.

Would be nice if it could use power from the car's 12v power supply.The only plus is you have a portable FM tranmitter that works on batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less convenient than the radio","review":"Well, I bought this for use in my car because it is a battery operated transmitter and my cigarette lighter port is blown out. I thought it would be nice to listen to the ipod in my car, and my non-battery operated model works like a charm. Not so with this one. I know the fcc regulates fm transmitters to low power, but this is ridiculous. I only got a clear signal if I actually touched the transmitter to the car antenna. I thought it might be my car, but it did the same thing with the other three cars I tried. To make matters worse, as some of the previous reviews state, the batteries run out very rapidly, making it worthwhile to invest in duracell stock if you plan on using this product for extended periods of time. Overall very poor performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"After receiving the TuneCastII to used with my iPod Nano, I noticed the batteries would go dead in the TuneCastII even when the unit wasn't being used within a two week period. I contacted Belkin and they said to return the unit to them and I paid the shipping. I received a new one from them and sure enough, this one does the same thing.It appears that the unit is still 'on' even though it appears off using up the batteries. Maybe this is due to the 'auto' on/off signal function requiring power to work. I'd rather just have a normal on/off switch to use and save on batteries. Or supply the car adapter with the unit instead of having to pay another $20 for it.Besides the battery issue, the transmitter is very weak and after trying numerious locations in the car and different frequencies I have found listening to the iPod Nano more of a pain with the TuneCastII and have gone back to just listening to the radio.Don't waste your money on this item!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This product barely transmits when it's on the dashboard, let alone if I try to set it on the passenger seat next to me. When it does work, the sound quality if pretty bad--very static-y. It's hard to find a wavelength that works--even with frequencies that sound practically clear, as soon as I try transmitting over it, I end up with all kind of interference. The signal just isn't strong enough.Also, it does eat batteries like others have said: Two batteries only last between 2-3 hours. And the little piece of junk is even poorly made: the plastic wire covering separates from the transmitter and causes the signal to short, which pretty much makes the whole effort worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one out there","review":"Comparing this FM transmitter with my Belkin TuneCast 1 and another off brand transmitter, I'd say this one is the best.

Its hard to find a consistent station (even at home where I can use the same one regularly) that doesn't pick up alot of static at some point. Like another reviewer mentioned, it works best when you can HOLD the transmitter in a certain position in relation to your radio or antenna....but its not exactly convenient!The product also seems to be cheaply made, the cord has pulled apart from the piece that plugs into the MP3, exposing the internal wires. I think its too late to return it or I certainly would!I also thought I had seen that this unit came with a charger that plugs into your cigarette lighter, but it does not; it is a DC adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"All static--no music","review":"I had high hopes for this device, but clearly should have done more research.

I took my unit on a roadtrip and just like I thought...I could not get the static out of any station that I chose to broadcast on...until. Here is the trick to the static issue. If you have a normal, non-power antenna on your vehicle...like I have on my truck...use a small wrench or pliers and GENTLY unscrew the antenna from its treaded base....just the metal antenna not the entire mounting base. Your static issue is now solved because now your car radio can not pick up anything or little of anything so now you can transmit on just about any FM channel you choose.

This is a fabulous game! Something that hasn't been mentioned enough is the incredible support provided by the games developers on their web forums. All questions, even seemingly 'dumb' ones are answered quickly and in great detail.Another great aspect of this game is the modifications that have been created for it by the community. It can be made into a completely new game - for example, there is a 'Rebels & Redcoats' mod that has been created that models the armies of the American Revolutionary War, complete with accurate uniforms and period music.

Simply amazing!","review":"This is one of the most realistic wargames I have ever played. In the game, you play as one of many real American Civil War commanders and fight on the acual battlefields of the Second Manassas campaign. The game provides a good tutorial. There are scenarios available, where you pick a commander and fight in the same way that commander fought, with the same objectives, at the actual battle. There is also an excellent Open play mode, where you select the commander, the objectives, and the size of the armies and have at it.The historical accuracy of the game is incredible. Almost everything is accounted for. The formations, the ammunition supplies, fatigue, morale, and even the types of weapons that your soldiers are equipped with have an effect on the battle.

I admit the band, that is, those in the band that play instruments deserve a 5 rating, but the singer has to be kidding. His whining and crooning, and ridiculously over dramatic lyrics degrades the overall quality of the album and the band. Everyone who has rated this a 4 or better must have the instrumental version:) I love Britpop, but this album is a major disappointment and naively overrated.oh yeah, if you have the turin brakes album, \\"the optimist lp\\",listen to # 8, \\"Slack\\", then pop in starsailor and listen to # 10, \\"good souls\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rest of the Album is nothing like Goodsouls","review":"I dont know maybe I was expecting too much but the rest of the album is nothing like Goodsouls at all. As far as guitar and drums are great but their lead singers voice is just so high pitch to me. It really gets annoying to have to listen to the guy pratically whining through the rest of the album. Well, I think someone wrote that if you like Coldplay you like these guys, well to tell you the truth I dont think you will unless you like listening to grown men whine. BEFORE you buy this album listen to the cd, or download a few of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Robert Plant singing bad \\"power ballads\\"","review":"Imagine the worst hard rock ballads of the late 70's and early 80's, written by corny has-beens like Styx or Journey---have a Robert Plant impersonator provide the vocals---and provide some largely acoustic accompaniment, and you'll essentially have this CD. Sappy sentimental broken heart lyrics filled with rhymed cliches, repeated over and over. The nostalgic familiarity and some imagined sense of the band's \\"potential\\" must be what are causing people to sing this group's praises; the music itself is not breaking new ground in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I was suckered in by all the hype in the British press. I usually avoid that pitfall, but after they were correct about the strokes I thought maybe they were turning their act around. Wrong!!! I could barely listen to any of these songs all the way through. The lyrics were laughable, the music pedestrian, and the singer's voice was plain annoying. Save your money and buy coldplay instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Prittle-Prattle","review":"Awful, the aural equivelent of snorting talc powder. Looks like the real thing but a closer examination reveals empty pretentious nonsense. Dont believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds intriguing but needs work...","review":"I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah!","review":"This is by far one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Allthe songs are so boring and awful. It made me sick just tolisten to it. The band would actually be good if they got a newsinger,(some one who's not so ugly), lose the keyboard, get better vocals, in other words they would have to change everything about them before I would ever considered listeningto them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coldplay/Travis Version 2.0","review":"The reason I bought this album was because it had good reviews, and the singer was supposed to be remniscient of Jeff Buckley. This CD creates the same bleak, yet warm and comforting atmosphere of \\"Parachutes\\" by Coldplay. There is alot of piano and acoustic guitar to be found... throw in a hint of folk and blues, with Radiohead and Travis influences, and you have Starsailor. Even just the first listen and I already like the songs and are somewhat familiar with the melodies. The guys' voice sounds more like Ours' Johnny Gnecco than Jeff Buckley, yet nowhere near both of their singing talents. There is no screaming or haunting vocal slides like there are on their records. Nonetheless if you like coldplay you should check this band out. This CD is superior to Coldplay when you look at the musicianship, talent, and vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"Think of Coldplay and Jeff Buckley and you arrive at Starsailor. The lead singers voice is great, very emotional and sometimes moving. The best songs are 'Alcoholic' and 'Poor Misguided Fool'. In fact 2 of the singles released from this album aren't very representative of this album, because they aren't very good, they are 'Fever' and 'Good Souls' , the latter was only released in the uk.In conclusion this debut is topclass (but not as good as Coldplay's Parachutes). Buy if you like more melodic, feel good indie. PS. Many songs are just Gituar and Piano combinations (very minimalistic), but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless and Boring","review":"The music and singing was good, but it's not something you want to listen to. I didn't really mind it, but I felt sort of repulsed at times because it seemed superficial. Listen for yourself, but not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is love?","review":"I first heard about Starsailor when Ian McCulloch of Echo & the Bunnymen named them as potential savio(u)rs of British rock. If that is true, I think our brothers across the Atlantic are in trouble. I find the CD ho-hum at worst, and decent at best. Creatively, it's a bit one-dimensional, despite the good musicianship of the bandmembers. I agree with some others here that the singer's voice is not for everyone, it's got a little too much treble (read: whine) and not enough bass for my taste. Good Souls is probably the best song of the lot, although it still couldn't touch the work of the likes of Richard Ashcroft (formerly of the Verve)."},{"rating":"1","title":"drama queens (and not in a good way)","review":"i'm not quite sure what those people comparing starsailor to coldplay and jeff buckley (maybe because their album is named after one of tim buckley's (jeff's father's) songs?) are thinking. well i suppose coldplay are a bunch of british guys, not unlike starsailor (the similarities end there) but jeff buckley? now come on. the vocalist in no way resembles jeff, nor does the quality of music. the lead singer's voice (always louder than the instruments) gets irritating quickly, the songs all sound very similar and they're way too melodramatic, even comical at some points. if you're looking for someone who sounds like jeff buckley, get more jeff buckley. if you're looking for more coldplay, wait till their next album comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Boring Boring BORING!! Unless you like that watered-down over-done mellow britpop a la Coldplay (which are far more emotionally satisfying), Travis (which are phenominal songwriters), or Radiohead (there is no comparison to one of the greatest bands of all time). Those are good bands, but imagine a band trying to sound like them, but without good songs and totally dull and lifeless. Then you get Starsailor.

Result..........Totally disappointing!!the songs are just repetitive and lifeless, with anger. i can stand anger, but i can't stand the fact that almost every song sound the same. and it's nothing originalso i did a analysis: here it is:MOST OF HTE SONGS HAVE THE SAME PROGRESSION STRUCTURE AND THE RECORD SOUNDS LIKE A \\"FAKE PUNK ROCK BAND\\"'S \\"CRAPPY LOVE SONGS COLLECTION\\".THE ONLY GOOD SONG----------cant remember the title, i think it has the word \\"all\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommended!","review":"As a music-loving 60's-70's survivor, I want to add my strongvote of support for this one. I don't hear it as British music per se (though it couldn't have been made anywhere else) but rather very soulful rock that wears its heart on its sleeve.James Walsh's voice will put you in mind of Jeff Buckley and Bono, but fans of more obscure '60s music will also hear Quicksilver's Dino Valente and the Beau Brummels' Sal Valentino. The fact that the histrionics wear you out toward the end shouldn't put you off---an hour after I played it the first time, I wanted to hear it again. And the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sail Straight Ahead!","review":"With James Walsh's distinctive voice and cleverly strung together melodies it is no wonder why Starsailor have been a success. They ratle rival bands like Coldplay, Travis, Doves etc and set new standards that even Oasis turn their heads, but a question that many who know British Alternative music well are \\"who are they copying?\\" Their music is a mix of the best of British Alternative put into one band and added just a little touch up of imaginative creation.Love Is Here is predominately a downtempo, melodramtic and sad album however Walsh has added a few gems that are actually very fun and uplifting as well - Good Souls.This album is one of those that should be played by yourself, it is very relaxing and full of intriguing lyrics that need your full attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool and artistic","review":"This starsailor album is the best album i heard in this year, there is no bad song in the whole album. An album foul of autor personal confesion, and life problems, there is some romantic songs, but during the whole album there is some sadnes in all songs and there is not lot of optimisam what is something new and i think that everybody must come to moment in there lifes when this album wold be there best. My favorits are lullaby, she yust wept, but there is somthing special in all songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"I'll keep it short. There's a few good songs on Love Is Here, but most of them are kinda sappy. Good Souls is a good song though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"We have Radiohead to blame for this. Without the success of OK Computer, and the relentless quest to find its successor, nobody would be taking albums like this seriously. Each song is trite and overwrought. The group desperately wants to be the next next radiohead (coldplay and travis are duking it out for the coveted next radiohead title). Its like buying a cd by a group trying to be the next Monkees."},{"rating":"1","title":"...no, sorry","review":"it's not even that they're an especially good band, but rather, they sound similar to other good bands. melodically fine, but there's no excuse for the sappy, sappy lyrics - \\"alcoholic\\" in particular is unbearable. and the only way to justify \\"the next radiohead\\" comparison is to say that radiohead were nothing like radiohead on their first album. hopefully this guy will find his own style, because at the moment it's just not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre as mediocre can be...Its bound to be a big hit...","review":"Starsailor sounds like the Frogs without the interesting lyrics. They present us a dose of subtle \\"genius\\" comparable to Radiohead (More pale skinny English boys with chips on their shoulders). But then again...mediocrity is what the public loves...just look at how many albums that Sting and Paul Simon have sold. But seriously folks, loads and loads of people will just flip their lids over this one. I'm a completely elitist music snob, and I really don't find Starsailor offensive at all (like I find Sting and Paul Simon). I just think that they're pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dung","review":"If I were a member of The Verve I would sue Starsailor. This is third rate Verve at it's best. 99% of Love is Here is boring, sleepy and forgettable. Starsailor makes a strong case for creating a music police who would be allowed to stop bands once they start to make bad music. I give it 2 stars because \\"Talk Her Down\\" is a great song. I'm puzzled how they did that. I'm sure they will sell a lot of copies of Love is Here. 9 times out of 10 bad music sells to the mainstream music dope... errr I mean listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I looked very much forward to listen to this new band. The most estimated music magazines have given Starsailor loads of stars, compared it to Oasis, and showered it with superlatives.So I go to my local CD store, find 'Love Is Here', put on the headphones and prepare myself for a musical experience beyond average.And what do I get? Embarrassingly ordinary acoustic guitar play, and a not even particularly good (kinda) male voice singing ordinary and everything but original songs.In other words, we've heard this a thousand times before. So what's the big fuss?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I can't say more than the other people who have already written here praising this CD. What got me interested in this band in the first place is the song Way to Fall. This was the song used in the ending credits of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and when I first heard it, I really liked the sound and pacing of it. Definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're \\"Good Souls\\".","review":"I must say, everytime I hear this I like it more and more. They're quickly becoming a favorite among the groups that they're often compared with, and I'm really liking the piano lately. At times they can be a little dramatic, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the album. I think \\"Good Souls\\" was the only song with airplay around here, but \\"Poor Misguided Fool\\", \\"Lullaby\\", and \\"Way To Fall\\" are all excellent as well. The whole thing is really good front to back actually. They're not as emotional as \\"Coldplay\\", or as complex as \\"Radiohead\\", but if you like the British scene, or good music in general, you should like \\"Starsailor\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Derivative and repetitive.","review":"How many times can you repeat the same words in the chorus of a tune? I loved the melody of \\"Good Souls\\" when I first saw the video. But 5 minutes of the same line drove me insane. The rest of the songs weren't enough to keep me listening. Too bad, I was optimistic... but if you want my copy, you can have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starsailor was the other dream brother","review":"Well, on the contrary, maybe this band was inspired by Jeff Buckley's father, Tim Buckley, rather than Jeff himself. Then again, I have neither heard or read any interviews of the bands influences nor do I hear the influence itself come from their music. I say this because Tim Buckley was \\"star sailor\\". Star Sailor was an album by Tim Buckley, one of his earliest. This album is mediocre at best. It has a certain aura that accompanies Jeff Buckley's Grace album. I would have to agree with an earlier comment, Jeff was amazing. I wont base the bands rating on a level with Jeff or Tim but am giving it their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Emotionally raw vocal delivery coupled with decent driving background. It's on the lighter side musically, but the vocalist makes the music sound more emotionally resonant at times. He sounds distraught, or bittersweetly happy. Solid album of songs that you might not listen to with a full sitting, but still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!!","review":"one of the greatest albums, ever made. each song has its uniq moment, the ending also is made in a very specail way. When Ive got this album Ive only heard the song Alcoholic, the other songs are even more convincing, this album is made for all the deperessed people in the world, it gives them a long enjoyfull depressing moment of pain, misery and funenjoy yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Strikes and Your Out!","review":"I listened to this album 3 times and was still not able to get it! I'm a huge Brit fan (Radiohead, Oasis, Coldplay, Travis etc..) and I was looking forward to a new sound for 2002! This ain't it mister! The lead singers voice is impressive and the members of the band are talented (good piano and guitar work) but mix it all together and it sounds odd and somewhat forced. Listening to it for the 3rd time had me bored and quite honestly depressed. I purchase about 3 new cd's a month and this is the first one I had to return in over 2 years - if that gives you any indication of how unhappy I was with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dig Suede.... your going to love this!","review":"Starsailor's debut sounds a lot like Suede.

It wasn't. As a matter of fact, it's about as far from that as you can get. The singer has one of the most annoying voices since Geddy Lee...and that's saying something. After 3 listenings (hey, I tried!) to this utterly amateurish and grating stuff, I tossed the CD out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Starsailor was great the first time I saw them...when they were called The Verve.Now though, what's gotta be some form of Verve spinoff project has replaced all of their pure rock and trippy melodies with sissified whiny love songs. This CD is awful.The lead singer's (Richard Ashcroft's evil nemisis) caterwauling becomes irritating after about 12 seconds. The songs are dull, slow and repetitive. And let's be honest, their band name is lamer-than-lame. Isn't Starsailor the name of a Japanese morning cartoon or something? It sure sounds like it.And what's happened to the once powerful Brit-rock scene lately?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no love for this CD","review":"This CD is cheap for a reason!

Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad lyrics and stale melodies","review":"I heard a great deal of hype about Startsailor from critics both here in the States and the U.K. The first single, \\"Good Souls\\", was pretty darn catchy and ... I thought the album was a good buy.Then I put it into my discman. Maybe this album is not meant to listen to while commuting cuz it was bad. Everything here has been done before and done better. The melodies and vocals remind one of The Verve and Radiohead. But the lyrics just ruin it - \\"Your dad is an alcoholic, blah blah blah.\\"Over the weekend, I put it on while on a road trip to Montreal and got drilled by my friends. I couldn't even defend the choice - listening to it was making me sad and ill. And not in a Morissey kind of way.Save the dough and buy some classic brit pop. Stay away from the Coldplay/Starsailor garbage coming out. It won't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Verve?","review":"The above words caught my attention in a review of their \\"fever\\" single in Q magazine (back in January 2001) so I waited, and waited, and waited.....and eventually bought this on importwith high hopes. Their general melancholy vaguely resembles Travis, Coldplay, and even Jeff Buckely but they have a folkier sound that's hammered home by this non-stop, saloon-sounding, jugband piano. It resembles a Carole King album more than any modern british \\"guitar\\" band and that's the missing element here. If James decides to plug an electric guitar in next time(plug that piano in while you're at it) then I might get interested. Meanwhile if you decide you still want this album, keep your eyes peeled on that \\"get it for less\\" section here at Amazon because you might see my copy there soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time-wonderful Masterpiece","review":"When I first bought this album I loathed it and found it boring and too melancholy.A couple of weeks later I started to listen to it again and gradually I began to love it. It is definitly one of the best albums to come out of the UK over the last decade. It has a unique beauty inspired not least by James Walsh's amazing, moving voice. The standard of songwriting is truly exceptional nothing compared to the Verve or other Britsh bands that they are falsely compared to. I see the people who have given this album bad reviews have judged this album on just one listen. You need to give this album time to grow on you. These arent songs that you can walk around and subconciuosly sing or whistle to yourself, you need to listen to this album carefully to appreciate its beauty and moodiness. My favorite songs are 'lullaby', 'Way to fall', 'Fever'.By the time this fantastic record closes with the hushed 'Coming Down' you will feel as if you're floating in Space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"A great album, which reminds me of the moody English bands of the early and mid 1990s.

This man is THE man at the moment with one of the best voices in popular music. This album proves it.

I mean, c'mon, how can you argue when Pink and 50 cent top the charts and Weller gets practically no mention or airplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unappreciated in the US","review":"Days of speed is a live accoustic album which is not my favorite format normally. However there is a kind of grainy black and white photograph feel to this album that makes it work. The selection of tracks goes through from the Jam and the Style Council to the modern day, a set of appetizers from an illustrious career. For some reason despite being up there in standing with Costello, Clapton and Lennon in the UK he has never been popular in the US. For me that is the US's loss, this is a great album from a great artist, give yourself a treat and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehire the band","review":"Sorry folks, I love Weller as much as the next man, but the Amazon reviewer has got it right. Weller is a good lyricist, not a great one, a good acoustic guitar player, not a great one. Solo acoustic is an unforgiving way to put your wares on display. These songs need the trimming. One of the greatest things about Weller anyway is his pop sensibility. Take away the arrangements and you've taken most of it away. What's \\"Above the Clouds\\" without the Marvin Gaye soul groove, \\"Out of the Sinking\\" without the electric assault, \\"Headstart for Happiness\\" without the horn chart? Not nearly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less is More!","review":"I listen to tons of music from a lot of different genres, but this cd stands out as one of the best! In this era where so many acts rely on an entourage of dancers, costume changes, lighting/special effects, drum machines, attitude, sampling, overdubs, videos, stylists, etc., this cd says let's forget all about that and see how much of an artistic statement one guy can make onstage with a guitar, his voice and songs that he wrote himself. Paul Weller succeeds here with a brilliant blend of new & old material and demonstrates what it means to live up to the challenge of being \\"unplugged.\\" I suspect that the number of performers capable of pulling this off is much less than some people might think. Paul Weller- if you're reading this, try this approach again! A live acoustic set of new material along with some classics of your own or other people's would be wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time fan disappointed in short order.","review":"I saw him as far back as '80 with the Jam and again solo in '90. I'm afraid this is no landmark album. A true test of a live album is whether it stands up as an introduction to an artist rather than providing fans with striped down versions of songs they already love. The thing that strikes me is how unremarkable the performances are. They feel run of the mill. No 'magic'. I wouldn't be surprised that if Paul played incognito in a pub, most people would just talk over him - so ordinary are his renditions. Average busker quality strumming, and a voice that while brilliant on album is very par here, this album amounts to an obvious purchase for a completist fan but it's rather forgettable if you don't know him. While he may [be great]as a rock guitarist he completely lacks acoustic fidelity on this solo effort. Sorry Paul but despite being a huge fan, I'd have to say this is not worth the [money]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respect Due","review":"Finally purchasing \\"Days of Speed\\", instead of relying on a song here song there on the radio, fully confirmed my initial impressions of a great musical adventure.

This is unfortunate because they had ample material to write an excellent story. Sadly, the film spirals into a highly cliched and very predictable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Pasttime","review":"This video is one that would have a great appeal to a high school audience as it features a love story between two teens from opposite sides of the relocation camp walls that harsely interned Japanese Americans during World War II. It also dramatizes how the sport of baseball was a \\"saving grace\\" for Japanese internees and others who viewed them as \\"enemies of the state\\" to be isolated, scorned and feared. Although its conclusion is very predictable, it offers some important lessons for teens and adults that promote intercultural understanding and healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer on Loose in NY Hospital","review":"I chose First Cut because it was a Literary Guild Selection. It turned out to be a disappointing choice for me. The author is obviously knowledgable about hospitals and medical terminology, but it was overdone and overwritten. The pace was frantic and I doubt any human could realistically continue to function as our protagonist, Ev, did in thise book. She is a resident who is a combination flawless physician, marvelous teacher, excellent detective, and sexually appealing to all men in this book. That is just too much woman for me. I began skimming about l/3 way through this tome and was relieved to finish. The lengthly explanation by our heroine of how, why and by whom the crimes were committed was just more (pun intended) overkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written.

It is the lousy choice of most of the songs and hokey arrangements that sink this CD. I am sure that Don and Phil lament the circumstances that resulted in these recordings.

Since receiving it, I've spent quite a bit of time considering whether or not to keep it, on the basis of it being better than nothing, and I've finally decided that it is not. \\"Plays\\" is a grossly overstated misrepresentation of the contents. They are not plays at all -- no attempt is made towards dialogue, characters or action. It is simply the words of the text divided up among a couple of readers. In terms of making the gospels interesting and accessible to young readers, one would be much better off getting a simple book like \\"The Family Story Bible\\" and letting the children make up the plays themselves.

The drawings are boring, lifeless, empty, and simple. Much to the dismay of a huge Berenstain Bears fan, I have to advise that you NOT choose these books. There are too many other GOOD Berenstain Bears books to waste your time or money on these titles. There are a number of other board books and pre-school books by the Berenstains if you like the bears --- check out the board book versions of Inside Outside Upside Down or Old Hat New Hat. You might also look at titles like Yike Yike Where's My Trike or The BB In Big Bear City.

I think the writer got some brain damage after that, 'cause what we have seen is a totally different Follett after that. Like J. Archer, both should be retired from writing and shouldn't bother their old fans furthermore to ruin the good memories.

However, after reading John Case's FIRST novel, \\"The Genesis Code,\\" I would suggest that Mr. Follett go back to the drawing board and come up with a more interesting plot and more specific details on what is quickly becoming every author's favorite plot-line: genetic engineering.After \\"Code,\\" this book falls way short of capturing the reader's interest or giving the reader much in the way of heros/heroines to actually root for.

The characters came off as flat, boring and (worst of all) stupid. Liberal bias and author commentary run rampant throughout this book and the bad guys (white males) are evil without reason.

My most damning criticism of this novel is that it is NOT smart. Full of factual errors, gaping plot holes and an abundance of handy coincidences to carry along the action, it does appear to be a plot for a made-for-TV movie. My favorite howler in this book is the black WWII veteran neighbor (really knows how to throw in those cliches, doesn't he?)stating that he stole a pistol from a German soldier because black soldiers were not allowed to carry weapons (huh?).

The author peppers the text with his personal bias on everything from gun-control to teenage kids having sex.The cardboard characters are cut-and-pasted straight from a re-run of \\"Knight Rider\\". I'll sum it up.Bad guy: An evil republican, genetic researcher, corporate official, Cold War relic, and tenured professor who wants to be President.Good Guy: Liberal female associate professor from a poor upbringing who wears a nose ring and stumbles onto Bad-Guy's horrible secret while \\"just doing her job.\\"Plot: Bad Guy tries to kill Good Guy and fails.

Don't waste your money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of Ken Follett's work, but in this novel, his superb narrative skills seem to have eluded him. The characters--primary and secondary- are basically one-dimensional (and that one dimension is repeated and replayed often). We have a host of supposedly intelligent, if not brilliant people, who seem to learn nothing from their experiences. The story is a good one, but I have come to expect much more from the author of \\"A Dangerous Fortune,\\" \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" and so many great novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett's weakest effort","review":"I discovered Follett late in the game and have been working my way through his books for that past few months. Here is what I have learned: Follett historical novels are consistently engrossing and entertaining. Follett's present-day thrillers/technothrillers? Not so much. Whiteout, Hammer of Eden, and especially The Third Twin are chock full of wooden characters, implausible plot twists, cornball dialogue, and clumsily inserted political jabs (leftist.)

A Place Called Freedom was a boring romance (disguised as historical) novel and now this. Follett is a master at making us understand his characters thought processes and he draws them out with such precision.

Nothing this bad can come naturally.The characters are as shallow as an EPA-designated wetland. The dialogue is contrived, and the suspense is nonexistent. While the book is purportedly a novel, it is also a political polemic; all the \\"good\\" characters subscribe to the leftest of left-wing extremities, and all the \\"bad\\" ones are right-wing ideologues (at least in intention.)I have a personal rule of not quitting a book once I've started it, and The Third Twin tested my resolve to the utmost"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get back to writing good novels, Follett!","review":"The premise of this book about cloning held such promise.

Alas, Follett does not seem to do all that could have been done with the scenario he created. Much of the dialogue seems mechanical, and it's interesting that Follett frequently uses the odd construction: \\"Jeannie said: '....'\\" to have dialogue, which adds to the detached feel of the character interaction. While Follett's premise of a misuse of genetic engineering is interesting, he cops out on the answer to the \\"nature vs. nurture\\" argument that the lead charracter is trying to answer.

The research was poor, the logic didn't exist, and there were so many flaws and gratuitous twists and coincidences, it was insulting. I have trouble believing Follett even wrote this mess. The dialogue was almost comic and the heroine was an idiot to contiunally fall prey to the \\"bad twin.\\" I've read the other reviews and I think it has already been said so I will quit with suggesting that the author take his royalties and find another profession if he can't do better than this.

I rented the audio version of this book and was BIG TIME disappointed. Did Ken Follett really write this thing? It was predictable, corny, contained shallow characters, shallow character interactions, and was just a bad read (or listen). I rarely do not finish a novel but I got just plain tired of this. I endured about 85% of the audio but just figured, with as predictable as everything was, I could probably guess out how it ended. Don't judge Ken Follett by this book (or, better yet, don't read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and page-turning story","review":"Reading Ken Follet is always a pleasure, and The Third Twin is no exception. It is fast-paced, well researched and innovative, making a far-fetched story seem very credible. As all his novels, this includes a bright female hero and a romance with the lead male character, in this case one of several VERY similar young men. So similar, in fact, that she is mistaken, and her confusion leads her to explore a mystery so secret, so controversial that only Ken Follet could have dreamed it up.

When \\"Third Twin\\" came out, I decided to check it out. I couldn't believe it was written by the same author! \\"Twin\\" was so much faster, more enjoyable, and less bogged down than \\"Pillars\\". While I will admit that the characters and the plot were not quite as fully developed, I believe that adds to the charm of the book. I don't know about the rest of you, but after a long day at school and work, the last thing I want to do is read twenty pages about the ongoing angst between a priest and a monk.

It may take days of constant agonizing and wailing before you realise that you have wasted a significant amount of your life analysing a piece of tripe. THIS IS WHAT THE THIRD TWIN IS; a novel so monumentally bad, so ridiculous, so trite, so badly written, and worst of all, so unentertaining, that the mere idea that you sat through it to the bitter end makes you truly upset.

And why the heck shouldn't he play around with a buzz issue like cloning? I thought The Third Twin was a lot of fun and enjoyed the characters and plot. Lighten up folks! The English language is so robust it challenges writers over a lifetime to come up with new and different ways of saying things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have been written for TV","review":"Have enjoyed some of Ken Follet's other work, i.e. Eye of the Needle, but this novel felt as though it had been intentionally written as a TV soap. It was thick and syrupy! It follows \\"A Dangerous Fortune\\" in it's story telling style. Ken - cut down on the F word, and use the skills you were given...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the novel that ends my reading of Follett.","review":"I loved his early and middle books, but I've been growing increasingly disenchanted. I picked this one up with misgivings which turned out well justified. The only reason I finished it was that I was away for the weekend with only this book, and I felt soiled afterwards. Ugly, manipulative, predictable, Follet is now off my list of authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another made-for-TV novel....","review":"YAWN...isn't this cloning idea gone a bit too long I mean, why can't Follett think of something original? The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is cliched...the whole book writes like a movie script...a bad movie script. The heroine Jeanne Ferrami is your typical female-scientist-with-looks-and-an-attitude and her lover boy is as wooden as they come,good-hearted but wooden. Anyway, I give this book a 4 since it's readable, ,the plot is not too stupid and it has a reasonable amount of suspense to keep me turning those pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a nutshell, it's a page turner.","review":"This Ken Follet novel is a book of mind-numbing deception and love. A research scientist, Dr. jean Ferrami, lands a new job at Jones Falls University researching the genetic aspects of criminal behavior. She has created a computer program which uses a restricted FBI database to find her subjects,who are twins that were raised apart, one with a criminal record and the other, a straight-laced citizen. There are two things she doesn't expect; 1) she uncovers a government conspiracy involving a top biotech company, right-wing politicians, and her own university, and 2) she falls in love with an identical twin whose brother is a convicted rapist. In fact, he was the one who raped her best friend. I recomend this book to the people who like romance novels but hate all of the lovey-dovey nature of them. This book has a lot of adventure and mystery and it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A PITY IT WAS A FOLLET'S BOOK","review":"The reviews tell it all. It is very strange that after \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" Follet writes such a weak book. Characters, plot, everything so simplistic. We have the impression that it was writen with the sole purpose of selling it to the movies. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but plot peters out by mid book.","review":"The concept of this novel is an interesting one, and involves cloning of embryos and misuse of IV fertilization. The plot is intriguing and captivating in the first half of the book, but Follett loses steam (and probably interest) there onwards. Not one of his better novels, but it may do well as a made-for-TV movie. I should have waited for it to come out in paperback, and read it on a plane"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharkey","review":"Can't believe this was required reading in a German high school English class.

There is a sophisticated twist of murder in the plot. I read a condensed form of the book, and it was great. The plot needed a little bit more suspense, but overall, it was indeed a facinating story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book has Average Written all over it","review":"I did not enjoy this one as much as I did main of his other books. I guess I did not think it grabbed me at the start like many of his works. He always produces a decent book, and for someone who wants a book that is somewhat interesting, easy and simple, this will fit the bill. If you are looking for something more he just did not get to that next level. The story is an inventive one and he just about pulls it off. I don't know why I didn't think this a real gripping boo, maybe it was just that all the work that went into it, the character development, plot, etc was just a little average and blah. I would read this one over a Grisham or Turow, but there are also much better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIZZLED!!!","review":"Ken Follett allowed his hatred of conservatism to show through. This could have been a very interesting and insightful story, but he allowed this story to become very uninteresting and boring. I will not waste my time in the future on a Ken Follett book.

What a disappointment! He must have phoned this one in--or maybe someone else wrote this book. It would make a great beach read if you can stand the improbable female characters, wooden dialogue, stupid mistakes by smart people. The premise is given away by the title so there is little intrigue. And the characters remain inconsistent throughout. Also, the academic atmosphere is bogus and stereotypical. And to add insult to injury, the salary quoted for the protagonist, given her degrees and reputation, is way out of line--no decent university would be able to attract her for a mere $30,000. I had to check the publication date on this book when I read that!An OK read if you aren't too particular. It moved quickly, thank God, and I am on to other titles in my extensive To Be Read pile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Really.Unfortunately, I couldn't bring myself to care about the one-dimensional characters.

Gilgamesh goes on an extensive journey, obsessed with the death of Enkidu and the idea of eternal life, only to fall asleep at Utnapishtim's home and be turned away. When he finds the secret, he carelessly loses it. All the time he is overcome with an unrealistic grief over Enkidu's death. Peculiar comparisons, and something that is just too close to the Judeo-Christian tale of Noah's ark.

It is over 2000 years old and before bible literature containing original concepts that are portrayed in the \\"Bible\\" in an altered state.

Disc two, with the forgotten GOLDFINGER tracks, radio spots, and the super-rare YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE demo is the gem. The THUNDERBALL Suite never gets old and recalls all the luster and grit of Connery's \\"Biggest Bond of All!!\\" Though some tracks shifted to the first disc to save space and the addition of some of Barry's later Bond scores and Bill Conti's work for FOR YOUR EYES ONLY would be appreciated, this is indispensible for any soundtrack fan, especially a Bond one."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the 007 Classics on One Album!","review":"The review title says it all! This is a great collection of music from the James Bond movie \\"golden age\\" 1960's-1980's. Each track is an original from a Bond film so the mastering varies track to track with newer ones having better fidelity than older. That being said all recordings are high-quality for the time periods in which they were recorded. Another interesting point is that this album contains both the Monty Norman and John Barry versions of the James Bond theme, if you're a 007 fan-boy then you already know why this is significant, if not then internet-search it."},{"rating":"2","title":"where is 007?","review":"I have the cassette version of this album and it has the great 007 Theme from \\"From Russia With Love\\" and used in several movies thereafter, especially \\"You Only Live Twice\\".

(So nothing from any of the Pierce Brosnan films.) What's great about this collection is its completeness. They find space to include a couple of the fine John Barry instrumentals: the wonderful theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and a characteristic theme from From Russia With Love which you'll recognize the second you hear it. (Frankly I might buy this disk for the On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme alone.) There's also a Dionne Warwick song from Thunderball, which previously had not appeared on CD.What's weird about this collection is that the tracks are not in chronological order. Jarring. For my own use I take these tracks and re-burn them onto a CD in chrono order. I don't understand what the producers were thinking when they set the track order of this collection.But it's a good to have these tracks.

Sure, the book is plagued with faulty reasoning, but God, the premise is just funny. Sinks falling from the sky!I think it's funny, but pretty much the ramblings of a guy who wants everything to be the result of UFO's, or extradimensional beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing and utterly unbelievable","review":"I bought this book out of sheer curiosity, and when I finished it I was wondering who could possibly take it seriously. If there is any reality to the UFO phenomenon, or to any other paranormal phenomena, then Keel's book will not lend credence to them. Better books to read are those by Whitley Strieber and Timothy Good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misdirection","review":"A look at John Keel's body of work shows a thoughtful man and a writer of speculation. Disneyland of the Gods is just his take on the old Fortean idea that mankind is property, or, at best, simply interacting with other realities that poke through into our space - time. This is just better speculation but is not based on much. We don't have to rethink anything. There are too many good reports with multiple witnesses and radar to conclude all the data simply needs a new frame of reference.Although somewhat entertaining, this lightweight book does little to bring the conversation about strange phenomena forward. If anything, it distracts and misdirects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to read, but not to be taken seriously.","review":"Mr Keel tells many interesting stories in this book, but he does not cite any references or sources for his alleged findings. No newspaper articles, no journals, no books, no scholarly studies - nothing.

Thorne Weston is just as determined to stop her.The rivalry turns to attraction as the two are forced to work together and become reluctant partners. But somebody is trying to kill Adriana and Thorne has many secrets of his own.Ports of Call was a interesting book and quick read but with not much substance. I found myself wishing the end would come and found the romance between Adriana and Thorne to be second rate and uneventful. I recommend the reader pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started off very well. I enjoyed the rivalry between the two protagonists and looked forward to seeing Thorne's defences crumble as he falls under the spell of Adriana.Unfortunately, I was not to be rewarded in that respect. As the book progresses, there are moments where you begin to wonder whether or not Adriana and Thorne are meant to be together, which makes the rather rushed finale even harder to believe. I am usually willing to suspend belief to some extent when reading a romance, but there has to be an element of believability for me to immerse myself in the story. The final scenes aboard the yacht were laughable and the writing dwindled to amateurish standards. I was denied a satisfying ending, which is a requirement in any good romance.Won't be reading other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This book is silly AND dull - avoid it if you want a good and entertaining story.

Its not completely instrumental, but Eric J. does great vocals too. He also leaves enough room at the end of the vocal tracks to make up a whole instrumental song. After learning and listening to Satriani, EJ came next. Suddenly non-lyrical rock guitar was better than anything that came before it. This cd has some awesome non-vocal tracks. This is definately his best cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut Up and Play!","review":"Eric Johnson is as talented a guitar player as God ever put on this earth. His chords and notes are so clean, it defies belief. You wonder out loud how someone could master an instrument as well as he does. Growing up in Austin, I have had the chance to see him numerous times, and my opinion of him has not changed in 20 years, he can't sing! I am sorry, but Eric has always had this desire to be a pop star. So many people in Austin just cringe at concerts when he stops rocking, so that he can sing one of his sappy lyrics. It is a waste. Now don't jump on me! I love the guy! But I wish he would stick to playing guitar and quit the singing. The guy just has so much talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but certainly not elite","review":"I bought this album after continually hearing how great a guitarist Eric Johnson is. While the album (and Tones which I bought also) does contain flashes of brillance and some very intricate soloing, too much of it is mundae, or produced to appeal to top-40 airplay.I consider Eric Johnson a very good player, with moments of greatness, but he is certainly no Scott Henderson or Steve Morse. Perhaps that best way to phrase it is, Johnson is a great rock player, one of the top 2-3 out there. But as an overall player he pales compared to someone like Henderson who has mastery over all types of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is like a journey.","review":"I love Eric Johnson's guitar playing (he's got that 'impossible' tone). Eric also has a great voice. I noticed some people commented that they wish he wouldn't sing, but I think he does a wonderful job of it.This is my favorite out of all the EJ recordings I own. Some would probably argue that the album seems over-produced compared to things he done in the past, but I don't care. \\"Venus Isle\\" is beautifully recorded--it's a pleasure to listen to. It progresses very nicely--the songs sound like they were meant to go in the order they're in. They all meld together to form one long song. Very soothing...especially tracks like \\"Song for Lynette\\" and \\"When the Sun Meets the Sky.\\"In reading other reviews, I found out that the person this album is tributed to was Johnson's girlfriend, who was unfortunately killed in a burglary. The general mood of this album makes more sense now knowing that.I highly recommend you check out this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"EJ is the man","review":"I think most of us that bought and listened to Ah Via Musicom were initially disappointed with Venus Isle, but there's something about Venus Isle that keeps listeners coming back. If you liked the track \\"East Wes\\" off of Musicom, then this album will be great for you, especially tracks like \\"Manhatten\\". \\"Camel's Night Out\\" sounds a lot like \\"Desert Rose\\" and \\"High Landrons\\" from Musicom, and \\"Song for Lynette\\" is a piano/guitar piece that sounds like something Vince Gueraldi might have written. Johnson's fretwork isn't as 'clean' as it was in Musicom, hiding his fingerboard skills behind walls of effects and reverbs, but the sound is still better than most other virtuosos can do. Guitar enthusiasts were somewhat disappointed that this album took about 8 years to make, but personally I feel it was worth the wait. For those with an ear that isn't so acute, Johnson's singing has improved immensely with time. Pick this album up ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"melodic heaven","review":"As a musician i was inspired by this album, eric johnson did a great job throughout the whole thing.

If you are a lover of historical fiction (and not of the Phillipa Gregory sort), I recomment it highly. It is the story of early Christian times, post Roman Empire and is written elegantly.

This novel has remained in print since 1964, in several languages. Author, Helle Haasse, sheds light on events in history, in novel form.

The rail is too long to allow a child to safely exit a toddler bed that has rails on three sides.

However, the rail does not fold down flat against the side of the bed when in the \\"down\\" position. When folded down, the rail sticks out at least eight inches from the bottom of the bed. This creates a tripping hazard and makes any bedding stick way out from the side of the bed. I want a rail that folds flat during the day so that I can easily pull up my son's duvet and quilt to make the bed and then pop up the rail at night when he goes to sleep. If you plan to leave the rail in the up position at all times and don't care about being able to make the bed each day, then this product would probably be fine for you, especially if you have a platform bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome - stays in place and does the job!!!","review":"These are the best bed rails out there. We have used them for three years, secured between a queen mattress and boxspring. It stays in place and never moves. It is not too difficult to put in place and there is no room for a child to fall between the mattress and rail, if installed correctly. When in place, it folds down more than 90 degrees to make it easy to change the sheets.

My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a \\"bunkie\\" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it.

I have had two other bedrails for several years (the Munchkin Safety Deluxe Bed Rail and Summer Infant Sure and Secure Single Bedrail) -took a look at both of them and the joins are metal, not plastic.As well, the Dex does not have straps that securely grasp the far side of the bed, next to the wall. Both the Munchkin & Summer Infant do, and are much more secure fits. I use them both on platform beds, so am disappointed that the Dex does not work properly. I am also disappointed in Dex customer service, who told me on the phone that they received my warranty request and photos of the broken bedrail via email and would be back to me; one week later, no response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic & Sturdy","review":"This bed rail is fantastic!

Ordinary people could not assemble the parts for the discrepancy. I had proper grinding tool to remove the extra flesh and could assemble parts.2. The markings on the parts were incorrect and caused confusion.3. When I unpacked the package, I found two pieces of one item instead of paired parts. The sender replaced the missing part within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usable as advertised","review":"This really can't be installed on a larger bed that has a box spring; there's simply not enough tension in the support strap to hold the rail firmly against the mattress. As a result, a child could easily roll against the rail and get caught between the rail and the mattress. And the rail is so low against a standard-height mattress that a larger child could easily roll right over it and out of the bed.Some reviews above mention using it with an infant and this is highly irresponsible. Based on those recommendations, my wife bought it -- but the instructions warn against using it for any child younger than 2 years and any child who cannot get in or out of bed on his or her own.THis is NOT a workable substitute for a co-sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This rail does not go 180 degrees down!!","review":"This rail does not go flush with the bed with you lower it!

As this rail folds down at a higher point than regular rails, I thought it might work. And that is the only good feature in this rail.First of all, it only works if you have solid bottom not slats. The width of the rail made it so the legs did not align with the slats.Second, the thickness of the plastic hinges made it very hard to fit the mattress back into place. The mattress stabilizer bar is square which is a bruising hazard. I did not really care if the side did not fold down all the way, but the thickness/bulkiness of the plastic on the hinged legs and the mattress stabilizer bar prevents the rail to stay horizontal against the mattress.Third, all of these unfortunate features are going to make it hell to change the sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!","review":"Perfect fit for a daybed!

Secondly, as a former missionary, I was greatly dissapointed by the western bias that was at times evident. Certain items are deemed unacceptable in the book because of their regard, or disregard, in our culture yet they are in reality used effectively among other cultures and this is not considered in this book and neither is a scriptural support given to explain Ron's difficulty with these matters.

The other characters were flat and uninteresting. Once you tire of the protagonist bemoaning his fate (and you will tire of it) there is little to make you keep reading, except hope for an interesting resolution. Well, forget it, there isn't one. The ending does not follow logically from the rest of the story and provides no resolution.The story fails as science fiction and mostly fails as horror fiction. Pared down, it would have made a good script for a comic book. It also probably would work as a juvenile book club selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"small","review":"a guy begins to shrink (wll, there is a story behind it, but that's what he does). and......he continues to do so. in the end he must face a spider which think he's yummy. one little fight for one little man. the book is just as good as it sounds. things that happen in this book has at tendency to be dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction Misunderstood","review":"People have often not noticed the significance of the time this was written. This is science fiction, but more importantly it is a social commentary. The shrinking of the protagonist literally is allegorical for the shrinking of the man in the emerging post-War World II corporate climate where men were treated as statistics by their inaccessible superiors rather than as valued producers in the company. The role of man was changing cause a generation of men to feel less than the culture's definition of \\"a man.\\" Hence, the shrinking.Understanding this brings a new dimension to Matheson's work. (Matheson, by the way, was a WWII vet experiencing a similar role crisis working for McDonnell Douglas in a job where he felt he actually did nothing, having no contact with the finished product. He was one of the aerospace industry's thousands of new white-collared workers.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Matheson's best stuff","review":"This book contains Matheson's great sci-fi/adventure novel, along with many of his best short stories including \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\", \\"Duel\\", \\"Button, Button\\", and one of my favorite stories \\"The Distributor\\".The plots are a bit dated, and Matheson's lean prose can be a bit thin at times, but these stories are pure pulp magic, infused with imaginative scenarios that can still grip any reader.The title novel may not be as good as Hell House, and it certainly isn't I Am Legend, but it's not a bad way to spend a plane ride. Plus, the cover art is really cool. People will invariably ask you what you're reading, and then you can turn them on to this underrated pulp master."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Science Fiction Classic","review":"For those newly interested in Richard Matheson because of the new I am Legend movie, you will not be dissapointed with this book.

Sometimes it jumped back in time, instead of staying with the spider story as I wanted it to, but it was all very well done. The emotions of the title character were well done, although I didn't agree with him at times, or with the things he did, it was just my perspective on it. The ending was a little neat to me. It ended a little different than I would have originally guessed. I enjoyed this book. It is very well done. It is ageless in the fact, that it was written 50 yrs ago, but could easily be placed in todays world. The characters and they way they react are timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"I ordered 6 12AX7s for my Boogie combo and they were shipped quickly and securely. I also saved a nice bit of money through Amazon/Part-Express. Tone-wise, they're new JJ tubes, I'm not going to get into their sound, if you're looking for durable, toneful tubes, you can't go wrong.One thing to note is that the glass nubbin on the top of tube is slightly longer than most Sovtek/Tung-Sol 12AX7s, so if you have a clamping tube system that comes into direct contact with the tip of the tube, it may be a bit more snug than you're comfortable with, but that shouldn't be an issue for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"After my Stovteks started sounding flat, I replaced the preamp tubes with JJ's.

I do agree that the book did read like a novel and it did sound like Bob, who at times was a likeable person to be around, however that doesn't offset the many \\"un\\" and \\"half\\" truths potrayed in this book.I was very surprised to find out just how bad off we were, so I do agree with the person that said Bob did a good job of keeping that information from the troops. But to what avail? Bob did sell the employees down the river. If you didn't get layed off, you were very poorly treated by B of A employees and management, and it's unbelievable that Bob didn't forsee that.I believe that, with all of the innovation exhibited by Security Pacific employees in the past, in both financial and technical aspects, had Bob been a forthright and competent leader, Security Pacific would not have failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera to Drop in Your Pocket","review":"I got this camera to replace an Olympus C4000 that was too slow focusing and bulky for my needs (shooting my toddler). I have had it for about 9 months now and still think its great. One reason I bought it was the price (under $200) and the reviews I saw on the web (like dpreview.com). It is small enough to go in your pocket. It can be used in the rain without fear of damage. The fireworks shots I took , a couple can be seen in the user images for this camera, where unexpectedly good and done HANDHELD without a tripod using the fireworks program! There are a couple of cons, but minor and are to be expected for a camera of this type, ie. weak indoor flash (fix with software), sometimes takes long in low light to focus, no lens protection.

The vet said their teeth looked fantastic and she was sure I brushed their teeth every day since I'm a groomer. When I told her I use this, she couldn't believe it!

More of a crime/drama story, this book contains all the necessary ingredients for a delicious literary treat. The storyline grabs your interest from the very beginning and builds up to a satisfying end. Don't look for your usual baby-momma-drama or thug life story here, this author went outside the box on this one. Spanning sites from Cuba, New York and Florida readers are given a taste of the drug cartel through the life of cousins Eto and Cache.There are many stories detailing the cartel, but Kaven's originality separates him from the competition.

(I didn't buy it here.) It's SLICK. Yes I use an Altoids tin as a case. Yes it always gets comments from every single person I show it too. Yes it's slick. Picture quality is O K. I find the autofocus a little finicky, but there are so many options to choose from when taking photos that I'm sure with a little practice I'll get every picture looking perfect. I find the battery to run a little on the weak side, hopefully their next version will be more robust.But so far, so good. I'd recommend it. It's just too cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure Camera","review":"I love this camera. I have taken it everywhere.

I loved this little gem, but it died the second day we had it. It appears to be a fine piece of equipment, but I had to send it back. I'm going to buy the Canon S400 instead. The Canon is a tiny bit larger and hopefully will last longer than two days.While examining the menu options a grinding sound came from the speaker and my wife turned the camera off. Then it would no longer respond to the on/off switch. I called Pentax and it was indeed a dead puppy. There was no software reset or anything of that nature. I opted for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow View to a Large Kingdom","review":"I wouldn't recommend this for every believer. Though the author defines the kingdom of God using scriptural reference, the underlying messages is that that kingdom of God is based on the model he has established for his own church institution. It left me questioning whether the kingdom he was referring to was God's or his. I'm more apt to believe the latter because he employs in his writing administrative procedures which do not apply to every believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't know Sacramento until you see this book!","review":"This is California's capital as it really is.

The original of this was one of my favorites. It was sad to read that the version I found so exciting, with the sounds of the audience, was faked in a studio. I used to get goose bumps when Peggy would say, \\" Shall we swing a little?\\" and the audience of DJ's exploded into rapturous applause. It may have been fake but it made exciting entertainment and isn't that what it's all about?There is something lost in this version, a little flatness that wasn't present in the one I grew up with. Never the less, it's one of the all time great performances and if I had never heard the original I would be more than satisfiedLinda Carmichael"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review...enjoyed both artists.

It was an early intro to jazz and I was a fan of big band music also. I recently have started to collect \\"older\\" albums that I had as LPs and was glad to see this one available. My other 1st album was Errol Garner \\"Concert By The Sea\\" that still is so soothing in traffic now that I have the CD.I can highly recommend this album as well as Errol Garner. Ms Lee was in her prime and a joy to hear. Mr Shearing was one of the finest jazz pianists and pairs up with Ms Lee beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEE and SHEARING Sparkle","review":"This live album is terrific. While I love \\"Basin Street East\\" this is JUST as essential! The Shearing piano, along with Peggy's vocals, add an intimate atmosphere to the songs, that are lacking in the studio versions. \\"I Left My Sugar In Salt Lake City\\" is really a find, along with \\"You've Come A Long Way From St. Louis.\\" This album was recorded at a Disc Jockey convention, and no matter what the cover, or voice overs, what remains is the MUSIC, and that cannot be topped! The instrumental selections by Shearing are great, and only add to a very pleasant listening experience. Acoustically great, along with the remaster. This is a Peggy Lee album to put on while the fire is burning low, and you are with the one you love.

AFOS was a highly influential band, albeit a short-lived one, and this disc has many of their best. This import version also contains \\"Windows\\", an excellent little tune that was only released in the US as the B side of \\"Space Age Love Song\\" and is thus very hard to find. I particularly like \\"Nightmares\\", \\"Transfer Affection\\", the instrumental \\"DNA\\", and \\"It's Not Me Talking\\". Unfortunately, there are also some of AFOS's later songs on here, when they were trying to sound more like New Order than New Order did.

Plus \\"Telecommunication\\" is way post punk, and \\"It's not me talking\\" would make happy any Cure's fan; if you like synths,drum machines as well as guitars and you're looking for romantic melodies & lyrics DON'T MISS THIS CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Greatest Hits Package","review":"This is one of three different greatest hits packages I have of A Flock Of Seagulls. Each package has some songs not on the other packages.

I have never regreted one of the pennies spent on this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"The book IS frightening as some reviewers have stated. Many of the acts described in it are feasible but it's hard to imagine a 20 year plan being put into place so effortlessly. All of the terrorist plans work to perfection. There are no moles, no one ever has a change of heart, all of these explosives and weapons are brought into the country, anthrax is created and through all this no one talks to the govt. The reality is that many terrorist plots have been foiled over the last 10 years when someone came forward to report suspicious behavior. The book is exciting enough, but it is marred by the author's constant preaching of his far right wing views. (And no, I am not a liberal) Just OK, wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"Written from a biased point of view, disjointed story line with side bars of \\"facts\\" on several crisis over the years.

However, it clearly looks at the historical and social reasons for how the museum came to be, particularly in its nineteenth century origins. It also relates museums to other social institutions: fairs and cabinets of curiosities as precursors, the 19th c. developments in prisons and the advent of expositions as contemporaneous to the birth of the museum, and amusement parks as a mix of the fair and the museum. Definitely located in the field of cultural studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printed in poorest quality after a digital scan of the original book - not worth the money","review":"This is not a printed book, but just a cheap reprint, apparently made after a digital scan of the original book. Almost all images are heavily pixelated, with incredibly strong \\"moir��e\\"-effects; sometimes you can hardly recognize what is depicted. Any average photocopy would provide a better quality of the print. The edition looks like - and likely is - a print-on-demand book - but costs twice as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculously complex","review":"As a museum professional with over twelve years experience designing and producing exhibitions for a wide variety of subject matter i was immediately interested in Tony Bennet's book. The summary on the back mapped out, in plain english, a book that detailed the social and political forces that resulted in and shaped the modern concept of the museum.However once i had purchase the book and actually tried to read it I found myself drowning in Foucault -ian language that ultimately obscures any observations that Mr Bennet may have had. This book is only for those with a college degree in philosophy,as it seems more focused on showing us all how clever Mr Bennet is than actually dealing with the subject matter. Completely inaccessible to all but the most acedemic minded scholars"},{"rating":"1","title":"pop-Foucault","review":"A glib account of the history of the museum, written in easi-Foucault language which simply adapts the traditional 70s sociological model of 'social control' - museums form part of the bourgeois plot to control the people, along with schools etc. In the end, the account is nothing more than conspiracy theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best set in the world","review":"I'd have to say I was a little disappointed in this set. Having bought the 2000 Annual a while back, I expected some better stuff from the Ministry. Disk one is so-so, a few decent tracks. Disc two was what turned me off completely, what with all this cheese techno sounding hip-hop stuff that I couldn't even begin to describe, at least for the first 7 tracks or so. The rest of disc two is at least listenable, last 4 tracks in particular being quite decent. Disc three, sadly, is probably the best, at least it resembles house music. Hopefully they will redeem themselves with Annual 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just below average cds...","review":"I just got my copy today and I have to say, I was really expecting a lot more from all the hype. Disc one is probably the best of them all. Disc two, well, I have to agree with the other review on here. Hip-hop was something I did not want, nor care about when wanting some good house. Disc three has it's moments, but overall, it was just there. I was buying this with hopes it kicked butt, but to no luck.

This crib has stationary sides which is fine, but even at the highest setting it would be nearly impossible to reach your baby. The only possible way for me to get a baby out of that crib would be by using a step-stool, or taking the baby out on either end of the crib which is just impractical. I have the two matching pieces which are beautiful, and really felt bad that I couldn't get the crib, but I knew I would always regret it. I asked the sales people at Babies R Us about this, and they said they get customers questioning them all the time regarding this matter, and that they can't understand why it was built this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but impractical","review":"In our opinion, the highest setting is much too low for a newborn up to 5-6 month infant. The crib is very nice, pretty solid, and not too hard to put together, but it is extremely difficult to pick up/put down my baby, especially without waking her up. I am 5'3\\", so perhaps it wouldn't be as difficult as someone who is 5'8\\", but since the other reviewer hasn't tried with a baby I would seriously consider this issue prior to purchasing. I wish we had read the reviews and looked into that more--we fell mostly for the look and convertibility. I would not have bought it had I known. We purchased it recently and my baby is five months old...cannot imagine how challenging it would have been with a newborn. I am looking into a return...if not, we'll have to purchase a step stool for sure, which seems unnecessary considering the purchase price. Wish the salesperson we worked with had advised us of the setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sturdy Crib","review":"I just purchased the whole bergamo set and they are very beautiful. The crib has high quality construction. The reason I am rating this a 4 of 5 is because 1. Hard to put baby in/out of crib if you are shorter than 5'6. 2. No where to tie bumper pads in crib. 3. No place to mount the mobile. really think about these reasons before you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical","review":"If you are looking for your own desires....looks..... a nice set to look good in your home, it looks nice... but as far as actually using it.... The sides are too high, they dont lower to get the baby out, the bumper doesnt attach in the back.... My baby is now 9 months and it is already chipping on the sides.... I planned on this being the crib I pass down from one kid to the next, but i dont think that will be the case... And the whole mobile thing.... it is nothing that helps to caring for your new baby but add stress.... I am going to sell mine and look into a new one....

She tries too hard to sound like American! Where's her pride as an Australian?I would not be surprised if this CD ends up to be a one hit wonder.BTW, many radio stations in Australia play her songs far too many times.

That is, however, not to claim those traits as defects, as what we have here is a burgeoning young talent with barely a toe on the first step of what should be a luminously trascendental career, but rather as virtues: Kasey Chambers knows her music, which has to be the case when you consider how geographically isolated she has been from her obvious artistic references. Vocally, Chambers sounds like a cross between Julie Miller and Stacey Earle, fit within the range of the great Emmylou Harris. Lyrically, there's not as much depth as the original stuff (read: Gram, Steve Earle, Gillian Welch, and Lucinda Williams), but the arrangements are tight enough, and the intentions honest enough, so as to make for a phenomenally satisfying sophomore effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 'The Captain' But Equally Good","review":"Being a humongous Kasey Chambers fan, I hunkered down the extra coin to get the import version of B & B before it hit the U.S. on a grand scale. Totally worth it, this album will soon be another Kasey Classic. However, I must warn you, I felt this album was a grower, so you too may have to give it a few spins in the CD player before you begin to really appreciate it. If you thought 'The Captain' was great, you will soon think the same of B & B. If you've never listened to Kasey before, I'd recommend buying 'The Captain' first and giving it a listen before you move on to B & B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, surprise","review":"I have to say I almost ran off the road after I bought this CD.

But then I got the of some knee-slappin, banjo-pickin, po-dunk country... and you know what? It grew on me. Soon I was tooling down the interstate here in Atlanta singing \\"Crossfire\\" at the top of my lungs. Her brand of country isn't the whiny, \\"i wanna be pop\\" sound of today, but sounds more like the classic country stylings of Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn. I highly recommend \\"Barricades and Brickwalls\\" to any rock fans that can take a little country sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A country sound...","review":"...But without the cliche titles and trite lyrics that sometimes accompany country music.

However, Wattenberg also dilutes the debate into a one sided ethnocentric account of what is a global problem. He considered himself a liberal but i found his ideas and unneccessary views rather conservative and politically charged. I thought that although linked to politics he presented an extremely bias account, with a pointless degree of patriotism. I was extremely interested in the topic at hand and if written by a well founded neutral writer i trust that this review would be somewhat different unfortunatly it was not the case.

With continuing increases in industrial and agricultural efficiency fewer people will be able to do more and provide effective growth in their own wealth as well as provide the surplus neded to sustain the elderly. The real fear of the \\"conservatives\\" is that fewer people and slower or reversed population growth will eliminate the huge surplus of people that allow the effective enslavement of the less developed world for the profit of few holding the wealth of the developed world.Yes, the world will have fewer, but far more prosperous people and the elites will see a contious erosion of their privledge.

Bowie just has that sex appeal and magical appearance for a perfect Goblin King, if they had picked anyone else it would not be as good.A Gem of a movie for both young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"** Fantastic **","review":"This VHS contains the making-of documentary of Jim Henson Labyrinth. Includes interviews of Jim Heson, David Bowie(Who play Jareth, the evil Goblin King), Jennifer Connely(who play Sarah, a girl that wishes her baby brother away by the goblins) and a lot more. I like to see how the characters of the movie take physical form in the hands of henson puppet crew. And the election of David Bowie to play the Goblin King were perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muppets and David Bowie?","review":"This is one of those cult classic movies I grew up with as a kid that seemed like no one else my age knew about. Yet as I have gotten older, it seems like everyone and their mom grew up watching this. I grew up with Muppets, Fraggle Rock and all that. This movie has great design aspects from Brian Froud and the Muppets in this movie are some of the best ever filmed. I don't typically like musicals but the musical numbers in this movie are mainly David Bowie and some Muppets. Mostly the musical numbers in this movie are like random, trippy music videos from the 1980's. This movie is still cool after all these years, the effects mostly hold up and it looks crisp on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, thrilling, and clean, this movie deserves an oscar!","review":"When I first saw this movie I thought it was going to be a bore. Boy, was I wrong! I wish I had taped it the first 3 times I saw it. Now, I can't seem to find it, even online! What a shame that this movie isn't being sold anymore, yet movies that are in black & white can still be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"somebody re-release this movie please!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this is one of my favorite movies and i have been trying to obtain a copy of it for many years now. it is definitely a classic and i would like to add it to my collection...i can't even find it in the video stores anymore! Please, i want to see this movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic tale from our childhood.","review":"I remember growing up watching Labrinth and I still love it to this day. I can only more appreciate it now. Those who like the work of Escher will love the scenery in the movie which was adapted from his work. Those of our scandanavian neighbors will apprieciate the trolls and gobblins in the film resembling that of the trolls from Norwegian fokelore.(So if your looking for a statue of Hoggle research Norweigan fokelore) This movie has been more the a childs film its fantasy tale for us all. Look at it closely for its for its real story lyes in the details of the film its self."},{"rating":"2","title":"HENSON IS THE MAN!!1","review":"If you thought that all Henson did was the muppets, you are soooo wrong! I didn't watch this movie for the first time until I was about 10, but it has remained one of my absolute favorites five years later. If you loved this one you've also got to see The Dark Crystal. It simply must be released again, PLEASE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing, sort of funny","review":"I found this movie to actually be extremely dissapointing. The characters well very under-developed, the plot was sketchy and immensely flawed. I seriously thought of BURNING it after I watched it, but I had to return it to Blockbuster. The singing was actually pretty funny, yet excruciatingly obnoxious. The first song that David Bowie sang was stuck in my head for 3 days. I had nightmares about the poor quality of the puppets, and lived in fear of being forced to watch this movie again. Then, I was forced to watch it on an airplane, and started looking for parachutes. Seeing I could not find one, I locked myself in the bathroom for the duration of the flight. Please, I beg of you, do not show this at social gatherings, unless you want to be TPed. Just buy The Stand, Cujo, or It instead.-Pennywise the Dancing Clown"},{"rating":"1","title":"can't give it any less","review":"the only people who will enjoy this are Bowie fans I guess and I'm not one of them.The Muppets are funny, this is not. Maybe suitable for a 9 year old who likes fluffy things prancing about but then you have the teletubbies for that....I guess that the only thing that stops me using all the explitives that I should be writing here is the thought that this was meant for children....Maybe that's how it got the 5 star rating - by eliminating the rude reviews..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Labrinth","review":"The DVD case came with a corner chiped out, and the CD had some crusty stuff on it that I had to clean off. There was a chip in the DVD and art was faded. None of these conditions were noted on the description of the product. It played well until 5 minutes to the end and it froze. I wouldn't of bought this had I of known of the condition of the case and DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable fantasy","review":"This is an enjoyable fantasy, with an over-the-top performance by David Bowie as the Goblin King and a charming youthful heroine played by Jennifer Connelly complementing the imaginative puppeteering of Jim Henson. There's lots of humor, a few scary moments, but generally nothing to cause parents too much anxiety.The genius of Henson has always been to take a medium which is essentially for children and give it enough wit and subtlety to keep adults entertained. Those who look down on this movie as beneath their level of sophistication (you can find a few of them in the lower-starred reviews) have missed the point. This isn't a film with a message or an allegory of life's lessons, it's entertainment.Relax, laugh, admire the creativity of the inimitable Jim Henson and enjoy. It's as simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words: David Bowie!","review":"\\"You have no power over me!\\" Well, this movie has power over me. This classic movie is a must see! I'll admit Sarah's constant \\"It isn't fair\\" gets pretty annoying but that's part of the charm. All is easily overcome by David Bowie simply appearing on camera. The music is amazing. So is the story and creativity.If by some miracle you haven't seen this movie, buy it now. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The movie is a classic, very fun. One of Jim Hensons best. Great effects and David Bowie does a good performance. Micheal Motion does a great job juggling, from behind David."},{"rating":"2","title":"Labyrinth","review":"A really good children's tale all be it, as most of the best ones are,quite dark. But then, the original Grimm's fairy tales were very dark ( hence, the apellation of \\"grim\\" as used today). Recommended for kids and adults alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!!","review":"I could watch this one over and over again! Its a really neat well presented family movie. David Bowie is wonderful at playing the role of the Goblin King. This is must see movie for those who like something out of the ordinary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch What You Wish For","review":"What starts out as a normal night for Sarah, being stuck at home babysitting her brother, starts into a fantastical adventure into another world. Sarah wishes her brother gone and the Goblin King answers that call. Sarah must journey into the Goblin King's land to try and get her brother back. What she dosen't realize is that his Labyrinth has many twists and turns. The storyline is not only great in this movie but so isn't the acting. The music is great, as well, and they choose the best person for the Goblin King part. You can tell Henson put alot of work into this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible transfer","review":"The blu-ray transfer for this film is simply horrible. Story aside, save you money and get the dvd. The picture will have to be better than this. It's frustrating to expect the implied clarity of a bd disc and sit viewing a picture of un-sharp images.Ken"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My sister loves this movie so I was so happy to be able to find it for her for her b-day. It was in great condition and the special features were a added bonus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Labyrinth","review":"I was so thrilled to finally see the rerelease of this movie. I thought it would never happen. For a long time, I had to watch an old taped copy of it. When it came out, I bought two copies just in case something would happen to one of them. David Bowie is awesome in this movie, and it is a great movie for anyone to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fantasy that only improves with the passage of time.","review":"I saw this movie when it was first released. I was 18 years old at the time and thought that it was a wonderful romp through a magical fantasy land. Jim Henson's imagination never failed to amaze me, and Labyrinth is second only to The Muppet Movie on the list of his achievements. Now, I'm thirtysomething and have children of my own. Last summer, they happened to catch this great movie on the Disney Channel. They, too, loved this classic modern fairy tale. I was amazed at the way it held even my two year old's interest better than some animated movie's have. All in all, this is a super movie that has stood the test of time. It would be well worth the producer's time and money to re-release this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, funny, for anyone","review":"The thing I like about the labyrinth is it is intended for anyone to enjoy. The puppets are the best in this movie. Think this was one of the most memorable movies for me as a kid because I really was a huge muppets and fragle rock fan and jim henson also was responsible for the labyrinth."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever!!","review":"such a great movie... I first saw this movie when I was a kid and now I get to share it with my kiddo... she loved this movie...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dated","review":"This is pure 1986, as both the dated David Bowie soundtrack and the primitive special effects will reveal. The story line is simple, and there are no scary parts. Good for kids, I guess. I never saw this when it came out. It seems to appeal mostly to people who were growing up in the 80s. If you didn't, you might skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, you *shouldn't* have","review":"I got this movie as a gift, as it was recommended from the other movies on my wish list. I was SO disappointed. The plot is lacking in any suspence, the songs have no \\"umph\\", and the acting was lack-luster. I was expecting something of the quality of \\"The Neverending Story\\" or \\"Flight of the Navigator\\", but it seemed merely a movie to showcase Bowie and the muppets. Others seemed to have really liked it, so rent it before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than an involved puppet show.","review":"This film was designed for staging an elaborate puppet show. The acting of the two main human actors is wooden, and the plot is shallow at best. The film's interest is harmed because of the slow pace. Fine work by the late Jim Henson, but beyond that, it just doesn't hold the viewer's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LABYRINTH!","review":"I absolute, positively LOVE the movie, \\"Labyrinth\\"! When I first saw it when I was six years old, I was rolling on the floor with laughter at the goblins and I was both frightened by and enchanted with Jareth, the Goblin King.By the time I was 10, I was reciting just Sarah's speech over and over.Now, at the age of fifteen, I write Labyrinth stories and poems. I find myself constantly comparing my mother to Sarah's stepmother and I feel like I AM Sarah! Nearly every night, I have to stay home and babysit my little sister. I've tried many, many times to wish my little sister away, but it didn't work! I'm still enchanted with Jareth, but it is in a MUCH different way. *blushes* I reccomend getting this movie. I reccomend watching it at least twice a day, like I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for kids","review":"I remember enjoying Labyrinth as a preteen and thinking it had some mystical charm. Watching it again as a 42 year old proved to be the longest, most ludicrous, incoherent waste of 80 minutes I wish I had back. It's just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!","review":"I watched Labyrinth on TV when I was a little girl and the movie hasn't been aired since. When I found this awesome movie on video at Wal-Mart over 5 years ago, I just had to have it! A couple of years later my mom bought the movie on DVD for me and watching it in a better clarity than a VHS tape brought back memories of watching in the dark when I was little. Labyrinth is a wonderful Jim Hanson movie that isn't just puppets. David Bowie plays Jareth and recorded the soundtrack for the movie as well. Anyone looking for a good rainy night or anytime movie, this is the movie to buy! Great family movie!!!!! Labyrinth is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun video with good Bowie music","review":"Why, oh why won't the studio re-release this? It's a classic for both children and Bowie fans - \\"although things are not always as they seem\\" - the demand alone should make the studio reconsider putting this movie back on the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"Both Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal are classics in my mind by Jim Henson the greatest puppet master ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy!! Fantasy !! Fantasy!!","review":"I'm just recalling this film. It's really interesting! If you love fantastical world fantasies I also recommend: Catnapped!,Return to OZ and Peter pan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fantasy and escapism","review":"The perfect movie for females from 8 to 88. Jim Henson puppets for the kids and David Bowie in Tights for the adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE TOP 10 MOVIES IN MY OPINION.","review":"This movie had a good story line. cute music and lyrics. and great acting. everyone in our family really enjoyed seeing it. all the charecters were so good. my favorite was Milo, he was so adorable...WHAT A MOVIE. I GAVE IT 5 THUMBS UP!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of all-time","review":"This movie has got to be the best movie of all-time. Who couldn't like this movie? It has cool characters, a great plot, and good music. I let a friend borrow my copy of this movie and I still haven't gotten it back, so needless to say, I am very happy that it is being re-released. I can't wait until I get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic !","review":"Labyrinth never fails to make me smile. I have been watching it since 1989! It has a great storyline about courage, love and friendship. It is action packed, full of one of a kind Bowie songs, and quite frankly, hilarious. The characters are unforgettable. Jennifer Connelly(this may have been her debut) is as breathtakingly beautiful as she is charming and innocent. David Bowie, as the Goblin King is perfect. This is a movie to watch again and again and each time notice some new detail. My 30 something daughter, my teenage son and my 8 year old grandson all think Labyrinth is the greatest. As mother, grandmother, and teacher, I highly recommend Labyrinth for anyone who likes an adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This on the DVD now....","review":"This is the excellent making of show that is on the Labryinth DVD release no need to pay silly collectors price for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it since day ONE!","review":"I first saw this movie when I was about 4 or 5 and now i'm 16. I instantly fell in love with it. I loved all the characters. My favorite time to watch it is on stormy nights. Now that the Labyrinth has been brought out once more, I will be buying it as soon as i can. If you love fantasy stories with a bunch of magic and puzzle solving you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie. A great adventure.","review":"I have also been searching for this movie. I bought one for a boy I babysat for about 7 years ago and they sold it everywhere. Now it is impossible to find. This movie takes me away to a dream world in which we all need to travel to once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Done!","review":"This movie captured the essence of everything a motion picture should be. The puppets are great for children. The symbolic atmosphere and depth will make anyone think. The genius of Jim Henson and the mystical presence of David Bowie (Jareth) made for a magical movie. Outstanding music. The songs will get stuck in your head and drive you absolutely bonkers!The DVD really cleaned up the video, wich was good to start with. It gave plenty of extras. I really liked the \\"Inside the Labyrinth\\". It was very interesting.On VHS or DVD, this movie is a must-see for anyone who likes to feel the magic of a fantasy kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie for all ages","review":"i saw this movie when i was a toddler. i fell in love with this movie i am now 17 and i watch it to the day. jim henson is a master of pupetry. he put mythical time together with the present and made a fabulous movie that has so many life lesons init. you can learn alot from the trials of young sarah. if you like fairy tale and muppets you will love this movie.(a lot like the dark crystal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the movie.","review":"I love the movie. Watched it once and loaned the movie to a friend to watch and when she went to take the DVD out, it broke in the middle leaving it useless. She felt bad and bought me a new one. But makes me wonder how cheap the case was or even the DVD to have it break like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it back in the 1980's. Somethings are better remembered","review":"Back around 1989 I probably watched this movie 10000000000 times. In my mind it was the greatest movie ever and had fond memories. Flash forward to this year - I got it for my kids to watch and it did not hold up. My kids found it boring and quite frankly, the movie really wasn't very good. I get the whole nostalgia vibe but the movie made very little sense, the acting was bad, the music was terrible and the effects were laughable.

We updated to DVD as we have the VHS and still enjoy the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many stars?","review":"I watched it based on its 5-star ratings.... Not for me, not for most people I know. If you are not a huge Bowie fan, I would think twice about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie's only redeeming aspect are its sets.","review":"Everything else about this movie is just bad. David Bowie was a horrible choice to play the bad guy! He can't sing worth beans! His voice sounds like a frog with a flu! And the choice of the actor for the main girl was less than admirable. She did a sub-par job. The sets in this movie had a great fantasy look, and the puppeteering was fabulous! But everything else, including a rather sappy screenplay, detracts from it and leaves it in the dust. Kids will enjoy it, but I'll never waste my time watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be Henson's Worst Film","review":"I enjoy Jim Henson's films. The Dark Crystal is my favorite movie. Labyrinth, however, is a real dud. It is a hodge podge mishmash of muppet nonsense, bad acting, bad singing, and a horrible plot. I guess I'll join the minority of one star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another thing wrong with the 80s","review":"This movie was sooo lame. The songs hurt my ears and David Bowie's pants hurt my eyes. Jeeze man his dingle was dragging on the ground. Dumb songs, David's tight pants, what could possibly make the movie any more campy? Oh wait there were MUPPETS TOO! This was a stupid, lame and all around retarded movie. I gave it another star because David Bowie had the courage to use a deranged hairstylist kicked out of Cats and wair the leatards that showed all of the bulges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone for a slightly used version instead? Where was Sting?","review":"I thought I would like this movie a lot because of the excellent Jim Henson \\"Dark Crystal\\" movie that came out before. Like Dark Crystal, the characters were wonderful and better in Labyrinth. Except the bad new is David Bowie ruined the movie. I think Bowie grabbed some old 80's tunes he wrote way back that were so bad they never made it to record. They don't fit into this movie. His acting and music make the film like a horrible music video from the 80's. I couldn't stomach his tunes on this and if the director had any sense he would have cut them all. As far as his acting, anyone in the street would have been as good but he is just fair at best here. I never disliked David Bowie in the past but he damages this movie to make it not worthy to buy and almost not even a rental. They should have picked Sting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have rented this so much, I should have 15 copies by now.","review":"Labyrinth is by far the best movie that I have seen. It is imaginative, exciting, heartwretching and appeals to all the elements of fantasy, humour, romance, a bit of horror and inner growth. The characters seem real to the audience. Each portrays a personality that makes them stand out. Sarah portrays that spoiled, complainative brat that grows up once she changes her views on life. The other characters portray blind chilvary, fear, loneliness, book that is more than it's cover and a ruler that is nothing without one to rule.I recommend it to anyone and everyone to watch atleast once."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIKE IT , LOVE IT , BUY IT","review":"Somebody pick my chin up off the floor please. This movie rocks. This movie is a great movie for kids and kids at heart. Parents buy it for Christmas for your kids. Grandparents if the parents don't get it, get it yourself and give it to your grandkids then, watch it over and over and over again. This movie will put you into a trance.You'll have no problem watching it over again because you'll love it SO MUCH. When I saw it was being sold here I had to get it. Ive always loved it and I always will. I love Jim Henson's work. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of the '80s","review":"This movie is so great! I saw it when it first came on television and I loved it! I've remembered it since then, which was probably 10 years ago, which would make me 8. I love David Bowie as the Goblin King! As a kid, the hair and voice spooked me for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HIDDEN TREASURE","review":"I saw this movie when I was about 11 and was held capative the whole time watching it.

Thank god for the release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video ever,a family classic that will never die.","review":"Labyrinth is a great video, when I was little I watched it so much that it broke.I became very unhappy.I would always tell my mom that when I grew up if it was not back out,I would pay any amount of money to have it re-released.I guess Sara will once again walk through the Labyrinth. I will never stop loving Sara's opening lines.Within you is the best song.Labyrinth is a great family classic,and a movie everybody should see young or old.I beleve Labyrinth is one of those movies that reminds us how to be young at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy meets Reality","review":"This movie shows the reality of a older sister that has to take care of the sibling brother and does it quite frequently. Then the older sister Sarah (Jennifer Conelly) wishes her brother Toby away and realizes that she actually did wish him away and ends up meeting Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie) who is her big obstacle in getting her brother back. It proves to be a well thought out movie with great charaters and settings. Jareth proves to be a seductive obstacle to Sarah but she is oblivious to that. David Bowie proves to be a sexy charming but ohh so bad in the role of the Goblin King with a young Jennifer Connelly (sp?) giving Sarah such a great niavete that is excellently executed given her little experience. A must watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required viewing","review":"As many times as I've watched this movie on cable and on tape, I never tire of it. The story is original and everything about the movie - from the background to the superb acting - sucks you right into the land of the goblins.David Bowie played a fantastic bad guy and his contributions to the movie's soundtrack were equally stunning.Kids and adults alike should be required to watch this movie just to let themselves float into a fantasy for an hour and a half. It's healthy for the self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and unforgetable","review":"I grew up watching this movie and was always entranced by its magic and beauty. Who can forget the \\"dream ball\\", the endless hall of stairs, or Bowie's general fabulousness? The creators had some of the most poetic imaginations in the film industry and films like this are just not made anymore. Why only four stars then? Because so much sexual tension gets built up between Sarah and the Goblin King and it never, never gets released! It's so frustrating! Ditch the litle brat and stick with Bowie you silly girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It reminds me of the power\\" \\"what power?\\" this power!!!","review":"AAAH! What is there to say about the best film ever?!?!? Look at the other ratings!!! FIVE STARS!!! And it deserves it. Chalked full of Henson creatures and ingenuity, it is not only for the kids this time. The songs are great, as are the costumes. \\"Dance a little dance\\" has such a great tune, it's hard to resist dancing to it! The effects are old, but it's cute how the characters can be ringed in a little black line or show the feet of a puppeter. There are beautiful and strange garments worn by the humans, and the makeup is wild. You just have to love a movie this orignal in scenery and rich in plot. Go get it!!! And someone re-release it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie!!!","review":"I saw this movie many times in my youth..now my daughter is at the age that she would love it.

Oh, if only. Anyway, Excellent. Stylish and original, charming and captivating, reminds one that we are children at heart.

The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way.

I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Wretched Beyond Imagination","review":"This is without a doubt the worst thing to ever molest my eyeballs. The only thing that could make the treacherous expirience worse was seeing that people actually enjoyed it.This movie is easily summarized by three elements; obscenely tight pants, mind-blowingly hideous and disturbing puppetry with obnoxious voice actors, and horrific acting by the only people in the film.I could live the rest of my life in absolute peace knowing that I would never watch this again. I would never put this atrocity in front of a child's eyes as suggested by some (possibly crazed) reviewers. This film is simply not suitable for anyone and if you should ever come across a copy you must destroy it immediately if you have any love for humankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedophilia at it's best","review":"Let's see... she's how old and David Bowie wants to make her his queen?

No offense if you like it, but I just don't see what's good about it. In fact, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it with my friend and we basiclly just spent the whole movie making fun of it.

Sorry, guys, cannot share your fun. Granted we laughed at quite few places, just not the places creators of the movie meant to be laughed. When evil king of goblins starts to sing \\"Oh, my baby...\\" Oh, my... It's really extremely stupid.The caveat to this is clearly that children of age 3-6 may find it really good, and for this purpose the movie is probably good.

This is one of those rare gems that took place at the right place and the right time.Kids of this generation do not know what they missed with this movie. Everything from the storyline to the music was absolute perfection, a true fantasy in every way.Jennifer Connolly and David Bowie one hundred percent carried this movie, but had some stealth competition from their puppet counterparts. It still surprises me that Jennifer was only 14 years old at the time this was made, but she every bit equals David Bowie's strong presence.Watch it. Listen to it. Treasure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"I loved this movie as a kid!

Item was new and in cello wrap as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good at All","review":"This movie was difficult to sit through. The acting is poor, the special effects are dated (it is, after all, an old film), the plot is rambling and even Bowie in his relative youth can't save it. Also, the music is bad-- who would have thought this could be the case with Bowie doing the soundtrack?-- but it's boring. I'm sure that when it was released, it was the cat's meow, but watching it today is difficult, at best. I bought it because so many people rated it so highly, but the joke is on me. I would recommend saving your money and watching something else. There are a whole lot of better alternatives out there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"for myself","review":"i know lots of people who love this movie..but i am sorry to say, i am not one of them.effects,etc.are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious!","review":"Just forget the plot of the film or the themes of adolesent responobility yada yada yada... this film is worth every single penny just to see the sheer hilarity of some of the things that crop up!Now i'm older, I appreciate more the little glow worm that talks to the girl... it is hilarious! The film is worth every penny for that scene. Secondly, seeing David Bowie jump about in those revealingly tight leggins is strangely funny and entertaining (i'm suprised they let children watch the film after seeing him in those leggins!) Thirdly, the way he dances and chucks a fake baby around during 'Magic Dance' is totally hysterical!Other funny things are watching that fox riding on a dog... what is that all about! And seeing the 'Bog of Eternal Stench'! Okay, so maybe i'm being a bit immature now, but essentially this film is great! A cult classic!

Even though I'm a teenager, my friends and I still watch this movie!! I first saw it when I was a little girl when my babysitter brought it over because she was (at the time) in love with David Bowie. This movie is something that will never be out of date or forgotten by me & if I meet someone who hasn't seen the movie, I have them come over & we watch it! I'm happy to see \\"The Making Of Labyrinth\\" made the DVD under the Special Features. The plot is great and Jennifer Connelly's & David Bowie's acting performances are wonderful... Any David Bowie fan will love this movie & I also own the soundtrack- which is almost better than the movie itself!!!

I somehow ended up with two copies of this movie and both of them went bad because I watched it so much.Spoiled, self-absorbed Sarah doesn't like her baby brother or her stepmother. She enters this fantasy world to escape them both, getting caught in the rain. She must find her way to the castle at the center of the labyrinth and solve it before her brother, Toby, is changed into a goblin forever.This is almost impossible with the likes of Hoggle, Ludow, Litimus, and Ambrosious. An unlikely but loyal group of characters that help Sarah on her quest. Then there's Jarreth, who watches their every move having a few tricks up his own sleeve.I laughed when they all had to go through \\"The Bog Of Eternal Stench\\". Ambrosious had me laughing when it was his turn to cross the rocks. I like the ballroom scene best. Also when Sarah remembers that last line of the book. \\"You have no power over me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I got this for my Little Sisters Birthday, and she made me a fan with her love of the British Worm.

David Bowie (although he looks to be more Elf than Goblin) does a wonderful Goblin King. The movie has excellent scenery (who can forget the Oubliette or the Bog of Eternal Stench?), great makeup (like Hoggle the Dwarf, and Ludo the Yeti), and expert puppetry(great examples are the head-tossing fire sprites and those nondescript Goblins). I definitely recommend the movie Labyrinth.Also of interest to a fan of this film is A Field Guide to Goblins: A Goblin Companion, written by the movie's author, Terry Jones and illustrated by Brian Froud, the author/illustrator of Faeries and Good Faeries/Bad Faeries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie for all ages.","review":"This movie is just plain fun.

They are all grown now and were all so excited when I purchased this movie! Young Jennifer Connelly was beautiful and David Bowie is mesmerizing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrrated Classic","review":"I first saw this movie when it came out. I enjoyed it very much, mostly because I was 16 at the time and was a major Bowie fan. I liked the somewhat love story between The Goblin King (Bowie) and Sarah. Now 14 years later, my children ages 7 & 5, watch this video at least twice a week. We also own the soundtrack, which they sing along and can tell me every part that the song or music pertains to in the movie. Everytime Sarah has that hallucination with the Cinderella theme, my daughter calls me and says, \\"Mommy, your favorite part is coming on! \\" In a weird way I find that part romantic. It was disappointing that this film received lukewarm reveiws and box office receipts when it came out. Thank God for home video! I feel it is one of Henson's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Labyrinth","review":"The Labyrinth is one of my all time favorite movies. It brings back many fond childhood memories. I used to watch it all the time on video when I was younger, but then one day the video dissapeared or something, because the movie was no longer to be seen. Then years later a friend of mine recorded it off the television and I again got to see this wonderfull movie. When it came out on DVD I knew I had to buy it, and so I did.The movie is a wonderful tale of fantasy and adventure. David Bowie does a wonderful job of portraying the goblin king. The movie is filler with fantastic music from David Bowie and a rich score composed by Trevor Jones. The movie does not have so many extras except some trailers, bios and a making-of. But the DVD edition of the movie is very good. I'm sure this movie will charm you. If you haven't seen it yet, and like these sorts of movies, this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fantasy Classic!\\"","review":"David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly star in Jim Henson's 1986 fantasy.A girl wishes for her baby brother to be taken by goblins and mustrescue him from a goblin king.

The story can be interpreted as pure adventure, an empowering tale for girls of all ages, and as the psychological journy typical of abused children. The humor is pure python and will delight Jones fans of all ages!

I bought the DVD for myself. I put it on ready to enjoy a childhood favorite, and I could sit through it once and only once. Not quite as good as I had remembered, as with many things loved in childhood. My daughter on the other hand loves it, so not a total waste. Since I loved it as a kid and now my daughter loves it, I would say it's a great movie for kids. It's very entertaining for them. As for adults or young adults, unless you loved it as a child, there's not much of a plot but no shortage of cheese. The enjoyment is more sentimental and nostalgic. It's Jim Henson puppets, I mean really, how many serious adults sit around enjoying Sesame Street.No, there's nothing perverse about the movie (as I read in some reviews). And no, you don't have to be on drugs or crazy to enjoy it, just young or young at heart accompanied by a great imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"Great purchase. Big fan of Jim Henson productions since he pioneered puppetry during it's golden era as well as special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantasy!!","review":"Labyrinth has been one of my favorite films from childhood through adulthood. This movie combines an excellent and exciting plot that has fairy tale appeal, complex characters, and major theatrical moral dilemmas. Sarah is a girl fated to learn the lessons of life while attempting to conquer the many obstacles of the goblin city to rescue Toby, her little brother. Labyrinth will inspire and renew your interest in the world of fairy tales with the assistance of Jim Henson's lovable muffets, George Lucas productions, and David Bowie's vocal assistance. Take the chance to dive head first into Labyrinth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This was a DVD replacement for my old VHS.

The Labyrinth is a classic film of fantasy that fits the taste of adults and nurtures the imagination of the younger generation. - A film for all ages. I watched this movie as a child myself, and I have never lost my love for the puppetry and the acting skills of David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly. I believe this was actually the movie that I fell in love with David Bowie and his music. The soundtrack for this movie is suggested for music lovers like myself. This movie is easy to fall in love in love with, and can revive any imagination and creative thought easily. It is something for everyone to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a classic!!!!!!!","review":"I love this movie...it REEEAALLY needs come be made available on video again..I have searched far and wide to no avail...but if you get a chance, see this video at all costs.

And to think of it as just a children's movie is to only look at the surface. It's so much more! It's a love story, an obsession unfolding, an adventure story and a journey to adulthood.

Sarah, the heroine, doesn't need karate to defeat the villains, as so many young female protagonists in today's movies do. Rather she achieves her mission through courage, cleverness, and friendship. It's a great family movie, with only brief mild language. Preschool children will likely find it too scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever","review":"I love, love, love this movie and have ever since I was a child.. when ofcourse I would watch it repeatedly. The many Goblins (from the mind of the late Jim Henson) and their many humorous antics, hoggle (wasn't that his name?), the fox and his dog ambroscious, the gassy swamp of eternal stench... a real classic!! I'm not a fan of fantasy flicks at ALL, but this one gets a major reprieve. For the record, watching David Bowie with big hair, big makeup and overly tight leggings 20 years ago was disturbing and it still is. IMO, even though I watched this movie repeatedly as a kid, as an adult I still find it entertaining and just as funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"You remind me of the babe....","review":"I first saw this movie when I was about eight-years-old.

Frankly, it's a film for \\"children\\" of all ages- one that parents will actually enjoy watching with their kids over and over again. The storyline is classic and the musical numbers, especially those featuring David Bowie, are wonderful (I still can recall all the words).

The characters are nothing short of enchanting, and the story has everything you could hope for: magic, monsters both good and bad, humor, everything.

Good score, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sublimely Awful!","review":"On the positive side the musical numbers are among cinema's most ridiculous, especially David \\"Goblin King\\" Bowies' warbling. This is the moment when any whiff of cool Bowie had disappears in a puff of fairy dust. Its also rare that a movie achieves a level of awful so profound on so many levels and even rarer that the end result is as entertaining as Labyrinth. Its true I enjoyed watching it for the bucket loads of unintentional comedy that it supplies more than anything else. Actually to the exclusion of anything else. But alas that high level of gawdawful can't possibly be maintained and the movie gradually devolves to what I imagine The Wizard Of Oz would have been like if it was made during a writer's strike. I have to say about half way in I ceased to care. But then I'm far from being a twelve year old girl which appears to be the target audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...","review":"It was scratched, and started skipping when i tried to watch it, so you could say that i am definitely very dissappointed :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks!","review":"I love Labryinth!

It was in the old VHS format, and I never got tired of seeing it, enjoying it as much as I did the first time. Fast-forward some 15 years, when on a whim I decided to re-watch it just to see whether it would stand the test of time. I'm very happy to say that this is one of those (relatively rare) movies that never gets old!I've seen it many times as an adult, and I like it just as much as I did when I was a fairy-story-obsessed kid. David Bowie's flawless performance as the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly's beautiful, headstrong Sarah are the biggest reasons I never get tired of this movie, but Jim Henson's puppets and the magical challenges of the Labyrinth itself is what makes a good story become unforgettable. A must-see!As an aside, I admit I've had a long crush on David Bowie ever since I first watched this movie at age 9 or 10. See it, and you'll see why! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice entertaining movie that's not just for kids","review":"This movie's all right. It's not GREAT or anything, but it's fun to watch on an afternoon when you have nothing else to do. Jennifer Connelly did a very good job as Sarah, although there's something kind of strange about seeing David Bowie singing with goblin puppets and waving his arms around.

I followed the directions on the box, which do not require any materials other than distilled water and containers to immerse the weather ball in. It appeared to be set up satisfactorily and within a couple of days, a storm came through, and water did travel up the glass tube and as expected, water went back down the tube after the weather improved. However, a day later, for no apparent reason, water shot back up the tube in good weather where it has remained, higher than where it was during the storm. So, I'm not sure what went wrong, but obviously, this weather ball is not reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly not for everyone, but...","review":"If you love old houses and comfortable, worn furniture, this is the book for you.

This did 1/3 of those things--only the projection. I had issues with getting the correct time because there was a button (which was difficult to push) to change time zones and when the correct time zone was found, the clock spent at least 10 minutes getting the information. Secondly, the weather was EXTREMELY INACCURATE!

The red projector is as promised. However, it has one flaw: the projector is not totally flexible. If you put it next to your bed, you can read the time on the ceiling and the clock is still facing outward. If you want it projecting against a wall, you will not be able to see the clock without manually adjusting it (turning the clock around). If you want to put the clock on the other side of the room and look at the projector, it is upside down, unless you turn the clock facing the wall. Although you can adjust it, you cannot adjust it for this purpose. So, I think that overall it is a great product, but more thought should have been put into the adjustment features of the projector so that you don't have to move the clock in order to see it each day, while still being able to use the projector at night. An annoying flaw, but not a serious one. It is a nice machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little More Quality Please","review":"I bought this unit as a replacement unit for the same model that had served me well for five years but quit working. This unit performed as well as the previous unit until about six months ago when only about 50% of the projected display is able to viewed.

Worry free, you never have to bother changing the time for DST. Mine is probably 5 or 6 years old and still works great except some of the indiglo back lighting has burned out. It has been dropped onto a hardwood floor several times. The alarm is loud enough for me, however if your one of those really sound sleepers I doubt many beeper time alarm clocks would wake you up. I'm thinking about buying a new one except the price has almost doubled since I bought mine years ago. Some mentioned the projector doesn't show up on the ceiling in the daytime?

It would have been nice to be able to show the inside temp on the projection, or dim the projection without turning it off, but these were minor quirks.

When you pay this much for a clock, you expect it to last a little longer than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Picture and Description!","review":"Know that the so called 'back-lighting' only stays on for 5 seconds, and then only when you hit the snooze button. So, you can barely see the clock, even in a well-lit room. The picture shows what it looks like with the back lighting on, not what it looks like most of the time. The projected time is only bright enough to be seen at night; however, even that is just barely true. I'm most upset about the backlighting.

Eventually, for some digits a \\"3\\" looked like a \\"1\\" because the the horizontal segments forming the \\"fingers\\" of the \\"3\\" are dead.The face of the instrument, an LCD with back-light, still shows correct information but the projection display is the reason I bought the thing.If you're willing to tolerate the short life, it is a great clock.

That said, I am overall quite pleased with the clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool item!","review":"This is one of the best purchases I have made of recent memory. It is one of those gadgets that every person can appreciate. The projection gives you the unique advantage of seeing the time from anywhere in the room. The indiglo is also really cool, if the projection is off. This clock works off batteries (there is an ac adapter for the projector) so it is easy to take with you if you are traveling. I put the outdoor monitor in my window, and I can constantly tell what the temperture and upcoming weather is. The best part is, the clock is tuned into the atomic clock, and is constantly setting itself for accuracy. This little guy is also pretty tough, I have tripped over the cord for the AC adapter twice (I can't tell you how infuriating this is), knocking it hard to my hardwood floor. Its still kicking.

Answer was the \\"warranty is three months and we can't tell you how to change the bulb?\\" Obviously I was amazed and asked how I could then return the clock to working order and was basically told that I was out of luck.

I don't use alarms, etc., but I do agree that the buttons on it are difficult to access. My issue is that the temperature is carried to a tenth of a degree. I bought this clock because I want to barely wake up, glance at the ceiling, and fall back asleep. With the temperature carried to three places, at least in Wisconsin at this time of year, there are many times where I have to think to figure out which is the time and which is the temperature. My brain can do it, but the whole purpose of this clock for me is to not turn my brain on to thinking mode. I don't need to know the temperature to the decimal point - 48.6 degrees doesn't mean much more to me than 48 or 49. I contacted Oregon Scientific to see if they had a projection clock that just had the simple temperature. They don't. To me, this is a design flaw. Otherwise, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected","review":"Looking at this device on the picture, I thought it'll have the graphics (i.e. clouds, etc like shown) but it is plain boring, only shows date/time and in/out temperature.

All in all, for the price, it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I had an Oregon Scientific clock for 10 years so when it needed replacing, I ordered another one that was similar but it was supposed to be a better model.

Other than doing that during setup, it has worked perfectly for the last couple of weeks. I love it! However,I must admit it's not always real acurate with the weather forecast, but that's OK. I don't really pay much attention to that anyway.Well here it is 4 1/2 years later (from 10/06 to 5/11), and it has worked perfectly this entire time, until last night that is. The bulb just got so weak, (literally overnight), that it stopped projecting. So I guess really don't have a choice other than buying a new unit, or changing brands or models. It's expensive but I like it so much, I'm going to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work in Alaska/Maybe Hawaii too","review":"I ordered this for a Christmas present last year. The projection of outside temp is great, however it will not automatically adjust to time in Alaska (and possible Hawaii as well).

I didn't really care about that feature, so when the clock incorrectly predicted rain twice in the last 10 days, I thought it was funny.Because it receives signals from the atomic clock, the clock quickly set the time after I activated the batteries. I really like the indoor/outdoor temperature and the projection of time and temperature at night. The projection is fine at night and my room does not get very dark. All the buttons are easy to use, and setting the alarm time is easier than any clock I have had in a long time.

The story of an alien from space named Kreton who seems to be less a cretin than the earthlings he visits, the play has little of the spectacular verve of language associated with its writer, one of the great wordsmiths of his time. As a play it's somewhat more serious than the film version, which was restructured as a Jerry Lewis vehicle. But not by much. After years of things like 3rd Rock from the Sun, it's hard to imagine a modern audience finding the wide-eyed gullible alien here much of a comedic revelation.

Another problem is the inherent unreliability of floppy disks. I have lost many shots due to disk errors. I liked the Mpeg mode when I bought it, until I discovered you cannot stop the camera once you begin recording. This is stupid. The camera takes good pictures, if your activity is taking pictures.

I've been \\"experiencing\\" their shoddy products for nearly 10 years now. If you look at their executive staff, it's all people with sales and marketing experience -- no one seriously technical or product oriented. This product shows it. As most reviews have indicated, if your a cash-poor amateur with some technical skills, this can be made to perform reasonably well in what I consider the short term. What happens a year or two down the road when the solar-sensors and the poor connectors fail I don't know. Also, it's not made for any kind of serious weather. The rain gauge obviously has no heater so you won't get anything in the snowfall department. As has been indicated, the anemometer reports windspeed on a whimisical basis. Overall, this is a pleasant enough toy if you feel like playing with toys. If you want a weather instrument, go with a real one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The unit is somewhat disappointing. The 1st humidity gage we had stopped working and the 2nd is wildly inaccurate. The screen on the unit stays backlit for only a few seconds even with the power plugged in. This makes it hard to read unless you want to press the display every time you want to see something. The directions are useless; if you ignore them and just use common sense it is pretty easy to set up if you know the following tricks: 1) open every unit and remove the protective strip in between the contacts and the batteries for the solar cells, 2) press the reset on the master unit when all sensors/units have the battery strips removed. The solar cells connect in an obvious manner with the back off of each unit. The unit is OK; you get what you pay for so don't expect a lot but it does function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Product","review":"For the price, this product has turned out to be extremely mediocre. I decided to purchase the weather station as a gift based upon the outstanding reputation of Oregon Scientific. While, the indoor/outdoor temperature gauge as well as the barometer have worked flawlessly, the rain and wind gauge have never worked correctly (not from lack of trying).Based upon a price of $400, I expect all the instruments to function flawlessly (assuming proper installation, of course). This simply hasn't happened. There are any number of less-expensive competing weather stations on the market that offer the indoor/outdoor temperature gauge and barometer. I spent the extra money on this product for the additional features of the rain and wind gauge. Since these features have never worked properly, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oregon Scientific - somewhat mis-leading.","review":"The name 'Oregon scientific' is a bit misleadng, as the product is manufactured in China. While the product works satisfactorily, the instructions were the worst I have seen recently. Example: each of the sending units (3) must be connectedto the datadevices via standard phone connector. However, there is no exterior recepticle; eachunit must be taken apart, and the screws are so tiny, most available screwdrivers willnot fit. And the instructions do NOT cover this procedure. Also, touch pad controls are not intuitive (at least for Americans). I have to refer to the instructions way too frequently to use the device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Problems","review":"I bought this unit about 4 years ago and could only get the temperature and humidity gauges to work correctly. It was impossible to get the wind gauge to work correctly because it seems you need robotic laser leveling on all planes to have it perfectly level. It would spin and and measure at about 1/4 of actual speed. The same goes for the rain gauge. I tested it by spraying water from the garden hose in a shower pattern and it registered nothing. When it rained I went out and looked inside and saw that the see-saw measuring aparatus was working, yet I got no reading. All components were communicating with the base station so I have no idea why these two would not work. For rain measurment I went back to my graduated plastic rain gauge that I hang on the fence and for wind speed I guess by looking at the trees and I stick a wet finger in the air or toss a few blades of grass in the air for direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 2 years","review":"I bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to return the initial unit because it did not work correctly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). The second unit worked well for a while (yes it was a long set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage stopped working pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensor. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function. It might be inexpensive for a weather station, but $240 is not cheap by my standards to have the product only last for 2 years. Not sure that I can recommend it. Too bad, because I think Oregon Scientific usually puts out a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good moderate price system","review":"I have had my weather station for two months now and have had no problems with it.

I had to buy a Jewler's Screwdriver to get the right size blade. I can't immagine myself standing on the peak of my roof replacing the battery in the Anemometer on a windy January day without losing half the screws (or maybe falling off the roof myself). The display unit does not have a continous lighted setting even on external power. You must keep touching the screen to keep it lit. I would suggest buying a companion computer program to display the units outputs. I chose Ambient Weather's program and am very happy with it.All in all, this is a good amature Weather Station at a resonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Station is great, Software is better","review":"I purchased this station to learn more about the weather, but I learned that the optional software package from Ambient ... was even better. This turned an interesting toy into serious weather data collection device for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initially complex, but a lot of fun once operational...","review":"I purchased a WMR968 a month ago, downloaded a \\"better\\" manual, spent a l-o-n-g day setting it up, and have since enjoyed being a \\"weather nut.\\" After purchasing a serial/usb cable, driver cd, and using a software program, I'm now on Wunderground as a personal weather station- with my station automatically uploading data every minute I'm online. Is it a professional weather station? Of course it isn't. Yet, for less than $260 (station, cable, driver cd, software to go online), it's a fun gadget for a 50+ adult who has always been interested in the weather. I'm sure there are better personal weather stations, but this one met my expectations for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings! I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat! We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings. Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings. This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband! Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help! Don't buy this product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you buy....","review":"Go to [...], click on personal weather stations then click on the google maps link. Looking at either the temperature or dew point readings look around on the map for stations whose readings look way off. 9 times out of 10 it will be a wmr968. This is easily the worst weather station ever made, and it is polluting weather data all over the country. For your sake and for the sake of people who may refer to your weather data, please don't buy this truly horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WMR Reliability","review":"My system is installed in a hot humid climate (Bahamas) within 200ft of the ocean. It was working perfectly for 7 month. Then, one after the other, the following parts failed:1. Humidity ~7mos2. Temperature ~9mos3. Wind Speed -10mos4 Wind Direction -12 mosAll units installed inside and the rain gage continue to operate.Obviously the WMR968 is not designed for this environment. So it makes no sense to keep replacing parts. I plan to dump the WMR968 and replace it with a more reliable weather system.ADDENDUM 9/2012I replaced it with Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 Weather Station (Wireless). This product is more reliable, The battery had to replaced after 18 month and the wind sensor went bad after 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor. Very in-accurate readings.","review":"Don't waste your time or money. If you want a Weather Station that gives accurate readings, buy the Davis. It can be found for not much more than this trash.The readings on the Oregon are all over the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oregon Scientific WMR968 Review","review":"THe Oregon Scientific WMR968 is ujst what we needed at out house. It is solar powered weather instrument and included a wind/rain/temp measurements. We live on the water in Seabrook Texas and have very strong winds and a lot of rain. This unit has operated very well. As a matter of fact it is our second unit. The first was flooded during hurricane Ike. The temperature indication continued to work. The wind transmitter could not take being submerged under salt water and the rain gauge was washed away. All in all we have enjoyed the ease of use. Once it is installed there is no upkeep!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible installation instructions","review":"I am in the process of installing this weather station and the instructions omit about 60% of the important stuff such as the following: 1) You have to take the back off the wireless/solar devices to connect them. That involves removing eight tiny screws. 2) Calibrating the anemometer is very unclear to get wind direction right. I finally figured out that you have to mount it on a pole. Oregon Scientific (fancy American name for cheap stuff made in China) said I did not need to. Nowhere is this key point addressed in the instructions. 3) I had problems putting in the wind vane. It clicks into place, but the instructions say nothing about that. That's as far as I've gotten, but someone else's review that it'll take 4-6 hours to install is on the money.I would not buy this product again and am not confident it will operate over the long term. I expect to run into other problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better... poor service","review":"I love the product, price is right....BUT quality is POOR and SERVICE is even worse!!!!!!!!!!! I have had two of these units over the past 3 years in San Diego CA and have had numerous sensors break and main unit malfunction. The service department at Oregon Scientific is very hard to get ahold of, it took 4 calls and 2 emails and I got a response after 4 days!!! Again I love the weather station, and maybe you get what you pay for at that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studio Portrait Photography of Children and Babies","review":"We are just starting a home-based photography business, and I have purchased many books of various subjects relating to photograhy in the past few months. This is by far one of the best yet, and the only one I've read entirely. The author shares many photographs that give you great ideas for props and poses. The text is very easy to understand, and therefore, not so overwhelming to those of us trying to cram in so much information during the startup of a business. There are suggestions for photographing and dealing with the different stages and ages of babies and children. The discussion on studio equipment is simple and to the point. She takes you through the steps of a portrait sitting, which was very helpful. I could go on and on, but I won't. It's a very good book, and I enjoyed reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves a place in every photog's library","review":"I am biased: I know Marilyn. She's photographed my kids, and the pictures are truly a joy. I think I've got the \\"credentials\\" to say how good she is ... I was a photojournalist, with credits in National Geographic and lots and lots of top magazines around the world.Even if I did NOT know Marilyn, I would recommend this book to fellow photogs ... because at one time or another, we ALL have to photograph kids. She has the gift, and she spills her secrets willingly for all of us to benefit.Studio lighting a challenge for you? It sure is for me. How perfect to have the diagrams, the explanations, and the tips from one of America's top pro's to guide us.Whatever your stage in the photography world ... beginning to full-time pro, you'll be richer for discovering her proven techniques and straight-to-the-heart way of communicating.And yes, it's loaded with pix. Naturally!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For stock studio photographers only","review":"I read the reviews on this book and decided to pick it up along with Vik Orenstein's. Orenstein's is definitely the better choice for my style. I have been photographing children for ten years and was looking for some fresh poses and ideas, and I found neither in Sholin's book. The shots are all poorly lit, boring stock studio photographs, like you would expect from a mall photo mill. If you are just getting into the children's portrait business and want to be more than just a stand-and-shoot photographer, this is NOT the book for you. For ideas on developing an interesting, fresh style of your own, choose Orenstein's book. I am returning this one because I have no use for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Shill reviews from Marilyn's colleagues - AVOID THIS BOOK","review":"Do a few cross searches on some of the names posted in these reviews and you'll find much of the glowing praise comes from friends/associates of the author.Bill Keane was nice enough to post TWO 5 star reviews for his friend. Way to be a pal, Bill!Take a look at the sample pages of this book and read for yourself what you're getting for your money.The author serves up gems such as this rare secret...\\"In digital cameras, images are captured on electronic sensors rather than film.\\"and\\"To get the most from each portrait session, you'll want to make sure that you've purchased a few key pieces of equipment. This includes:digital SLR camera...\\"DUH! So that's what I was doing wrong!!! This is the first book that told me I needed a camera to do photography! There's a lot of secrets in here, folks.Unless you wear a helmet, lick windows, and constantly ask if you can \\"pet the rabbits\\" you probably won't find this book very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK FOR THOSE OF US JUST GETTING STARTED","review":"For those of us who are just getting started and hope to someday be a professional photographer this book is for you. The photographs and lighting diagrams are especially helpful if your still not quite sure of yourself. Hats off to Marilyn. THANKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vintage recording..but mastered at the wrong speed!","review":"This is indeed a vintage recording of George Carlin with Jack Burns when they used to be a team back in the early 60's. The material is very dated which is expected, and truthfully not that funny, and the recording quality is not too good.The most annoying thing about this release is it was mastered at the wrong speed. Yes, George and Jack were younger back then but WAY past the age of puberty so their voices were not THAT much higher!! I am fortunate to have heard an original copy of the album, so apon hearing this CD for the first time was a bit of a shock.The cover is a total joke as well. It shows Carlin in his later days which gives no indication of the vintage recording contained inside. This cd is only for the collector.(I bought a copy, re-mastered it and corrected the speed using Sound Forge, then made a beautiful cover using an appropriate picture of \\"Burns & Carlin\\")Now I have to find a way to unload the \\"speeded up version\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"My friend bought this tape at a Quicky-Mart type establishment.

I own the majority of the BTM series, and this is, by far, one of the best. In terms of maintaining a consistent mood with a flawless track selection that isn't compromised by the artist's need to display his/her broad knowledge of music, this album is great. Talvin Singh's BTM is very distinct from the other's in that his Eastern origins are wonderfully present throughout the album.
