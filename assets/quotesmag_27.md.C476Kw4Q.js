However, Renner and Norton convinced me to give it a shot. Big mistake. This movie is a pathetic attempt to revive a story that has already been told. The first half hour to 45 minutes is mind numbing talk that tries and fail to reel you in with Bourne Ultimatum flashbacks. Renner and Weisz have little or no chemistry. After an hour and a half of agony, I finally left, went home and watched the Bourne Identity. How anyone who loved the original trilogy could possibly compare it to Legacy, it makes no sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo bad","review":"This movie jumped the shark. A distant fourth in the series. i just wish i could get my $5 dollars and two hours back.."},{"rating":"1","title":"S****","review":"Don't waste your time or money! This is a s***** movie. Would have given it zero stars if possible, or negative one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"This movie, unlike other Bourne movies, was hard to keep track of. I like Bourne movies because in the past they have kept my attention and were exciting to watch. I paid $15.00 for a movie that was not entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bored Legacy","review":"Two great lead actors, loads of potential, it's shame this was so disappointing. Renner is a perfect choice for the next iteration, but the director sacrificed plot/character attempting to prove this was a Bourne installment. Far too many flashbacks to earlier films. Decent action and chase scenes but they don't compensate for the thin content. Not worth the purchase price, IMO. Go back and rent the original trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not watch","review":"This was NOT Jason Bourne or anything of the such. This was a guy hooked on steriods/virus and he needed his FIX. There was no action until the end and then it was, \\"that's it?\\". The movied ended with the inclination that there will be another one to follow. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you have two hours to kill and there is nothing better to do with your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable action film...","review":"I guess I am easier to please than the other reviewers.All I ask is for a lot of action,suspense,a few thrills(which I got).This is the first time I have seen a \\"Bourne\\"movie.I will be ordering the Bourne trilogy(I like Matt Damon,especially in \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\")since this movie piqued my interest to watch the other 3.This is the first time I was exposed to Jeremy Renner--liked his portrayal,believable,not some young,built stud.I kept thinking,\\"Who is this actress who looks so much like Rachel Weisz\\"?I couldn't believe it was actually her!!She looks much younger!I always enjoy her performances.If you like action films,you won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak movie","review":"Acting poor-story line hard to follow-where is Matt?The other Boune movies were much better.Would not remmend this movie to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice twist to a great movie series","review":"I liked the new approach yet keeping key characters in play in this movie.Frankly the car and motorcycle chase scense got tedious and I felt I had seen them before but the rest of the film was interesting and well acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne Legacy","review":"Renner is powerful in the Bourne surrogate role, and the film is action packed. Highly recommended. Contains some violence, but it is tastefully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro to the Jason Bourne series.","review":"I am a great fan of the Jason Bourne trilogy and just had to get this one. It took me two attempts at watching it through to grasp the storyline and get used to another actor. This was done well as it introduced the original main characters from the Bourne series and somewhat explained the theory behind the story through flashbacks. I can see this going on as a new series, and Jeremy Renner was excellent. This would be a good movie to buy so you can watch it repeatedly. I didn't give it 5 stars because it still isn't as great as the original Bourne trilogy, but it's pretty close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Film","review":"The film was action packed and Jeremy Renner played his part well. The main character was not portrayed as a replacement for the Matt Damon character; Jeremy Renner's character was a continuation of the Bourne conspiracy. I Would watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it go!!","review":"I think the Bourne legacy is over. I think Jeremy Renner is a great actor. He was just put into a bad role. No fault of his, as he did his best. No one pulls off Bourne like Mr Damon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"I had such great hopes for this movie because I enjoyed all of the previous \\"Bourne\\" movies. But this is a STINKER! The entire movie is running and chasing without any development of the characters or plot. What a waste of time!!!! Too bad, because I like the actors, but they really should have had some control of the script. This is nothing more that cashing in on previous movies - too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but lacks Bourne style action","review":"The Bourne Legacy isn't a bad movie and it is worth watching but it lacks the typical Bourne action that made the first two excellent movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real sleeper","review":"This movie had misguided direction, no character development, and a very poor script. As one of most boring movies I have ever watched and movies so do not waste your time renting or buying.

It was actually very boring. It did not keep my insterest at all. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"chase scene too long","review":"As a big fan of the first three I was leary of no Damon. However I was immediatly of with the premise as I started getting into the movie. But the movie really dragged on for me, especially the final chase scene. It was way too long and boring and unecessary. Bottom line, the movie bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie!! Matt Damon Step Aside!!","review":"This deviation from Bourne Matt Damon) with Jeremy Renner playing as a more advanced operative and the new LARX operation is very mysterious and alluring. I really hope they continue along this story line. Jeremy Renner plays the part of Aaron Cross with style and finesse that Matt Damon doesn't have. I can't wait to see more of this great intriguing story. I would love to see Renner play Scott Ambler as well too if they ever get around to writing a screenplay to it.This is a bargain at the price it's being offered at as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Legacy","review":"Great movie, the whole group is great, this one falls right in line and is just as good as the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"really enjoyed latest in the bourne series, even with new main character...action packed, great story line. would recommend to older teens and adults"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action movie","review":"So glad I purchased this, such a great movie. I plan on buying it for my family member for Christmas"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the other Bourne films, don't buy this one","review":"Quite disapointed in this film. Just a remake of the other Bourne films with different actors. Glad I didn't waste my $$ at the movies. The motor bike chase scene was SO long I fast-forwarded through a lot of it and it was so unbelievable. Glad it was on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation","review":"This film is a poor imitation on the original Bourne series. Then again, I wasn't a fan of the second or third Bourne films either. The first film was a novel idea about a programed evil \\"superman\\" who discovers his powers and his goodness. The subsequent Bourne films have been just a repetition of the first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for Bourne","review":"This film, lacks the cerebral and intellectual content of the other Bourne films. It seems focused on car chases and explosions, without the substance. The premise is fantastic, but I would have liked to know more about the experiments and also more of the inside CIA operation. Edward Norton is good, and Jeremy does fine although he is no Jason Bourne.If I had known this was just another mindless action flick, I would not have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie was boring and slow. We feel asleep several times and do not recommend this movie to anyone to rent or buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne -- the Fugative!","review":"This was a pure waste of talent. Bourne always had a personality and a mission. In this endless run, chase and never solve anything outing, it plays like an episode from the old TV series 'The Fugative', except Bourne doesn't solve any real problems for anyone else either. It's sad to spend so much time and money making a film that has no heart, no soul, no satisfactory ending.I wish Hollywood would wake up. Characters make even a poor plot interesting, while special effects, explosions and chase scenes do nothing but make the audience wish the show would end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action","review":"I don't like violence so I can't give it 5 stars, but this movie was interesting, entertaining and action filled"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others ...","review":"Matt Damon got out of the series because he was too old. The producers made the mistake of not having the lead roles go to younger actors. Rachel Weisz (42) is not athletic enough and Jerry Renner (41) is not a good enough actor. In the other movies the best scenes are the fight scenes, in this film there are hardly any. The chase scene at the end is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremy renner","review":"Good actor....when an actor can make his craft appear natural-convincingly accurate they get my vote...Of course you know a sequel is down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not as good as the others.

Worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring Legacy","review":"I saw all three previous Bournes and this one was disappointing. I expected more action and the chase scene was too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not quite up to the first 3","review":"I enjoyed The Bourne Legacy. It was engaging and entertaining. However, it wasn't as good as the first 3 Bourne movies - I missed seeing Matt Damon in the lead. It was a good movie and the future ones might sharpen up to the level of the first three, it just seemed as though Jeremy Renner was just not quite there yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick!","review":"It typifies government at it's worse which is what I believe it to be today. The good guy came in first this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"4��5��","review":"not as good as the first 3 Bourne movies. seems to be more a side story than a sequel. also in my opinion, the chase scene at climax was a bit too long and it did not seem as exciting as other chase scenes. this is similar to the Tokyo Drift movie of the Fast and the Furious franchise, good movie, but not as good as the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad coda to a strong trilogy","review":"The Bourne creators had a strong trilogy. It wasn't Lord of the Rings, but they had crafted a nicely-woven narrative that finishes the way it begins. Why not exit the stage and leave it alone? Money.First off, the storyline makes no sense. And once you've thought carefully about the plot, you're left wondering why you should care at all. After watching this movie twice, I still can't figure that out.I don't want to spoil it for anyone considering buying the movie -- but it is a sexed-up story of someone trying to get their medication. With satellites, drones and assassins mixed in.If this movie is playing on an airplane, sure, watch it. If the neighborhood mega-store is handing out free copies, sure, take it. (And regift to someone who doesn't mind illogical action.) But don't spend money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Bourne","review":"I like this guy better than Damon in this series; a more gritty character fits better.

I actually stopped watching it 30 minutes into the movie. I was expecting a movie equally exciting as the previous Bourne series.

Had to counteract with a counterattack. I adore the first 2 Bourne Movies in this series, the 2nd being my favorite (it had feeling, vision, and purpose) , the third feeling a little too handheld even for me, but it ends very well.. \\"Bourne Legacy\\" is muddled and so far afield from what was introduced in the original movies that it's indecipherable. Had they not transplanted Jason Bournes picture in this I would have never even guessed this was the same series.. different colored pills/medications/dosages? Where did this come from? The movie moves at a snails pace, and although I've liked Renners' performance in everything up until now, particularly \\"The Town\\" I have got to steer as many people away from this mess as humanly possible.. not the worst movie ever but one of the worst sequels in recent memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"The title for this review says it all - Boring and predictable.

Something about how he commands the screen that Jeremy Renner hasn't quite figured out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting continuation of the Bourne saga","review":"I almost think I like Jeremy Renner's character better than Jason Bourne. Aaron Cross seems to know what he's doing and why, so we don't have always the undercurrent of searching for his true identity. The action scenes and chase scenes in this one are exciting. All in all, it's a good addition to the \\"Bourne saga\\".

Looking foreward for next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the new Bourne!","review":"I love this one with Jeremy Renner playing the new Bourne, even though he's playing an entirely new character. I never like Matt Damon portraying Jason Bourne, who just lacks the muscle and determination that the character is supposed to convey to the audience. He is witty, I'll give him that, but not quite the Bourne I picture should be. The new one played by Jeremy Renner is, on the other hand, strong, muscular, and willful. The movie is action packed with intelligence intertwined, totally enjoyable watching compared to the previous Bourne series. Rachael Weisz is a great addition to the movie too. Her intense chemistry with the new Bourne is undeniable which adds more softness to the otherwise hard core Bourne movie. All in all I like the new combination of characters and brilliant portrays by the actors. I will definitely collect the DVD when it's available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your $$$","review":"This movie is one of most boring movies I have ever watched. I am a huge fan of all the Bourne Books and movies except this one. Do not waste your time renting or buying - if you must watch it - wait till it gets to redbox for only a $1.

We'll just have to see how it is reviewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the Bourne lineup","review":"Great escapism with a very real center theme. This movie doesn't have a Bourne in it, although the movie does have some references to Jason that tie back to the previous Bourne film.Whereas the CIA bent Jason to it's purposes with brainwashing, Agent Cross is a product of genetic engineering/experimentation by a civilian government contractor with too much freedom and not enough oversight.Great action scenes, cliff-hanger suspense and a plot real enough to make you believe in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action in the Bourne tradtion with surprising in depth characters","review":"Excellent and detailed preparation for the next one to come.

The characters are one dimensional and not very likeable. Everyone is perfect at what he/she does. I could not believe for one second that all these events could have taken place in such a short period of time. There was nothing credible in this book, at all. Deaver (or more likely, his assistants) did some great research for this novel, but that's the only compliment I can give him. The writing style is trite and without any originality or lyricism.

I forgot the first one I started, but that should be no surprise. I didn't finish that one either!This plot is so far-fetched, so convoluted, so full of cardboard characters that I gave up on it after 175 pages. Too bad. It started out promising, a nice twist on tracking down a killer(s): He/she always had magic incorporated into the scheme. But this story just went on far too long (keep in mind, I didn't even finish it) and got so unconvincing and outrageous that I had to move on. So many books, so little time. I think my Deaver days are over.

A treat for all mystery lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding as usual","review":"Dever never fails to keep the reader entertained. I did not think that he could develops a plot that would out do The Bone Collector. I could not put this book down. There were times that I needed to take an emotional break though. .before I move on to my next Lincoln Rhymes book I will have to take a mental break with something easy like Dracula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penn and Killer?","review":"Misdirection is a fundamental part of all of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme stories. Through forensic wizardry Rhyme and Sachs brilliantly zero in on the right line of investigation, pursue it, then inevitably get hit with a plot twist from left field. So to build an entire story around a homicidal illusionist whose talents of misdirection are a central theme of the story kind of puts Deaver's plotting techniques out in the open for the reader to see. It also enables him to weave a more complex web of head fakes and suspense filled surprises.Though the acts of the Conjurer, his escapes, characters who come back from the dead and things you think happened that didn't are all totally outrageous, Rhyme is up against a criminal from whom we would expect no less. The combination makes \\"The Vanished Man\\" work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and not so magical a storyline","review":"I really do like Lincoln Rhyme stories by Jeffery Deaver. This one just went on too long and was hard to get into. Magic was at the heart of the storyline and sometimes descriptions were vivid and sometimes just clouded by confusion. I never really got into the story, I didn't care for the main character and then find that he wasn't the pivotal villain after all. I can't put my finger on why I didn't care for this novel, but, I know something isn't right when I don't want to add the book to my collection. I cherish books I have read, and even if I don't re-read them, I know that I can. This book will go to Goodwill and I hope the next book I read will get me back on the Lincoln Rhyme track of enthusiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is an illusion itself","review":"The only point that I felt discontented with this roller-coaster story is a bit of kindness Rhyme showed to Kara after the mystery-solving climax. Is the scene produced from the sake of thorough happiness of every member belonging to Rhyme's team? That's as may be, but this kind of humanism seems a bit different from what the cool criminalist is likely to indicate. This complaint is, however, as a result of very lively description of the characters. Therefore, we readers anyway have to admit the compelling skill of Jeffery Deaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one.","review":"Jeffrey Deaver has a special style of writing and it comes through again in this book. Great story and I love Lincoln and Amelia. It had some twists and turns that made you really not be sure of \\"who done it\\". And once again I learned something new.Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I tried to figure out the twists in this book before they happened, but as usual, I couldn't and neither will you.","review":"No spoilersAs usual with Deaver's novels (especially the Rhyme series), I could not figure out or anticipate the plot twists he was about to spring on me, even though I tried to look for them. Although I'm one of the readers who considers Bone Collector the best of the series up to this point, all of the others haven't been too far behind that, and this one isn't either. The Vanished Man centers on an antagonist who uses magic and illusions to commit murders and then escape from those pursuing him. If you've like any of the previous Rhyme books then this one won't be different and you'll tear it up in no time, just like the rest of the books. This book is so different in terms of main subject than the previous books, yet it is similar in that it'll keep you glued to it. It's another solid Rhyme addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanciful but fun","review":"The last book I read was State of Fear by Michael Crichton and while that book was ok, I ended it feeling the need for a guaranteed good read.Enter Jeffrey Deaver........I enjoyed this read far more than the Crichton book as Deaver has the ability to tell a story at a fast pace.While the premise of the story is entertaining but preposterous (the Conjuror was just too good for too long), it made for a good read.Don't read Deaver if you think you are going to get some hard-boiled crime like Walter Mosley or George Pelecanos, it doesn't have the descriptions of the surroundings like James Lee Burke but what Deaver is good at is telling a story that keeps one entertained.Just leave your thrist for realism at the door and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever Thriller","review":"Rhyme and Sachs are on the trail of \\"the conjurer\\", a master magician exceedingly deft at illusion and misdirection. The conjurer is killing people, seemingly at random, but it soon becomes apparent he has a plan. The magic and forensics makes for an unbeatable combination in this story. I was frequently tempted to peek ahead a few pages to learn the resolution of some of the situations. I didn't, however, care for the evidence charts included at intervals. They were redundant and the print was too small for me to read comfortably. I found I could skip these charts and follow the story just fine. This was a very clever thriller with a clever plot and several clever characters. I especially liked the addition of Kara, a young, student magician who contributes helpful information to Rhyme and Sachs' investigation. Nothing in this story is what it seems and the ending is filled with spectacular twists and turns. A very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deaver loses plot","review":"I'm with the other reviewer who gave this two stars. In Stone Monkey the 'surprise' bad guy was all too obvious because you know that's what Deaver does, but with the Vanished Man Deaver really starts to unravel. For me the story has to be crdible, and far too many scenes in this novel had me shaking my head in disbelief. He still writes in an enjoyable way, and his characters are still a little flat, but this had none of the tension of the Bone Collector and all the signs of someone who really is trying to be far too clever for his own - or his readers' - good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just do it","review":"I can't respect a novel as contrived as this one. The killer wants to kill someone from his past. Instead of just doing it, which would have been a total surprise, he kills other people, thereby garnering the attention of the only people who could prevent him from attaining his objective. Spare me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery~~~","review":"this is the first Jeffery Deaver novel I read, and I thing I will read more of his books.

A murder of an art student sets the two detectives on the course to find the murderer. the supposed illusionist, the killer is using the old magic tricks and escapes to kill and escape from the scenes. aided by an amateur illusionist, rhyme and sachs have to find out the true intentions of the killer's acts before it's too late.I'm not going to reveal too much, but I will tell you one thing.

I don't know if this one would, but this version is, simply put, awful.This is a terrific reading of an awful abridging of a book. I had to borrow (not wanting to throw good money after bad) the novel to find out how poorly this version was cut. Important plot details and character development seem to have been randomly eliminated, and the work as a whole suffers for it. Seemingly unrelated events pop up unexpectedly in what seems an amateurish manner. Deaver's writing deserves far better.I thought the reader, though, was great. He gave a good performance of what was in effect a horrible script. If the unabridged version is ever released on audio, try it, but don't waste money on this version. An editor somewhere at Simon & Schuster needs a new career. The person who OK'd the abridging needs to work in a different industry.Don't get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mystery Ever Written","review":"Jeffery Deaver has really outdone himself this time. Having read all the books in the Lincoln Rhyme series, I was already immediately tuned into both Sachs and Rhyme, and the introduction of Kara as a major character was really wonderful. I found myself really close to her as I read.The plot itself if brilliant, and the research put into the book is quite evident. I love how you learn when you read his books, and with the theme in this one being magic, I thought It was absolutely amazing. The way he could change the plot at any given moment without making it seem choppy or broken up also enthralled me.The fact that the book was written on a time deadline also made it exciting for me, and while it's slightly boggling how things could happen in a short period of time as it was, Deaver did enough explaining of the techniques to make it credible.I wait anxiously for the next Lincoln Rhyme mystery, keep them coming, I say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"When starting this book it grabbed me from the first couple of pages. I was aware of the Lincoln Rhyme books since i saw the move version of the Bone Collector starring Denzel Washington. This book had a creative twist to the forensic thriller series. The Killer uses magic and illusion to commit the crimes. The book contained a lot of information on how magic and illusion is done and also the history of magic. It had so many twists and turns throughout the whole book, I kept being suprised by what happened next. Amelia Sachs was in this book a lot. There were also some good peripheral characters like the young girl illusionist to help them out with the investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best book ever","review":"This was Deaver's best book ever---lots of twists. Great characterizations--even Lincoln Rhyme had more personality in this book. The illusions were great, especially the last one which I won't describe because it would spoil the fun. Never did I have a chance of predicting the ending. Good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaver Returns to Original Form","review":"I have read most of Deaver's books and this one is reminiscent of his first two blockbusters in the Lincoln Rhyme series, Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer.

This time the heinous killer is an illusionist nicknamed the Conjurer as he lives out famous magic acts to kill his victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"I'm sorry this book didn't appeal to me. I was turned off by all the magic laden plot twists which for me were too unrealistic, even if this guy is a pro illusionist. I guess if you can believe somebody doing the cartoon style magic tricks he does, then it goes by better for you.I also didn't care for the lead character Lincoln Rhyme and his whole troop of police friends. This was my first book by Deaver, and more than likely my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted","review":"\\"The Vanished Man,\\" another of Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme mysteries, has more twists, turns and dead ends than a cornfield-maze. \\"The Vanished Man\\" will give readers a well-written trip through the house of mirrors via lessons in all forms of slight-of-hand and other magic.

I found this novel to be extremely boring. Yes, there's much research into forensics and the magic business, but the author tends to talk down to the reader, which I find annoying. One example would be the over explaining of the classic illusion \\"Sawing A Woman In Half.\\" Is there really anyone out there who doesn't know the basic theme of this well-known magic effect?In what is otherwise very stiff text, Deaver attempts to make the characters sound more natural by throwing in way too many contractions (\\"or is\\" becoming \\"or's\\") from every character. Contrived and distracting.Ridiculous turns of events and cardboard characters who all sound alike seem to be par for the course these days, but beyond that I just couldn't find anything of interest here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed it","review":"I've never heard of this author until I read about him in Canyon News, the article in Star gazing.

I would mess around with the belt and transmitter over and over to make it work - and it would sometimes for about 5 minutes - then back to crazy readings. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, replaced a 10 week old battery - same results. So I bought another transmitter here on Amazon only to have it do exactly the same thing after only 2 weeks. The product is bad because of the transmitter and you cannot use the older models with it so I am back to using my Polar F6 which has been bulletproof (and costs 1/4th as much).

But after I was up all night reading it, I found that it covered an unexpectedly wide range of themes: relationships, love, dance, art, war, being in a foreign country, and anorexia (to name a few!) Specifically, this book gives probably the most lyrical and complex description of the experience of anorexia that I've ever read. The passages about Liza's body and dance training are haunting. Although there is no explicit sex in the book, it is deeply erotic. People who like the films of David Lynch will love this book -- it has that same dreamlike quality.

It is a story about an old acquaintence named Conrad Moricand that and needs a place to stay. Miller sets him up in an attic/loft at the Big Sur residence and gives Moricand the utmost hospitality at his disposal. Over the course of time, Moricand offends every member of the household to the point where miller regrets ever letting him into his house.

I think this was a counterpoint to the rest -- the darkest shade in the chiaroscuro masterwork Miller created with Big Sur. This darkness was different indeed. It was chilling then, and left Conrad Moricand a ghostprint burned into memory like a shadow burned into a Hiroshima sidewalk.Now that I have a little girl who is a toddler, the story of A Devil in Paradise is exponentially more gripping, chilling, and unforgettable.Henry Miller's mastery at telling a tale and keeping you entertained and interested to the very last word is displayed here perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"1)It doesn't support US Time zone.2) It doesn't work at the maximum network speed of 100 mbps.

I've always purchased the hardcases for my Palm Pilots,but this one is such a pain to use.

It would have been much better if this were designed like the flip top hardcases of the lesser Palms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protected at first but now won't stay closed","review":"This case provided good if inconvenient protection - at first. You had to take the Palm out of the case to synch or charge it, both occasions when I'm likely to drop the device and so especially need it in the case. But it was sturdy, slim, and fairly light weight.Then, after using it for about six weeks, it quit latching shut. No amount of fooling around with it will get it to stay closed. I recommend against this case and suggest you purchase one with a more secure closing mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tungsten E hard case, OK ,but not what it could be","review":"Got the case even after the other reviews about access to sync cable, exp card, and on-off switch. These are easy to work around. The two concerns I had are.1) Loose fit, PDA can bounce around inside of case. Added foam tape, along top and bottom,inside cover to give it slightly snug fit.2) My hinge pin broke, and it's only 1-1/2 weeks old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The Palm will rattle within the case even when properly placed. Also, there is no ready access to the on/off button, stylus, synch port or charger when the Palm Tungsten is in the \\"normal\\" position in the case. If this wasn't bad enough, the case is difficult to open. Palm should go back to the design studio and get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen Cracks if you Push On Case!","review":"I bought this case because I take my Palm with me everywhere and I thought the hard case would keep it safe. Unfortunately the hard case CAUSED my screen to crack!Here is why: On the inside, opposite the screen, are brackets for keeping extra memory cards. They stick out higher than the rest, so if you push on the case from the outside, they go right into the screen and crack it! It doesn't take much presure either.Palm does not consider this to be a design defect and won't pay to fix the damaged screen. If you buy this case, be very carefull not to let anything ever push against it. Actually, you may want to consider a protective case for the protective case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big and Bulky","review":"I was surprised when I recieved this case as it was bigger than I expected, also much thicker than it looks in the pic.

That's it; everything else sucks. The palm rattles when it is inside (i.e. it does not fit snugly). You cannot reach the power button or get the stylus without having to lift the palm out of the case. The photo of the case that shows in amazon and everywhere else suggests that the case has an opening in the top right corner for easy access to the stylus, but this is not true, at least not here. Basically, I wish they made a case like the old palm hard case for the palm Vx...just a simple hard case that opens easily, protects the palm, allows for easy access to the thing and all the needed buttons, and, most importantly, does not add bulk. Until some intelligent designer gets this done, this case is good enough to protect my palm while it jumps around in my briefcas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tungsten E2 Case","review":"The item I received did not have the features that were advertised on Amazon.

You can't listen to music without the earphones because it covers the speaker, but overall, I will keep using it for the protection it gives while keeping it in my purse.

It's sturdy and sleek, a little bigger than other cases, but I was willing to make that trade for protection. But after just four months, the clasp broke and now the case pops open inside my purse, subjecting my Palm to the ravages of keys, combs and various whatnot. This is not good.

The problems I have with the case are:1. The palm does not fit snuggly inside the case and tends to rattle around. I had to glue a piece of foam inside the front cover to stop the rattle.2. You cannot get the stylist out, even when the case it open. The edge of the back cover blocks you access to the stylist, so that you must balance the palm between the front and back to retrieve the stylist. Very, very annoying.3. The case muffles alarms so that they cannot be heard. I've just missed another appointment, so I'm going out tonight and buying a new case with slots for the speaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, I'm very impressed","review":"I wanted something tough, durable, and small, this thing fits the bill. It IS in fact aluminum, to be specific, the outside is anodized aluminum, the inside is plastic. Yes, the power button and stylus are hard to get to if you find it difficult to lift the 5oz palm about an eighth of an inch. I do think it could be a little easier to open, the first dozen or so times I had some difficulties, but I got used to it really easily. It is small and compact, offerring little extra space save for the clips built in for 2 expansion cards, but small is what I wanted, this thing adds very little to the size while at the same time protecting it better than any soft case could."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"everything associated with this case sucks. wish this was like the hard case for my old palm Vits a pain to turn on the palm while its in the case. you have to use two hands to do anything - turn it on, use the stylus, etc. the hinge (which was designed for flexibility) is so loose that handling the case is like negotiating a wet magazine. the case is really bulky and is most certainly not aluminum (try cheap plastic). the palm rattles around inside the case. there is a latch that (again) requires two hands to open and is much more secure than necessary. a simple springloaded hinge would have been perfect.anyone want to go into business desiging a new one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard cover for Plam Tungsten E","review":"Two hard to hold and try to do anything I am going to look for a leather one soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I am very pleased with this purchase.

I have not dropped it, so I'm not sure why it broke (another reader suggested that dropping it might be the cause).I love this case, but I'm not going to buy another one to replace it -- too expensive to replace every 4 months.

It's impossible to listen to music while your PDA is in it. I strongly recommend InnoPocket or Rhinoskin cases for Tungsten E instead of this thing.Mine didn't come with a foam and yes it rattles inside the case. It's not an issue for me, though.The lock is very weak and I believe it will open if it falls down. If you want real protection, Palm Tough case is much better than this one, but it's bulky and not fancy.I got it for free bundled with a Tungsten E.

It was not any easier in 1997 when this book was published -- it was more difficult because the technology was still young and far less stable, and because learners were not nearly as comfortable in the environment!I feel that in his push to get his book to market early in the game, he sacrificed content and ideas for (what was then quite forward-thinking) technology.You can learn something here, but watch your step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for teachers on effective use of the web","review":"I found Brooks' account of the instructional use of the web as practical and thought provoking.

I don't think an American parent or teacher would want any kid younger than 13 or 14 to read it. You can find cheaper copies on Alibris--check it out. To be on the safe side get an Australian or UK edition of the book because book 2 (Lockie Leonard, Scumbuster) was severely edited to change the Australian slang for the American reader. Big mistake. Not sure about this one because I only have the Australian edition. The Aussie slang isn't that hard to figure out and it's a lot of the fun of reading the book. Highly recommended. If you're a fan of Tim Winton's books for adults, don't dismiss this one--it's every bit as good as his writing for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try tracfone instead !!!","review":"Tracfone gives better deals in minutes.It is perfect for those with light, in town usage.

The airtime doesn't cost a fortune, and you have no credit checks, or monthly bills. Reception is good because they utilize many different providers instead of just one. They also have a referral program, so you can earn 100 extra minutes for free if your friends and family buy one too(they also get 180 minutes).

The boat looks good and for the money you think your really getting a nice boat, but after the few times that I sailed her she started to become unresponsive to the Tx, and a sloshing sound was coming from inside. This wouldn't be a problem on a more expensive boat but this boat has no access to the internal electronics making replacement of parts and drainage impossible.

The plot is silly as well, these four drunk teens run over some guy after a 4th of July blowout.

I thought one negavtive about this book was the fact of the killer was killing people with a hook. A hook on his hand! It isn't believable. Another negative, is that they came out with a sequal. I think that is stupid. There are many postive aspects, one is that it is very suspensful and scary. It will kept your full attion for and hour and 45 mintues. Another postive is that Freddie and Ryan are in the movie! This movie is for only people who love to be scared! It deffinatlly isnt for people who get scared easily.

My only problem is that for a horror flick the body count is too low. And to tell the truth the film really has no suspense. The filmakers trick us into beliving that Sarah Michelle Geller would pull a \\"Buffy\\" and make it through this movie to see a sequel, her final scene is probably the longest chase scene for a character in a horror flick that does not live. Usually when there is a prolonged chase scene in a horror flick it's towards the end of the movie and the person being chased ends up surviving.But the only survivors here are Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt who live to star in this films horrible sequel \\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.\\" A film that wasn't scribed by this movie's scribe Kevin Williamson."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"This movie was ok i only watched it to see if it was going to be like the book and because freddie prinze jr was in it.To be honest i screamed more when i babysat one morning during the summer and the kid wanted to watch teletubbies.Trust me if your not big on getting scared then watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a stand alone its ok, but...","review":"when you compare it to the book, this is a stinker.Don't get me wrong, if you want a decently good teen horror flick, this will definitely fit that, but if it is supposed to be based off the book, it falls flat.

I would recomend it for older teens because of the language. They used th F word many times. It was intense. There was no very gorey scenes, just the blood. All in all it was an awesome movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"best acting duo since lemmon and mathau","review":"There is actually a very entertaining performance given by Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage in this film, which steals the show totally away from Sarah Michelle Gellar's thighs, Ryan Phillippe's sensitivity, and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s hunkiness. The at times comically over-the-top pair of actors do a massive work-out throughout the film, being that they have to keep the audience from ever realizing how dull and unoriginal the movie is. The cleavage twosome do their job very well at times, although I think they've done better in lighter films like Heartbreakers. Still, their performance is proof that if you can distract the audience, they will walk away believing they actually saw a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know... this movie STINKS","review":"Oh man.

Many people say that slashers just aren't up to par anymore, and I agree. I believe that it's mainly because Hollywood decided to start casting celebrity heartthrob 'beautiful people' as the stars.Horror slashers used to cast no name actors/actresses and it gave you a gave you a sense of reality -- that it could be any Joe or Jane Doe being stalked by the killer.You never heard of these people before, and for the most part, never heard from them again.It takes the believability potential out of a slasher film when you see celebrities getting stalked.As for \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" I had high hopes for it and really tried to enjoy it, but it really wasn't that thrilling for me.

This movie wasn't even scary, I can't say that I even flinched. As I said in the title it was more of a comedy then it was a horror, that would be of course because that it was so bad that it was funny. And let's not forget the acting, It was just awful.

None of this cop out editing and close-ups on an axe dripping blood. we want to SEE the axe going into Jennifer Love Hewitt's head, we want to SEE the giant hook gouge out Brandy's eyes (in I still know....). The director of this movie was obviously more concerned about worrying if Sarah Michelle Gellar's pants were on tight enough.

Sure, some of the cheesier horror classics aren't really concerned with the intricacy of the plot either, but at least Friday the 13th and Halloween are made with some effort to be memorable and charming in their own way.

It appalled me then, but after seeing Trojan War, another of Jennifer Love Hewitt's movies in which her acting was superb, I decided to see it again. And, I'm sorry to say, the movie is still terrible. The acting is atrocious, the scenario unbelievable- the 'Fisherman' must be superhuman to remove all those crabs and the dead body in a matter of minutes, and to sneak into a house and hide in a closet all night.It's cheap, nasty and utterly unconvincing. If it wasn't for the excessive gore, there would be no audience for it. And, now, it seems I'm to be punished for ever going to see it with the release of 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'.

The ending only has one scene that gets you, so this movie wasn't well done. I am only being honest. It is not as suspenseful as the movies Scream, Scream 2, any Alfred Hitchcock movies, or its sequel. I also believe that the language and sexual content in this movie is also inapropriate for the young viewers who enjoy these movies. Many of my friends and I enjoy the Alfred Hitchcock movies, which display no bad language, and nothing but maybe a kiss. I also believe that it is more fun to be involved in movies, like Alfred Hitchcock's movies \\"Rear Window\\" or \\"North by Northwest\\" in which you get to try to solve the mysteries along with the characters.

First off, it was totally blatant that the film tried to live up to Scream\`s quality, but it fails miserably. 2 out of the 4 lead actors can\`t act (It\`s pretty obvious who), and the plot is pretty vapid and stupid. In fact, the plot is an example of what \\"Scream\\" jeered at. \\"IKWYDLS\\" has the basic running through the woods, killer with hook, unexpected jumps, \\"open the door!\\" substance that gets tiring, FAST.

I guess they could have cut the start shorter, but that doesn't matter.This is the best stalk 'n' slash horror I have seen, and apparently it's a lot better than Scream. It isn't too scary, but it's a very suspenseful thriller.The basic plot is as follows: A group of teenagers accidentaly run somebody down whilst celebrating on the 4th of July. They decide to dump the body in the river. Following this, a number of strange letters etc. are recieved, and a compelling story unfolds. However, the gang have a price to pay for finding out about what really happened that night.So, if I had to put my review into 30 words or less, I would put: Rent or buy this instead of the new PSYCHO.

The comedy is not funny, the suspense could be a little more suspenseful, and the actors should take much, much more acting lessons. Jennifer Love Hewitt is only a busty air-head with good looking friends who don't know a thing about covering up a murder (or so it seems). They just scream and run around instead of taking proper action in the first place. J Love H s*cks in this movie, although I must say Sarah Michelle Gellar is a good actress who should continue with the good work she has been doing. Jennifer on the other hand, needs some help, because she thinks she's a good actress. Please, Jennifer, try a little harder, and people will want to watch your movies and TV show because of your acting, and not because of your body.

A definate 2 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most original and fun movies I've ever watched!","review":"I got to see this at the Toronto Film Festival, and the writer/director Matthew Blight introduced the film, and he said that the film was basically about girls and his obsession with them. After watching it, it's quite evident that this is true. Anyways, all I have to say is that I really loved this movie. It had so much energy and was just really enjoyable to watch. I haven't got the dvd yet, but I hope it's the exact same cut I saw at the film festival. In my opinion this had way more energy than the first Freeway, (which I felt was kind of boring, and honestly didn't like that much), and you have to love Vincent Galo in this. Classic! This was easily the best film I saw at the film festival, and my girlfriend thought so too. So I recommend it to those who like something fun and different, and I know it's not for everyone, but give it a chance. Also, if you bought the dvd and didn't like, feel free to send it my way. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freeway 2 is similar to Freeway","review":"On some of the reviews I have read on Freeway 2, some of the people do not see the connection with the first movie Freeway. I have seen both movies and like them both. Freeway is a modern and twisted version of the Little Red Riding Hood story. Freeway 2 is a very twisted version of the Hansel and Gretel story. That is the connection and why they both carry the same name even though the sequel doesn't have the same characters and a plot involving a freeway. I can't wait to see if there are more of the sequel upcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker and stranger than the original...another classic","review":"FREEWAY 2 is a name-only sequel to the 1996 cult hit starring Reese Witherspoon, but managed to live up to my high expectations anyway. Have no fear, it was written and directed by the same guy who did the first one, Matthew Bright. Its actual title is CONFESSIONS OF A TRICKBABY, probably referring to the first film's Vanessa character's statement of, \\"I ain't no trick baby\\" (rather than the Iceberg Slim book TRICK BABY), and stars Natasha Lyonne of SLUMS OF BEVERY HILLS as yet another juvenile delinquent on the run. This film is a lot darker and weirder than the original, and pushes the envelope of good taste even further. Now if that's not a reason to get this right away...I don't know what is."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"freeway 2 definitely didn't live up to my high expectations after seeing the brilliant original freeway. It's alot darker, and alot pervier than the first, substituting disturbing visuals for witty dialogue. Natasha Lyonne is all right, although i definitely don't think this was her greatest effort ever. Vincent Gallo was very effective as sister gomez - horrifying. One of the many problems i had with this movie is (and maybe i'm being way too literal)that bot of the girls thought sister gomez was really a she! couldn't they see the five o'clock shadow? i saw this movie last night, and i fell asleep at 5.30 this morning, still thinking about her (or, rather, him.) don't get this film unless you are prepared to sleep with the light on for a loooong time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the Lettermen, but NOT this CD!","review":"I own this CD, and never listen to it.

While television pulls on all emotions and provides little information, the power of books are the facts, and power of the book is what Moore uses to make those facts clear.

When we criticize Iraq for using CS gas or the use of British helicopters in Northern Ireland, or tanks in Tianamen Square, we should know our government used the same equipment in Waco, Texas against a Church of children. Powerful book which will make you mad at how your tax dollars are spent by Federal agencies such as the ATF and FBI. The use of helicopters was made possible by the war on drugs which Moore proves, causing an American, such as myself to wonder, has the war on drugs gone too far? And what about guns?

Forty-two years of absence, and four short months of reconciliation - the author brings this vividly alive, not in a depressing way: this is a book that makes you proud to be human, a book to lift your spirits, not to dampen them.

Is this guy ever going to come out with an Oracle8 book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst attempt at a technical review guide ever seen.","review":"I don't wish to simply bash Mr. Ault's book, but this certification \\"aid\\" is by far the most poorly organized and least thought out book I have ever come across. There is no clear breakdown of review material for the PL/SQL and DBA tests. The topics covered regarding PL/SQL are not explained other than a definition and parameter listing that one could easily find verbatim on the Oracle Documentation Library CD. The sample test enclosed covering PL/SQL is not at all like the sample test downloadable from the Oracle website. (One has to believe that Oracle has a better idea of what the test is like than Mr. Ault). I urge you not to waste your money as I did, this book will be off no use in your preparation. The Oracle Press Exam Guide will prove much more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not enough","review":"It has taken this author two books to cover OCP DBA exams and he still hasn't covered Oracle8.

I even pre-ordered this book and find myself believing I wasted my money! I have 2 specific issues with this book: 1) The organization of material is not presented in the order of the tests. 2) There are gross errors in the sample test questions. Examples: Pg 362 Question 1, the answer key states 'B' while the explanation states 'A'. Pg 303 Question 42, the procedure references variables 'v_proper_ratio' and 'v_found', while the question references 'v_proper_line' and 'v_approval'. Pg 40 Question 3, 'b' is the correct answer (LGWR), but the choice is typed as 'GWR'. Pg 43 Question 8, states 'Which shutdown mode will require instance at the next startup?'. Obviously, the word 'recovery' is missing. On and on...basically if there are this many gross editing errors, can the rest of the information be accepted as correct?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware !!!","review":"I bought mine from 'Surpluscomputerbooks'.

There were several errors or vaguely worded questions that wouldn't make it past a beta exam. The chapters are pretty much photo copies of the oracle documentation with one main difference -- there are VERY FEW examples. Do not waste your money on this or any other exam cram books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book suffers from mistakes and bad organization","review":"This is NOT a good book, and seems to have been rushed to press. First of all, it contains some serious typographical and editing errors, which unfortunately mar several sample questions. Second, it is badly organized. The material for Exams 1 and 2 are intermingled together, making it difficult to know from reading the book what you need to know for Exam 1 versus Exam 2. Exam 2 material is given short shrift and is basically inadequate. Far too much of the book is just diagrams of SQL commands with a few comments about the clauses: you might as well just read the manuals. The best part of this book is the sample tests, which sometimes force you to think about the material more deeply. Too bad there are mistakes in these tests. It cost a lot more, but I would get the Oracle Certified Professional DBA Certification Exam Guide by Jason S. Couchman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cover all of the material it advertises to","review":"Sorry - but it is not as advertised folks. I just received the book today and was very disappointed to discover that the book only covers HALF of the information required to pass the OCP DBA exam. It is advertised to cover all material but in fact only addresses that required to pass TEST1 and TEST2 of the 4 part OCP certification exam series. It does not cover the Backup and Recovery or Performance Tuning components - look like someone missed a publishing deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only . . .","review":"The music selection and the performances in this production are simply outstanding--definitely up to expectations if you have looked at their previous release (\\"Three Mo' Tenors\\").

This DVD has different songs than the first, and the songs are fun, but they all seem too focused on tonal gymnastics and \\"in your face harmonies\\" rather than focusing on the story being told in each song. Cook, Dixon & Young also don't seem to connect with the audience quite as phenomenally as they did in their previous show. Also, for reasons beyond explanation, the costumer put them in black clothing with a black stage background through almost the entire show, so you just see little bits of color coming out at their collars and cuffs...not fun to watch.

The next day, it stopped reading the heart rate all together no matter what I tried. It now seems to be stuck in one mode, simply recording time. I can reset it and I can use it as a watch but that's it.After reading all of the other reviews here, I'm not sure it's worth the time to try and get it repaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but would like to transfer data","review":"I have been using this product for several years. It is my first heart rate monitor and I like the use of seeing how much i'm pushing myself with the heart rate measurement and especially the estimated calories burned. This def gives me more motivation. The heart rate monitor will be picked up on the machines at the gym also displaying it there. Some ones that are probably are broken end up interfering and giving screwy numbers for the watch. The one thing that I thought it had when I bought it was the uplink feature. But that is only to transfer data to the watch not to get my workout data off the watch and onto my PC which would be helpful in tracking progress. Why write it down manually? Still good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable enough","review":"This watch worked great for about 6 months. Then the buttons on the sides fell off.

Now I can't get it to pick up a heart rate, and if it does, it isn't even close to correct. I have tried all of the trouble shooting techniques, and nothing has worked. I will be sending this back to my great disappointment. I will probably buy a different one, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use it with Sun Tan Lotion","review":"I got this F4 as a Christmas present in 2008. Two weeks later the buttons cracked and fell off. Polar sent me new buttons, and two weeks later the buttons cracked again. I sent the unit to polar two more times and the buttons only lasted 2 weeks each time.I called their service department and escallated the issue. I spoke to Albert, who said that sun tan lotion damages the buttons so they break. He suggested either not using sun tan lotion or wearing a wrist band under the watch. GIVE ME A BREAK!!! I live in San Diego and I wear sun tan lotion 360 days per year. Polar said their new units do not have that problem, but they would not replace my F4 with a good one.I will never buy another Polar product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Calculates the calories burned for every activity - gives best assessment! beeps if you are below the necessary heart rate.

While running it will start out giving an accurate reading, then start jumping around, giving me an impossibly high (151 at a slow jog) or low reading (71 while running uphill) or it will jump from an extremely low to an extremely high heart rate (51 to 160) in a second, a virtually impossible reading. It's maddening. For some reason, I do not have this problem while working out indoors at the gym. Only when running outside. It's too bad because it's easy to use. But what's the point of a heart rate monitor that reads everything but your heart rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I am very satisfied with this purchase. The only reason im not giving it five stars is because it doesnt have a stop watch or a pedometer. I have a small wrist, and the watch face is a good size especially if you dont like a bulky look. It is comfortable and the band stays put. It is easy to operate, and set up. you can easily turn the sound on or off. The strap is probably the same as all others and occasionally when i switch from doing cardio to weight training the clasp will pop apart, but that only happens occassionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good product, but you might do better.","review":"I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor. They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape. After you've purchased one or two of them, you become a better shopper. I purchased an F-4 for a friend, and I was very, very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out. Some of the newer heart monitors - Nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"F4 is the perfect size and the perfect monitor","review":"I am very impressed with the F4. It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. It is easier to program than my F6, and it fits better.Polar makes the best HR monitors, and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded, and even with ones that are not from them. I have Vision Fitness exercise equipment, and the strap works with their HR function. Sometimes I strap the watch to the equipment so I can read while I exercise, and I'm able to continually see the HR without constantly changing the view on the equipment.The color is more of a gray color than an ice blue, so it goes with just about anything you wear. I'm really looking forward to using this unit while I go out and do my walks this spring!I can't imagine buying anything else but Polar. This is my third watch and all three of them are still working well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Performance","review":"Israel Hougthton has once again demonstrated his musical genius and spiritual commitment with this performance.

Since that one read, I can't get the characters and situations out of my head. Now, more then 10 years later, I've read dozens (hundreds?) of cyberpunk books but I had to go back and read this one again.Don't get me wrong, this is not the best book ever written. A lot of it reads like those trashy novels you pick up at the airport because the cover art looked interesting. Despite that, or maybe because of it, this book manages to contain the essence of cyberpunk like few books can. Drugs, music, class conflict, mega-corps, youth, and technology are all represented here.Snow Crash and Neuromancer are much better written books but, if you're looking for raw cyberpunk, you need to add this book to your collection as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The forgotten cyberpunk gives Gibson a run for his money !","review":"So you think William Gibson & Bruce Sterling are the only ones writing truly revolutionary \\"cyberpunk\\" sci-fi ? Think again ; this 1989 offering from Jonathan Littell is a brilliant novel which works within the genre and yet simultaneously manages to achieve its own distinct style. The novel's brilliance is evident in all its aspects ; from the generically non-traditional European setting, to its strong characterisations, its fast paced plot line and it's sheer street \\"cred\\" :-). Last but not least, Littell seems a lot less preoccupied with describing every detail of the advanced technology his characters make use of than Gibson. He concentrates instead on character development & reader empathy, and this makes \\"Bad Voltage\\" considerably more accessible to the \\"average\\" or first time (cyberpunk) reader than Gibson's \\"Neuromancer\\" will ever be..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpunk with attitude!","review":"This is easily the best cyberpunk book I have ever read! (and I've read 'em all :) What makes the book so great? it's unique mix of cyberpunk injected with huge amounts of 'hipness' and 'attitude'... awesome! I have always presumed the name 'Jonathan Littell' must be a pseudonym as this talented author has never released another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this flaccid derivative like THE PLAGUE!","review":"I had excoriated this novel from my mind, and then was reminded of it strolling along an Amazon Cyberpunk reading list.This is derivative junk. It is not an homage or pastiche - it was an attempt by an author to \\"cash in\\" on the cyberpunk craze of the 80s. It is forgotten, but not a \\"forgotten classic\\". The plot is puerile, the tech laughable, and the characters one-dimensional. VERY little suspension of disbelief or sociological relevance. Some reviewers say that the main characters are based on \\"real\\" punks of the Paris underground. Whatever. Then the author COMPLETELY failed to make them believable or interesting!Avoid this trash. If you get a retro kick to read some classic cyberpunk look out for the usual suspects - Gibson, Sterling, Spinrad, Brunner, etc. Or even second and third wave authors. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need a crash course on cyberpunk, this is it...","review":"..because it rips off just about every notable story in the genre, from Gibson's <u>Neuromancer</u> all the way through Rudy Rucker's <u>Software</u> and into <u>A Clockwork Orange</u>. The fairest thing that I can say about the novel is that it takes an unusual approach for the genre, which is to say that it is told from the point of view of a just-post-adolescent urban spelunker in France, and music figures very heavily into the storyline. That aside, there really isn't very much original material in this novel. It puts a slightly different spin on the references that are in place, but if you're looking for something completely new, this certainly isn't it. In good conscience, I can't recommend this book to anyone unless you really want a whirlwind introduction to some of the better, and certainly more notable works in the genre of cyberpunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Co-Pilot has problems","review":"I've had my Co-Pilot for several years now. The first one failed within a few weeks of purchase. Minn Kota replaced it under warranty. Year two, Co-Pilot appeared to be sensitive to heat from direct sun. It would stop working completely on hot, sunny days. Sometimes unplugging the motor and plugging it back in would get it started gain after shading the Co-Pilot. This happened about once or twice each outing for a couple of years - annoying. Now, the Co-Pilot has quit entirely. It used to give a short burst of beeps when power was initially applied to the motor, but now it is dead and long out of warranty. The wired foot control works great. I can't recommend the Co-Pilot.

I made the mistake of using these for some finish work on a newel post and the ugly hole I started with looked better then the finished product. I don't even enjoy using these bits for rough work, they just screw into the wood every dang time. Oh, and the \\"no slip\\" shank is a crock. Only the larger bits have the no-slip shank.

I've tried by hand but there are to many angles and surfaces to deal with to get them right in a timely manner. Sharpening a regular drill bit is hard enough. If they would make a bit sharpener that would sharpen these (and not cost way more then a drill doc) I would continue to use them all the time and not have to buy new ones. Now I only use them when I'm drilling something vary rounded or when I can't find a small bit to make a pilot hole... not worth the money if buying for a long term use in hard material."},{"rating":"1","title":"screw right on through","review":"I've never had a drill that grabs so aggressively at the end. Their site claims that \\"Pilot Point Tip starts on contact for clean, accurate holes and reduces lock-up on breakthrough\\" Balderdash, the large bits 5/16 and up will chew right through shallow holes.

(i.e. mounting hardware or trying to drill w/o going all the way through) they are too hungry for the wood. The larger bits don't actually drill through the wood so much as drill into it like a screw. Even when being extra careful to apply light pressure the drill was twisted out of my hand as the bit tore through my workpiece. while drilling through some Maple Plywood drawer fronts the bit pulled the workpiece up off the table and out of my hand leaving a large chipped out area of veneer on the face of my piece.

I've used drill bits of every type for the last 40 years, I have never seen anything so bad. I have a brand new set, but they are worthless. I only use my old set. If you have a table drill you may be able to get some control with the feed rate of these bits, but for hand tools you will constantly be struggling.

I had to use other cards, and my amount of storage was drastically reduced because I lost those 900MB.However, once I got home the pictures could be retrieved by using a card reader. Somehow about 50 strange folders with jumbled characters had been written to the card, causing the problems (not a camera problem, the card was the problem).This card was noticeably faster than my other Kingston 1GB \\"standard\\" card, however it was slower than the SanDisk Ultra cards that I brought.

I have only used this card and another (a 512 MB Kodak brand) in my camera. So far every time I use the Kingston 2GB card at least 1% (and usually up to 5%) of my pictures are corrupt. This has NEVER happened with the Kodak card, which has led me to believe that it is probably the Kingston card. After researching this card online I have found this to be a problem for other people.

Certainly, Nihilism and the lack of respect for tradition, classical education are a problem in our society. I do agree with Mr. Bloom that a university education should be rooted in reading the classics of literature and science.

It is funny how the literature of the West is loaded with lustful imagery from the Bible to the present. Bloom seems to overlook this. If we are to follow the \\"lessons\\" of Western literature (whatever they are) then the world is in deep trouble. What he deems as pure, moral art has something to be desired on both fronts.

This is my first Kindle book purchase and it appears that older books are haphazardly scanned for sale as a digital file. This version of the book has a large number of incorrect words: Modem instead of Modern, horror instead of honor, World War H instead of World war II,etc. There are large portions of text that are dropped out of context, usually tacked onto the end of a chapter, and unclear indenting the makes it difficult to determine if text is being quoted from another source or part of the authors original intent.

He claims that the focus should be placed on those who are in the upper level of intelligence, yet he provides only a superficial means for assessing the capability of students.

In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction.The rest of the book is a chore to read.

The tone is nasty and condescending, the prose is impenetrable, and the net effects are relief when the book is finished and wonder at the fuss it has provoked.

It is written to appeal to people who consider themselves \\"liberals\\" (the yuppie crowd) and parroted exactly what groups like the PMRC and the Moral Majority said about rock music in the eighties.If you believe rock music is the great scapegoat on which to blame all of parents' failures, then this book is for you. For the rest of us, don't be deceived by the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and prophetic, in a way...","review":"What I mean by 'prophetic' is that the dilemma Bloom discusses in this book is becoming more and more widespread, and it is mapping the future of this country; a dim future indeed.Like it or not, the majority of society allows the 'intelligentsia' do its thinking. That's a real shame, but so long as it is so, the 'intelligentsia' ought to be at least guiding the masses toward right, rational thought processes. This isn't the case today; western culture has traded truth for inclusivism, and it's going to cost us in the long run. My experience validated Bloom's observations and concerns, both in the schools I've attended and in the relationships I've had with students and graduates from other schools. Anyone who recognizes this phenomenon and would like to understand why it's bad would do well to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy's History","review":"Alan Bloom attempts to explain the root of America's troubles. He examines the philosophical root to be exact. Basically what he says is that Americans are so focused on their rights that they forget about their responsibilities. he shows how this came about by explaining the way in which the American acedemic community had been influenced by German thought. According to Bloom this was bad. Very bad. Well, to be honest, this book was a little heavy on the philosophy. Nearly half of the book is a histroy of western philosophical thought with barely a mention of America. It's interesting, but I don't think that is what the title of the book lead me to believe this book was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as described","review":"The book I ordered wasn't anywhere near the condition advertised on Amazon.

On & on, an endless editorial on the American cultural condition, in dry & occasionally mindless prose. Like its contemporary, Cultural Literacy, Bloom's The Closing of... is critical tepidity to make smug ignoramuses feel bright. In other words, it's the best we have. When Bloom tackles pop music, you can feel not only waves of ignorance about his topic but an undercurrent of indifference as well.I finally read this because I thought it might be part of my cultural education.

As such it should be read.Bloom's attacks on pop relativism and the emptiness of pop culture are on the mark, and his analysis of the history of our \\"sickness\\" is insightful. His prose is very muscular and powerful.However, he is just another despairing intellectual. This is not the answer. Hopefully this book will not turn you into someone who swoons over the poetry of T.S. Elliot.Western Civilization is over, as is christendom. Deal with it. There is no reason to defend tooth and nail such a horribly repressive culture. I agree that there is much we can learn from it, but there is no reason to wish it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist nonsense.","review":"It is disturbing that many people in the academic community have embraced the positions advocated by this book. Bloom's Eurocenrtic elitism is absurdly out of touch with today's America. He rejected almost everything less than three centuries old, which pretty much eliminates the entirity of American accomplishments. Worse yet, he lacked any understanding of the culture that surrounded him. Even basic contemporary concepts like freedom of speech and freedom of the press seem to have eluded him. Nobody disagrees that today's scholars should read the great thinkers of the past. But students living in today's real world have a greater need to develop an understanding and appreciation for today's culture. For better perspectives, I suggest reading \\"Culture's Sleeping Beauty\\" by Michael Bugeja, \\"Legacy of Wisdom\\" by John Merrill and any of Arthur Asa Berger's books about interpreting popular culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent publication.

In one, we learn of that a lesbian relationship is just dandy, even when there is a child involved. In the other, the Catholic priest and a Bible spouting parishioner are the villains. Some nasty anti-Christian commentary appears as well.

Second, because it contains only around 140 species, I find that I can identify an unfamiliar Bay Area bird more quickly than I can using Sibley or National Geo.

(That says a lot, for I have read thousands of novels.) It focuses on various characters whose experiences in London are both sinister and funny. Mick, Judy and Stuart are quite different, but are somehow brought together in strange ways. They all have a different take on London -- Londoners feeling foreign in their natural habitat while out-of-towners see it as an exciting and daring challenge.Nicholson does a great job with the description of a big city. As a New York City native, I am able to identify with the story line and the dark message the author is sending.

The stories could easily take place elsewhere in the world, New York, Los Angeles, Paris... I've read Footsucker by Nicholson which, by the way, is also a highly enjoyable book. Bleeding London, in comparison with Footsucker, is more complex and more involved.

Unfortunately I went in expecting something on the artistic level of the Beatles at their best, which this is not. True there is a consistency of voice, but it's that of a whiny teenager with girlfriend problems, enough to hold my interest for about one song. The lyrics consist of commonplace rhyming conversational prose, totally lacking in imagery, metaphor and anything else that separates verse from poetry. The music has that distinctive Brian Wilson sound, pleasant and ingratiating. Breaking up the meter or, adding accordions, barking dogs and train sound effects doesn't alter that.

Setting my CD player for the remastered stereo tracks and strapping on a set of good quality headphones I settled in for the 33+ minutes that the record covers and was simply blown away...The remastered tracks are bright and textured and and the lyrics are heartwarming and at times even heartbreaking.

The Beatles were not nearly as good as the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson was far better then Lennon and McCartney put together. All the songs on this album are near perfect and will live on for longer than Sgt. Pepper and Revolver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's all its hyped up to be","review":"This is a masterpiece. I won't get into the Sgt. Peppers or Rubber Soul vs. Pet Sounds. I let this classic stand on its own. Brian Wilson stretched his wings on this one and the band followed. It is, at times, a little uneven, but the music stands up. \\"Wouldn't it be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" are the deserved hits, but don't push aside the other not-so-popular titles like \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times,\\" \\"I Know There's an Answer\\" and probably the most underrated Beach Boys song of all time, \\"Caroline No.\\" A truly introspective album. It's deserving of the classic label. Truly a fantastic album. The Beach Boys showed they could do more than just surf and drag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is the definitive Beach Boys album.

The melodies define natural musical talent; Wilson's a baby Bach. His music comes out in structures that echo the ascensions and declensions of classical compositions. Yet, it's also intensely personal. Next to Wilsons' achingly earnest lyrics with perfectly matched music, the Beatles come off as almost unbearably cute and ingratiating."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"all through the years have always liked it since an old old old friend bought it for me way back when 2of my good friends now have it on cd i have it on record but not the original one i had god only knows &sloop john b and wouldnt it be nice ...would also like to say the jazzy little st nick is superb to really like all music to chiffons and all from a-z&0-9 +_)(*&^%$#@!~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for info:","review":"Pet Sounds is a 'set album' for the Edexcel A2 Exam in Music Technology for the years 2006 & 2007.

The creativity and innovation on this single improve upon the work the Beatles did on \\"Revolver\\" and really kick things up a notch.Too bad, \\"Smile\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" in totality didn't really equal the excellence of the singles that came from the sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really beautiful CD","review":"I like the Beach Boys, but I have to admit that I prefer their earlier California style hits (e.g., Fun, Fun, Fun) and I'm not a big fan of 60s music. Nevertheless, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is undeniably a beautiful CD that still sounds great today. \\"Sloop John B\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" were top 10 hits in the US and \\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"Caroline, No\\" cracked the top 40, but all the songds sound great. Brian Wilson's voice has never sounded more beautiful and the harmonies are near-perfect. As a bonus, \\"Hang on to Your Ego\\" is included (it was recorded at the same time, but not released). It's a great song and may be familiar to alt rock fans via a remake by Frank Black. The liner notes are also terrific and include comments from Brian Wilson as well as a song by song description. Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we stop the Beatles/Beach Boys argument?","review":"The greatest album ever. It is a travesty that its avergage is only 4.5 stars, so this is my attempt to remedy that.Personally I hold it above anything the Beatles came up with, but it's just a matter of taste: the sound of this album just does something special for me. For other people, the Beatles may be superior. Let's stop arguing and enjoy the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pet Sounds version ever","review":"Read the other reviews carefully - this edition of my favorite album is a disgrace. The sound is terribly dead, has drop-outs and plenty of tape hiss, and the flimsy packaging is hopeless. I have Pet Sounds in at least a dozen different formats, and this one is the WORST sonically. The gold disc does not matter at all in this case. Stick with the DCC, the reissued vinyl LP, or the 40th Anniversary mono/stereo editions. Pet Sounds Sessions box set is also a must-have, and even the \\"bonus\\" mono-only disc in the Pet Sounds Sessions box set sounds better than this. Pass on this one and spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"One of the best music purchases I've ever made. I'm not a huge Beach Boys fan, but this is something else. This DVD-A has advanced resolution Mono, Stereo, and 5.1, and it's all simply amazing. I've heard all the songs like Sloop John B and God Only Knows, but never the album as a whole. Brian Wilson truly is a genius. Listening to other music from this era...you can tell just how advanced he was. If you're new to liking the Beach Boys and expecting a lot of surfing summertime music, you'll be disappointed. This is something much more mature and profound. An excellent album, on an excellent format. I wish DVD-A was more popular, because it's a great way to enjoy music and hear things that you couldn't before."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE Pet Sounds...you will too...","review":"I first got this album because I really liked the song Wouldn't It Be Nice. But after I sat down and gave the whole album a listen, it blew me away. Great harmonies and instumentation. Not to mention wonderful songs, ie.God Only Knows, Caroline No, Sloop John B, etc. I could tell why Paul McCartney praised it so much. I really reccomend you get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically superb, lyrically so-so","review":"Mike Love called this one \\"Brian ego music.\\" Problem is, he's right. Some of the instrumentation on this record is breathtaking (\\"You Still Believe in Me\\"). Of course the \\"hits\\" (\\"Wouldn't It,\\" \\"Sloop,\\" \\"God Only,\\" \\"Caroline, No\\") are utterly brilliant, but there are too many \\"Maxwell Silver Hammers\\" in here to warrant 5 stars. So I hit the skip-forward button. So what. I think \\"Today\\" and \\"Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)\\" are better \\"Beach Boys\\" records. But, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is still a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite!","review":"Listening to \\"Pet Sounds\\" for the very first time was one of the best discoveries I had ever made. Six years ago, when I first heard the album, I stayed up all night long, alone, listening to it over and over again. I was so affected by the music.I'd never heard anything with so much heart in my life. It's not just the emotional experience that makes \\"Pet Sounds\\" my favorite. I think it is the finest album ever produced and arranged. It is quite a set of unpredictable and unorthodox recordings. For me, Brian Wilson is the greatest musical mind of the century.I still listen to \\"Pet Sounds\\" a lot, and it affects me the exact same way that it did when I first heard it. I buy copies of it for all of my close friends and relatives. For those of you who have never heard \\"Pet Sounds\\" before and are about to buy it, I am excited by the possibility that you will share the same experience that I had. I hope that \\"Pet Sounds\\" inspires you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album To Heal By","review":"I was a few months shy of 20 when I bought \\"Pet Sounds.\\" I had heard little of it except the hits, but knew it was more than an average Beach Boys album.Hearing those hits amidst the other beautiful, orchestral songs on this album -- \\"That's Not Me,\\" \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times,\\" \\"Here Today\\" -- made me realize that Brian Wilson, through his brothers, cousin and the musicians and writers they assembled, made an album that spoke to me personally. If he lived to tell the tale, I could, too (I didn't know how much worse for wear Brian Wilson would be).The album got me through two breakups, one more painful than the previous. Three days after the second breakup (itself three days after Christmas)I returned to my ex-girlfriend's house wanting not the presents or anything else I gave her -- only \\"Pet Sounds.\\" One person's music is another's medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right on, JMAN from Fairfield County!","review":"Yes, Pet Sounds is as good as music gets. But dang it, I want Surf's Up, too! And Sunflower! And Holland! And Carl and the Passions! And Love You! And the Light Album!

I think it's a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiophile version?","review":"Sorry I have to say that this does not sound like best version of this beautiful album, even it is marketed as a \\"audiophile/gold/superhyper\\" recording.

Brian Wilson's arrangements and melodies on Pet Sounds are a milestone in modern music. The Beatles knew it, and held it out as an inspiration, which continues to bother Bealtle-blind fans to this day. And no, I would never compare Rubber Soul (2 stars), Revolver (2 stars) or Sgt. Pepper(3 stars) to this, because those albums aren't in Pet Sounds' (5 stars) league."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pinnacle of American music","review":"This album is the showcase that Brian wilson begged his label to let him make. What you see here represents the greatest album of American history, and shows what music hacks the Beatles were. Everything that Paul and John wanted to be, Brian Wilson captures with his soulful, mournful songs. Pet Sounds captures youthful exuberance mixed with typical teenage depression-simultaneously. Pet Sounds isn't the peak of the Beach Boys harmonizing style. This is a Brian Wilson production through and through, Mike Love didn't even like this album. While only a modest commercial success, it only gets stronger with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely divine!!!!!!","review":"Absolutely divine...Do we need any other words do describe this incredible \\"teenager simphony to God\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"God Only Knows\\" how Brian Wilson made this.","review":"It's true this is one of the best albums of all time. I'm not sure if I'd call it the second best album ever (Rolling Stone), but it is amazing. Even though \\"Pet Sounds\\" as a whole is great, it's the hits that really stand-out, which include \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", and \\"God Only Knows\\". But I also really like \\"You Still Believe In Me\\" and \\"Caroline No\\". Other than being a classic among classics, this disc also includes the bonus track \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\", and the entire album is repeated in stereo on tracks 15-27. For all these reasons I highly recommend getting \\"Pet Sounds\\". At least you should see what all the fuss is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Those who don't like it don't appreciate music itself","review":"IT is the greatest album of all time it is so different from anything else. Though Smile by brian wilson is great it is not the beach boys which is why Pet Sounds is the Greatest album of all time. I know Sgt. Pepper was good but there are some songs on it like within you without you and when I'm sixty four in which I found boring. Pet Sounds is one hundred percent great it is the only album I have ever heard where each song is just as good as the next. And historically it is one of the first albums to have 4 top 40 hits on the album. I have not been able to put it down after buying it 8 months ago. It is probably my favorite album moreso than Brian's Smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"To me, the Beach Boys are an oldies band. I never paid them much mind, though I knew their songs through my parents. The Beatles have always been the band I grew up listening to. They are the finest songwriters of our lifetime. They wrote what i thought were the best albums ever, that is until this past summer when I bought a copy of Pet Sounds.This is the greatest pop record of all time because it rewards repeated listening. Front to back, it's a monument. From a lifelong Beatles fan, that's really all i can say. This is THE desert island album. It's emotionally devastating. Wonderful and timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the century's all-time GREATS.","review":"I get something different out of this CD every time I hear it -- for me, the mark of an outstanding record.When something new STILL pops out of the speakers after three years of listening.....well, I know I'm hearing one of the all-time greats.I get the most out of PET SOUNDS on headphones. Take a walk on the beach at dusk with this CD at medium volume, so you can hear the music interspersed with the crash of the surf and the cries of seagulls. The music fits right in. Brian Wilson absolutely captures the outdoor beauty of Southern California in 13 heavenly songs.I won't get into the SGT. PEPPER - PET SOUNDS debate. They're both masterpieces. Let's just say both bands pushed each other to new levels of aural beauty -- a \\"race\\" that ultimately drove Wilson into seclusion. One of pop music's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best single disk version of Pet Sounds","review":"The Beach Boys/ Pet Sounds (The complete Albums in Stereo & Mono): This is a beautiful and absolutely classic album. This particular single CD version of it gives us both the Mono and Stereo mixes. Both are great. I originally did not want to buy a bunch of individual albums by the Beach Boys. I wanting instead a good compilation but, having been disappointed with the five-disk history set, I turned to the original albums. I had the old LP of Pet Sounds many years ago and this CD is a revelation of brilliance and clarity. I could not be happier with this CD, and am glad that I was not forced to buy the multi-disk Pet Sounds Sessions in order to own the album. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version of Pet Sounds","review":"Pet Sounds is a great album musically, but the sound on this particular version is so bad it's like taking an icepick to the ear (the Capitol version 'The Complete Album in Stereo & Mono 72435-26266-2-5): shrill and bright in the upper midrange, edgy, and just plain annoying. It's hard to believe Capitol let this thing out the door this way. Doesn't anyone at Capitol listen to these things before they're released? Instead look for the superb DCC version of Pet Sounds (GZS-1035) mastered by Steve Hoffman in 1993, which sounds wonderful and does service to this great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE","review":"Agree with the other 2 reviews (to date) that this is easily the best sounding version of Pet Sounds. Sound is fuller, lusher, more relaxed, more present. Great great job by MFSL on this Pet Sounds digital remaster. Nice packaging as well, with CD inner sleeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may be missing something","review":"First, I love the Beach Boys. I think they have some great stuff. I also love the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeplin, old blues, Black Sabbath, and new rock, etc. I am very open minded when it comes to music. I love classical, jazz, opera, every genre. But I apparently have some deficiency when it comes to this album. Although there are a few great songs, I find the album mostly aweful and unlistenable. It is beyond me how some have put this as the greatest rock album of all time. Maybe one day I will wake up and see what I'm missing, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes!","review":"Although I have never been much of a Beach Boys fan, they did harmonize well, and produced some undeniably classic 60's tunes like \\"Good Vibrations\\", \\"California Girls\\", \\"I Get Around\\" etc... However, I have tried in vain for 30 years to discover the appeal of their PET SOUNDS album - to no avail. Those who claim that PET SOUNDS is anything more than an over-rated collection of outdated pop tunes are perpetuating a hoax! You've probably even read where this album was compared to RUBBER SOUL by the Beatles. That's like comparing the SOPRANOS to the GODFATHER movies. Be honest, how much time has PET SOUNDS actually spent in heavy rotation at your house, or that of any of your friends?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"THE MOST OVERRATED RECORDING IN ROCK HISTORY\\"","review":"I share the same confusion as the reviewer a few entries below me - what's the big deal here? To hear so many people champion this recording as the greatest rock album ever seems ludicrous to me. I bought this CD a few months ago and listened to it several times, hoping it would \\"grow on me\\", as many of my favorite discs have. I finally gave it to my father-in-law, hoping he would derive some pleasure from it. If you're looking for truly original and inspiring classic rock, stick to \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Tonight's the Night\\", \\"Astral Weeks\\", \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Exile on Main St.\\", or any album by the Velvet Underground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Boys Pet Sounds","review":"This is a very good album.

Pet Sounds is one of those albums that are just not able to created ever again. By this time Brian Wilson who had suffered a nervous breakdown while on tour with The Beach Boys now remains in the studio writing and recording new material. Pet Sounds shows the bands growth from there humble beginnings to more complex songs and much more greater album compared too there earlier ones... Highly influentail album that has even influenced the Sgt. Peppers. Such classics as, \\"Sloop John B\\", and \\"God Only Knows\\", remain classic songs too this day. Albums like this come around once in a lifetime. Pet Sounds is a pop, rock, and psychedelic album and explored Brian Wilson's exploration of the drug LSD. So what are you wating for the only Beach Boys album you will ever need buy Pet Sounds todayYou wont be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant collection of Brian Wilson songs.","review":"Glossy and largely produced.All of the songs are Beach Boys radio staples.For the best Beach Boys recording from their original catalogue see\\"Smiley Smile\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest concept - albums of all time","review":"Pet Sounds takes you into the 360 degrees of teenage hope, confusion and despair. Of course, the Beatles were more sophisticated and intelligent, but the honesty and emotions in this album make it something that could be timeless. I don't know, the difference between this and Sgt Pepper would be that The Beatles take you into a different, incredibly creative world, and Brian Wilson shows you a mirror and tells you that you're not alone. Which do you prefer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Emo Boy","review":"Pet Sounds is great. There is no more soothing yet disturbing sound than Brian Wilson on this album. I had heard about this album for years and wondered what the big deal is. To me, the Beach Boys never seemed all that great, and I couldn't see how someone who wrote \\"California Girls\\" could be considered a genius. Yet, after listening to songs such as \\"That's Not Me,\\" \\"God Only Knows\\" and \\"I'm Waiting for the Day,\\" I understand. Wilson & Co., I salute you (sans Carnie and Wendy, of course). Wonderful, emotional stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia triumphs over reality","review":"I've listened to this album a number of times - I own this album. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. I simply don't understand why it's raved as one of the best albums of all time because it's so outdated. It's so cheesey and it gets boring. The songs are fun and poppy, but really get thin after a few listens. Why does it get such high reviews? It is important historically, but I sincerely believe that the legend is far too inflated for such a bland bit of 60s pop.I guess I'm unimpressed by Brian Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Ok - What???????","review":"I like it.

I can't wait until their next 45 is out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest albums ever!","review":"A long time Beatles fan, I just recently decided to purchased this album and I was blown away. I am not going to say any album is the best of all time, because there is never a true \\"best,\\" but this ranks right up there with \\"Rubber Soul,\\" \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" The new stereo mix is fabulous, as is the original mono, and every song is arranged in such a way that it captures the listener and keeps them flowing with the album. The lyrics are amazing, and speak directly to the listener. If you don't believe me, just take a look at the wonderful \\"Caroline, No\\" or \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.\\" Everything on this album flows, sounding as if it belongs together. For sure, if something were removed, it just would not sound right. Along with the Beatles \\"Rubber Soul,\\" this album is a must have for any collection. Truly deserving of such high ranking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTERS!","review":"It's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape, but from a second generation copy and DAT.

Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired the Beatles to make \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" Any questions?","review":"It's easy to forget that there was a time when the Beach Boys were not only relevant to popular music, but actually revolutionary. \\"Pet Sounds\\" not only impresses the listener with its technical beauty--perfectly blended harmonies laid over intricate musical constructions--but with the emotional maturity of the songs themselves. They weren't singing about surfing and drag racing anymore. They were singing about love, faith, growth and lonliness. \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" deals with such mature concepts as sleeping together and wishing for an ideal world that'll never exist, and \\"God Only Knows\\" is one of the most beautiful pop songs ever written. \\"Pet Sounds\\" inspired the Beatles to make \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" Any questions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Few Good Songs","review":"In my opinion, there are very few good songs on this CD. I have only used it a couple of times.

I practically thought I had wasted my money getting it on vinyl. I was going to abandon it altogether, but something made me listen to it again. Now, it's one of my favorite records to listen to. It's so good. I've heard a lot of people say it's overrated, but I really think it's useless to numerically rank albums in terms of which ones are objectively the best anyway. Don't let the \\"best album ever\\" classification make your expectations too high in the beginning- you've gotta spend time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever because...","review":"Pet Sounds is arguably the finest pop album of all-time because of its ability to express deeply personal feelings of a very confused but brilliant man (Brian Wilson) through a wide range of musical sounds and the classic Beach Boy harmonies. No pop album since has been able to deliver such intimate feelings. The songs are by themselves quite simple but made unique by the music. As always (though) its the Beach Boy vocals that carry the day in classics like \\"God Only Knows\\" \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"You Still Believe In Me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated album in history!","review":"Never a Beach Boys fan I had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews. What a dissapointment. I just don't get it. \\"God only knows\\" is indeed a masterpiece, but the rest of the album is filled with boring music that does nothing for me. I've tried multiple listenings to make sure I'm not missing anything, but the plain truth is that this album stinks. I was expecting some deep music as described by some Beach Boys fans, but the best use I can get out of this album is using it as a coaster.

But my excitement turned to disappointment as soon as I listened to the stereo version of 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'. The high frequencies are heavily filtered, and the bass simply isn't there. The rest of the stereo version is an improvement over the previous stereo version, but the fact that the first track is so bad completely spoils my enjoyment of the album.I don't care about the surround sound mixes - extended resolution stereo is what I am interested in - so this disc has been an expensive waste of money for me.Who messed up, Capitol records?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE most overrated album in history!!!!","review":"I bought this CD mainly because of its critical acclaim. When I first listened to it I was completely shocked at how ordinary it was--the word that comes to mind is CALLOW. Listen to the over-the-top wretchedness of Mike Love's so-called singing on 'That's Not Me' and you'll understand what I mean. Brian Wilson's comment in the liner notes that this particular song was so great that he 'couldn't get enough listens' must mean that he's actually deaf in BOTH ears when it comes to judging Mr. Love's ability. There are actually some good songs on this album, however-- 'Sloop John B', 'God Only Knows', and 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' are rightly called classics. But to compare it in the same breath to 'Sergeant Pepper' is ludicrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of ten best of all time","review":"I have a collection of over 825 cd's from the rock and roll era (1950's-Present). And while it is impossible to say what is the one and only greatest album of all time, there really is no question in my mind that this is one of the top five or ten albums ever recorded. Maybe Sgt Pepper's is better, maybe Revolver is better, maybe Born In The USA is better, but top to bottom this is one of the greatest records ever made. End of Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than 5 stars","review":"If there was a way to give this record any more than 5 stars, I'd be all for it. It is a bona-fide masterpiece, created in an era where nobody seemed to get it.Pet Sounds is all at once beautiful, resounding, aching, passionate, bold, breathtaking, and especially, heartbreaking.

It BLOWS AWAY the CD in this terrible reissue. It is a shame people ASSUME this later re-release surpasses the 2001 CD , as it is like night and day. The CD in this package is a DISGRACE. Capitol Records should be ashamed putting out such a reduction in sound quality as an anniversary edition, when CLEARLY the 2001 CD in HDCD got it 'right'. Since Capitol is STILL selling the awful Beatles CDs mastered OVER 20 years ago, it is NO surprise this issue is abysmal.

The Beach Boys sound, and yes, including \\"Pet Sounds,\\" which, yes, I have listened to, has always been and always will be nothing but bubble gum surfer music. When did society decide that this mediocre piece of fluff was greater than truly legendary fare such as Sgt. Peppers, Dark Side of the Moon, Exile on Main Street, Highway 61 Revisited, and on and on and on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Pan in music, never having to grow up in music","review":"I have tried listening to this music by the Beach Boys ever since it came out. It is a recorded very nicely-Five Stars for that. Musically it is nothing but the teenager songs of the early 60's music of beach, sand, girls and nothing much more. After listening to it, I get the same feeling as too many good donuts, too sweet and leaves this person feeling empty. I keep on trying to decide why it is so highly rated and will continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average album with one great song","review":"..that song being god only knows a great song. Wouldn't it be nice is cool though not great. The rest is a mish mash of bubble gum boy loses girl pop and pointless instrumentals. This was influenced by Rubber Soul but really misses the boat big time. The thing is brian wilson was a good songwriter of surf pop tunes but couldn't compete with lennon/mccartney when it came to deep timeless pop. As for best album this album probably isn't even among the best ever. The people who rate this album highly either have an agenda or like ho-hum music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well really four and a half","review":"I would give this album a five because quite frankly, it is VERY good. I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me. God Only Knows, Wouldn't It Be Nice, and Sloop John B are the best on this album.The reason it is half a point lower:People keep claiming it's the best album of all time. If it was the best album of all time, wouldn't people let it be?In the jacket it is always compared to the beatles' albums.You don't see the beatles writing stuff about pet sounds in their jackets, do you?THEY DON'T NEED TO...I think the best album of all time is a beatles album. One of them. (id have to think too hard)Buy this album, but don't buy the jacket.

There are, at last count, about 238,481 recordings in the history of music that are more interesting, entertaining and/or influential than Pet Sounds.Don't get me wrong - I like the Beach Boys as much as the next band that plays easy-on-the-ears pop music. The Brian Wilson biography on A&E a few months back was both sweet and sad.

I have listened to this cd several times in both stereo and mono and I just don't get it. Each time I listen to it I have to struggle my way through. To me, it's just another Beach Boys record with Brian Wilsons' whiny vocals. That's not so bad when he's singing that corny surf music but when he tries to get serious as he does on Pet Sounds it's almost unbearable. How can anyone think that this is better than anything the Beatles did is even more ludicrous.

Any 60's Rolling Stone album is one hundred times better. And something else, if this is the sound that shape the American pop music, I might be wrong, but ... where is Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Miles Davis, etc?

But in 1966 they got it right, and this album is truly genuine...Brian Wilson's songs are heartful introspections about growing up and realizing that our fairy tale plans get shattered in the real world.Historically significant and entertaining.

Finally, I started soaking the medicine into her dry cat food and then mixing in wet cat food to cover up the taste. That seemed to work better. If only this medicine came in little pills instead of the thick, white liquid! it is much easier to hide a little pill in a cat treat than mix this stuff with the cat's food!

I was not let down. The movie is ostensibly about drag racing, with a cross-country race being waged. More broadly, the movie addresses the American fascination with speed and excitement. More importantly, it is a prime example of the type of small American movies that flourished in the 1970s, but are not being made today. James Taylor and Dennis Wilson star in their only primary acting roles of their careers, and bring a low-key realism to the movie. None of the characters are named and there is minimal dialogue, but my interest was maintained throughout. The DVD also includes a fascinating commentary track with indie director Monte Hellman (Cockfighter). I highly recommend this DVD for persons looking for something a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 lane blacktop","review":"A great find. A true classic if you love cars.

I love the sight and sound of machines, so Two Lane Blacktop is a natural for me. In this case the machines are cars with their drivetrains at full tilt. A wonderful flavor is the whine of the special cut gears of the '55 Chevy's M22 transmission handling the power of the big 454 motor.The austerity and robot blankness of the characters and plot mate perfectly with the barren mechanical environment. The cross country scenery and coffee shop settings highlight the theme as well. Nothing pulls away from the dominating emphasis of machines . A very singular movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddy Gonna Shut You Down","review":"I have to wonder whether other people giving this movie four and five stars actually watched it.

What I got was adolescent boys of all ages revving their engines and conversing at a prepubescent level. I tried hard to find a theme -- disaffected youth? looking for America in the 1970's? car culture's impact on American culture? -- but to identify a theme in this movie would be grossly unfair to the thousands of movies that have one. Finally, I rescued the evening by playing a comedy from the golden age of Hollywood so I could be reminded that there was a time when acting ability was a requirement of being an actor. Two-lane Blacktop is the movie of choice when you just came home from oral surgery and want to be lulled into distraction and, finally, sleep.

Soulful, never self-indulgent and he never puts himself above his listener... I love all of his music but this is his most elegant album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Get Excited About","review":"This guy got passed me back in the day, even though I basically bought every album that came out back in the 60s and 70s. I was listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and I liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere, so I checked out a few websites on Nick Drake. His tragic story kind of hooked me so I bought this CD. Quite frankly I find this to be interesting, but not something I would recomend to everybody. The mood of depression stays so heavy that every song sounds the same and makes me feel like I am watching one of those pulse readouts in a hospital room, and it is a flatliner. I suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of \\"I wanna leave this world stuff\\" but I get enough of it quick. Drake's guitar work was a bit unique in it's time, but as many times as I try, I just can't quite get with this program. It is good to listen to and then take a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"TGreat CD!!!","review":"I heard all these bad reviews from the other reviewers and I wasn't sure I should buy this, but my friend convinced me I should.

He sings in a Donovan-like moribund drone, the arrangements are lacklustre, and most significantly, there's a definite lack of emotional connection between the music and the listener.

Light some incense, light something else, close your eyes, hit Play. If you don't visualize a concert hall stage that looks like a huge altar with Donovan Leitch (aka Donovan) strumming soulful tunes as the centerpiece, sorry you missed it. Although Nick Drake plays a nice guitar, only 17 y.o. boys trying to display a sensitive side to their 16 y.o. girlfriends should expect any magic from this one. Wispy, poetic, and some pieces heavily orchestrated with strings - a warning I did not heed. I bought this from a recommendation off the Garden State soundtrack. Although I generally like that one, some of the songs are similar - aenemic, immature, weak, something. I'm not a rocker per se, and indeed my beloved Radiohead can drift over into dreary unconnectedness, but Five Leaves Left (title another clue?) is boring. A+ in lilting-ness, if you're into that."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxed intensity","review":"I first heard this album many years ago, as a student in the '80s. 'Three Hours' floated out of a friends bedroom, and I was hooked immediately, had to ask what the record was, and get a copy. It has remained fresh ever since. Drake's evanescent voice, almost fading into silence at times, is hypnotic. His guitar writing is equally compelling - unpredictable and extraordinarily delicate. But it's the songs that are truly wonderful: those mysterious, pathos-laden lyrics, and long, breathy melodies that seem to linger, fade, recreate themselves, and shimmer like a watercolour."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite CD of All Time","review":"I am amazed that I lived 45 years, and somehow Nick Drake escaped my awareness. The first time I heard the entire CD, I fell in love with it, and Nick Drake became my favorite musician. It is many months later, and I have not grown tired of listening to it, and do so almost daily. I actually purchased a second copy from Amazon so that I have one for the house and one for the car. To explain his approach is impossible; it really needs to be heard to be appreciated. He does have two other CD's, but this is my favorite. I only wish he had lived longer. I love this CD so much that I am travelling to his resting place in England this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I wish I knew Nick Drake. Nick's music is so gentle. The melodies are beautiful and the lyrics are deep and wise. I feel that he lets the listener see through into his soul. That is, to my beliefe, a brave thing to do. I learnt that Nick is nicknamed \\"the Van Gogh of music\\".

Dan's words and images really spoke to me deeply a number of years ago when I really nneded to understand what \\"Leap of Faith\\" really means. I believe that many books have an important \\"epiphany\\" in them waiting for you to find when you need it. This is definitely one of those books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Millman, hated this book.","review":"I have been a Dan Millman for over 20 years. I own almost all of his books, but this was by far the worst. If I had read this one 1st I never would have picked up another book by him.This book goes too far into the \\"mystic\\" and \\"new age\\" side of his teachings. It was too far fetched for me. Minor details did not fit with what was written in \\"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.\\" One MAJOR thing was that \\"Joseph\\" comes back from the dead to make an appearance in this story. Not a vision - Joseph is alive and well and raising a family.Everything else I have read by Dan, has inspired me to make changes in my life and try to improve, not so with this story.It does have some insightful thoughts, but they are few and far between.Finishing it was drudgery. Do yourself a favor, choose another title and let Dan inspire you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elemental","review":"This book may be OK for people with little or no background in spiritual awareness.The author has been \\"inspired\\" - to put it mildly- by Castaneda's work.He is nowhere even close to attaining Castaneda's depth or artistic talent.There is no new concept, no original idea that I can remember : every single inspiration can be tracked down to previous authors .The overall design , i.e. a man who finds a spiritual teacher almost as if by chance is a direct copy of Don Juan. Situations, characters and dialogues are infantile ; it is definitely an effort to put forth some spiritual ideas through an adventure story ( absolutely unbelievable) to appeal to a wider public.If you buy your books at the Newstands stores of airports, this may be right for you : easy reading and sugary.If you have a serious interest in the field, be sure to leave it on the stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sacred Warrior review ~","review":"I am currently enjoying the Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior. Although I have not ended the book, it is uplifting and fun reading for early mornings in the hot tub!!! It is somewhat spiritually uplifting and I appreciate that very much. I have other projects in the middle that is why the reading is going a little more slowly but in this way I can enjoy it a little more as well. Thank you for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dissertation","review":"The title suggest a very interesting and worthy subject. However, the book seems to be a copy of Ikegami's dissertation. Factual information does not have to be communicated with words that cannot be understood by most readers.

It appears this book is a regeneration of the writer's dissertation."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Back Cover","review":"The Tanner family was about to adopt a baby girl and all Woodrow Tannerhad to do was tell Dr. Elizabeth Montgomery , the only other relative who could claim the precious babe.

But when a sexy Texan came toting news of a baby niece, she got more than she bargained for! Held hostage on the family ranch, Elizabeth succumbed to Woodrow's seductive touch. Now the pretty doctor wondered if this gruff bachelor could make her dreams come true...2nd in The Tanners of Texas series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff, not enough stuff","review":"I agree with pretty much all the negative reviews. There's too much history of the fitness industry, too much about the author's spinning obsession and what she did in college, not enough information about \\"ultimate fitness.\\" Bottom line: this is not a book for the athlete or anyone wishing to improve their fitness routine. There are some nuggets of wisdom, but they're hard to find; the author puts them in almost as an afterthought and does not build on them at all. I'd give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as title would indicate","review":"I would simply like to confirm/reiterate what other negative reviews have said about this book, Ultimate Fitness. It is not a book about either the science or history of exercise, but is rather an extended reflection on the author's obsession with spinning, which is a form of highly stylized but intense stationary biking. It is well-written, but I wouldn't have bothered reading it if I had understood what it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This is a terrible book. It doesn't warrant me saying more than that. If you buy it or even waste your time reading it, you deserve what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to reporting","review":"some of the statements from the book are just not accurate. For example stating that putting on 4 pounds of muscle will not add weight. That four pounds that will not have a positive effect on a persons overall metabolism is simply not true. Muscle is your metabolism and the bodies fat burning machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome and repetitive- why did she write this book?","review":"I still can't find the answer to that question. This book began with no voice to lead one through it's sprawling travels of unlinking timelines and ended with no point in hand. I have no time to begin with but then to waste ones time on a book like this makes me crazy. There is not one remarkable, enlightening statement made in this book, everything in it is a no-brainer, don't waste your time like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I picked up this book hoping for a well-researched look at fitness,maybe putting ideas we have today about excercise into a kind of historical context. Instead, I got a superficial look at the history of body building and waaaay too much information on the author's personal fitness routine especially in regards to spinning. This book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"If you really want the \\"truth about exercise and health\\", just read the Epilogue. The rest of the book is filled with far too much detail about the history of the fitness movement and business, including the author's own experiences. In fact, one comes away with the conclusion that this woman is somewhat obsessed with exercise. What reader can relate to a person who admits that she belongs to three different gyms, two in New York and one in New Jersey? In a word, the book was boring. I only continued reading it because I kept thinking it was going to get better in terms of answering the big question, i.e., \\"what is the truth about exercise and health?\\" Little did I know that I only needed to read the last chapter to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a fitness book","review":"After reading halfway through this book, I decided to stop reading any further. This is not really a fitness book geared for people trying to get into shape.After seeing Gina Kolata on a TV talk show, I expected a lot of useful information on fitness myths. Instead, the book consists of 5% fitness information and the other 95% percent are boring anecdotes about her personal life and fitness gurus, trainers, and doctors that I doubt anyone would care to learn more about.Read this book if you literally want to learn the \\"history\\" of various fitness myths (in all it's arcane detail). For me, I just want the bottom line information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant read, but doesn't deliver","review":"I found her style to be very enjoyable to read, but the book lacks substance. Some interesting history of fitness. She shoots down some excercise myths, but then doesn't provide much in the way of answers. Seems like an extended magazine article.This is certainly NOT a how-to guide for fitness, especially ULTIMATE fitness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title - Non Scientific \\"Story'","review":"Not worth 1 cent. Virtually zero science, and the rest reads like a diary review of narcissistic self-thought. You will learn nothing of exercise, physiology or anything else that might be useful for personal exercise or training. A womans story with all the interest of discussing shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative and interesting","review":"In this book Gina Kolata ties together her personal experiences as someone with a lifelong interest in fitness with information about the state-of-the-art today. If you want to know what is a fad and what is proven, what the leading researchers are looking into and what they are finding, this is the book for you. With information on topics including strength training, supplements, & general conditioning, this is a book for anyone interested in separating the lore from the facts in an oft-confusing area."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad and deceptive book","review":"This is a bad book.Like many other people, I bought it with the erroneous assumption that it would deal with the issue of ultimate fitness. It doesn't. It's a tiresome collection of insipid anecdotes about the author, her boyfriends, her husband, and many others who go about exercising, along with a lot of uninteresting and tedious stories about the history of the exercise and fitness movement.Worse, the author continually touts a proprietary exercise routine called SPINNING. Is she on the payroll of the people behind SPINNING? It certainly seems so, since the boook is written as a marketing brochure for the procedure.A book to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grill Cleaner Envy","review":"Did not care for this product. Very hard to use and not very effective. You would be better off with a copper brush for your stainless steel grates. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking a weak stab at Blair Witch...","review":"The film takes a stab at capturing some of the realism of the original Blair Witch project and reality TV. The story itself is entertaining and could easily be used again to greater effect. However, this movie only gets 2 stars for a number of reasons.1. There is little to no action in the first hour of the film. It is just people talking about little to nothing, with no special effects, and a minuscule amount of action. It's nearly painful to watch.2. The biggest point of realism in this film is when the two filmmakers discuss wanting to do more but not having any budget for special effects or doing what they want. I felt that was probably VERY real.The last fifteen minutes are faster paced with more effects and wrap the film up nicely. Overall, this is a nice movie to relax with if you're ready for the first hour to be dull. Asylum had made better movies and I look forward to seeing them evolve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Asylum, we've had it with your bad movies.","review":"Haunted house is another Asylum production. This movie is nothing more than a glorified home video (and not a good one). I have seen better movies on cable-access. There is nothing to recommend about this movie.

An hour I'll never get back..Don't watch it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk away, Far away!!","review":"Okay, so I saw the cover for this movie at the video store and desided, why not. I'm all about the horror flix. I sat thur the hour and 14 min movie. And I now wish I hadn't. It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Even worst than Kazzam. For real.

Brings back memories of my college years in the 80's. The Talking Heads are a very unique band whose style compares with no other band."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really pisses me off when a band raises my expectations and then disappoints me","review":"I've heard some bad rap about this album from those who hold true to Talking Heads classics, and what can I say, they were absolutely right. And She Was is easily the best on here, and Road To Nowhere is also very good, but the remainder is pure uninspiring rubbish that won't be memorable. Go with '77, More Songs About Buildings and Food, Remain In Light, and even Speaking In Tongues was better than this, and that to me is probably the last album you need to get. I've heard samples of Naked, and I won't even bother listening to the whole album, since that's even worse. This seems to be more representative of David Byrne's solo work, which tells me he wasn't listening to the advice of his bandmates, which might have been what expedited their breakup shortly afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 'domestic' album","review":"This album, after the dizzying rush from their second thru their fifth, is somewhat of a subdued affair. But it deals so handily with issues that hit closer to the listener that the low-key-ness of it seems appropriate. On here, David Byrne turns his lyrics back toward everyday observations, albeit ones which often have a wry, weird, altered twist to them. The band's sound turns away from the complexities of their multi-ethnic sound of the previous few releases to embrace elements of country and gospel, as well as straightforward pop music. Unfortunately, a couple of the tracks here really start to seem like 'filler', whereas before, there were virtually no unimportant tracks on Talking Heads albums from \\"Fear of Music\\" thru \\"Speaking in Tongues\\". Still, a satisfying collection nonetheless, one which has a wonderful sing-along appeal, especially with the closer \\"Road to Nowhere\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT RE-RELEASE","review":"These re-releases of the Talking Heads have been remixed beautifully - The surround sound is amazing and well worth listening to. They have taken the place of the originals for regular listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it then, still do now.","review":"Okay, I admit that I had never heard of Talking Heads before the single \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", but I loved this album. Quirky? Yes. Poppy? Yes. Humour a bit jouvenile? Definitely, but then so was I when I first it.This is not so much a review as a comment. I wonder whether there is a darker meaning to \\"And She Was\\", which most people have missed, and which juxtaposes with the cutesy melody. \\"And she was\\" - i.e. was, in the past tense. And now isn't. \\"No time to think about what she's done,\\" \\"Rising up above the earth.\\" \\"Joining the world of missing persons\\", etc. I've seen it interpreted as a love song, or as nonsense verse, but is it about a suicide?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Post sense beauty","review":"Talking Heads / Little Creature: This album came out after the great \\"Stop Making Sense\\" Movie was made and, having the DVD, I really didn't feel I needed any of the albums except this one, which has some great tracks. This is a good album that is very entertaining. Four Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Heads turn to pop-rock","review":"Definitely the not the best Talking Heads album, but also not the worst. it has several great tunes (And She Was, Stay Up Late, Television Man), but it also has its share of mediocre tunes (Give me Back My Name, Perfect World, Road to Nowhere). Of course its good for die-hards but the casual fans will probably be disappointed by its lack of dance qualities. its much more of a singing album than a dancing one like their previous efforts. it does have one of the best album backings ever though!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficulties with DualDisc","review":"The one star is for the technology, not the content or sound. Boy, did I have problems with this disc (as to a lesser extent I did with the other DualDiscs). Of the five CD players in my house, this disc worked on only one of them, a newer Sony multidisc player. It did not play correctly on either my computer cd-roms, including the usually reliable Plextor (only six months old). Only my work computer allowed me to play and rip the cd correctly. I then ripped the music to a new cd-r and it plays just fine everywhere. Keep trying. It shouldn't be this way, but it is. The quality of the remastering does make up for the frustration though."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Little Creatures\\": Memorable, great pop from 'Heads.","review":"I actually came across this album a couple years ago, but at the time I only really payed attention to the big hit, \\"And She Was.\\" Then I checked it out again, and realized that each of these songs is catchy and solid. Sure, it's not as quirky or goofy as moments in older releases, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have greatness. It does. The album especially has a good album-ending punch with \\"Television Man\\" and \\"Road to Nowhere.\\" \\"Road\\" was actually pretty unconventional compared to the remainder of the album even though it was one of the hits from the album. And yes, David Byrne sings more mid-range here. He actually does sound British at points, like in the chorus of \\"Creatures of Love.\\" Quirky lyrics like \\"I've seen sex and I think it's okay\\" and \\"I wanna make him stay up all night\\" make the album memorable. It may not be an elitist favorite but it still connects to younger people, including me, a fan who isn't even 20 yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm.","review":"Now, I thought Naked (with a few niggling exceptions) was a fine album. This album, however...I mean, especially considering who we're dealing with...is simplistic and poppy and occasionally just plain dumb. It seems like people who'll collectively jump up and down for something like \\"Remain In Light\\" fall into two distinct group when confronted with this thing (and Naked-) you love it, or just can't see why anyone would rave about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed at this time","review":"This is a very much needed teaching manual for this time and age when too few Christian Clergy are even READY to give an answer to those in pain, sorrow, or sin they can't seem to break.

Readers will relate to Neel, a typical elementary-aged American boy who loves shooting hoops and playing computer games. When Neel decides to honor his family's history and heritage, the encouragement for readers to do the same is subtle but powerful.

It is nice to be able to see the workout stats at the end of the week. You can set your own heart rate zones or use the pre-programmed versions.Cons: Oftentimes I have to moisten my skin under the strap to get the sensor to start.

It's a great product, but the company's customer service could be improved. Recently, I sent the unit to the Polar Dallas, TX service center and requested a new LCD and a new elastic transmitter strap. They returned it with a new battery and new transmitter.

I have not had any issues with the watch at all and I use it daily. The only reason I do not give this watch 5-stars is because of the software.

The many anecdotes will not only bring back many fond memories, but will also shed some light on parts of his life that most people don't know about. For example, he wasn't really drunk up there in that booth. He was just acting so fans could relate. Harry was always one for showmanship, and he was one of the best at it. If you miss Harry, you need to read this...it will help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes ya laugh, cry and laugh even harder","review":"This book is one of the best ever. All you have to do is be a baseball fan. I gurantee even those dreaded Cardinal fans will love to read this book. The stories that Steve has in here will make you laugh and cry and than laugh again.No matter what team you rooted for, everyone loved Harry. Sad to see him go, but glad to have the book to learn just a little bit more about him. Truly a comical wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry the egomaniac","review":"After reading this book, I am convinced that Harry is a self-important, arrogant, spiteful & phony man who will go through great lengths to make sure he's in the spotlight at all times. The story where Josh Lewin went to thank Harry for giving his grandmother joy by listening to Harry do Cub games before she died, only for Harry to arrogantly dismiss him was very disturbing. As a huge fan of his growing up in the 80's, I was very disappointed to find out what a phony & a poser he really was.There is no controversy in this book whatsoever, if that's what you're looking for. In fact, it's a pretty good bootlicking session. This read shows that Steve Stone is as bland a writer as he is an announcer. VERY vanilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I Love this little car, I bought it for my little cousin and he absolutely adores it!

I had bought this car in August, and the race track during for Christmas. These cars are motion sensitive meaning they are easy for a young child to rev the engines up. My son loves seeing the cars moving on carpet and on the track. There is also an off switchI wanted to say that these cars DO require 3 batteries that are included (3AA). I had seen a review that said they do not require batteries. With that said with constant use and turning the toy off when not in use, the batteries die after a few days.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked one time","review":"This was a Christmas peresent for my grandson. The car worked one time and then would no longer go. It still made the vrooom noise, but would not perform as advertised. The price of the car was not worth haggling over for a new one, but I would definitely discourage the purchase of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake & Go is a GO GO GO!!","review":"I purchased this Car for My 4 year old son. When the car is shaken it makes real engine reving sounds, it allows enough time for little children to put the car down on the floor before it takes off. It can go very far. It works much better on a hard surface than on the carpet. We created some ramps out of cardboard for the car to jump, it actually gets up enough speed to jump the ramps. This is a fun car. I would say the only draw back is that little kids won't shake the car long enough for it to go very far. When my Husband and I shake it we can get the car to go a great distance further than our kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning, a masterpiece","review":"Giant Robo features top-notch animation, an excellent story, brilliant direction, and some of the best action sequences I have ever seen in an anime, or in any film for that matter. The animation style is unique and charming, although it may seem overly simple at first. It soon becomes clear, however, that the apparent simplicity allows the animation to be far more fluid and dynamic than what you find in most anime. There are quite a few grand rotational shots that really bring the characters to life. The Orchestral score by the Poland national warsaw philharmonic adds an impressive gravitas to the proceedings. Thankfully, anime works has included the original dub by manga which I find to be far superior to their own dub. On the whole Giant Robo is a thoroughly entertaining show as well as an artistic tour de force. The current price for this box set makes it one of the best deals you will ever find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Animation is weak and story line a bit complex for kids to follow.

Had I looked at it in a store, I never would have bought it.The book is very poorly organized; while there are chapters, the index makes it difficult to find what you're looking for. The editors seem to have assumed that the reader intends to read the entire book from beginning to end; it's not usable as a quick reference guide.Worst of all, the book fails to mention any other written source of information not already published by the same company. If the Newcomer's Handbook for moving to the USA is this bad, they're doing their readers a terrible disservice by mentioning it.I strongly recommend theNot for Tourists Guide to Atlanta 2007 (Not for Tourists)instead. The real estate agent we worked with told us that it's one of the best, and I agree. See my review for that book for more information on why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This product is great for hiding messes of wire running along a wall. I choose to use this for my computer cables. Obviously some of the holes were not big enough, but you can just cut out one of the tabs and now you have a nice big hole to stuff cables into. Looks great, easy to install and easy to cut with a hacksaw.Took off 1 star for the difficulty of taking off and putting on the cover. It is a huge pain in the rear, mostly for taking it off.Overall, great product and I would suggest this to anyone in need of cable management.

He begins with Incas (1/5 of the whole book) to continue with plethora of their ancestors.

The overall effect is like a pleasant evening in a small jazz club. There's a sense of the familiar here, yet it's all new and fresh.The performers chosen to interpret Bob's songs are all top-notch; they imbue the selections with the warmth of their personalities and seem to 'make them their own'.All in all, a fine piece of work, and we can only hope that the 'Volume 1' in the title of the CD means that we can expect more great things out of Bob in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Church in the Wildwood","review":"This generational novella collection traces the feud between the Campbells and the Randalls in the Missouri Ozarks. Starting in 1869 in the book Leap of Faith, the family feud begins while the community builds a stone church in Hickory Hollow. You will want to find out what Amanda Hodges has to do with fueling the feud. In Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy, Forest Tounsend arrives in Hickory Hollow in 1894 to become the pastor of the church started by Shirley Campbell?s grandfather. How can this big city pastor fit into the life of this mountain town, and how can he fit into Shirley?s life? Only a Name tells the story of Eva Hargrove in the 1950s. Will she marry the man her father wants her to, a man who doesn?t understand the importance of the church, or will she follow her heart to Robert Campbell?

Kid can then scribble to his or her heart's content without making any mess ever, and practicing a lot is how they get ready for pencils and crayons and paint etc. It's also perfect for teaching letters and numbers and shapes since you draw them each time, which is more interesting to little kids than other teaching toys. Our MagnaDoodles have tended to die of being stepped on, which warps the board and makes the erase lever difficult to slide, so keep it off the floor if you want to make it last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fun- Small Price!","review":"For whatever reason, this toy has been a favorite of my child and any child who visits. Almost any child from two and up should be able to hold and operate this toy themselves, inlcuding wiping away one picture and beginning another. we have brought it everywhere. There is no clean up or mess. We have used it to begin learning letter recognition and how letters are formed. If she \\"makes a mstake\\" or does not like how her drawing is turning out, she merely erases it and fixes it herself. It is not the most durable of the Magna Doodle selection of toys, but does offer a large drawing area for its compact size. Parents have stopped me in the grocery store to ask where I got it. (It doesnt seem to be easily found in retail stores) Just when I think my child is losing interest in it, she becomes drawn to it again. I would recommend it for almost any child.

The cats hated it. I could barely get one clump (doesn't come out in drops, more like gel) into each ear without them freaking out and running. It has a horrible alcohol smell. Both cats have run and hide for half a day and shake their heads all night, but the next day they do seem happier. I have used it twice - only one drop in each ear, rub, let cats run and hide. Then I gave off one day and did it again the next day. I am going to try and use it for a week and if their ears don't clear up take them into the vet. I was told by a vet they didn't have ear mites, just dirty ears... but not sure if they picked it up in a month as their ears looked a bit dirty. They never really itched their ears, but they did have the black stuff in them. I am going to give it a go since the cats do seem happier the next day... but it was a concern after the first time I gave the medicine to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It helps.

It certainly is cleaning the cats ears out, and she scratches far less, but it is really not a pleasant thing for her...I guess this is what we get for taking in an orphaned cat...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I found nothing original in this book.

Most of what can be learned from this book can be found by reading the table of contents, but Jeffrey Gitomer felt the need to belabor each point ad naseum. Gitomer uses catch phrases splashed across pages in big fonts apparently to fill space. He has a certain arrogance that I found distracting.

The book is clear, easy to understand, and humorous. It's also hard-hitting & forces the serious service provider to take a hard look at themselves and their businesses. I gave a service orientation for my co-workers based largely on the contents of this book. The results were astounding. Even the most jaded of our service providers were overflowing with questions, comments and excitement. Anyone who works with the public should read this book. Just a note: If you are curious as to what happens if you take the opposite approach, check out another great book, \\"It's Not My Department\\" by Peter Glenn.

He goes through the process of helping you discover what you're doing right and what needs improvement. This book also points out the importance of the individual in business for promoting or hurting future sales.

In my experience, this message is a very superficial and one-dimensional approach to understanding customers. For well-known examples of companies doing a great job of creating loyal staff and customers - like USAA, Rosenbluth International, Fed Ex, State Farm, MBNA, Southwest Airlines and Ritz-Carlton - service is just one element of their success. Companies like these are so committed to their customers, every process is targeted at building value.

The author completely says, even in the title, that customer satisfaction is worthless - which is completely untrue. No real plan given.

This book is very helpful in regards to gaining a fuller understanding of how the two bodies process differently.Joanne Kanute, Certified Master Life Coach"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Dr. Gray!","review":"I was shocked to discover that the product Dr. Gray so enthusiastically recommends as a once- or even twice-a-day meal substitute, actually contains a laxative (cascara sagrada). I doubt that this is medically sound advice.It is listed on the ingredients statement, but many people may not know what cascara sagrada is and what it does. And even though it is a natural herb, taking it twice a day for a sustained period of time is not healthy, and is contraindicated for people with certain intestinal conditions. Shame on you, Dr. Gray--and on your friends at Isagenix--for not pointing this out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought two copies of this book after hearing him on COAST to COAST AM. I planned to give one to my sister. Well I should have read the reviews from normal people first. I notice the excellent reviews all come from other authors or co-authors or those somehow in the diet or doctor field. I am having a difficult time getting anything out of this book. I find it's presentation frustrating, and a lot of gobblety gook. I tried to find specific information I heard on the show and am having an aweful time doing so. I like a book where I can go to a chapter you \\"think\\" is about what it says it is about, and goes to the point without fancying up and saying a lot of nothing in the text. The highlighted text on each page throughout the book is very distracting. The font is too small (age I assume).

Some facts in the books seem dubious, \\"..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume.\\"However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they \\"feel\\" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr Gray is not a true doctor; fake credentials","review":"Check out his credentials and you will find he has a fake degree from a diploma mill; which has now been shut down.

This one starts out with Grover delivering an important \\"package\\" to Oscar, then it's followed by a series of \\"cookie\\" themes (including the familiar \\"C is for Cookie\\" song), and my personal favorite, the peacock that won't do the peacock dance despite Grover's showing him a training film made in China of little girls doing the peacock dance.

They have a split second of Mr. Hooper, they briefly show Maria and Louis getting married, didn't bother to show them meeting for guacamole for the first time, they showed when miles was adopted, but don't bother to point out olivia. They don't talk about when Gina came to sesame street. This is not a reminisant look back at all. It's let's put out yet another elmo dvd, and dumb down the show even more.

Once you watch it though, you realize that it is one giant plug for the little red beast who ruined a really good seires, Elmo. There was almost no reminiscence in the episode. You got five minutes at the end, with only a brief little blur that could have been Mr. Hooper. For a show that taught children how to deal with a lot of difficult issues, and where everything turned out okey-dokey in the end, this was a highly disapointing video.

Now once you can see the entire puzzle then again this book helps link the intersectiong letters and helps you figure out other parts of the puzzle.I think that it makes it much easier to learn the language when you can see the entire puzzle, after all if you can see the puzzle then you can place the pieces and move them around until it works.So far this has been my number 1 book that i refer to for explanations and to get an ideal of what is happening to the words that im reading.this book is incredibly cheap for the value of the knowledge it can offer to someone. at the time i paid 6 bucks for mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madrigals Magic Key to Spanish","review":"This book is easy to follow and the author made learning the language easy and fun as well.

I've always had problems with using and understanding verbs in their correct tenses and persons. I found out about the author, Margarita Madrigal, on a language forum and recalled that I already owned one of her books (I never read it). I then started reading the SEE IT & SAY IT IN SPANISH and the simple repetitious exercises in the book started unlocking my understanding in Spanish! Most language books are too lazy to use various tenses and persons. In many language books it seems like the popular thing to do with verbs is to mainly use the present tense in lessons and put all of the other uses in complicated verb charts/tables.

It's cool because I get to teach them a little English and they teach me some Spanish.....we enjoy each others company because it's not often you see a Gringo out working in the fields. Being able to speak with and listen to native speakers is always the best way to learn. This book though is indeed very useful, lots and lots of information and exercises.

In comparison to some, (like r.s. $500) it's way cheaper. Every language learning resource has it's place. This is great for an English speaker who wants to understand and make things simple, a little at a time. I like how the book starts with past tense. You aren't going to be fluent with one language resource. I'm not going to be fluent with just this book. You wont either. However, It's one cheap, fun, and effective way of solidifying some spanish in an English speaker.

The illustrations are line drawings by Mr. Warhol. As far as the book itself goes, it seems to be based on the concept that one can learn Spanish by learning the English-Spanish cognates - essentially memorizing long lists of words that are similar to their English counterparts. It doesn't spend much time on the structure of the language - at least, not initially. Different people have different ways of learning, but that doesn't work for me.

How nice to find an enjoyable piece of fiction that actually makes you think about your life and personal philosophy. And from a pure story-telling standpoint, there is a GREAT twist at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a well written and engrossing work","review":"the combination fo characters and excitement come together to form a breathtaaking work that is impossible to put down"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book (3rd edition) is a classic source for answers.","review":"I am familiar with the 3rd edition of this book. This text is the classic text in the field, and the original source for what a lot of other authors write about grounding and sheilding. It is fairly mathematical in its approach (and hence has a theoretical rather than purely practical bias), but if you have (for example) a transmission line problem on your circuit and can't model or fix it, you will be able to get a handle on the problem using this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More confusion added to a confusing subject","review":"In his book Morrison says he may have gotten a few things wrong.

We had to read this for class and my classmates agree that maybe the themes for \\"Culture\\" and \\"Economics\\" should switch. It feels like there is more on economics in the culture section and more culture in the economics section.However, it was a good read and was helpful information. It was just confusing on which theme is which."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compare","review":"This book is an eloquently written, serious, and original set of lectures. The book will interest political scientists as much as historians or just simple readers ( as myself) because of its explicit orientation to \\" International history\\" . There is a highlight of very deep manipulation of the concepts of power, economy, and culture in order to explain why his three eras-late Meiji, interwar, and postwar differ from each other.Well, is not a simple analysis, and is without spelling errors , not as some reviews about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Just like the other review above. This book was aweful. There were three chapters that werent really chapters at all. It was one long \\"history\\" book. I do not suggest this book to any East Asian History enthusiast. His facts were far and few between, and his facts were weak and could have been better. You could do far much better with a middle school history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one is a dud","review":"This is a series of shoddy lectures (142) the author did and then had run off. It is a shallow thematic history on hte relations between China and japan with special emphasis on hte pre World War period. The guy is a historian of sorts and the global bit of the title is to hide just how shallow is his knowledge. Harvard have obviously little to do with their money if they publish weak drivel like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"manga style","review":"manga style means this book is a glorified comic book. i wish i had known before i bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a detective who is not so P.C.!","review":"I loved the humor of detective John Corey. I laughed out loud through the whole book. People who were offened by DeMilles dialogue need to lighten up. I loved his witt and irreverence. DeMille painted Plum Island very eerily and chillingly. I felt the story moved at a good pace.Ree-views (Ree Mancini)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should get &#65533;the most obnoxious main character&#65533; prize.","review":"Lack of suspense coupled with the totally obnoxious \\"hero\\" of the story is way out of line with other Demille books that I\`ve read. I'm glad that I only borrowed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad. Not bad at all.","review":"First, I'd like to give the woman who wrote, \\"My husband laughed out loud while reading this book. My friends recommended it. I found it a complete waste of time.\\" a \\"10\\" for her review. It confirms no book is for everybody. I, for one, have no plans to read War and Peace in the next decade or so! I found this book to be very different from the other DeMille books. In most of his other books, DeMille's graphic descriptions create a great deal of horror and suspense. DeMille took a very different approach in Plum Island. There wasn't much suspense and the potential for horror was mitigated by the odd personality of the main character. Still, it was a good, entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is \\"Plum\\" good readin'","review":"I'm glad I read this. It was my first Demille book and won't be my last. I've already started The Gold Coast, and so far I like it even more.This is a story told by an NYPD detective who is recouperating from bullet wounds in one of the ritzy areas of Long Island. It involves murder, buried treasure, love (or perhaps more accurately, lust), greed, and biological warfare agents. Demille's use of dialog and voice of narration is great. It was so refreshing to read this after trudging through a Clancy novel. He must average two wisecracks a page. And I found all of them to be funny. That's probably why I like his writing style so much. Maybe it's not for everybody. I have a feeling there's more than a few women would get a little steamed by some of his remarks.This isn't a short read and there's not always a lot of action, but the story and writing style make it a page turner. Demille is now one of my favorites and I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Long Islander","review":"My father worked on Plum Island for a brief time in 1957, and my family lived in Greenport, where all of my mother's family were born and raised. Demille's descriptions of the areas, including the restaurants, hotels, etc. are definitely on the mark. I must admit I'd never heard any stories about Capt. Kidd's hidden treasures, so this was an unexpected and delightful surprise.The story line was rather ho-hum.....I'm pretty sure all the readers knew who the bad guy was fairly early on, and the final scene was a typical \\"Nancy Drew\\" stereotype.It's an interesting story to follow, and for anyone who lives or has visited Long Island, the book will bring back some memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"A big disappointment after reading the very entertaining \\"Gold Coast\\". The premise of \\"Plum Island\\" is unlikely, and the plotline soon becomes predictable. Worst of all, the dialog is insipid to the point of distraction. (People talk like this in bad TV movies and in cheezy novels --but not in real life.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"What a disappointment! An adolescent, misogynistic (is there any other kind?) NY cop as the hero of an amateurish story filled with two dimensional characters. The writing and story seemed so obviosly aimed at a screenplay, I kept being distracted by wondering if the author had Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson in mind for the role. It certainly would be fitting for a cheesey Die Hard- or Lethal Weapon-IV. And the boat chase was right out of Patriot Games. \\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" Jeez, Snoopy would have written a better tale. What on Earth kept this book on the Best Sellers List for so long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last","review":"This is the first book that I have attemptedto read by this author. For the first 40 percent ofthe book he was desccribing Plum Island and in toomuch detail. I didn't stick around to find outwho murdered the victims or why. Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit much on the macho wise cracks","review":"The story was ok. Overkill on the NY macho attitude. Not sure if I'll buy another DeMille book. I normally like murder mysteries but this one was too simplistic in the writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Suspense! Wow!","review":"Nelson DeMille has done it again with Plum Island. He tells this story with suspense gripping enough to keep you breathless all the way through, and keep the reader guessing 'til the end. I couldn't stop reading this tale of a mysterious and dangerous island where people fear chemical and other hazardous weapons are created and stored. I stayed up way into the wee hours reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The character development exceeds the plot","review":"Most thriller/mystery stories live and die by their plot lines. If that be the test, this one mostly dies. The author tips his hand (or perhaps wholly opens it) midway through the book. One gains the impression that he does so in order to use the balance of the book to sell an unsaleable plot. Without wshing to give it away, the entire plot hinges on a single unexplained (and unexplainable) assumption. Indeed, the only \\"mystery\\" in the last half of the book is the reader's (logical) reluctance to accept the profferred explanation of events. On the other hand, the author is a skillful writer, conveying a likeable protagonist and believeable dialogue. By far the most appealing aspect of the book is its insightful description of the residents of this small section of Long Island. The author's evocative recreation of his characters raises the product of a wholly unconvincing plot to an average book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corey makes you laugh out loud and roll your eyes!","review":"I read Lion's Game first, so my introduction to John Corey was a little out of order. My first DeMille book was Charm School and I fell in love with his work then. Lion's Game was better than Plum Island for Corey's quirky, eccentric characteristics, but he's such an interesting guy, you have to love him. The action is good. This book is a little predictable, but fun anyway. After these two Corey books, I do wonder how he ends up with the women, though.......Excellent author. I would always recommend Nelson DeMille."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this book down","review":"Over the past several years, I have found it difficult to find spare time to read anything other than assigned textbooks. A friend told me that Demille was an exceptional writer and recommended this book. The first day I covered 8 chapters in a period of 2 hours and finished the book within a weeks time. Also found myself reading for longer periods of time as the story line kept me interested. Those who say that Demille's ability to write page turners has only improved have my attention. He is an outstanding writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Island","review":"I'm half way through this book and I can't put it down! I've read a few other books by DeMille, all also great, but this is the best so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum island","review":"Well written, funny murder mystery. Demille is a great story teller. I can't wait to read another of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE DeMille","review":"DeMille really takes the reader on a whirlwind adventure in this novel. I was having heart palpitations!!! There seems to be no end to his story telling abilities. Can't really give much of a review without giving away some of the plot.....suffice to say \\"this is book you cannot put down\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Corey - you either love him or hate him","review":"Nelson DeMille introduces the main character of John Corey in Plum Island, who is later used in The Lion's Game. John is witty, sarcastic, and chauvenistic, which you either love or hate. Personally, I got a kick out of following John through his investigation and pursuit of the bad guys, and thought that John's flaws kept a good human quality to the book when so many books have a nearly flawless main character.A good read, which DeMille improves upon in The Lion's Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long way behind his earlier efforts, Rivers of Babylon, et","review":"This book like some of his previous tales, Spencerville, Gold Coast are a long way behind his earlier books. His earlier tales were of the unput downable, but I struggled through this one. I think Mr Demille like a number of his peers is living on his past reputation and not putting the effort into his work. I will think twice before investing in any more of his work, always assuming of course he does go to the trouble of publishing any more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plum Island What a let down!!!","review":"I was hooked within the first 200 pages. I loved it. It was exciting it was believable. I was telling everyone about this book and was thrilled to find on a road atlas, Plum Island restricted area just like the book! But the twist in the story line killed it for me! Stolen treasure!!! be serious. It's like Mr. Demille left and another writer who obviously thought the story needed something finished it. Is this customary for Demille? I've purchased another one of his books and have not opened it for fear wasting my time. I like surprises, but pirate treasure? - from top secret government agencies, CIA, FBI, to pirate treasure? Perhaps I missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I was always right","review":"Books where the main character always seems to know what's going on while other characters stand around clueless always irritate me. This is exactly one of those books.While the writing is good, and the storyline an interesting premise, Demille's characters are just too unbelievable. His main detective questions everything (and is always right) and everybody else kind of just takes a back seat.The villain is fleshed out nicely until the end where we get the cliche maniac, and the book is probably 75 pages too long.This is the first book I have read by this author and I can't say this title made me want to try another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read a different PLUM ISLAND than everyone else ?","review":"Maybe I read a different version of PLUM ISLAND than everyone else, but I thought this was horrible. What happened to stories like The Charm School and The Gold Coast ? The first 200 pages kept my interest and then it was all down hill with a let down of an ending. Interested in a real good story like DeMille used to be ? Read Jon Land's THE WALLS OF JERICHO or David Morrell's EXTREME DENIAL...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"My husband laughed out loud while reading this book. My friends recommended it. I found it a complete waste of time. I stuck with thinking it would get better but it didn't. I'm told I should give some of his earlier books a try. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, crude humor, sexist.","review":"Most of the other reviewers touched on the same problems I had with the book. It was way too long for what it is. The humor is right out of middle school. Most of the humor is sexist.You should pass one this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche & predictable story, boring lead characters","review":"As a fan of the Spencer for Hire novels, I enjoy the crime novel genre. We all expect the tough-guy detective with a sharp wit and lots of disdain for the bad guys - its required. This book brings us a boring detective with a sense of humor that falls flat and a little too much distain for just about everyone. Maybe its just coincidence, but I get the impression that DeMille heavily and unsuccessfully 'modeled' the character after the Spencer character.The most annoying aspect of the book is that the real plot was obvious pretty early on - even before the author starts sprinkling the \\"Ping\\" comments throughout the story just to make sure you get all the clues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissatisfied!","review":"Ordered a new book; received an obviously used book, with no dust cover and worn hard cover. Wrote to the seller, never received an answer. If I had wanted a used book, it would have cost 4 or 5 dollars. Paid twenty-five; will never use Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character...","review":"This book was the best from Demille I have read so far. The wit that often makes me burst out in laughter is very distinctive. The character John Corey that has been created in this work is very likeable, although I don't think this style of writing about these kind of male thoughts appeals to a lot of women, but I might be wrong about that!? The main character is definately good for another story and I hope that Demille realizes that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Detective Corey","review":"This was my first DeMille book and I really enjoyed it. I liked John Corey and want to read more books with him as the lead. I also think the book dragged on a bit when persuing the murderer, but it was not enough to change my opinion that it was a really fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent beginning but not consistent to the end.","review":"This is one of my favorite authors. The book started out with his usual excellent storytelling. But, about halfway through, it is like a totally different author began. Very disappointing last half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have remained buried...along with the treasure","review":"You should stop reading this book after about Chapter 5. It starts with the introduction of a potentially great character in Detective John Corey, and an exciting scenario for a mystery. But DeMille cannot sustain the plot or the character, and from then on it limps its way to a dreary and inevitable conclusion.Reading DeMille is a hit or miss affair, and it certainly fun trying to guess what he is going write about next. Sometimes it works: General's Daughter, Gold Coast and Cathedral are all very different, but all work. Plum Island is a great disppoiontment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plum Island ... plum rotten","review":"Wait for the movie. Missing deadly viruses, natural disasters, car chases - it will all work better on the big screen. Bruce Willis will probably have the starring role (a la Die Hard).The most likeable characters in this book are the couple dead before page one. Do you really want to keep reading?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I certainly hope Nelson Demille is not turning into another novel machine, although it would appear otherwise. His last two efforts have left me wondering why I bothered to read them. Plum Island has its fun moments, but mostly I found it to be a silly, predictable novel. The main character of the story, John Corey, comes across as a chauvinistic smart aleck. Occasionally his humor is well placed and sparks a laugh, but mostly he comes across as a wisecracking, sarcastic know it all. The story is far fetched, and the characters lack depth. I think what makes this novel even more disappointing is knowing Mr. DeMille can and has written far better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Very entertaining story but a lot of details. They do all come together though. It was very unrealistic but that is why it is called fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"plum island","review":"it kept me gripped to the very end. nelson demille is a favorite of mine and has never disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Island","review":"I Like Nelson DeMille's style.

John Corey character is my favorite. Only wish he could write FASTER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me reading!","review":"This was a good read! I gave it a 4 for the story line and the interest it kept. I recommend it for a quick read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"While the author grabs your attention at the beginning he seems to have lost interest (like myself) in the middle of the book. If it were not for it being my first Kindle book I would have put it down. The plot change mid narrative is just stupid and overworked.Pirate treasure? Give me a break. I kept hoping he would lose the pirates and salvage the book. It never happened.While I like cop humor the author has dumbed down Corey's sense of it to the middle school level.(sorry kids). Also, while the last third of the book picks up in action, the actions of the protagonist are unreasonable, unbelievable (yes I know its ficton)and outright disgusting. He is no hero with honor - fictional or not. The sad thing is that the author set the stage for what could have been an absolutely riveting novel and seems to have just gotten lazy. Perhaps the publisher was on his back for a first draft. Whatever... read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of a \\"Demille\\"....","review":"A poorly written novel that is extremely predictable and has the feel of something manufactured, not a story. The first person perspective does NOT work since the main character is not defineable and has no redeeming qualities. The books feels like several scenes were stretched out to hit an editor's target like a lazy student trying to achieve a 10k word essay.Demille's Charm School, Cathedral, Rivers of Babylon are excellant stories, and books I plan to re-read. But Plum Island, (like Spencerville) left me with a feeling I had been cheated. A bad movie, I will walk out on, but a book is an investment. Don't make it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad.","review":"This is the first and last book I will read by this author. Everyone was raving about the book so I decided to read it. The detective, who I thought was not the least bit funny, was so annoying that if he were a real person I would probably kill him. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could a book this bad be published?","review":"John Cory is a macho, sex obsessed, obnoxious, smart alec, disgusting cop. He's also a case of arrested development, with the mind of a high school sophomore who spent most of his time in the bathroom. In between making insulting or boorish comments to, or about, everyone he meets, There are pages and pages of drivel; pointless conversations or observations on nothing anyone would want to waste time with. I don't know how the book ends. I don't even care; it ended for me when I cheerfully tossed it into the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"This is the first novel I have read featuring Detective Corey, and will frankly be my last. I found the plot and actions of the characters to be extremely unrealistic. The book dragged in so many places, and left me wanting less! I read the whole book as I hate to leave books unfinished and it helped me fall asleep, but on the whole I thought it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken reality","review":"Fiction is a remarkable phenomenon. It begins as anunread sequence of words, the whimsical constructionof the author's mind. But as the pages pass, the realitygels, the events become meaningful, the author disappears.But sometimes work strains the suspension of disbelief to thebreaking point. The veil of reality disappears, and one isagain left with words... words of the author's design,the events they describe without importance or causal connection.This is what happens with Plum Island.It isn't a total loss. Some of the character interactions,through most of the book, are compelling, and the descriptionof the local culture sustains interest. But the end-gameis where it falters. Drama surrenders to silliness. The readeris betrayed.I haven't ready anything else from Demille, and probablywon't. I instead recommend Robert E. Parker's Spenser series(I recommend starting from the beginning) as superiorin virtually all aspects -- it's a far better executionof the same style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Further Information on Plum Island","review":"If you want more on Plum Island,read Lab 257 by Michael Carroll to get more elaborate info on this place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story-telling style, great mystery novel","review":"Nelson DeMille is witty, sarcastic and entertaining in this mystery concerning the deaths of two Plum Island scientists. The story was good, but the best part of this book was the sarcastic style it was written in, I laughed outloud many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, snappy read, with wit and charm.","review":"Overall a fine story with fast pace, interesting characters and lots of laughs along the way.

The main detective is annoying with his wise guy attitude and the finale is totally unbelievable. A good one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This book was a disapointment. I just read \\"Mayday\\" which was exciting and terrifying. But this? I liked the jargong of the antihero. But why has always, always, the girl/woman who are sexually free - have to die? And why does the hero always have to end up with the \\"good cop\\". This book is filled with good dialouge and good craftmanship. But the sexual frustration and predictable social storyline let the whole concept down to only two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacation book.","review":"This book is much different than your generic murder thriller. It is written with quite a lot of wit. This is a somewhat comical, very relaxing, yet suspenseful story ----- perfect for a reading on a vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Cop or Inadequate Vigilante?","review":"The main character in this book is a horribly sexist homicide detective who in the real world would have been drummed out (and probably jailed) for blatant disregard for the constitution.

Nothing to recommend here."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fav's","review":"This guy is a master story teller. I love his John Corey character. Great sense of humor too!

Im not going to spoil anything here but i will say that toward the middle/end of the book new information is realized and the story was not what i had expected it to be at all (which is not necessarily a bad thing) I found the book to be very entertaining throughout and would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing Well Written Suspense Novel","review":"I can be a bit biased when it comes to Mr. Demille's novels. Living on Long Island, where many of his stories take place, I know they are spot on geographically & by description, as well.The author tells this story very well. It's long, but not boring by any means. His characters are developed very well. They almost pop off the pages at you.I know Plum Island & the surrounding North Fork areas well, right down to Claudio's. Mr. DeMille takes the true accurate description and leads the reader into thinking the crux of the story revolves around the actual goings on at Plum Island.He then gently switches gears and the reader discovers the real reason behind the murders & mayhem. It becomes a novel which one hates to have end.I've always thought John Corey, the main character, a bit over the top with his corny jokes. I think DeMille needs to tone him down. But, that's minor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a good editor","review":"Longer than it needed to be. The reason for the murders was explained over and over by the main character.

Very llittle to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the irresistible John Corey and you won't be disappointed!!!!","review":"Convalescing in the North Fork of Long Island, NYPD cop John Corey is asked by the local police chief to look into the murder of a young couple. The Gordons worked as scientists at Plum Island, a Government research site, on biological diseases such as Ebola and Anthrax. Could the Gordons' have tried to sell samples of the disease to the wrong people? Or could the answer be routed in the past, since Plum Island has a notorious history going back to the pirates who frequented it. Corey is definitely one of the wittiest characters I've ever come across. I love his flippant attitude. The pirate lore was fascinating, and I was totally surprised by the plot twist toward the end of the book. This will not be the last John Corey book I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelson DeMille rocks","review":"I have all of Nelson DeMilles books. I throughly enjoy them.

Always like his books and will cont to inform other people to read his books. This one was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 3/4 of a Book","review":"I loved reading this book on my vacation. The mystery of Plum Island was a great idea. I also enjoyed the local flavor. I was disappointed with the ending which turned into a Rambo Styled Boat Chase. In general I find many of Demilles work to suffer from poor endings. Cathedral was also an excellent 3/4 of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty bad read.","review":"I wish I has read the one and two star reviews listed here previously. I found them infinitely more entertaining than the book, and maybe I could have saved myself a few bucks.Contrived and predictable characters, s-l-ow to no pace, and an embarrassing B-movie ending (beer-guzzling and wise-cracking while being shot at on a boat in a hurricane with a bleeding colleague? Puh-leeze!) made this book a turkey!I'll have to take the word of Mr. Demille's faithful readers that he has writtten books of some merit. Unfortunately, this was my first encounter with this author and I don't intend to repeat the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading some of Mr. Demille's previous books, like The General's Daughter, Catherdral, and The Charm School, I found this book to be very disappointing. The premise and storyline were fine. His main character was over done. I grew tired of his sophmoric sense of humor. It spoiled the story for me. I think he was trying to imitate the main character from \\"The General's Daughter\\", a much better book and character..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horrible!!!!","review":"I live in the little village of Greenport, which the author mentions once or twice. The novelty of reading a story involving a place I lived in was gone by page 10. Silly me, I stuck with the book until about page 50. I found the main character to be extremely obnoxious and annoying, and found myself skipping some of the paragraphs because the writing was so tedious. Do yourself a favor and forget about this one. Dr. Suess is more suspensful that this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"If you are telling a story through the eyes of your main character, he better be likeable. This guy, John Corey (I think), was not likeable. The first 200 pages were fair, although overburdened with irrelevant details and overbaked character development. The plot twist in the middle of the book was preposterous and far less interesting then the original path the storyline was following. I would avoid this book, not a good Demille effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcooked Cynicism can only make a writer worse","review":"\\"Are you John?\\" \\"None other.\\" How could a person answered a stranger like that? How could John Corey could become a detective if all he could do was jerking around to other people in a murder case with a totally unrealistic and absurd attitude? The writing is so loose that until page 100, the jerk detective could only find an ice box was missing on the victims' boat. We only read lot of unnecessary and extremely absurd dialogues between or among unfamiliar people. This time, Demille was totally lost and become a overkilled cynical melodrama writer as unapproriate as the hero, John Corey, as he created. I regret to find all the dialogues in this book were just like adding hollow bricks. A book which could be finished under 250 pages being ballooned into a farce over 500 pages. Such a terrible way to waste the precious paper material"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Author!!!!!!","review":"Coming from a Long Island NY background, I love how most of Nelson' books take place there, Love his sarcastic satiric writing style.

I lost count how many times this guy wrote either \\"whatever\\" or \\"something or other\\" throughout the first 200 pages (I put it down after that, anyone want my copy?). This had the makings of a good read, but his disjointed writing style and first person narrative was too much to take. I, like most people, appreciate humor in one's writing. However, his attempt at humor seemed to be forced and a bit too frequent. It became harder and harder to turn a page with any enthusiasm. Save your money on this \\"effort\\" or whatever it's called (please note the irony)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, stutters and falls","review":"My first Demille's book and it was recommended to me by a lady .. she had'nt read this book either, but had apparently read others and said \\"This guy writes well\\".I thought I'd made the right choice and really liked the book - at first. I recommended the book to lots of people and even presented the book to a colleague who was leaving us. Around the 250th page or so, the author begins to lose focus and it becomes quite a chore to finish the book. There is no element of suspense and the book just drags along.As another on-line reviewer had mentioned, there's ample scope for Bruce Willis to display his wares !I do like his language and his \\"sexist\\" humour and caught myself unabashedly smiling and laughing at times.

Plum Island has it all for those looking for an exciting book to enjoy at the beach or anyplace else you go to escape and relax. It's loaded with well-developed characters, hot action scenes and light, breezy dialogue. The plot is always enteraining and fast-paced; although at times, a bit predictable.

Though not as heavy a topic as Spencerville, and certainly not a War and Peace, Plum Island is definitely an enjoyable read. Unlike other DeMille works where you want to turn the pages quickly, this one must be savored because of his witty dialogue. If you read too fast, you'll miss some of the best humor to be written in some time. People at the beach wondered what I was suddenly laughing about. He truly has created a real life character. Women may not appreciate him as much as men, but he's definitely a memorable protagonist. Great summer read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Nelson Demille hate women?","review":"I was so disappointed in Nelson Demille's latest offering, Plum Island. His hero seems to never think of women in any context but sexual and the red herrings the author throws at his readers are given way too much time and attention. The real culprit was not believable....I would have bought an international biological warfare coverup before I believed a crass little man. . . well, I don't want to give away the story.The way the narrator of the story views and handles women also leaves a lot to be desired. If he wasn't thinking with his zipper, he was working on a way to get his partner or a comely shopkeeper into his (or any handy) bed.I was very disappointed in Plum Island. I loved other Demille tales, but this one fell short in a myriad of ways"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone hates him, everyone loves him?","review":"How can one guy haave all the luck?

Maybe not his best, but still worth it. The main charactor is just that, funny, rude, smart and human. The story goes in a direction that is not expected and somewhat \\"off the wall\\" but who wants predictability? There are sections that dragged a bit, but the book grabbed me from the start. I laughed out loud and looked forward to my evening time with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best.","review":"I was disappointed. I was expecting a great read like the \\"Gold Coast\\". The story showed promise in the beginning. Unfortunately, the story took an unbelievable turn into pure fantasy. Toward the end of the exhausting story, Mr. Demille throws in a hurricane. Every trick in the book was tried, just doesn't work with \\"Plum Island\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Island: A mystery told with a sense of humor!","review":"I would highly recommend Plum Island to mystery lovers. Nelson Demille is hilariously funny as he describes his characters...though some women may find his humor offensive in that the main character is very sexist and quite horney throughout the novel. The story itself is interesting and provocative! If you're intrigued by pirate legend and government coverups...you'll enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book's beauty lies in the details.","review":"I have attempted to read this book on many occassions but somehow I have never been able to get past a certain point with all of the details. But Nelson DeMille is my absolute favorite author and I knew that if I just kept holding on the pay off would be big. This book is true to form. It is slow to develop both in terms of the plot and the characters. But once this book takes hold (like all of DeMille's for me) you cannot put it down. The last 200 pages are suspenseful and funny. I should say the entire book is funny even though about death as seen through the eyes of Det. Corey. Why 5 stars if I had to struggle through the first half of the book? Well, DeMille has huge payoffs and this one did not disappoint. All of the details mean something and add to the ultimate enjoyment. I have never been disappointed in DeMille book. So if you like books that slowly place the dots and then connects them (through a sarcastic NYPD detective)this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet John Corey!","review":"John Corey is a convalescing NYPD homicide cop in Long Island after gunshot wounds received in the line of duty. Corey does not like to play by the rules and his keen instinct lead him to solving the mystery of the murder of his two friends. Corey, while arrogant at times, is still a very likeable character for his undaunted determination for tracking down the killer.This is my third Nelson Demille book after Charm School and Lion's Game, both of which I highly reccommend. Nelson Demille's strength is in his clever writing and humor. It is also a very good read if you enjoy murder mysteries. If you like John Corey, you should also go on to read Lion's Game, where John Corey tries to outwit a Libyan terrorist with a score to settle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plum paste my taste","review":"I am 85 and still living with Agatha Christie and her crowd.

This is my first Nelson Demille book and I couldn't wait to go buy up all others that I could find. John Corey is great. His character is superbly developed, and very believable. The storyline and Demille's way of conveying the story makes it very hard to put down. I really appreciate the fact that nothing was \\"over the top\\" or unbelievable. I recommend this book highly to anyone. Great job Mr. Demille! I just started reading The Lion's Game and am hoping that Corey is not killed off. Keep him coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing turn of storyline","review":"Started out the book expecting something exciting on the line of \\"Virus vs. Earth\\" and instead got an obnoxious \\"Columbo does Treasure Island\\".

The bad guy was determined early and yet the author had some twists and turns and a high level of excitement that made the ending a page turner anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun till the ridiculous end","review":"Plum Island started out well. A convalescent policeman becomes involved in an odd murder investigation. He becomes interested in an intelligent policewoman. Then he starts to get macho. The ending is beyond belief. Although Mr. Macho claims to know little about boats, he takes a speedboat out into the turbulent waters between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean during a hurricane. And he has a couple of beers while doing so. The supposedly sensible policewoman goes along and is mightily impressed. Ugh. Then it gets sillier. I was, in the end, quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"I have read most of Mr. Demille's works and totally enjoyed GOLD COAST and THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER. PLUM ISLAND is a disaster! It seems as if the author is trying to create a \\"gum shoe\\" of the 40's and 50's but fails dismally. John Corey, the NYPD detective, is all smart mouth. For pages on pages on pages, NOTHING HAPPENS. Then, maybe, a clue. All of a sudden, this smart mouth becomes the greatest detective on earth. Too much talk and smart remarks and too little action and plot. If Demille is tyring to make John Corey the \\"gum shoe\\" of the 90's, I'm not buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nelson Demille wrote THIS book?","review":"I loved Charm School and The Gold Coast, so when I read the blurbs on the cover of Plum Island that this novel combined the best of both styles I was excited to start reading. What the heck happened to my Nelson Demille? It's hard to believe the same man wrote all three books. I kept waiting for Plum to \\"kick in\\" but it never did. In fact, it turned out to be extemely corny. I read a review that suggested that it was meant to be a parody. Who knows? A MAJOR disappointment.If you've never read Demille before don't start with this one. You'll might be so underwhelmed with ND that you might miss the EXCELLENT Charm School and Gold Coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is typical of DeMille's work...","review":"I began this book with great hopes, but was very disappointed. First of all, I found John Corey tedious, with his constant wise cracks and gods-gift-to-women behavior. I kept waiting for the \\"mind twisting suspense\\" to happen, but it never did. The story line was weak, with Corey deciding who the murderer was in the middle of the book, and then we just get to watch him act out his revenge, without any real proof or justification till almost the end. I guess we're just all expected to cheer for Corey, but he's so obnoxious and so vicious, that I found myself hoping he was wrong! Nothing is \\"hair-raising\\", except his sadistic behavoir towards the murderer. I seriously doubt that I'll waste money on any of DeMille's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great story.","review":"How in the world could Demille move from the potential intrigue and excitement of biological terrorism to the ridiculous fantasy of pirate's treasure. This book could have been done in well under 200 pages. I was very disappointed with Demille's earlier works but thought I would give him another try. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of the reader's time","review":"After reading and thoroughly enjoying Demille's earlier works, I was completely turned off byPlum Island. The writing, characters and plotare juvenile at best, and a travesty at worst. Has what was once a talented writer turned trite and commercial like the now disappointing John Grisham? Demille's protagonist, an NYPD detective, is such an obnoxious, arrogant pain-in-the-neck that he discolors the entire story early on. I gave up on Demille and thestory by page 100 and have decided to donatethis bit of garbage to my local library withpity for any readers who may check it out inhopes of a good summer read. My recommendationis to leave Plum Island on the shelf and pick up \\"The Perfect Storm\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plum lsland","review":"I had read gold coast,which was wonderfully rich.

From the start you are engrossed in the story and will keep turning the pages until you have run out of time or reached the end of the book. The story line takes a suprising twist that is sure to have your imagination working in overdrive. The main character will make you laugh with his wit and his private thoughts. I grew very attached to the characters and wished the book was longer. I would like to see Mr. Deville put John Corey in more of his future books. This is a character that needs to have more adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"I think Nelson DeMille is a fantastic writer. In fact, I'm going through withdrawal waiting for his next book, which seem to take longer each new title. While Cathedral and Word of Honor were excellent, Plum Island is the beginning of something special. I think this was the first book for which he wrote a sequel, which is probably because John Corey was such a compelling character. The Corey character, all the way to his latest title \\"The Lion,\\" is still as interesting and irrepressible as ever. I won't get into the story, there are a bunch of them here already. This book is especially well researched, and the detail of their visit to Plum Island made me think I was there with them. A great book, a great series.Let me come back and edit my original comment.

I think with the \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" era being repackaged as much as it is and Van being an 'album artist', he doesn't do compilations all that often. \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" was the most recent, but those were rarities.This is a great intro to Van's music, but nothing tops \\"Astral Weeks\\" from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Morrison still Rockin","review":"This CD is good but....

This song was featured in the female buddy film Thelma and Louise. I love the track Moondance. It sounds so groovy. I did not know it was featured in the movie An American Werewolf In London though. I feel like renting the movie just to see how the song was used. The classic hit Gloria is another favorite of mine. This song was featured in the movie The Outsiders.

I was expecting to read something that would add to my knowledge but was very disappointed. Her strictly religious viewpoint causes her to see things as fitting into her already learned beliefs, thereby missing much of the 'bigger picture'. The angel stories were nice - much like those in any other publication about angels.I'm sorry I bought it and won't be buying any more of her books. Would that she were as enlightened as she thinks she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is wrong","review":"This book only has about 50% right about angels, the rest is wrong. One reason I think this is because she says that a person with no gaurdian angel is a dark entity, and I don't have one, but I'm certainly not a dark entity! There are plenty of people I know who don't have a guardian angel and are not dark entities!Also, angels do have personalities,they have emotions like us! They could also take the form of anything, even how thay look like without wings.So, Sylvia Browne only understands little about angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"No delays or any noticeable problems, just plugged into my modem and ran the line to my computer and a great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice transaction","review":"Well, I did not have any problem in this transaction.

He repays the favor by being the official Microsoft apologist. If Stross had some technical knowledge (rather than being a historian) he might have been capable of reaching some independent judgments. As it is, he merely parrots the Microsoft line at every point. He even repeats the ludicrous claim that Microsoft is not a monopoly.

Purchasers have the right to expect better from authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"very biased view of Microsoft","review":"While there are some interesting insights to some of Microsoft's history, this book skips over vast territories of non-competitive behavior.There's nothing on how the Microsoft overcame their competitors in the application spaces (word processing, spread-sheet, presentations, etc). Instead the book spends most of it's time on how Microsoft cultivated the CDROM as a new medium.The author had access to Microsoft employees and lost his objectivity due to this. The first few chapters could have been written by Microsoft's PR department.The author's idea of Microsoft uniqueness: Microsoft tries to hire smart people. I'm sure there will be a Harvard MBA case study on companies which went out of their way to hire the mentally deficient and how that wasn't an effective strategy against Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Sided","review":"This book had some good information about the history ofM.S. but was very 1 sided.

Instead it was a watered-down tail of how MS likes to hire smart people. Its sad to see how such a respectable historian could be duped by MS into thinking their success lies in good honest leadership and hard-word.

I loved this book until the very end, when Lena speaks of Marilyn's visit by her half sister, Bernice. She states Marilyn was approached by her sister as if Marilyn had never heard of her. There are pictures and facts of the two sisters meeting first when Marilyn was married to her first husband. This total absence of their meeting is a big blow to the entire \\"Confidential\\" book for me. How can Lena not know the two sisters had met many years earlier if Marilyn had truly confided in Mrs. Pepitone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to take seriously","review":"This is an interesting book indeed. Unfortunately I find most of what's written very hard to believe. The way Pepitone describes Monroe goes against almost everything else that has ever been written about her. The book paints her as a lazy, dumb, immature and half crazy child. I kept an open mind while reading it but when the author claimed that Monroe had a child in her early teens I took the rest of the book with a grain of salt. If you don't really care about how accurate the content is then go ahead and read it to get a good chuckle if nothing else. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being stabbed in the face with glass.","review":"I found this book horrifying.

All of those who can say they've made more people laugh than Jeff Foxworthy should raise their hand. That's what I thought. So easy to critisize, so hard to create. He must be doing something right, eh, naysayers?Having said that, Foxworthy's auto-biography revolves around his life growing up \\"Redneck\\" style. His early life in rural Georgia is chronicled in humurous detail, and his narrative is fairly light and easy to read and enjoy. He talks about getting started in Comedy, how he met his wife, and the birth of his daughters, all of it with a fun little wink and a light heart to make sure the reader is playing along. Unlike Engvall or Cable Guy's book, this one could be shelved either in humor or biography. An enjoyable read for anyone with an afternoon to kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, Foxworthy manages to destroy my faith in humanity.","review":"I've never liked Foxworthy.

The sibling connection is never made, the relationship with her teetotaling mother never appears......it just left me empty.I found it curious that Montgomery is an editor, because at many points in this book I read and then reread a passage, wondering if I was missing something? There was often no succinct point to an entire paragraph. She jumped all over the place, and left her readers disconnected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for Insomnia","review":"I have to start off by saying honestly that I could not read the entire book, which is rare for me, particularly memoirs. I skimmed the middle section, just to get through it. This book is lacking in humor, insight or compassion. Without any of those redeeming qualities, you are left with a long drawn out story of somebody dying. Yes, the author comes from a \\"dysfunctional family.\\" So what? Don't we all! I so wanted to read something that would make this family likeable, or even interesting. Sad to say, I never found it. There is no animosity, no self pity, no drama, either. Even these would have been preferable to the blandness of this tale. My favorite character was the mom (no wonder she drank with that family - bo-o-o-oring!) but there isn't even much about her. What little is recounted is so detached it comes across as cold.

I'm sure most of the pieces are VERY expensive and I'm sure the textiles are too. I was hoping to bring Africa into my home in a very affordable way and I think this book is really for bucks up kind of people. Other than that the photos and rooms are exquisite and delightful.

And I have to say it's been nothing but problems for me. Half the time I can't get any computer to connect to it and recognize it. Then for some inexplicible reason it will stop communicating with the network, requiring to to basically reinstall all the stuff on your computer, lug the printer and the server down to your computer and plug it all in and redo it from scratch. Now that doesn't even work on the thing. So I've got a paperweight. SMC's tech support is even worse, assuming you can understand anyone there, which I could barely do.All around I've found this product to be less then thrilling in its usefulness.

Lynn Harris","review":"To avid readers this book is a bit breezy. Its a small book with few words printed on each page and a reading level of probably 8th grade. For people who do not read much or who just want an easy summer read then its perfect. It will leave the rest of us wanting a little more. The saving grace for this book is what has made Harris a best selling author---his character depictons. These characters are so real that you get caught up in their emotional rollercoasters. They're believable and may remind you of people you know. It was a creative little tale of romance, deception, sex and family issues. When the two main characters have to face their pasts head on, it reads like a high speed train wreck.

They are both so self centered and childish, I couldn't wait to finish the book so I'd be done with them. They both deserved what they got in the end. I hope that if there is a sequel there will be some sort of epiphany for both to help them become real people and give them some redeeming qualities or I will just have to give up on them altogether.

I read a lot, across many different genres ,and I can't say much more than this book is poorly written. I could not have cared less about the characters and what happened to them. The only consolation was that the book was written at such a basic level that I got done with it in about 4 hours. I cannot figure out how people can give it five stars... especially if they are extensive readers.The copy I picked up had been in a high school library.

All of the main characters spend the book lying to each other and practicing deceit. None of them are particularly likeable, and their dialogue and sex scenes are mawkish, but there's a cheap thrill in the jaw-dropping coldness with which they treat each other.It's a cute way to empty your head for a few hours before you read something more substantial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read... interesting story.","review":"This was the first book by Harris that I have read.

Yancy like Basil has made brief apperances in other ELH novels but this is the first time we get to read her story. When these two get together it's truly explosive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but a good read nonetheless","review":"I read this book in one sitting. Harris knew we were hungry for what Basil would do next, and this was the expected dose. Like his other works, he starts the plot off running, adds in a few unconventional but expected twists and wraps the book up too quickly. The one aspect I did like about this book is that I felt that Harris is getting a firmer grasp on characterization. He develops his two main characters, puts them under pressure, and shows how they react. Much better than some of his other endeavors, but still waiting for his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back E. Lynn Harris!!!","review":"After the his last disappointing and boring novel, E.

I started reading it right there and finished before they kicked me out. I'm glad to see another side to Basil and that he handled Ava/Yancey with the slickness of a cat.

I think NOT - - Superb Writing!","review":"I've read Invisible Life, and Just As I am by E. Lynn Harris. Undoubtedly, his storytelling is as powerful and riveting as real life itself. Although I haven't been committed to his series, I found myself right at home with his novel \\"Not a Day Goes By\\". I read the book in five hours! It was like an addiction that came about suddenly. I picked up the book and I couldn't put it down. Mr. Harris definitely earns my full attention with his debut of \\"Not a Day Goes By\\". He was very detailed and I didn't feel lost at all by his masterful storytelling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a minute went by.","review":"E. Lynn Harris latest saga was a TRIP. When I started this book, I knew then I was not going to put it down till I finished. Every word kept me engrossed and entertained. His characters were out of this world, they were wild, wicked, loveable and deplorable at the same time. Ironically, being a woman,I related and emphatized more with the Basil, the male character than Yancey. I thought Basil was so real. He was brilliant, amazing, gorgeous and yet possessed all the human frailities. Yancey was a disgrace to us women, She really was a sad woman who has a lot to learn about love, life and what it truly means to be successful. I was pleased with the end because Basil deserved a lot better than Yancey, he deserved to find love in either lane. E. Lynn Harris is a master story teller, he has wit, grace, charm and most of all the ability to draw the reader into that world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've always loved E.Lynn Harris' books, but this one failed to entertain me as they usually do. This book felt like a rush job; the characters were more like caricatures: soap opera-like and unbelivable, which is unusual for Mr.Harris as his characters are usually so life like. He relies too much on pop culture. There is an abundance of cliches. And I think Yancey and Basil's relationship should have been played out from the beginning. I can hardly believe Basil loves Yancey; just because he says so isn't enough. Show--don't tell--is the oldest writing tool in the book but it is the most effective. How did Basil make the transition from woman hating to woman loving? Well, this book in no way will deter me from reading E. Lynn's following books, because no one's perfect--he is allowed a few faults--and the previous books were so good that I shall keep the faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"mr harris's book was good as the rest of his books are i love e.lynn harris but i do not condone homosexuality it's wrong and i don't think anyone should but the book was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted!","review":"I was so shocked to see this man give credit to Jesus Christ for helping him write this book, and claiming Jesus as his personal Savior. The book is full of homosexual relations and relations out of wed lock, both are absolutely, spoken against in the Bible. He also has profanity in it. It is a slap in God's face, and puts a very bad reflection on real Christians. I did not read the book, I do processing in a library and discovered this by accident. If this is a best seller, it speaks pretty clearly of what our society is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Day Goes by that I wish I did not read this book","review":"I thought this book was terrible, the reviews were so misinforming.

It was refreshing to see old characters as Basil and Yancey tackle the issue of love. I felt the love, envy, hate, and betrayal in the story. The ending left open a small door for a sequel, and I loved the fact that Basil has grown emotionally. Maybe, Basil can reunite with his first lady love Yolanda, and may Basil find inner peace.

Mr. Harris has a unique talent for satisfying the cravings of his readers by conjuring up intricate plots that unravel as the reader briskly turns his pages. He teases us by leaving us wanting more, and answering our questions of 'how are Raymond, Trent, Nicole, Jared, Zurich, Sean,Yancey, and the sexily evil Basil?' only merely mentioning them in his next sequel. We never know if he's going to bring on of them back or move us into caring about the new people his brilliant mind can concoct. Mr. Harris has us in the palms of his gifted hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUILTY PLEASURE","review":"If you're looking for a easy, quick \\"summer read\\" this is it. Harris continues his always entertaining trials in the lives of characters introduced in Invisible Life. This go around cocky, bisexual footballer Basil takes the lead engaged to the snotty, conniving wanna be diva Yancey ( from Abide With Me ). While some of the dialogue sounds cheesy and forced, you will get so absorbed with the characters and story, you won't want to put it down. And then when it's over Harris achieves his goal of making you want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO, BETTER THAN THE LAST TWO!!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I didn't want to put it down. I was disappointed in Mr. Harris' last two books, but this one has made of for those. Yancey got exactly what she deserved. I usually don't like Braxton's character, but he was o.k. this time. If you haven't read Mr. Harris' other books, you must read them (at least the last one), in order to follow the characters in this one. Good Job, Mr. Harris!!

This book however leaves you hungry for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a silly soap opera","review":"I found it difficult to care about those two (Yancey and Basil). The only ones I could have any sympathy for were Windsor and perhaps Basil's sister, Campbell and Cade. After forcing myself to finish the book (it was a selection for my book club) I was starting to think something might be resolved for those two and that Yancey might grow up a bit and so might Basil, but alas, I was deprived of even that. Unfortunately, I feel that reading that book was an abysmal waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book was really good! I felt it gave Basil a 3-dimensional personality which had been lacking in the previous books. His personality became less centered around sex, which was a good thing. I didn't like Yancy's character, because of what she was, until the end. When you read the novel, you will know what I mean. The end left a lot of things in the air, so I hope Mr. Harris, gives them, another voice in his next novel. I hope you all will enjoy the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Formatting","review":"\\"The Task\\" is a wonderful read, but don't bother with this file.

I'm watching it online, and I haven't seen the last episode, but this series is wonderful.For those of you who shy away from boys loving other boys, do not fret. This anime, from what I know, only has one Yaoi kiss, and they only did it to get a pursuing girl to stop chasing one of them (I will not tell ANYTHING of this anime. No spoilers here!), so you shouldn't worry too much about it.Also, the dressing up is just for perks. To learn how the \\"Princess\\" thing started, watch the anime. It's well worth your time and money.Another thing that you must know is this: this anime doesn't contain too much. There's really no pairings except for one straight pairing, and ALL of the characters are straight, so really, this isn't Yaoi.

I don't want to give the movie away. Therefore, I will keep it generic. This movie was boring, predictable and all around dumb. It's like they made a movie only because Vampires are the it thing right now, but they didn't think about the plot. The movie tried to be humorous, with a couple of entertaining moments.

Poitier plays a reporter who comes aboard to do a story about it all---I know it's heretical to say so, but I've never cared much for Poitier---I respect the fact that he broke down a lot of barriers for black actors and all of that, but he's one of those actors that never seems \\"natural\\" to me---I'm always aware that he's \\"emoting\\".

When I try to start the microwave, it would come on and then shut down after 10 seconds. It appears that many of the Panasonic microwaves has this same problem. I had tried unplugging it for a hour to let the electronics reset without success. Since the warranty has run out and the cost of Panasonic repairs are outrageous, my only option is to scrap this microwave and buy another. Until Panasonic can resolve their manufacturing problem, I would not buy another Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Died On Me!","review":"Okay, we bought this microwave in December 2004. It lasted 10 months until today. Now, you would think 10 months is better than 1 month, but when you spend more than $100, this microwave should at least last 1 year. Hello??? I am currently contacting Panasonic to see if I can have mine replaced. What a bad a product. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!! And wasn't even the cheapest when we first bought!","review":"Had to rig it to make it work! Very poor quality engineering!!! Door wasn't shutting all the way.

It just completely stopped working without warning. The timer would come on for about three seconds but the oven did not work, then it would shut down. I've had it less than three years. Call me naive, but I thought microwaves lasted around 5-7 years. No matter how pretty it is, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 1 year","review":"This Panasonic microwave stop working after 1 year.

However, after only two months or so, one of the cars does not work anymore. Replaced batteries and it will start up when you shake it, but not go.

You have to know a quite a few names of the dance steps, and the minute you get the step down, they move on to a another combination. I had a very hard time following it.

Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I am a huge fan of Michelle Dozois, but unfortunately didn't like this workout at all. I thought the steps were very confusing, and would take me quite a while to master. I think this workout would be fine if you really enjoy dance style aerobics, but if you are looking for more straight forward aerobics, this isn't the workout for you. I think Shape had a good idea as far as the format, set, music, and overall production quality, I just wish this would have been a non-dance style aerobics workout. Hopefully, they'll come out with something like that for us non-dancers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"I really like the instructor Michelle Dozois. She teaches in the 10-minute solution series. That's mainly why I bought this dvd. I was dissapointed with it. The only routine I like is Dance Party. Other than that I think the routines are so-so. Maybe it's just me. I am more athletic and don't really like dance style to get fit. For fun, I think it's great. I don't really recommend this if you are trying to get a good cardio workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Video","review":"This video does not match the description given.

Michelle Dozois offers user-friendly instruction, where Lisa Wheeler tends to just perform a movement and expect the viewer the catch on. The routines are learnable, so don't give up! The pilates segment afterward is a great idea, but Lisa moves from one position to the next so quickly that I don't expect you get much benefit. I'd award Michelle 5 stars, and and Lisa, 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst video I've ever owned","review":"This video is, by far, the worst exercise video I have ever owned. I regularly salsa dance and have taken dance classes since I was young, so the combinations aren't too difficult. The instructors just aren't very good - especially Lisa Wheeler! She goes into a move without prompting the viewer.Instead of doing this video a few times to learn the steps, I would rather get a good cardio workout. I don't have time to memorize steps, and this tape isn't worth taking the time to learn. My advice...don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been working out at home w/ tapes/DVDs for almost 30 years, so I think by now I can grasp most choreography and routines relatively easily. Not with this one though. Not intuitive, lots of work to remember the steps with minimal rewards calorie-burning wise. Neither instructor was particularly engaging -- kind of frenetic. Weird, huge set that seemed neither a \\"living room\\" nor an outside environment. Basically, awkward, overly complicated, and left me feeling like I'd wasted an hour of valuable workout time. I really tried to like it ... it's in the Goodwill bag now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dancy and hard to follow","review":"I love the other Shape DVDs I have purchased but was not impressed with this one. The moves are very 'dancy' and don't provide a really challanging workout. Tracy was really hard to follow and the routines got old very fast. They also have a couple of 'extra' people just following along who look kind of silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are a dancer, forget this video!","review":"I bought this video hoping for a new fun workout, but unless you have a dance background you get lost following the fast paced moves. The back of the box says 'easy to follow dance-based segments', nothing easy about it. The instructors do not take their time to show the moves before jumping right into the combination of moves...a lot of foot action. Don't waste your money on this DVD! I'm going back to 'CRUNCH'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Dance Moves!","review":"Awful! Like other reviewers, you really need to watch this a few times before attempting to incorporate it into your workout routine. Unfortunately I didn't do that and was really frustrated. I made it through 1 segment before I gave up and tried a different workout video. I hate it when cardio moves are so complex that you can't follow along right away. The whole point is to motivate you to sweat off those calories. I just didn't find it easy to follow or motivating. I love some of the other Shape DVDs and I was really disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate dud from a great series","review":"I love the Shape workouts but this one is a dud. Really stupid workouts because they are too intricate to follow on the first time around but they don't get your heartrate up. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay video if you know the moves.","review":"I bought this DVD and was really dissappointed. Unless you have seen the video once or twice through before performing the movements, you're screwed. The instructors leave no time for you to learn and catch up in time. I was extremely frustrated within a short period of time, and their \\"get crazy!!\\" phrases got very old, very fast. This is my first video purchased with Shape, and it may very well be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardio....really?","review":"I am a 20-something woman who was looking for an intense cardio workout for someone who is out of shape but I completed all of the workouts on this DVD without breaking a sweat.

This is not a cozy mystery. Beloved family pets are not brutally, savagely murdered in cozy mysteries. I have read many mysteries, but I've never yet read one that would benefit from an animal being disgustingly murdered, much less one that is a family pet. I know this is fiction, a story, but that doesn't make reading about such an act any more palatable. This was a marginally good story, but it was completely wrecked by such a gratuitous scene. I will not be buying any more of this author's books, and I will be returning my copy of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series is going to get better; this isn't a bad start","review":"This is, for the most part, a fun read. The story takes on the task not only of developing its own plot, but of developing what will obviously be recurring characters in a series.Where the story succeeds is in its quirkiness: an unusual protagonist, describing lovely settings of the Pacific Northwest, some funny \\"bride-zilla\\" episodes. Things bog down considerably in some of the longer action sequences and in some of the dialog, which at times is stilted or implausible. There are a lot of subplots and a few seem to get lost rather than resolving.This isn't a bad start, and it seems likely that the series will improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Don't Know Much About..\\" Series is Excellent!","review":"I've read all of the books in the \\"Don't Know Much About..\\" series.

The audio version probably should not have been abridged. The author glances over some very important topics in history.

I have done a good deal of research about John Brown, and was encouraged to find three books by the real expert on this subject--Stephen Oates-- listed in Davis's bibliography. He must not have read the books, however, as he simply repeats the old prejudices that Oates did so much to disprove. And his summary of why the South seceded gives the impression that it was all the North's fault! A little knowledge is a dangerous thing; beware of anyone who promises to simplify the complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judgment colors everything","review":"I got very weary of hearing the author's judgments on virtually EVERYTHING in US history.

Washington did not nudge Henry Knox with the tip of his boot as he stepped into his boat to cross the Delaware. Knox did not travel in the same boat as George Washington. Knox was in charge of transporting the horses and artillery on the big ferry boats.2. Most of the men crossed the Delaware standing up. Big river ferries and freight boats (Durham boats) had few seats or none at all.

Davis does a very good job of overviewing American history in this book. His style is informative and very entertaining. The chapter titles such as \\"Apocalypse Then\\" are comically brilliant.The book does suffer from a case of terminal liberalism though. While Mr. Davis is more honest than most liberals are about historical figures and events (he does actually criticize people like FDR and JFK for certain things), still Mr. Davis's bias does distort his interpretation of some historical events. One example is of Reagan's 1986 bombing of Libya which he chalks up as just a botched assassination attempt.But if you can ignore the bias, the book is still an entertaining read (just don't take it as 100% gospel truth)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, Although Clearly Not Objective","review":"The author provides an interesting survey of American History up to and including the mid 1990s.

I bought it because I wanted a good un-opinionated look at American History. The author would have us believe he giving an unbiased portrayal of history, when in fact, his opinion is the most frequent occurence in the book. He takes great liberty in defining not only the actions but the motives of historical figures(how would he know their motive)? He sets himself up as judge of any ambition as evil and twists facts with overblown adjectives setting a tone that is cynical and mocking toward common portrayals of historical events. I have never read a book where it was more apparent that objective fact was being redefined by the author's slant. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I don't understand the appeal of this book. It's not a humorous, or fun, recounting of American history at all. It is old wine in a supposed new attractive bottle, but would-be readers would be better off spending their time with better-written, truly researched real histories. Davis writes in cliches, and he is highly biased: a liberal who sneers at anything done by Republicans. I say that as a longtime independent, neither Republican nor Democrat.

Unfortunately the author is very biased without the ability to provide perspective or context.

Overall the material and author was misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not history, but what the author wants you to believe","review":"There ought to be a law against false reporting like this. The claimed premise of this book is that it reports the real truth about history, and the author's agenda is to affect the social attitudes of the reader. At best this is propaganda, seasoned with enough fact to lull the average gullible reader into accepting it.

What I got was a writer projecting his political bias on as many topics as possible. I'm kind of a hybrid Rebuplican/Democrat so I'm far from a right winger. But the left wing slant of this book is obvious and obtrusive from the get go. If this guy wants to impose his political beliefs on others, he should try fiction because history is too important to become an interpretive exercise.I couldn't recommend this author less."},{"rating":"1","title":"One man's opinion - a honest review","review":"This book should be called how America is a racist country. Don't Know Much About History : Everything You Need to Know About American History but Never Learned exploits every aspect of American History into a racial point of view. It does little to go in detail about some exciting American events, but focuses on a country's past mistakes of slavery, segregation, & discrimination. The author stepped around certain interesting subjects and steered more towards these topics. However, the narrator does an excellent job of bringing the subject up-front, clear and concise. Overall, I did learn much about American History and injustices that were unfolded throughout the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition. Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling. White men were all bad, indians were good. Women were brave. Conservatives are anti-semites. Republicans are bad and pro business. Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy. This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Politically Correct","review":"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book. Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that. I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.

Having taken US History about five years ago, my recall in that area was a bit lacking.

I enjoyed that he laid the book out in Q+A format."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok.","review":"I enjoy a fresh presentation of the facts, when provided, but his left of center dogma gets tiresome. One reviewer stated that he backs up his positions with facts, but really he picks and chooses the \\"facts\\" presented and excluded. I suppose it's enough for those inclined to agree with him, and works if you don't take a second to think about the aspects of the topic that he chose to ignore or downplay, but for most, I believe it will be an irritant. He expends a good deal of time at the beginning telling us that he has been neutral, but even that \\"explanation\\" is loaded.

Don't Know Much always kept my attention despite much of the basic history not being new for me.For that I give it 4 stars.I agree re: the commentary re: liberal bias. It is pronounced.However, the author frequently presented both sides of the issue on a given subject, so there are of plenty of nods to fairness. I felt the treatment of the founding fathers to be respectful and balanced. As the subject material gets closer to the present day, the bias becomes more evident.(The mention of the legendary smallpox blanket gifts to the Indians was gratuitous, I thought, given how uncertain the facts are on the subject. Yes, there was at least one incident during the French and Indian War. But it was neither official policy nor widespread as is commonly believed.)But the audiobook is solid, chunky with information, and presented with a lively narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"quite\\" everything you need to know","review":"Davis presents \\"his\\" views on American history and if you are too lazy to study or read up yourself then you might think this is a landmark work. It isn't! He presents his opinions as facts or implies they are factual without any supporting evidence. This is typical revisionist history without the benefit of facts to support his views. This does not fill any gaps from middle school. However, the book does provide a small amount of energy...if used correctly can start a few fires in the old fireplace. Other than that...not really useful as a reference.Andy Eskew"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"Throughout the book there are a number of must reads listed which give you a place to look if a particular topic interested you enough to want to read more.There are very few books that attempt to cover such a wide span of history in one volume with such attention to keeping the reader interested. Davies' Europe: A history is one notable exception.I listened to the book via audible.com download -- a format I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What He Knows About History is Wrong","review":"It's not what Mr. Davis DOESN'T know about History that makes this such a dangerous book for it's intended audience, it what he DOES know that just aint so. For example, he \\"knows\\" that Karl Marx was really on to something in making class struggle the driving force behind historical change. But that's just not true.He \\"knows\\" that the next most important things you can say about any historical figure are how they measure up to 21st century orthodoxies on questions of race and gender. This tells us something about Davis, but not much about the historical situations that he claims to be talking about.A quick way to verify these overall assertions is to pick a subject that he deals with that you already know something about and flip to the end of the section where he gives his \\"must reads.\\" Even when he waffles a bit in the text (or more often hides behind another historian), his bias almost always shows up here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame...","review":"I enjoy learning about history, so I was anxious to hunker down with this book hoping to learn a little more about the history of this great country. Like most people, when I read a history book, I expect a fact-based, reasonably unbiased account of the events. Unfortunately, this book is anything but that. The authors view is so obviously skewed to the left that he distorts the facts to ensure his biases are well represented.If you are like me and want an unbiased account of history, this is definitely not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Don't Know Much About History","review":"The most appropriate place for the title of this book should be right after the author's name. Imagine writing, for example, the history of World War II without ever mentioning the Japanese before say 1942 or the Germans before perhaps 1943. This is pretty much the approach of this author with regard to \\"Indians\\" and \\"Whites.\\" Incredible. Not much redeemingly good about America in this incompetent tome. If you believe, with Actor Matt Damon(\\"Good Will Hunting\\") that author Howard Zinn is indeed \\"heavy\\" and if you agree on all principles with Noam Chomsky, then this book is just right for you. If not, it is just another brick in the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Don't know much about NEGATIVE History\\"","review":"This book is very informative but the author is almost un-American in the way he skims over America's great accomplishments while concentrating mainly on it's moral shortcomings.He is very liberal in his thinking and it shows in his book. He is also very cynical about human intentions, always pointing out negative reasons for an action. For example, he tells us the first world war was about \\"Empire Building,\\" which was not the original cause of the war. He also indicates that the United States entered the war for profit. I am sure some people stood to profit but I highly doubt that was the main reason.This information in this book is worth reading but combine it with other research if you want the whole picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I read the reviews first","review":"Of course the author would emphasize different things than a standard history but his biases are evident. Kennedy assasination conspiracy theories! Come on, these were put to rest years ago.

Bias in the modern sections is easily spotted. Read the sections that describe Ronald Reagan as an incompetent dolt and Bill Clinton as a brilliant but flawed politician. If his bias is so readily apparent in these modern passages, then what kind of bias is probable in sections where a reader is less able to discern his 'slant' on history to suit hisown agenda. Historians should offer up facts and figures and weave from a variety of sources to come up with a solid profile of history. Davis has an ax to grind for the liberal camp. At the end of the book, he refers to Howard Zinn, a hard left historian, who offers a 'necessary corrective' in his books.If you're looking for history books, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I trust any of it??","review":"The notion of a complete history of the USA broken up into small segments is a great idea. Call it the Readers Digest for history, or call it a bathroom book. But other reviewers are correct about the bias. I'd rather have the same pages devoted to just what happened and how, rather than guessing at why.I found it ironic that the author found a way to criticize both choices that leaders could make. For example, he criticizes \\"big business\\" for dragging the US into a war with Spain. Then he criticizes Henry Ford for being an isolationist before WWII.Overall, I'd recommend the first half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining for its Obvious Bias","review":"In terms of objectivity, this book has little to offer.

First mistake. As noted by several other reviewers, the book is laced hard factual errors. The author's liberal bias ... all business activity is bad, all organized labor activates are good. Couple this, with his invention of what motivated the minds of many history characters, make it all ludicrous. It is a sad commentary on our knowledge of history, when so many readers have rated this book highly.

Speaking for someone who is taking classes to teach History to high schoolers, this book gave me a lot of information that would be great for pop quizzes etc. I could use this book along with a teaher's book and hopefully the kids will get something out of it.You have to teach that for every action, there is a reaction- and to this action...here is the reaction...It really is a great book, and for so many pages, it is also a quick read, because you can really get into it.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What color is your history?","review":"History is in the eye of the beholder, and Davis views it through the lens of a liberal. There is nothing wrong with that, except that he espouses to present an objective, unbiased view of our nation's past. Perhaps this is an impossible goal, but he should at least be congniscent of this.It is difficult to cover the entire nation's history in the span of a few hours, but the periods he chose to explore, and the viewpoints he chose to represent, will leave the the unskeptical reader leaning to the left.If you want an entertaining perspective on history, this certainly fits. But please don't use this as a substitute for real history books.I would strongl recommend _Don't Know Much About the Universe_ over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Know Much About History","review":"Beware! This is an engaging book. If I didn't know much about American history, I would likely have found it an appealing survey. Unfortunately, Davis doesn't deliver when it comes to objectivity. He too often steps outside interpretation of facts/events to offer HIS opinions.

This book is written from a hard left point of view and meant to demonize us. There are NO positives mentioned about America in this book.

It also seems to me to be a very apathetic way of life.I do not think this book is all crap, but it is way too extreme to be adapted for most humans. Of course it is good to be present, and not to be concerned too much about the past and future, but I rather suggest something in between what \\"normal\\" people do and Tolle's teachings, than to take things to its extremes.As many already have mentioned, this book is a repetitive zen ripoff.

A worthwhile read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shape Toning","review":"This toning workout is great. It is fast pace but also gives you time to learn the moves. I like how there are sections for each part of the body and in each segment you can pick what order you want to do the exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"THis dvd was terrible...I am an on the intermediate level..and basically this tape is marketed to advertise Shape magazine not to workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was breathing heavily!","review":"I don't have much time to work out (mother of 3 under 3) so when I do, I have to make it count. Whever I do toning, I feel like I need to rev it up a little and get some cardio in. Whenever I'm doing cardio I think, \\"Gee, I hope this can stick with me the way that toning does...\\"The thing that struck me right away with this program is that as I was doing the toning moves, I began to feel my heart pumping hard and my breathing was much heavier, as if I was doing cardio, too. That's a great sign to me, because then I can complete my workout in half the time.I also appreciated that I could do a different body \\"segment\\" on different days, so I didn't overwork a specific area.The bonus \\"cardio\\" segments are NOTHING SPECIAL, just your typical box steps and grapevines, etc. It's the toning segments that stood out.I rented this through Netflix, now I'm planning to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastes a lot of time","review":"First, you're forced to watch a 40sec Shape commercial each time you put in this DVD - you can't forward/go to DVD menu. The time-wasting only continues. Many of these moves could be combined to increase your heart rate and make better use of your time. Some exercises are even done sitting/laying down! My heart rate is barely 50% of maximum and muscles are not challenged at all with the basic lunges, mountain climbers, dead lifts, etc. Includes about 7-10 exercises in each section, each exercise lasts about 1.5 minutes (with 5 seconds of instruction and non-movement at the beginning), and a 5 second delay between each exercise - keep moving if you really want a decent workout.I like Michelle and have purchased her other videos. Lisa Wheeler's jazzercise style annoys me so much it's hard to concentrate. I expect her to go into jazz hands at any moment. This video is about what I expect from a magazine who thinks celebrities are an example of fitness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Workout!","review":"A friend at work recommended this DVD to me. I have been working out over my lunch hour and getting my cardio in for the day. However, I didn't have any time left for some strength training. I love that this DVD offers the different zone workouts so that you can work on many areas of your body instead of one specified zone.I look forward to this DVD because it is easy to catch on to; yet at the same time, you are bound to work up a sweat after completing a zone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I was looking for a toning workout to use along with my regular cardio routine. I really like this workout because it is broken up into 4 targeted sections, abs, arms, legs, and buns. I can work all of the areas or pick just one depending on my area of focus and time available. I also like that I can change up the order of the workout so I don't get bored by doing the same workout every time. This DVD was a great find. It was just what I was looking for in a toning workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for beginners","review":"I was very excited to give this DVD a try after reading such good reviews. I thought it would be similar to the weight training class I take at my local gym. Unfortunately it did not live up to the reviews or my expectations. This is a great workout for beginners but not for people who have been at this for a while. It seemed like I was resting for at least 5 of the 15 minutes for each segment. I never once felt my muscles getting fatigued from the workout. After only trying it once I will be putting it up for sale and continue on with my pursuit of finding a challenging workout DVD focusing on weight training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Shape interruption","review":"This probably would be a great workout if I wasn't waiting for each exercise to start after the \\"Shape\\" logo that pops up after every exercise. I didn't finish the workout because of the lack of flow to it. If you don't mind a set-up period for every exercise than it'd be worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant ambient operatic music","review":"This album fuses chillout rhythms with classical, operatic music, creating a style that is very much \\"New Age\\" in feel. This compilation is crafted with smooth production and decent vocalists - it's nice music for the background, not for serious opera listeners. This is better than some other compilations of reworked classical chillout music I've heard and it is a nice change of pace from modern chillout tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluke C510 Leather Multimeter Case","review":"The Fluke C510 case is great. Although snug, it fits my 177 multimeter with the ToolPak hanging kit very well.

Usually I do a small taste test first before using the product, but I figured it would be fairly similar to Death Sauce in taste and intensity. So, like I did with Death Sauce, I put it on my eggs as if it were ketchup.Big mistake.With that first bite, I knew I was doomed. My lips swelled up (I used a lot of it), my glasses fogged over, and I had trouble breathing. I actually almost called 911 because I feared my throat was going to swell shut.Yes, it's that good.I don't use nearly as much now. I learned my lesson. My tongue was destroyed for weeks after that, and I'm amazed I actually didn't have to go to the hospital.

Im a big boy. At 6'2\\" and 400 lbs, there isnt much that can stand up to me for a long period of time. I know this throne will. I had to buy a replacement for my old Pearl medium weight throne, as the seat post was starting to bend(whoops). I searched for almost 3 weeks straight, finally making my decision to buy this throne. And what a right decision it was! First off, I noticed the heavy duty base and threaded seat post. Awesome. East adjustments on the fly. Second thing was the combined leather/cloth seat, for really warm gigs(big guy=big guy sweat). A great plus. the padding on the seat is very plush, and doesnt make my arse numb after a long 2-3 hour gig. I would buy this throne again without thinking about it. And yes, I know its not a Roc-n-Soc Nitro, but it comes damn close. Buy this throne. Especially for 80-100 bucks LESS than the Roc-n-Soc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great throne but broke within 2 years","review":"I bought this about a year and some change ago. It's a great and comfortable throne. I noticed some wobble over the past couple months and thought I just need to tighten the seat to the post. It didn't seem to fix it but it was still a great throne and usable. Recently I went to sit down and the middle hardware that adjusts the post height and connects to the base completely cracked through causing even more wobble. It's still usable but I'm not risking it falling completely apart at a show so now I'm looking to replace. Would have used this throne for a long time had it not broken but I can't say I'll buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing drum throne!","review":"I couldn't be happier with this drum throne! I didn't know exactly what to expect, seeing as I've never owned any Sound Percussion gear. It has stood the test of time(and weight) without any issues. The craftsmanship is just as good as any of the bigger name brands and the cushion hasn't lost any of its cushiness. I waited a while to review this item so I could really use it heavily and see how it holds up. I would recommend this throne to anyone beginner or professional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, comfortable, adaptable","review":"I'm a pianist and now use this throne full time with my rehearsal and gig rig. Can't believe I used those thinly-padded keyboard benches for years. If you play keys, seriously consider this. Even if you play with traditional posture (left leg back, right leg forward, elbows level with keys) this thing will not get in the way. It is easily adjustable and very comfortable. The only thing you may not like about it is obviously you can't slide your butt over to get up to the high or low registers. But, then again, if you were trained old school (like me), you should be leaning to the side anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to follow","review":"I am not sure if it was the three people speaking or the way the material was presented - but this is very dry and difficult to follow.

Consequently it didn't serve my purposes well, and I found the commentators rather too sanguine about the Middle Ages, praising the tactical warfare of mounted knights (like adolescent boys) with virtually nothing critical to say about the superstitious, anti-intellectual, patriarchal, sexist and oppressive aspects of those times. One does better to watch The Name of the Rose."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Inner Beaty Real Hot Sauce\\" replacement found!","review":"Been missing Inner Beauty for a long time, and on occasion have looked for a replacement.Found it - this stuff is pretty much the same.

Enough is enough to him and he goes after them himself with revenge on his mind.I thought the movie was OK, but I wouldn't wanna own it or see it again soon. It didn't interest me enough to want to see the bonus bonus features. I didnt think the main actor played it angry enough. I didn't feel like he was super p.o like he was supposed to be be playing. And I don't understand the cop looking' back all the time.Apart from that, it should have been more gory or more vengeful, there is hardly any real feeling of revenge.

Seems like car windshields are getting bigger and more deep and slanted, and they seem to get a film on them after a month or two. It's surprisingly hard to reach them with your hand and a rag to clean them.The Glassmaster is a nice sturdy cleaning product that will reach those far places of a windshield without making you go into contortions.

Whereas, the application of high-frequency sound to medicine is known as ultra-SOUND.The author of this book named it, a bit imprecisely, we think:\\"Essentials of Ultrasound Physics\\"The word \\"physics\\" in this title implies broad theoretical discussion (i.e. ultra-SONICS), whereas the books is actually limited to (medical) ultra-sound.Searchers, suggest you use search words \\"ultra-SONICS\\" if you want to find broad materials on \\"high frequency sound\\" applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken and too expensive to repair","review":"I got this watch for a Christmas present a couple of years ago.

Many of the assertions made regarding cats are simply untrue, and the moralistic tone was quite offensive. His denial of the predator-prey relationship will baffle anyone who owns a cat that is not confined to the house.He does not seem to differentiate between surviving and thriving. After much study it is clear that cats cannot do well long term on a vegan diet, he admits to seeing problems in male cats himself. Cats have nutritional requirements that can only be satisfied by meat (like Taurine), but in his disdain for meat processing methods he seems blinded by that.The pet food industry is deplorable, but their is no reason why a raw meat diet cannot be provided that was humanely raised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't convert humans? Then coerce a helpless animal...","review":"Overall, this is probably the best psychotherapy book around for Vegans who need to redirect their frustrations from humans (who have a choice in their eating ethics) to their pets (who don't). Jed has written a reasonably sound guide that enables any conscientious food-fascist to coerce his or her pet into accepting meals that they would never even SNIFF if they were given a choice.If you harbor a need to bully a helpless animal into accepting a completely unnatural diet in order to compensate for your feelings of inadequacy at being unable to convince anyone else in your life of the superiority of the Vegan lifestyle, this is the book you've been waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I really wanted to like this book because I usually love a good Alpha male and I've enjoyed Jaid Black's books in the past. This story was just too....degrading. I can't imagine any woman with an ounce of pride writing this chauvenistic drivel. Examples are: constantly being forced to walk around in sheer outfits for the \\"pleasure\\" of every man. Never being allowed to wear a top while around your husband or the \\"second\\" husband. Watermelons for boobs through all your child-birthing years. Virtually gang-banging and watching your husband constantly fondle other women. Too much for me to list.

The film is interrupted by short sequences about her concerts and the rehearsals. The wolfs are not the main aspects of the film. They play only a short part in the film. They have nearly five minutes to justify the title. It is the same problem as it is shown by the media. Helene Grimaud is the one with the wolfs. But no one really cares about the wolfs. It is an attraction to make her public. For the connoisseur it is a matter of marketing only. It is her music what makes her really attractive. You can see a few snaps of the second Rachmaninov concert and Brahms and Beethoven too. It is a good video to promote a concert tour. But for me it is a minor attraction. What I miss is a concert at the end of the film. This was a good possibility to give the viewer a chance to have a goody with the DVD.

Of course we know if we are overweight that eating right and exercising regularly is the cure to our problem. However, few books address the \\"why?\\" behind the problem, the underlying mechanisms of WHY we overeat, WHY we are lazy, WHY we make excuses for ourselves. He starts off by saying \\"this is not a diet book\\", which is great because the pressure is instantly reduced. The book addresses your mental state of being, your life goals, stress, and emotional overeating, really forcing you to look inside of yourself. From there, he gradually builds in aerobic exercise, and not until the end are you even considerig food choices. You do not worry about being on a \\"diet\\", which is very relieving.

You'll probably want to supplement it with a 2nd title from a non-Microsoft Press publisher to get a great bonus CD-ROM ( I would have ranked this book as five stars if the CD-ROM had been more impressive ). This book focuses the reader to stay within the framework of FrontPage 2000, rather than hacking through the HTML directly, so very little coverage here of HTML or line-by-line explanations of HTML examples. FrontPage 2000 has finally matured into a very useable web authoring tool, and hopefully it will overcome the reputation of its previous releases which were notorious for clobbering finely-tuned HTML.

No topic deserves less than a long paragraph of zero content. The book also is really annoying in the way it pushes the product, talking about \\"rich\\" features, \\"making things easier than ever\\",\\"the force of FrontPage themes\\".When push comes to shove, features simply are cataloged.

The author's inclusion of the criminally insane within his definition of terrorism is simultaneously disputable and thought provoking. However, the book does a poor job in thoroughly exploring the concept of WMD terrorism.

Viehl writes as compellingly as ever but the story turns out to follow an increasingly violent and monotonous pattern of plucky defiance followed by punishment and torture interspersed with the good Doc saving all and sundry in the Medlab. Chojero appears increasingly dour and embittered and the lovely humour that leavened Stardoc is largely missing, apart from a brief subplot with 2 alien teenagers. The good Doc has little to do apart from fend off her various suitors or torturers. I do hope the next book has a lighter touch, but at least this one did not end in a cliffhanger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not great","review":"Pretty good book, but not the best. i agree with the reviewer who said Cherijo was smart and if you are referring to the character i think you are(Noarr) i agree with you.

It wasn't a cliffhanger like the last one, but i, for one, would like to know his reaction to the news, but i don't know about you. There were too many torurings, escapes, and captures for my taste because they were all the same! Also Reever seemed a little too harsh, even if you've finished the book and know why he acted like he did. Some people might not like this, but i think she has been obsessing over Kao TOO long.

This third book however, had me very frustrated at the main character Cherijo. For all her intelligence, she was being extremely obtuse this go around. If she gave any thought to the words Duncan said and his actions, she would realize that he was trying to keep her alive. Her stubborness created most of her troubles, which got a bit old over and over again. Despite my frustration with this particular volume in the series.

It was like I was watching an entire season of DS9 in my head.For all those trekkies out there who miss DS9, do yourself a favor and read Unity and all the other previous books detailing DS9 after the episode \\"what you leave behind\\".

I have loved all of the books of the DS9 relaunch series, and this certainly was worth the wait. I am not a literary critic, but I do know I enjoy rich characters, and this series certainly has those. Although I got a little bogged down in the exploits of Vaughn in the Gamma Series, I enjoyed his character much more in this book. The Millenium series still remains my favorite, but this came in a close second. Finally, we learn what happened to Benjamin Sisko, but I hope the story can go on, and am waiting for the next installment.

A good book is a good book, and I rarely put something down when I start it. However, this book was so awful I couldn't bring myself to read further than the first few chapters. I tried to give it a chance - I really did. Christopher Golden, however, doesn't need to quit his day job. He's created a bunch of 15-year-olds that act and sound more like 20-year-olds, only when I was 15 or 20 years old I can't say I knew anyone who talked or acted like these kids. They're certainly nothing I can identify with and all I can say is, Golden was either living in another world when he was 15 or he wishes he was. The writing is bad, the characters are silly and tedious, and I can't imagine why Peter Straub would ever endorse something like this, unless he's a relative.

This book states what we don't like to admit, but frees us to understand it. We need to change... We can't do it... God can from the inside out! It discourages you in an encouraging way.

Not your average self help book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Dallas Willard Instead","review":"Okay, I'm a sinner. I knew that already, had a pretty good idea of what that means. But Crabb would have me wallow in it, reflect on my sin, roll around in it and focus on it exclusively. I simply don't believe that's what God intends. Crabb gives little to no Biblical support to back up his delineation of the types of issues in our lives. And his final chapter, where he tosses off a few clichés about joy, is beyond weak. It almost feels as if it pains him to admit there *is* any joy in our life with the Lord.Frankly, this reads as if a professor of Abnormal Psychology tried to write a \\"regular\\" psychology textbook, but couldn't get his slant for the \\"abnormal\\" out of the way. It is repetitive, self-absorbed, and misfocused.If you want to read a truly great book on spiritual renewal, go for Dallas Willard's \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" or \\"Renovation of the Heart.\\" Now *those* are books that will help you change from the \\"inside out.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Info","review":"Soprano Jacqueline Nicolas sings dramatic cantatas by Andre Campra (1660-1744).\\"Campra left three books of cantatas, which, if taken as a whole, show rapid assimilation of operatic techniques.

(The author does not fail to point out that all textbooks are biased in one way or another and admits that he believes, (as we do) that the case for creation is stronger) I have learned so much this year--the excitement is contagious. (I was only taught evolution in my science schooling) I have even facilitated the labs for our co-op and feel totally comfortable. As I mentioned, the book and labs are written TO the student.

Then Saxon math came along and revolutionized math for those parents and children who hated math. What Saxon did for math; Jay Wile has done for science. Except I'd say Jay Wile has done it better. This is science by a scholar who knows how to break down the complicated concepts to the level of the common man. Nothing is lost in the translation except, perhaps, a previously poor attitude toward science by the student. Children who hated science before will fall in love with Dr. Jay Wile's way of teaching. The experiments are fun & use readily available items in the home one *actually* has on hand. He's won this home schooling family over for good.

It is a well written book. But it's also cynical, negative, and disdainful of the tourists and visitors who vacation in the Keys.

The Feathered Onion is far more than a defence of panspermia.

There always seemed to be a slight millisecond lag between when you move the mouse and when the cursor moves on the screen. This wasn't noticeable until you needed precise movement, like in a game or when photo-editing with Photoshop. I found it impossible to do precise movements. Very dissapointing. This seems to be a problem with most cordless mice. The mouse is also heavier then other mice of this size, due to the 2 AA batteries inside. The only good thing I found was that the wireless system had a distance of like 10 feet. If your just gonna surf the net, or do other mundane tasks on the PC, I guess this mouse will be fine.

A young minister comes among the secretive closed-off society of lumberjacks, ranchers and cowpokes who view encroaching civilization with a proud cynicism. Initially stuck with the derisive appellation of \\"The Sky Pilot\\" - his influence nevertheless brings God, goodness, and personal decisions to be viewed as serious opportunities to develop character in keeping with the rugged grandeur of their surroundings. The colorful local zanies are astounded at his non-religious manner and how accepting he is of what they thought he would be against and how challenging he is in several unexpected ways. Several characters are carefully developed; much humor - a moving story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After cruising in the Pacific NW for the past two years using the Douglass and Hemingway guides and the Waggoner Guide, we were admittedly spoiled. If that's the quality you expect, you won't get it here. On the other hand, we couldn't find an alternative, and this is better than nothing. The harbor diagrams were nice, but there aren't enough of them and what there are don't provide enough detail. The landmarks mentioned in the text often don't appear in the diagrams. We also noticed inaccuracies, but this could be due to time. For example, the fuel dock in Morro Bay wasn't where the guide said it was. However, the woman at the Visitor Information Center also thought it was in the direction indicated in the book.

I graduated 10 years ago from college and don't use the Spanish language and forgot many words...its sad for me because I love the language. I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it!!! She wanted me to play it for her nonstop. She loves the kids in the video and the songs. Luckily they have a song section so I dont have to fish thorough the tape to replay it 100 times like she requested. I bought the whole series and am hoping to freshen up my spanish as well. My concern is that I don't think it will make her learn spanish enough to make her bilingual....she will learn some but it cannot replace a teacher or parent who is fluent and unfortunately I am not. I bought books too to read to her in spanish. I read well in spanish but my speaking is not so good. Interaction needed for fluency.

I purchased \\"Adentro y afuera\\" for my two young kids, and after about a week, they had already memorized two songs and had learned a number of expressions too. The DVD was so good that I bought the rest of the collection, as well as the CD of songs. The people who put together these DVDs obviously put a lot of thought into it, and the DVDs are entertaining and lively. The singing is the best part, and Maria and the kids are great too. Although they are marketed for young children, I would think that these DVDs would be helpful for anyone who wants to learn Spanish, at any age, especially if they are taking a class and want to reinforce what they are learning. The pamphlets that accompany the DVDs are very helpful if you want to practice the vocabulary and songs with your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Spanish video for kids!!","review":"Whistlefritz is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE brand of Spanish videos for kids. I have two other videos from them and love those as well, and so do my kids. I love that it's an actual \\"show\\" that's strictly in Spanish and not just a bunch of pictures with words.I have several other videos that are not from this company and they are not entertaining, and my kids lose interest quickly. With Whistlefritz videos, my kids are glued to the screen and actively learning Spanish. In this video, Adentro y Afurea, the kids repeat the words, answer questions, sing songs, participate in games, and are encouraged to interact with the characters on the screen.This particular video is very educational because it also has the word written at the bottom of the screen. It has children in the video, cartoons, and my kids love it! Plus, it's all strictly in Spanish. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these videos and highly recommend them to anyone who is wanting to get Spanish videos for their kids!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BILINGUAL LEARNING VIDEO","review":"GREAT AND ENTERTAINING FOR NEW SPANISH LEARNERS, MY SON PICKED IT UP FAST, HE IS IN A DUAL LANGUAGE CLASS THAT TEACHES ENGLISH SPEAKERS SPANISH, 90% TAUGHT IN SPANISH ONLY HE IS IN (K), THE DOWN SIDE IS, THAT IT IS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND NEEDS MORE OF THE BASIC SIGHT WORDS ALPHABET, AND VOWELS FOR THE SPANISH LANGUAGE; BUT A GOOD INTRO TO SPANISH DVD ONLY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, draws kids in with real people & music","review":"I am a native speaker from Venezuela and have tried lots of Spanish DVD's from the library. Many of them are boring, annoying, or poorly done in Spanglish. I am not a big fan of the Spanglish used in popular cartoons like Dora The Explorer. I prefer the whole video to be in one language. My 4.5 year old has been watching Plaza Sesamo since he was 2 and loved it for a really long time. After 2.5 years he's become curious about the many other English cartoons available, so I was extremely happy to find this DVD to get him excited about Spanish again. He loves all 3 DVD's in the series, and I wish they made more. His 2 year old brother also loves it, even though his Spanish is not as good as his brother's, but the cute songs really keep them both entertained. I highly recommend this one as well as Vamos a Jugar and Los Animales."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD -Vamos a jugar","review":"With this DVD, you're going to no where.

Good idea that needs alot of redesign!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this product","review":"The idea is a good one, but I found it flawed, especially in two ways. First, even during simple movements like hanging up the phone it is practically impossible to avoid hitting the the time-set buttons and accidently changing the time... not a good thing when you are counting on the clock to get up for work. Second, if you have the radio on and the phone rings, the radio is supposed to shut off when the receiver is lifted. This didn't work, and as I recall required some drastic measures to get the malfunctions reset (like unplugging the thing.) I hope that others can counter my experience with success, but I was not happy with the GE clock radio phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a winner","review":"Good idea but bad implementation of what a bedroom clock should be.The viewing angle of the LCD on the Bedroom Clock Radio Phone is very poor. Unless you look at the clock directly you can not tell what the time is. There is also an anoying green flashing light to indicate a new call is listed on the caller ID. If GE were to change out the LCD and remove the green light this would be a 5 star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy GE","review":"Their products are full of glitches. This bedroom phone stopped displaying the Caller ID correctly the first time I bought it. After I brought it back to the store for a replacement, the time was always wrong.

Look for similar statements about other GE phones and take the advice not to buy a GE phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this item. You can't read the display at all, so you never know what time it is. The base is so light that when you answer the phone, the base comes along and falls off the nightstand.

I have this phone and it does have an alarm and caller ID, but NO AM/FM radio as stated in the description. You can choose either the buzzer or some annoying electronic \\"music\\" to wake to. There are some good features such as the dual alarm, but the negatives offset this. The display is VERY bright making it hard to sleep and sometimes when I hit the snooze button, it \\"freezes\\" the clock until the alarm is turned off, thus making the time 9 minutes slow. The phone cord is way too short as well. Not a bad phone for the price I guess, but I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard to read lcd","review":"Great idea but a terrible phone. It's impossible to read except if you are directly above the phone. Also the delete for removing calls from caller id didn't consistantly work.

Too easy to accidentally change the time when you are changing the alarm. There are too many buttons to push in order to change any of the clock's settings. Overall, a very poor design.

He's into gay, and if he were why would it matter. Nor does he worship Satan, just becasue he hates Christianity does NOT NOT NOT mean that he worships Satan. Now onto the music, I think this is one of his best albums. I don't blame him for going more pop, and changing himself considering he had a nervous breakdown after the making of Antichrist Superstar. One would think that The Dope Show and I don't Like The drugs are the best songs since they are th single, but I don't think so. Buy the album and you won't be sorry, maybe he isn't being to to true to his real goth obbsessed fans but like I said if he kept going in the direction he was he'd be dead by now probably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a great c.d.","review":"The C.D. is great!

Second, I am a Christian and don't agree with much of what Mazza stands for, but this about the music. It took me a while to get into it due to the strange and depressive image that Manson puts across (that does him few favours) but this is a great album. If you don't like because of the music then fine, that's your opinion. But listen to the music before slagging it off. Get over the image and look at the music. Apart from anything the image is all front, not what Brian Warner/Mar1lyn Man5on is really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Record by the so-called \\"king of shock\\"","review":"I don't know what the Moral Majority and all those other conservative organizations are talking about. Calling Manson's music Satanic or Evil. This stuff is hardly demonic...It's just good rock n' roll with a slight edge to it. Nothing shocking here, just 14 tracks of listening pleasure. Much different then Anti-Christ or any of his other previous works. Don't judge Manson by what you hear about him on the 700 Club, give this a listen...it couldn't hurt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep an Open Mind","review":"Now while Mechanical Animals wasn't Manson's best effort to date, it is by no means a piece of crap, and I'm extremely offended by your statement that only \\"freaks and weirdos\\" listen to this. While a good portion of Manson's fan base is composed of the gothic kids, he also has a large number of fans that are considered 'normal'. So, you're ignorant.Some standout songs on this album are Great Big White World, Mechanical Animals (I don't know why people would not like this song), I Want to Disappear, I Don't Like the Drugs, and of course Coma White. The rest of the songs are also good and enjoyable, but not the standouts that those are.Not a great album for the beginning Manson fan, as this will not give you an idea as to what to expect on some of the other albums. Very different. But, it's a good album, and you should pick it up sooner or later."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums of the 90's","review":"I think That this is Marilyn Mansons Best album to date this is way better than Antichrist Superstar, Smells Like Children, Hollywood Etc....this is one of th ebest albums of the 90's that goes up there with Nine Inch Nails The Fragile and Tool Aenima"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Sound For Manson, And It Works!","review":"Wow, this is sooooo different from antichrist. This new kind of clinical sound really suits with what manson's doing right now, it sort of makes you realise that the world IS huge and empty. I love every song on there, you never need to programme the cd player to skip stuff coz it all rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marketing Genius!!!!","review":"Not since Ozzy Osborne has a performer been able to real in the teen suffering suburban apathy@on such a large scale. Manson must be in his late twenties and has probably come to terms with not fitting in which gives him the ability to step back and really play this shtick perfectly. Saw him in Tokyo and in Toronto and, despite the fact that the shows were identical (right down to his encounter with a roadie on stage) his point about how people in positions of power are more of a danger to others than this glam-rock wanna-be will ever be was made quite clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bible thumping...","review":"I don't want to thump any Bibles and I dont want to kill any dogs. manson is OK..but that is it. some of his songs are good and some suck. Manson is, honestly, trying to get a quick buck with this cd. Oh well...I thought that certain songs were good but manson was just...not convinced enough to wright good music. His older stuff was better. Unless you are a real big hardcore Manson fan, don't get this, it just doesn't sound good enough"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson's homage to Bowie's Ziggy Stardust!","review":"Mechanical Animals is concept album split in two parts. Part one is about an alien named Omega who comes to Earth and his caught up in it's decadent lifestyle. Part two is about a glam rock band called the Mechanical Animals. The album orignially came with some cool multimedia stuff, but the re-releases have none of these. Inside the CD is a slick booklet with lyrics and the correct track listing for the two concept pieces. The album is even more mature and structured than Antichrist Superstar. The lyrics are deeper and in my opinion a better album. I wish people would get pass the Manson's shockmaster title and try to listen to his music. He's a very talented writer when he's motivated. Coma White is the final track the somberly ends the album.Highly recommened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson is Phenominal!!!.... He totally kicks @ss!","review":"I've practically memorized this whole cd!!! I love it, and completely recommend it to any Manson fan.

So, don't be a dumb@ss and think Manson's music sucks now just because of a change.... No! Change is Good!.... and so is this cd, so go and buy it already!!! it should be number 1 !!!! I don't know why it isn't!!! That angers me! grrrrr.... hee hee.. :) I'm a complete Manson freak... I guess you can tell. heh heh... ***Evil Grin***"},{"rating":"2","title":"damn straight!","review":"I'm giving this album five stars for the simple reason that MM has managed to upset a very large number of people with the cover art. I even knew a guy who said that he thought it was a real photo! Thus, due to the fact that people are idiots by nature, this album gets a five. The content, on the other hand... well, let's just say that if you want music by a man who craves atttention, stick to Elton John. Much more creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Manson's best album yet!","review":"This is Manson's best album yet. Unlike Antichrist Superstar he sings about things that affect all of us. He constantly is reminding us that drugs do run our society. \\"The Dope Show\\" is the best song on the album. But the others are not far behind. In his past albums Manson constantly screamed his lyrics. This happens only a few times in \\"Mechanical Animals\\". I particulary like the song that has a 70's sound and backup singers. If you are looking for variety from one artist, Marilyn Manson is your man? woman? mannequin? Who knows and who cares!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn Manson?","review":"I found this album not quite what you would expect from Marilyn. I am not saying that the album is bad, it just lacks the depth and spirit of AntiChrist Superstar. Some catchy and strong tunes catch the ear but none with as much energy as previous songs. After listening to AntiChrist Superstar I don't see how anyone could compare this album to it. When compared, this album is a let down. Manson wanted to make a classic album and he has, it was AntiChrist Superstar. This album also lacks the production and help from ROCK GOD Trent Reznor, I think that may be a major part of the problem. Over all this album is still soooooooooo much better than most music out there so I would recommend a listen. -DamnDan '98"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Floyd, Tori Amos, Radiohead and some grumbling dude...","review":"I usually hate most popular music. This album reminds me of why I liked Radiohead's last album, except that its better. This album has highlights that are reminescent of old Floyd (not the post The Wall crap), Tori Amos, and Radiohead, except the oh so charismatic Marilyn, has such a gravely voice, its easy to remember who it is. I now refuse to shop at any CD outlet that refuses to carry an uncensored version of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Marketing","review":"I don't think this sucks at all, anyway is not great either is just fairly acceptable. I believe he's getting too much attention, more than he deserves. He is just a marketing product, and that's why i can't find many differences between him and the spice girls. If you are a goth fan this will suit your needs but to anyone out there i say: listen to really good bands like pearl jam, rem, smiths or radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Sellout Masterpiece!","review":"Unlike his other albumns, Manson goes with a very souless approach to rock.

The best thing about Manson is that he does whatever it takes to put on a great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoot myself to love you","review":"Fantastic, I must say I really love this Album.Unexpected release...........((Back then))You gotta listen to this, it is NOTHING like the other Albums,I really appreciate this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm some cool songs, but Antichrist Superstar beat it","review":"Mechanical Animals didn't impress me... I was waiting to some Industrial Rock with a little NIN style but it sounds just like Rock'n Roll. For sure, the Dope Show is great, but it remain the best song of the title... and I don't think that it beats Beautilful People or Tourniquet. Marilyn Manson is a * , everybody knows it, but he does great music. But I don't think that he will do a better job than Antichrist Superstar.... sorry to everyone that love him and his new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marilyn Manson essential","review":"Mechanical Animals is one of best Marilyn Manson albums. What's most surprising is the approach the band took for the sound, and more than that, the way it was accomplished.It's also a good testimony on how the band will never be the same again without Twiggy Ramirez (Jeordie White), the man responsible for the band's success."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest hits","review":"By the way, i am not 13 i just dont have an account. This album is pretty much the greatest hits every song on this album is awsome and \\"Lest we forget\\" dosnt have half of his best songs. Don't judge Mr. Mason by his looks or charms when you see this album cover. I used to hate marilyn until i heard \\"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\\" that was when i decided to listen to him more and i bought this album. The media has made Marilyn Manson a more knone name than Saitin. I highly recomend this record to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Manson","review":"Manson's Pub is one of a kind and so is his new CD. It is different from the older stuff, a new sound a little mellower. It is worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite!","review":"I love how MM has reinvented himself on this CD. The glam turn he's taken is terrific. I can definitely see how he's grown as a person and an artist since his last CD. His lyrics -- as always -- give a really clear view of what is going on in his head at this particular time in his career. My personal favorites are New Model 15 and Don't Like the Drugs, although it's hard for me to just pick a few favorites. MM has taken some of the best influences of 70s glam and incorporated them into his own style of music to make a CD that is interesting, creative and (dare I say?) fun. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think about manson and mechanical animals..","review":"Well, This is one of my Best Cds of Manson.. I think he's ok. That doesn;t mean that im Antichrist like him. no way, i love God.

HE'S GONE GLAMOROUS AND IT SHOWS IN HIS SKIN PRICKING MUSIC. GET THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new Addition","review":"Marilyn Manson started with strait shock value, raw and hard-core, AntiChrist Superstar marked the beggining of a long transformation and was that was his best work ever, now in the aftermath of this change, he brings us something lighter and less wrenching, he brings us to his level and shows us what we cannot, or are too afraid to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARILYN MANSON RULZ!!!","review":"I think manson is the all time best mind warper in the world. The music makes you think about life and the world around you. He may be different in appearance but on the inside, he's just more willing to let out what he has to say then anyone else in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or leave it, but try it before you decide...","review":"This artist, unlike so many others, has discovered a way to express his thoughts, feelings and behaviors without intimidation. I have much respect for that. His newest album, \\"Mechanical Animals\\", demonstrates that his musical diversity matches his social deviance. The riffs are rockin', the lyrics are well-worded, and the sonic architecture is downright awesome. Manson, like his mentor (Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails), has definitely found his niche, and this album is one of the best portaits he's painted. Pick it up and check it out. If you can get past the false impression that this stuff will make you want to kill your parents and sodomize the family pet, you'll see that there is so much more depth involved in Manson's work that even YOU might appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good - worth picking up","review":"The songs I have heard on the radio ('Dope Show', 'Rock Is Dead', and 'I Don't Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me') are good songs, so are there any other good songs on the CD? The answer is yes - I think 'New Model #15', 'User Frendly', and 'The Last Day On Earth' are even better than the three radio songs. The rest of the songs are not terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right to the points","review":"I guess many know how Marilyn felt when writing this album. My taste doesn't even allow my listening to the noises he made on the last few albums, but this one definitely unleashes a more mature and balanced Manson. Call me mainstream if you will and even though I would rate that as an insult, it won't stop me from liking this album, simply because I can relate. Listen to this stuff. Listen to it long enough to see behind the simple yet effective music. Look for the details and you will see what I mean. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Bowie on some really bad crack....","review":"This is a great disc that sounds a lot like David Bowie on crack. The guitar riffs are absolutely killer, and it was a nice change of pace for the band to actually have the drummer play drums for this recording. The old sound machine used on previous records sounded just a little too perfect.I love this album, even thought the last three songs are rather lack luster sounding. It just wasn't my dish to hear about the Anti-Christ's trips to space and beyond, sounds like a demented Star Trek episode.Besides that the music is fantastic and well worth going to see live. They put on one helluva show, just don't go expecting an encore performance, Manson doesn't like to do them. Besides that I feel like I am 18 again, and I am loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson hits brilliance with this one.","review":"I must admit the thought of MARILYN MANSON gave me the creeps about eight months ago. But, then \\"Beautiful People\\" began to grow on me and I listened to more and more. And then I bought Mechanical Animals. This CD puts Antichrist Superstar to shame because it doesn't speak so much about GOD-and speaks more about society's messed up ways. Which I happen to agree with. He sings about the same society that blames him for our troubled teenagers and their problems-like the suicides and murders they all seem to be committing. Which in itself is crazy. I don't admire or worship Marilyn in any way. But, I love music and his music gets to me in a certain way. And, since I haven't heard any voices telling me to kill anyone-I'll continue to listen. (Besides, he doesn't look quite as demonic and scary as when he first began. Lighter make-up and red dresses do him justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew my imagination away","review":"At first I did not like Marilyn Manson, but this CD made me reconsider.

If he wasn't how come people who hat him know all his album cover names and know all the lriycs to his hit songs, one reason he is a marketing genuis. as for the album it is pretty cool, his lyrics are phat and his vocie is cool. incase you haven't notice all his evil man stuff is work, he is just smart(kinda reduntant)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson Has Matured","review":"In the past, Manson has relied on little more than controversy to sell his music. Without the icon he represented, you had little more than rehashed, run-of-the-mill industrial rock. As a matter of fact, Marilyn's depressing lyrics were pretty much all the band had going for them. But now, the music has made a turn into well-thought out melodies that sprinkle goth into '70's glam rock. Yes, it's been done before, and yes it's music that borrows off of a lot of work by other artists, but this time it's done very well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Anti Christ, but still great music","review":"Manson's new sound is hard to adjust to at first. This new album does not match Anti Christ...I believe that nothing he will do will ever match Anti Christ...but his music is still powerful and amazing. His new look is wonderful. I just want to tell all the other Manson fans out there to give this new album a chance. He is still Manson...and he is still a great musician and shock rocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"Just when rock and roll was starting to get too serious again, along comes a grandiose parody, Mechanical Animals. This album is great, not because it's really that shocking, or musically brilliant, but fun. Good old fashioned, blast it loud, fun. Thanks Mr. Manson, you've made my day ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful CD - Highly Recommended","review":"This is absolutely one of the best CDs I have ever bought. Mechanical Animals is, I feel, the best Marilyn Manson album ever put out, and one of the best albums I've ever heard, period. The music has the most unique sound, with lyrics that will actually make you think about the state of the world today. While Manson's other albums have their high and low points, this album is great all the way through. The first time I ever heard Manson in my life was from this album, and I new right then I had to have it. If he were ever able to top this album in some way, I think I would run outside and do a cartwheel because this has been one of my favorite pieces of music for three years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few Rock Stars still trying","review":"While another of Manson's operatically themed albums, this album takes a step forward in that its full of great rock songs. Its rare today that you get original sounding songs that tie back into rock history. In a landscape full of knock-offs and boybands, this album shines.If you're new to Marilyn Manson, go buy this album. Go buy it now. Your friends won't believe their ears. Its full of emotion, lyrics, melodies. At times it sounds just like David Bowie, but then at times Manson goes back and uses heavier guitars juxtaposed with soulful backup singers. Much better than Holy Wood and different than American Family or AntiChrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment of the Decade","review":"The title of track 4 sums this up.Rock is dead. Manson shifts from the in your face controversial metal that has accomponied the band since the beginning to more mainstreem,alternative, and Ziggy Stardust inspired music.Marilyn no longer screams.He prefers to try and sing which he fails at miserably.If you like bands that poorly imitate the Smashing Pumpkins then pick this up. Locate Anti-Christ Superstar or Portrait of an American family if you REALLY want a taste of Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"...I bought this expecting a hardcore, ..., vulgar, metal album, instead I got this.

The music on this Album is some of the best I've ever listened to. My favorite song on this album is Great Big White World because it has a very good guitar style and expresses emotion. The music on this c-d recieves five stars the cover deserves none."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good alternative to sleeping pills","review":"oh man, the most boring album since since Spahn Ranches \\"architecture\\". Now dont get me wrong im a Manson fan...but this album just sucked.

Skip this and buy Spooky Kids bootlegs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm warning you, this isn't any good!!!!!","review":"I don't like the songs on this cd. I don't think Manson sings about things that are worthwhile to listen to. There are a lot of other artist out there which you people could also really enjoy, so why don't you go for it and give someone else a try. This is just my point of view on Manson's cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome","review":"A Manson fan for years, I admit I had my doubts after reading the Rolling Stone interview. All my doubts were put to rest. This was far and away the best album of '98. This is my favorite album of all time; not one song is bad. Which songs stand out? All of them, seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible stuff","review":"Marilyn Manson didn't have any classic albums, and this one is certainly not any good either. His voice isn't that good, his ability to create a vocal melody is unspectacular, and the entire album sounds like a bunch of nonsense noise to me. Oh sure, some of his lyrics are alright, but everything else on the album fails to impress me. I recommend you check out the more talented, creative, and interesting Alice Cooper (specifically the early version of his band) instead. He's someone who knows how to shock AND please the listener at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"'rock is dead.' yeah, and guess who is helping to kill it? that's right, marilyn manson and his brand of kindergarten, no-talent garbage that he apparently doesn't even try to pass off as music. how people like this can make money off of the poor, moronic public is beyond me. wow, how controversial, he has t*ts on the cover. he swears!! oh my GOD!! the devil is coming!! oh, wait, it's just this poser trying to act hardcore and sh*t. music isn't how you LOOK, it's how you SOUND. don't buy this talent-free crap, for once in all of your miserable lives lead, don't follow!! progressive 4 ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw this away....","review":"Manson is definately a sell-out...and look at him..very disturbed...\\"Rock is dead\\" is like the only good song the rest is junk.

Marilyn Manson was not only an inspiration to me, and a representation of what I myself stood for and believed, even as a preadolescent child, but he was a saviour. I looked to him as the answer to life's most fundamental questions. When I saw the video for the dopeshow in 1998 I became nauseous. I suppose one could hurl invectives at me such as that I had or have no \\"life\\", or that I am a fool for believing so in another human being, but one must remember that we are all looking for answers, and when you think you find one, and then it's comfort is violently ripped away from you, it's bound to make you pretty sad. It makes me sad. I believe in the transforming powers of the arts. Marilyn Manson was a great human triumph up until Mechanical Animals, it was a big disappointment. This album gets one star for crushing my childhood dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"a non stop rail way frait train of hardcore rebeliousness","review":"marilyn manson is so tubular i blacked out the first time i herd this cd , manson is very scary becouse of all his creepyness .you all should watch out or he could beat you up beacouse hes really strong. people who give him bad reviews are just babys, babys are stupid. so watch out all you little babys becouse manson will eat your heart out of chest and make you watch if your not carefull. i hope manson never changes his talent is just smelling of harcore goodness. i know every album will just make me explode powerfull happiness"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a zero if I could","review":"I really don't get this type of music. This little albino goth is just screaming into a microphone. His music videos are just distirbing. I really dont like this.REAL rock music is seventies rock. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Hendrix all saw the true meaning to music. And Plus they all knew how to use thier instruments. I KNOW that all you gothic manson lovers are reading and thinking you want to kill me. Well I dont care. I don't see how you like this.

I have only recently spent time listening to his music and I saw his show in San Francisco this year. Great show. I really am not too concerned with his detractors or his supporters. I do think Marilyn Manson is very intelligent. The lyrics in his songs prove this, in my opinion, regardless of whether you agree with them or not. They have substance and meaning and have come from a person who has wisdom. I think Marilyn takes a lot of heat because parents, priests, and the like, realize their jobs become harder with people like Manson in the world and they don't trust themselves and their ability to reach their children. We must all remember that we can who we want to be as long as we do not hurt others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, an exilerating experience of screams and screaches","review":"For an unexplanable reason I love this CD, it drives me crazy listening to it. I've always seen Manson and his band on television in his black birdie outfit or his fake chest, but never really bothered to listen to his music, now I know what it's all about.If you have Manson, try his CD, this guy is screaming for attention, and here we give it to him. Hehe, I'm going to get his next CD for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Change!!","review":"Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar are like comparing chalk and cheese. Manson has dramatically changed his demonic, industrial-goth sound image, and presents a new kind of rock in his new album. Much easier to listen to, and not so filled with rage and anger, Mechanical Animals is Manson's best album by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just back from Hell, Mr. Manson (Omega) adjusts to heaven.","review":"With the majority of his fans having expelled the fears and world and loathing through the cathartic Antichrist Superstar, the record explores the slow and arduous task of learning how to be comfortable with comfort and feel at ease with feeling. Brilliant and a beautifully musical record. Manson's continued exploration of isolation as birthright is producing musical documentation of how we get so lost. And the tracks that rock, rock like a mothuh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson's most musically brilliant album so far","review":"Mecanical Animlas is one of those rare albums that brilliantly mixes genres, inculding glam, goth, and metal. The lyrics are heavily focused on drugs, but the overall effect that Manson feels like an outsider watching the human race. Both haunting and fun, Mechanical Animals is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I'll admit it, I was never a Marilyn Manson fan. Antichrist Superstar had about two good songs on it. I then heard some clips of some songs off Mechanical Animals, and immediately bought the CD. It's very different from the last one, and it's very good. Plus, it's packaging is unique, with hidden stuff inside the booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!","review":"This has always been my favorite album, and since i bought it i have always ben a devoted Manson fan. It should appeal to anyone who likes rock, rap, metal or dance and can be listened to over and over again. The Best songs are: 1) I dont like the drugs, 2)Posthuman 3)I want to dissappar, 4)User Friendly and 5)Rock is Dead. Go and buy it now!PS did anyone notice how \\"Posthuman\\" and \\"I dont like the drugs\\" sound exactly like David Bowie's \\"Scary Monsters\\" and \\"Fame?\\" Think about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The risciest album ever","review":"I would of given it four stars but this album deserves better. When I first saw this album cover I was about to say never mind I'll just get into a different band but I didn't and boy am I glad I didn't. This album is awesome because of the look, the sound and the lyrics. There is no slow point on this album. All though it does not compare to Holywood or Golden Age it does blow Antichrist Superstar out of the water. If you like this album then you might consider getting the movie God is in the T.V. which has all of Manson's videos up to this point. Plus, it shows a lot of backstage footage of the tour and is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock is NO longer dead","review":"Marilyn Mansons mechanical animals is just amazing i love it!This album is different from his others (although all his albums sound different) this is very 70/80 glam metal it is also more melancholy then his other albums and is very emotional but is great. this has great music and great lyrics. Also for people who loves zim zum's or John5's guitar writing/playing on MA and AcS ive got to say that it was Twiggy Rameriaz that recorded the guitar and Zum and 5 were only the live guitarists, but Zum recorded some parts on MA and 5 has writtin on the other albums (Holywood and GOAG)So buy this album now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"im annoyed...","review":"(...) songs like 'great big white world', 'disacoiative' and 'fundamentally loathesome' are very well dun and manson sings with passion about all of his subjects always. i think im gonna come on next time and diss sum of the musik you people like...hmm theres an idea..but hey, u no wot? I WUDNT SINK 2 YOUR LEVEL. i would recomend this cd to everyone who is open in their musik tastes and is willing 2 giv manson a try..it really is very good. thanks! cya"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Most people find Marilyn Manson appauling. The way he looks, the words he sings in his music, everything about him. Behind everything there is the music, and most people seem to judge him just for how he looks or what he is saying. But if you really to what he is saying, behind all the controversy, he is making valid points and opening our minds to various issues. That is what the shock effect is. An example of his best work is this album, Mechanical Animals.This time around, he went for a more futurstic, dare I say, techno sound with some bleeps and rhythms, not to say the music isnt hard anymore, because he sure can rock the house down with this music. Each of the songs on this album are very good, his approach to lyrics makes us think, and its not just a bunch of jitter, its serious material.I reccomend this cd to anyone who appreciates true music with deals with mature subject matter. Behind everything is this message which needs to be heard. Let Manson open your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mechanical Animals","review":"This album is all about pain and love. It is in true Manson style and outlines more of his love life than it ever has in previous albums. It also talks about a dream that Marilyn has had. The CD has alot of references to drugs, but mainly not in a bad way. I do have to say though that it is nowhere near as powerful and over-taking as the last album, \\"Antichrist Superstar\\", but it is still brilliant all the same. Over all, its a great CD to listen to at all times, and especcially good for a broken heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"top ten of my favorite romance novels","review":"I have to agree with all the rave reviews.

Don't expect to be swept along","review":"One of the core principles of good fiction writing is \\"show, don't tell\\". That holds even more true for film. This is an ambitious story which unfortunately unreels mostly through exposition. When the filmmakers do occasionally take advantage of the medium to show instead of describe they do it very well. Those scenes are few and far between, though - and usually brief. The actors (with one exception) handle the cumbersome dialogue impressively well. And whoever staged the operating room scenes (whether the director or second unit) needs to visit a hospital - or at least watch some medical dramas. These scenes lacked any credibility even to someone with my limited exposure. A movie more \\"interesting\\" than \\"engrossing\\".

It is very funny and interesting to see the story come to life.There is also another Homer Price film on this tape. It was made by a different studio, in a different year with a different cast, The Case of the Cosmic Comic.If you have read the book and are yearning for something more, then see this video for the first story.

Robert and Olivia Temple do not know very much about the sources of Aesopic fables, and they do a poor job of describing the history of this wonderful body of folklore. People who are really interested in Aesop would do well to look for a copy of Lloyd Daly's Aesop without Morals (out of print) or they can read the brilliant collection of Aesop's fables in seventeenth-century English by Roger L'Estrange (published in Everyman's Library Children's Classics, ISBN: 0679417907)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for children, but a good source & great book","review":"I think perhaps some of the reviewers here are missing the point of this book. And please don't go read Ben E. Perry's book because it's just full of falsities. I know, I've read it. Here's the thing: the fables that I and many others have grown up with are really adaptations and distortions of the real fables. And as the author points out, those fables may have been attributed to Aesop but he didn't think all of them up. He had other sources he drew from. These fables are probably not best read to children but if you're going to use them to help teach morals then adapting them to your own purpose is fine. However, I read this edition for a scholarly purpose because I'm interested in the origins of fables and folk tales. It is a really good book for that purpose. Morality was not Aesop's thing, the morals were attached later.

There are limitations to what this toy can do when compared with the traditional blocks because of its varying sizes, shapes and edges. However, my son is not fond of blocks, so he is sort of mesmerized by this.Since there are a lot of pieces of different size, I find storage to be a pain.

They are colorful and easy to interlink. At first I was disappointed that I didn't get more gears in this set but after awhile of seeing how durable they were and how much my son played with them I was appeased.I also got the bucket of Gears, Gears, Gears from another company and while those gears are a bit more plentiful and versatile, these gears are a must have set since they are larger, easier to handle and more colorful.

The set is made in Italy(!) and the pieces feel very sturdy. The reason why I give it 4 stars is assembling them can be a little tricky even for an adult.

The parts are very difficult for an adult to assemble and virtually impossible for a child to enjoy alone. The box did not contain any instructions to help in the management of the activity.

Other kids I have seen play with this toy have a lot of trouble too. It looks cool but isn't a practical choice for a kid. The base is really hard to put together because not all of the pieces will interlock with each other.

The pieces are fully interlocking, and none are the weird fake-edge pieces I find so annoying. Although I was indifferent to the \\"glow-in-the-dark\\" feature, it turned out to be kind of neat. The only annoying part is that the picture on the box does not show you where the glow-in-the-dark material was added, so I spent some time looking for the places in the picture where there are white lines, before I realized that the white lines are on the pieces only!

Don't get me wrong: there's riveting combat, but it's not the focus. O'Brian's concern here seems to be plot and character development. The subplots that get advanced are the respective romances of both Jack and Stephen, and we get deeper insights especially into Stephen, who -- much as I love Jack -- is swiftly becoming my favorite of the duo, not to mention one of my favorite literary creations of all time. In short, this is an amazing read, and the ending (I won't give it away, but the book is aptly titled) can't fail to leave you moved and thrilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Brian is superb.","review":"Another thorough novel by O'Brian.

I also would like to be sure that the action parts are based on some reality - the enthusiasts for the series say that it is, and the writing has a realistic historical flavour; however the 'top-gallants a lee, bring 'er about, nicely lads' stuff could just as easily be gobbledook for all I know.As a true son of Erin, I am quite happy with the reversal of usual stereotype - to have the English partner (Aubery) as a bluff, rash, unreflective type, and the Irish (or Catalan) type as reserved, intellectual, reflective but deadly.p.s. this one also has requited and unrequited long distance love, perhaps to interest the Signoritas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is an incredible series - well written and full of adventure and humor.

While there, Stephen comes across his affection, Diana Villiers, who is also under the affections of an enterprising man named Canning. My review scarcely does the book justice, but suffice to say that HMS Surprise is an engrossing read, and will keep one impressed with O'Brian and yearning for more of Aubrey and Maturin"},{"rating":"2","title":"HMS Surprise","review":"One of O'Brian's early novels of the Aubrey/Maturin series.The author will stand the test of time to rate above others of this type of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the best","review":"I've read all the Aubrey/Maturin books twice.

Which brings me to the best part of the game - the sheer challenge. Most games of today are beautiful, large, and quite simple to play. Ikaruga is the anti-friendly game. True, its easy to pick up, but not easy to master, and this makes the game very replayable.The only gripe I have is that the game is relatively short.But no matter, my friends will be crying trying to match my hire scores!Hahah...oh and one last thing - the music is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ikaruga=Aesthetic Experience!","review":"This is an \\"old-school\\" style space shooter. It also has some of the most elegant and beautiful gameplay I've ever seen. The graphics and sound are very good, but the gameplay is really what makes this stand out.Before buying it, I heard this game spoken of as the \\"thinking man's\\" shooter. Some have compared the subtle strategic aspects of the game to chess or go. If you're interested in seeing what one of the best and most addictive games ever plays like, I'd suggest buying this. BTW, its HARD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-school gameplay with new-school graphics","review":"Ikaruga is the perfect game for anyone who fondly remembers games like R-Type and Raiden, or any of the scores of other shooters that were popular on earlier game systems. Ported over from the Dreamcast version (not released in the U.S.), which itself was ported from the arcade version, Ikaruga is pretty much the only space shooter you will find on the GameCube at the present time.It doesn't disappoint, either. The ability to switch your ship alignment from \\"light\\" to \\"dark\\" and absorb like projectiles adds a unique spin on the game and is just enough to set it apart from other games in its category. It's easily recommended to anyone who grew up playing shooters or who just wants something different from the normal GameCube fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ikaruga raped my mind...","review":"This game is hard. Prepare to have your brain raped and eyeballs spanked. If you love old-school twitch goodness that puts hair on your chest, buy this game, take it home, and be abused by gameplay. This game serves as a lesson to all you casual gamers (who I hate SO MUCH,) as to what a real gamer looks like. 3D graphics and exploration is great, (however, sports games are inexcusable...) but every once in a while, you need to bring it all back home. Take my advice, if you want your kids to grow up knowing what a VIDEO GAME!, (not a video game, but a VIDEO GAME!) looks like, then force them to play this along with all those great SNES games. It's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Masterpiece","review":"Ikaruga is short, fast, and brutal. It's not for everybody, but if you're a fan of shooters, there's nothing better. The enjoyment of this game comes from working at it, trying over and over, and increasing your skills gradually. You're in pretty good shape if you can even reach the end of this game, even though it's possible to play through it in a single sitting. As your skills with Ikaruga develop, you're sure to get more and more addicted. The gameplay is ingenious; the pacing, perfect. Even the graphics are beautifully done, and the music is grand and quite fitting. Ultimately, Ikaruga is a game that many people may find difficult to appreciate for it's brutal difficulty, but nonetheless, it is a true masterpiece of a game, and will forever be known as a legendary shooter from a legendary developer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly hard and clever shmup","review":"This is an absolute must for any shmup fan. The twist here is that there is two colors of enemies; white and black. You can switch the color of your own ship to alternate between these two colors, which lets you absorb the bullets of the color you are in order to build up your special attack. It is an extremely hard game. I've read that there is only 5 levels but so far I could not even make it through the third. There is a lot of challenge and sometimes there is so much bullets in the screen that your eyes hallucinate and your brain almost switch off. Only for the most hardcores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"There's no story behind this game. The back of the package displays a greatly written intro to a story, but as you begin to play, you realize that this is just a simple point and click shooting game. For those of you who enjoy pointing and clicking without reason, go ahead and buy it. But for the rest of you, esspecially those who enjoy a good story, stray away from this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky shooter game for the Gamecube","review":"Fans of arcade shooters should not miss this game. Ikaruga is extremely punishing but through the high difficulty, it still remains entertaining. Storyline aside (you can learn about it on your own), the game consists of blasting your way through levels. This game boasts the cool ability of being able to change your ships polarity (from white-to-black or vice-versa) with the push of a button, which allows you to soak up bullets of the same color and gives you the advantage of multiplied damage versus enemies of opposite polarity. Ikaruga is a great and surprisingly difficult game to add to your library and is a great way to cruise (or fly) down memory lane (for fans of old-school arcade shooters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Murder Music","review":"Beenie Man's music encourages people to kill gays.

The right of \\"free speech\\" is limited by criminal laws on \\"incitement to violence\\", but the boundary is fuzzy. When asked to apologize and change his ways, Beenie Man wrote a song about how he would not apologize (\\"No Apology\\", 2005).

They wouldlose one guitar, and replace it with stupid keyboards. Giving the Critics and MTV what they want. Yuck. Every album after Communique would just get worse and worse. (although I like the soundscape of \\"private investigations\\" and the song \\"Brothers in arms\\" NOT the album).This album is truly their best. It has my favourite Dire Straits song \\"Where do you think you're going\\", wich is really damn catchy. \\"News\\" is another brilliant song.I like the fact that this album didn't contain any radio hits, it makes you judge it for the music itself, wich is beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tracklist, courtesy of Wiki","review":"Communiqué is the second album by British rock band Dire Straits, & was recorded in November and December 1978, at Compass Point Studios, Nassau and was produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett.All songs written by Mark Knopfler.1. \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" - 5:252. \\"News\\" - 4:143. \\"Where Do You Think You're Going?\\" - 3:494. \\"Communiqué\\" - 5:495. \\"Lady Writer\\" - 3:456. \\"Angel of Mercy\\" - 4:367. \\"Portobello Belle\\" - 4:298. \\"Single-Handed Sailor\\" - 4:429. \\"Follow Me Home\\" - 5:50This above information was found on Wikipedia, under Dire Straits' discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up!","review":"Excellent second album from the most underrated musican ever!

Still, it sounds pretty good and can be a pleasant listen if one doesn't concentrate too hard. \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is a promising start, one of the better tracks, with Knopfler's sardonic writing in force, \\"Sitting on the fence, that's a dangerous course/ You could even catch a bullet from the peace-keeping force,\\" but \\"News\\" stutters and \\"Where Do You Think You're Going\\" gets going only in the last minute. From \\"Communique\\", the album mellows a bit, and with a hint of flamenco and a hint of funk and the title track is a nice tune, though far from truly vital. The single, \\"Lady Writer\\" is rehashed Sultans of Swing, but a catchy song for all that, and so on...the songs taken on their own are just fine, but the sum is considerably less than its parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Writer is the only good song.","review":"Maybe in my opinion this is the lamest Dire Straits album yet by Brothers in Arms.

Although I have grown accustomed to the new fantasy that is being written, what was once deemed a classic simply follows a prodigal wizard who first must face a \\"dark\\" enemy, then subsequently we see three stories with little enemy development or self development.

It still maintains the Original Death flavor.However, after using this sauce on more items, I learned it really wasn't a hotter version of After Death. The ginseng flavor comes through strongly when enough is used. It's still very good on a burger mixed with ketchup, good mixed with BBQ sauce on chicken or anything that uses soy sauce really, and passable on rice, but if you use enough, the chemically Ginseng flavor can wreck some dishes too.I would recommend this for those who would only use a drop or two at a time. In that case, this is still a very good sauce.

I personally have come to doubt these writers' ability to tell the truth, as what they take in, and put out, is so tainted by their agenda (political, ideological, whatever). If you are a person who believes strongly similar to these writers, and you wish to look at all of the world through such tainted glasses, you will enjoy this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The American West: A New Interpretive History (The Lamar Series in Western History) by John Mack","review":"This book is painfully flawed in it's NEW interpretation.

I can't believe Hine and Faragher call themselves historians.The name Canada comes from a chance meeting between Jacques Cartier and two young native Indians in 1535. The two Indians were showing Cartier the route to their village, Stadacona but they called their village \\"Kanata\\", (the Huron-Iroquois word for village). The name stuck and Kanata was then used by Cartier and other explorers to apply to an increasingly larger area. In 1547 everything north of the St. Lawrence River was designated as \\"Canada.\\" The first official use of the name was in 1791 when Quebec was divided into Upper and Lower Canada. On July 1, 1867 - the date of the country's confederation - the name \\"Canada\\" was assumed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"The arm holes are way too small. It looks and feels cheap.

Not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"I usually shy away from discouraging others from watching a movie, because who knows what their taste is, right? But this was the biggest waste of my time I have ever experienced. It was so bad in every way, and not in a kitchy-b movie kind of way, just bad. They tried to make it looked home filmed, which just came off as cheap and bad. They had the same few actors commenting repeatedly, which was bad. Pauly's performance was so whiny and annoying that by the end of the movie I WANTED him to be dead. I would rather sit at the dentist's office getting my teeth drilled out with no painkillers than ever watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth you're time","review":"I did not like anything about this movie.

I was let down allot it brought nothing what so ever, I don't even think the acting if that is what you call it was good.

But he didn't.Instead Pauly produces a lame, laughless series of scenes featuring \\"himself\\" and other semi-celebs being \\"Not-Funny\\". althought he scene with Carrot Top buying Pauly's house is pretty funny.Overall the film falls flat trying to be both surreal and funny, leaving the viewer saying, \\"What?\\" a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"The screenplay, if one can call this one note monstrosity that, was written by Shore and some guy named Kirk Fox, yet it all smacks of being a vanity project, laced with bad one liners where the B listers try to recall who Shore was, after his \`death', then rail against him when exposed. You know you're film is in trouble when a supposedly funny scripted line by Chris Rock, \`No Pauly. [blank] you. Stay dead,' turns out to be the most genuine reaction to this film.

Should I feel sympathy for him because of that, or should I loathe and detest the mere fact that he has been able to get movies made? Of the two choices, I'm going with the latter.This movie is a lame attempt by Shore to reinvent himself as a misunderstood genius, but to do it by poking fun at the mere fact that he could ever consider himself to be a misunderstood genius. Wow, how very ironic and clever. It's not a terrible idea. Charlie Kaufman might have been able to make something genius of it. However, in the hands of Pauly Shore, you get garbage. The wittiest thing tht happens is that people confuse Tom Sizemore for Michael Madsen, and vice versa. If that's you're idea of hilarity, then you deserve this movie.Seriously, this is a TERRIBLE movie. I wish Pauly Shore no ill will, but the money spent on this movie is gone forever. Please, don't reward the fools who spent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sexy modern romance!","review":"A very sensual romance to curl up with anytime.

I was so disappointed after watching it with her. Kitty and Mimi are told by their parents that Santa is not real. I thought this was going to be a great video like the classic Frosty and Rudolph ones, but it is not. Also, the voices in the movie are very shrill and seem to be screaming a lot of the time. It is not calming at all. I would not recommend buying this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULD HAVE DIED!!!","review":"I couldn't believe this video wasn't properly summarized on the back for parents of preschoolers!!! When I started to watch this with my girls I almost fainted when the concept of 'Santa's not real' came up- My girls hadn't even considered he wasn't real. It sort of ends up ok- but there is some lying on the parents part that is introduced. I would NEVER buy this for a young child.

He's relayed some of the stories and info, and I'll probably be reading it after him! Although I will be sure to update this once he finishes it (with more of his input!), I would not hesitate to recommend this book.

The entire CD is absolutely breathtaking. \\"Pieta, Signore\\" (Have mercy on me, Lord) - is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever written, and there is NO ONE that can deliver it like the Great Man. There is a passion, sincerity, reverence, urgency and depth to his singing here that is just unsurpassed. You will come away KNOWING that he believed every word that passed his lips. This album does exactly what all holiday albums should do, which is make us feel, realize and honor the true meaning of Christmas.If you're looking for a Christmas album to convey the spirit and meaning of the season, this is the one.

Pavarotti sings with sincerity and great musicality. The songs are familiar and some are 'potboilers' (such as Schubert's \\"Ave Maria\\" and \\"Panis Angelicus\\"). Pavarotti's voice is characteristically warm, open-throated and full yet there is an intimacy to these recordings, which were made over several decades.Pavarotti sings with various top class orchestras and some songs have a choral backing. There are 17 songs, which is generous.It seems strange to have included \\"Che faro senza Euridice?\\" on what is otherwise a CD of exclusively Christian music, but Pavarotti does such a beautiful job with it that that is a minor quibble.This is a CD which will give the listener years of pleasure.O Holy Night / Luciano Pavarotti / Special Deluxe Edition (Decca)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pavarotti's Christmas CD","review":"Since Pavarotti's death, there will be no more wonderful Christmas music from such a perfect voice.

I've read the reviews that mentioned this problem before I decided to purchase it, but I still went for it because I thought others buyers had it exposed under dusty environment. The truth is that this case gets dirty and dark naturally. The material is not good at all.Don't waste your money on this case and it's NOT worth 20 bucks at all.

I can't get the music to Changing of the Guards, out of my head. It is obviously my favorite cut on the CD. If I had to pick, I'm generally into CD's more for the melody than the lyrical content. Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), and True Love Tends to Forget, are very strong musically as well. As another reviewer mentions, this is probably an underrated album. I give it a solid B. I find most of the other songs, good but not great. As always, I find the lyrics challenging but thought provoking and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable album.","review":"This is one of my favorite albums by Dylan. Not a fan of the female vocalists to be truthful but this album is definitely worth listening to without a doubt.

It was my favorite album when I was in collage, A friend gave me a guitair speaker and I hooked up the record player to that- but when I started listening to music on a 5.1 system the sound on this cd was so bad it took me a song just to get adjusted to how much worse it sounded then my aveage cd. Then this came out and I rememberd why this was the greatest album of all time to me. Its best taken on a Saturday night after 10 p.m. with a bottle of wine and maybe a :\\"cigarette\\". Whoever said giving up the love that defines the love that last forever is easyZ? Just stop crying already- lets just expend some goodwill and git on with our lives already. anyway the invisable me is clawing at the door and he wont go away so i think I better intrude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Street Legal","review":"Street Legal being Dylan's 1978 record and his 18th release as artist is a very good album. This album in question was a major musical departure for Dylan. This is the first album in which he utilizes a large pop-rockband complete with female backing singers. One can not get stuck in a rut and I think it was a bold move. The book-let contains no lyrics which is a shame. It does have a list of who plays what and that is very nice. To imagine that he paid a photographer for the front cover is a puzzle. It is simple snap shot of Bob standing near a flight of stairs. Joel Bernstein must be a good friend since the inside is a travesty. Even so songs like Is your love in vain?, Changing of the guards are very good. I can not understand why on earth this album got such negative reviews in America but was generally liked in Europe. This not amazing album but good enough to get 4/5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, Bob excels","review":"Once again, Bob Dylan grabs our attention with an imagination that only he can do.This album (CD,MP3,cassette,) however you listen to it goes great with your choice of drink; (at least 3 or 4).It always takes me back to the great times that were going on when it was first released.If you know & like Bob Dylan & have not heard this album; you owe it to yourself to own this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"This is probably the only album in Dylan's catalogue I can't stand (aside from, of course, SAVED - but that's a given for most). I don't know what it is...the use of female backup singers, the tepid big band instrumentaion, or Dylan's tired-sounding vocals. There are some decent songs here, but they're marred by poor delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It's Not Funny","review":"Some albums are worth having, and some aren't. I found this for GBP 2 ($3) in a bargain bin and I wasted my money. Don't get me wrong, Bob is the King (sorry, Presley fans), nobody could write what he has written, but sometimes the guy just had a contract to fulfill and turned out whatever junk was in the back pages of his lyric book. I haven't been able to pay enough attention to know what the lyrics are like, I have trouble getting through a listen! Don't buy this. Buy Bringing it all Back Home, or Desire, or Highway 61 or, just buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"Dylan's first really dull, undistinguished, mediocre album--even \\"Self Portrait\\" was interesting if flawed. For such a great artist, it's a terrible let down. Unworthy of him. I cannot see how anyone could compare this to Dylan's masterpieces of the 1962-67 period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars? Get real...!","review":"First of all I'd like to ask all those who gave this album 5 stars how they'd rate Blood on the Tracks! 20 stars? This album was recommended to me by a friend, but now that I have it I'm sure it was just his idea of a joke..haha. There are only two songs on the entire CD that are worth listening to, Changing of the Guards and Señor (Tales of Yankee Power). The rest of the songs are so weak I can hardly believe it. \\"Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?\\" Need I say more? Well, yes I do 'cause so far I haven't even mentioned the AWFUL gospel choir that accompanies Dylan throughout the album. It will drive you MAD. So go ahead and buy this album if you want to, but don't ever say nobody warned you against it. Oh, if you do buy it anyway make sure to get the remastered and remixed edition. I didn't...but I'm sure you'll understand if I don't rush out to buy the enhanced new version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real blood on the tracks","review":"Dismissed as imitation Springsteen by several critics (presumably due to the prominence of Steve Douglas's saxophone), \\"Street Legal\\" caught Bob Dylan at mid-point in a creative hot streak that started with \\"Planet Waves,\\" and ended with \\"Infidels.\\" Far from sounding \\"fake\\" (Rolling Stone's description of this album), there is an effortless quality to both the songs and the performances as if pure inspiration was at work. \\"I wish I was a magician,\\" Dylan sings at one point, and on \\"Street Legal\\" he truly is. From the countrified \\"We Better Talk This Over\\" to the sorrowful \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" this album is as bittersweet as \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and, at times, much more powerful. You can really feel the blood on these tracks, and, in retrospect, it shouldn't have been a surprise to see Dylan embrace Christianity a year later. Who but the Lord could relieve such pain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creeper","review":"Where was I in '79..? Why did I not have this LP? Why was I listening to the likes W.A.S.P. and Iron Maiden in the '80s?First couple listens may be labored. But soon you'll be thinking about the arrangements of these songs. By far one of the top 35 LP's by Dylan. Name a bad one? But honestly folks, if you are on the fence and checking out the mid career of Dylan, looking to fill in the gaps in your catalog from the late 70's and 80's LP's and wondering where to start....start here. Infidels is just as solid too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's Most Underrated Album","review":"Dylan's conversion to raving fundamentalist Christianity shouldn't have come as a surprise to anybody who heard Dylan at Budokan or Street Legal. That's because: a) Budokan is evidence that he'd lost it to the point that his songs no longer meant anything whatsoever to him, and b) Street Legal is a brilliant and powerful chronicle of a guy who's losing his grip. Songs like \\"Baby, Please Stop Crying,\\" \\"Journey Through Dark Heat,\\" and \\"We Better Talk This Over\\" continue the breakup narrative of Blood on the Tracks and Desire, taking it to a more desperate level (\\"I think we better talk this over, maybe when we both get sober...\\"). Songs like \\"Changing of the Guards,\\" \\"New Pony,\\" and \\"Senor,\\" on the other hand, appear to find him wandering a wasteland far more stark than the playful landscape of \\"Desolation Row,\\" grasping at symbols, crying \\"this place don't make sense to me no more....\\" Harrowing stuff, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of TOOM should give this a listen","review":"World Gone Wrong may've directly preceded TOOM, but the groundwork goes past Oh Mercy back to Street-Legal. Here you find Dylan referring to Robert Johnson on more than one occasion: the raw sound of New Pony, the title Is Your Love In Vain (Johnson's title was Love In Vain), the juice running down my leg line in Where Are You Tonight? No Time To Think adopts in the polka sound attempted in the demo version of Like a Rolling Stone. Senor became an immediate favorite upon first listen-it sounded great live in '78 and it's still a highlight of Dylan's concerts. The last four songs on this release achieve a cumulative power. The album wasn't generally well received during its original release. It's good to know the critical tide has turned somewhat over the past few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned to like it","review":"This was a dylan album I had no interest in buying even when I tried to buy everything he owned. I had heard that it was strange and unfocused. I bought the full remastered set and this CD came with it. It was one of the last I listened to and I immediately disliked it. I returned to it a few weeks later and found it a little more managable, and now I quite like it from start to finish.I am typically pretty easy on Dylan, liking a lot of his lesser albums, but I do believe this is on par with Infidels and Oh Mercy, maybe even better.You just have to get past the strange arrangement on some songs and the awful backkup singers.I do believe this album has some of Dylans best singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My last deal gone down","review":"The recording is muddy. The imagery is mostly dark. The last album before the born again phase. The backup singers are annoying at times. But, you can smell the seventies when you listen to it.

He detailed his journey for a cure - and he literally tried about everything. He partnered his experience with the scientific data of why we snored and well as what worked for others and the effectiveness of each method throughout the snoring world. It was also a fairly quick read.On the downside, a lot of the information is readily available for free on the Internet. He did do an excellent job of compiling lots of knowledge in one source that had me laughing on several occasions. Personally, I would rather read a 150 pages book than comb through 25 websites to find the information that I really want.In summary, don't think reading this book is going to automatically sure your snoring.

Unfortunately, it is not logistically possible for all of America to be invited to a White House event...but here we get to see exactly what it looks like!

I've always enjoyed the Black Widower mystery stories, but in this fifth collection of those stories we learn that Asimov has pretty much run out of good ideas. So he publishes bad ones instead.

They have 4 small slits that accept standard nylon zip cable ties (sold separately). Having a larger sticky surface than most stick-ups, they adhere very well to the bottom of desks. There are a few dozen (50?) in the $15 pack, so it is good for those that install many computers (IT support staff). Most people need only one or two squares. (Cables for mouse, keyboard, USB). When you relocate, you cut the zip ties and leave the thin-flat squares stuck under the desk for the next installation.I had been looking for inexpensive, effective, and unabtrusive self-adhesive cable tamers for years, and was pleasantly surprized by how well these (fairly large) flat squares work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, until the next day","review":"I spent a few hours using these adhesive squares to run a 100'+ cat5 cable and I must admit I was extremely pleased when I was done, It turned out great. Then the next day, 3-4 squares fell off the wall .. no biggie .. I replaced them with new ones. Then the next day, I did the same thing. A week later half my cable is on the wall, the other half has fallen to the floor. 17/48 of my squares have now fallen. Very disappointed, however, it was a low risk investment. I'll try a different vendor and cannot recommend this product if you are sticking it to a wall or the door frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"The adhesive backing isn't as strong as I would have liked.

We've used these on racks, pc cases, desks, walls, etc. Walls and the lower trim pose the greatest long term issue, where the adhesive may come loose. Overall a great mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, needs better adhesive.","review":"I really like the low profile of these mounts, but I have found they do not hold well to finished particle or glue board, which is what a lot of desks and tables are made of on the underside. About half of them that I placed had come unstuck after just a couple of days. I have not tried it, but maybe they stick better to painted metal or plastics."},{"rating":"2","title":"holds on tight, priced right","review":"This 100 pack is quite the bargain; I used these to neaten up some cords around my home. The adhesive works well on most surfaces but I also figured out that I can apply a flat headed screw right through the center of these for extra hold in that rare spot if/where I need it - works perfectly!

Because in the 1940s and even in the 1950s, we did not have the technology that we have today. Therefore, the author relied upon instinct and good old fashioned detective work. That makes the mysteries of these very odd diseases outlined in this book to be even more fascinating.This is a good book. Each chapter dwells on a different, odd and unusual illness, and it is up to the author to get to the bottom of what, where, and how. This book would make a good TV series. I recommend it. Although not cutting-edge technology, it has its charms by relating human intelligence and human curiousity, and it will certainly keep your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is amazing! I love it and recommend it to my friends. The author formerly wrote for a New York magazine, and his stories cover decades.

Our systems have gotten much more complex, more inter-coupled than they were decades ago --think of the recent (Summer '03) East Coast power failure. Systems Engineering tools, techniques, and education must progress to address the new complexity. This is why Buede's book is invaluable. He has digested much of the current state of thinking regarding systems engineering practices and concepts, and made them available.This book reflects where systems engineering is going. It is written for practicing systems engineers who deal with complex systems, and for students who have someone leading them through the subject. Persons who engineer complex systems will find this book valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this so called book","review":"The worst text book for system engineering you could ever buy.Concepts are vague, the text could have been much simpler, and the concept much clearer.

The plot is fairly traditional- marriage of convenience, dour man rescued by the love of a good woman, Napoleonic schemes- but the dialogue is absolutely the worst I've ever read in this type of novel. By trying to cram in every single possible example of period speech, the author makes the conversations wooden and often incomprehensible. Serious issues like child abuse are thrown in seemingly to add interest, but are abandoned rather than explored. Each character is more like a cariacature and the end of the book does not provide any satisfactory answers to the questions raised during the course of the book.

It's very hard to get it now, but if you do, make sure that the one you're getting fits the plug on your mobile phone. Most of the models you will find have a metal ring jutting out of the base of the plug, so your phone needs to have a canal around where you plug the headphone. I always had it pried off completely. Otherwise, the plug doesn't go all the way, which in turn makes the sound in the earpiece go in and out.I do love it. It's very discreet and easy to carry since it's not bulky. It doesn't hurt my ears, but it will if I use it for hours.

I have modest expectations of books like these, figuring that if I can capture one new useful piece of wisdom, my time and money would be well spent. Unfortunately, I did not find anything useful here.In addition, I found the style of the book made it hard to move through the book quickly while easily capturing the few big ideas.

And I look forward to this author's future work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Road Trip Reading","review":"My husband and I give Hidden Place rave reviews. Couldn't put it down even through the stimulating interstate scenery of I-80 through Nevada and eastern Wyoming. Shiflett nailed the Chicago ambiance of my teenage and early college years so well.Brought back some good and not so good sights, scenes and personalities. I think I've met Mila's parents, somewhere along the way. The Mexico scenes made us feel like we were right back in San Blas, Mexico wolfing down Camarones a la Diabla and \\"chumpando-ing\\" cervezas under a sandy palapa. Some great story-telling. The descriptions were so authentic that some personal experiences must have been incorporated or embellished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written","review":"Mr. Shiflett's brilliant work keeps the reader enthralled and entertained.

The story is excellent and production is well-done. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadulterated Garbage","review":"Let's be clear about what this book is. With his adult version of this book, The Curse of the Bambino, Dan Shaughnessy milked a series of Red Sox failures for nearly two decades before the team won a World Series. He would work a mention of the alleged curse into practically every column he wrote about the Red Sox. It was unvarnished hucksterism at its worst. With this book, Shaughnessy is attempting to repackage his nonsense into a children's book that can continue his flow of royalties now that the \\"curse\\" no longer exists. Not surprisingly, the writing is terrible, as it's simply a mail-in job.Parents considering buying this book should also consider that Shaughnessy has used his column to mock and demean players on the Red Sox. Harsh criticism is expected from sports columists, but calling one player a \\"piece of garbage\\" and mocking another's documented mental disability is beyond the pale. Is this the sort of person you want to support with your purchases?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...If you believe in witchcraft","review":"Admittedly I am a Yankees fan, but I still thought--at first--this seemed like a cute book. Indeed, I even gave it as a gift to expectant parent friends from New England.But if I'm honest, I have three problems with it.1a: First and foremost, it perpetuates a \\"Curse\\" which was simply a face-saving method of making excuses. As better writers have said, it rationalized--even justified--ineptitude, making losing a badge of honor for Red Sox fans.1b: The basis for said \\"curse\\" does indeed appear to be anti-Semitic in nature. (A 'Curse' born of hate, by Glenn Stout/ESPN).2: Finally, and especially on subsequent re-readings, the book seems light. I understand it is a book for young readers, but where is the explanation for how the Sox won in 2004, other than a full moon?

He attempts here to get his claws into children and brainwash them into believing his so-called \\"curse\\" gibberish, and therefore perpetuate his own revenue stream. The Shank's hope, so transparently self-serving, is that these kids will grow up buying more of his foolish fiction. The real \\"curse\\" was the alcoholic haze under which the Red Sox were run and managed by the Yawkeys, Harrington, et al(thank you Clark Booth and Leigh Montville, two real journalists, for pointing this out). Parents: Be warned! Keep your kids away from The Shank."},{"rating":"1","title":"turning anti-semtism into a children's book","review":"In a recent ESPN article, baseball historian and author Glenn Stout revealed the truth about the so-called \\"Curse of the Bambino\\": it is rooted in anti-semitic slander that originated 80 years ago with Henry Ford's racist newspaper, the Dearborn Independent. (Evidently, Ford thought Red Sox owner Henry Frazee was Jewish.) Now that the truth has been exposed -- a truth that evidently escaped Mr. Shaughnessy's reporting of the original \\"Curse\\" -- it is sad and disappointing that Mr. Shaughnessy and his publisher have chosen to push all this on children.Then again, perhaps Mr. Shaughnessy will do the right thing and revise his book to acknowledge the anti-semitic roots of the \\"Curse\\" he helped popularize. It would be the honorable thing to do, and he should be commended if he chooses that approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a story of survival ...","review":"... of a viewer of this extremely boring and stupid movie.

It wasn't much more than a rip-off of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Frozen\\". Frankly, there was just nothing original about it, nor was it very realistic. Plane crashes in arctic, wolves hunt survivors. My personal favorite has to be the fact that in the movies, people seem to be able to survive being submerged in icy water for extended periods of time, emerge dripping wet in subzero temperatures and yet continue to plod on. Yeah, yeah, I know... it's just a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on..........","review":"What could have been a good movie ended up being a little stupid. It may help a lot if you know nothing of wildlife and firearms when you watch this movie and if you have seen neither \\"Survivorman\\" nor \\"Man Vs Wild\\". Liam's character carries a rifle but we are always shown shotshells. Then, he \\"Macgyvers\\" the shotshells to the ends of sticks and states that they are like \\"bangsticks\\". I wouldn't try that at home nor in a survival situation. Liam takes control of this group of \\"survivors\\" but if I were one of them, I would have thought that he was dummer than a bucket of hair. They should have never left the wreckage of the plane in the first place. Lastly, the portrail of wolves as \\"land sharks\\" is way over the top and only adds to an unjustified bad image for the animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen B-Movies with more realistic animals","review":"Forget that Liam Neeson is and has always been a wooden actor. His movies are usually carried by the plot or his co-stars, yet they always come off fairly decent. However, when you add CGI wolves to the mix that look more fake than a prosthetic leg, how am I suppose to take this seriously? Did The Edge (which is a much better film I might add) animate the Grizzly Bear? Even the wolves in the The Breed & The Canyon looked better than this with probably half the budget. I could really care less for any of the characters in the film because of the crappy acting from Liam and the overall fakeness. I nearly split a gut every time someone would die and Liam stared off into space trying to show some sort of emotion. This guy couldn't portray grief if you killed his whole family. Don't waste your money. Buy a proper wilderness movie like The Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grey Review","review":"Waste of time for the most part. The scene where they climb down the trees and the wolves are already there at the bottom waiting? Stupid, it should have given them several hours distance between the wolves. He ends up at their den, which must have been at least 20 miles from the plane. Makes no sense. And the ending. What a joke. I hate movies that leave it up to the viewer. It's cheap and over used. So there is no ending to the film which means you're wasting your time. I'm glad I just rented it on Netflix. Not Neeson's best performance either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic tragedy, badly done","review":"Virtually every character that matters dies. That's a hard story to pull off. The number of well known tragedies is rightly short. This movie won't be joining that list.The basic premise of a pack of wolves hunting down a group of humans is unconvincing. The majority of the human characters seem like caricatures. The choices they make trying to get themselves rescued are laughably stupid. And the bit with the wallets literally made me slap my forehead. Just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Thought it might be an exciting survival/ inspirational tale.

Who doesn't like Liam Neeson, but this film is really awful. It's difficult to know where to start, but the two central concepts that defy belief are these: that a passenger jet could go down on American soil and no one will be interested in getting to the crash site; second, that on a planeload of roughnecks returning from a drillsite near the Arctic Circle, there is ONE firearm, and it becomes inoperable because of the crash. There are many more, but the film depends on your acceptance of these whoppers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from The Grey","review":"Give an award to the trailer editors for splicing together something from their imagination that held no reality to the film's true nature or theme. From the beginning moments to the closing scene, the entire movie is about death. And while there's nothing wrong with movies that deal with this important topic, this film was devoid of all deeper meaning or greater perspective. It fell from gray to a depressing shade of black. Then, as if it hadn't already overdosed on it's loathing of life, it felt the need to inject lethal doses of human depravity, over-the-top violence, unrealistic fight-against-nature sequences, and a script that could have been written by troubled middle schoolers (trying to outdo each other with how many f-bombs they can squeeze into each phrase).Philosophical depth? No. Just a look at fatalism from a cold, shallow perspective.What wasted opportunities -- for this film, a great actor, and my evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"just horrible","review":"I watched the trailer and it looked good but it was a complete let down the movie plot was really sketchy and the ending was the worst EVER!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruined this movie","review":"This movie was pretty good until the end.

If you've seen the commercial you've seen the movie, the other hour and 58 minutes is filler. The ending is horrible. Not horrible in the Horror sense but in the terrible, no-good sense.

BUT it's still a pretentious half assed bore at times as well. For every great scene or moment, there's three more frustrating, unfinished scenes that are mired in self concious twaddle.It's almost as if the very talented Joe Carnahan started with an unfinished story and has blown it out with brooding, contemplative moments that only occasionally work. Ironically, had this been the man battling wolf thriller it was promoted as, it really might have been something.Thank God for Liam Neeson, it's his strong presence and natural gravitas that anchor this otherwise muddled experience, in fact without him it would be almost unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogs rock","review":"I just endured this ridiculous movie.

It was quite boring and dull, and the wolves looked very fake. The amount of bad language in the movie was ridiculous. I know there are some who don't care about language at all, but there comes a point where it is way too much. Every other word there seemed to be an f-bomb dropped.

If you have any faith whatsoever, the movie is an anti-God movie disguised as an action flick. It was pretty detailed in its objections to God, but it didn't even attempt to explain in a real way the validity of God. It's like watching a one-sided argument for the most part. I respect the right for people to not believe, but if you are going to present a debatable point in a movie, at least present both sides well. After watching this movie, it left this hopeless, meaningless, I-just-wasted-my-time feeling in my gut. The movie really just reaffirmed my faith in God because I never would want to live or die with this sort of mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grey","review":"Liam Neesan will hopefully be more choosey with his roles.

I was sorely disappointed. While this movie could have provided insights in how people face death, it fell flat on its face. The wolves were portrayed with an uncanny ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound or a very large canyon while the humans were portrayed as stupid and having absolutely no common sense at all. The scenes showing Neeson's character with his wife were unconvincing in that she was supposedly dying and yet her makeup was perfect and she looked like she could walk the runway at any minute. With movie technology being what it is, the wolves were more cartoonish than scary and we were never really able to see them anyway.

I know enough about wolves to know they don't behave like these. I didn't read any reviews or synopses before seeing it and after a while I was wondering if it was some kind of werewolf-movie or perhaps a prehistoric beast up there in Alaska!

Kind of an open ending. Don't get me wrong. I like it when films do that, but I don't think it worked for me here. I wanted more but didn't get it. However, I did really enjoy the movie overall. Great acting, good directing, and interesting characters. I give it 4 stars!

There are no real ideas here, the entire film could have been a brilliant 20 minutes of lovely, grim determination, but instead it keeps repeating the same tale: survive the wolves in the cold. That's it. For an hour and a half.

You get characters developed enough to care about and some surprises here and there. Carnahan's story and direction get's the viewer emotionally invested. This isn't for the faint of heart.

Along the way, the elements and terrain, along with a nasty band of attacking wolves, complicate things in a predictable way.

You basically start to watch it just to find out who dies next. The suspense was just lacking and the story didn't really end.

It all seems awfully calculated and down rght stupid. Coming from Finland, it's hard to believe that someone would freeze to death, if rivers are running free and sun is shining. Silly movie for silly people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap - Not worth renting, Not worth buying","review":"Don't believe me and watch it. If wagging a dead dog's head in the dark and howling from the dark woods gets you off, then dig this one. The constant camera shaking is a cheap trick to hide the lack of investment into good special effects. Not so special in any way. Absolute trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This movie was seemed contrived from the start. I do not watch many movies and I am sorry I wasted my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"Leaving the plane wreck site where there is plenty of material to make weapons, food, shelter and probably the only possible place where any rescuers could have a chance of finding you is STUPID. If you remove the ridiculously unrealistic wolves, all you have is a bunch of morons who spend most of the movie whining instead of making weapons to fight the Wargs that must have escaped from The Lord Of The Rings film set..............Don't get me wrong, if there had been a nuclear accident or toxic waste spill that would explain how wolves could turn into the monsters shown in the film, I might have given the film two stars................"},{"rating":"1","title":"video quality poor","review":"The movie was boring and the quality of the streaming was poor so I use 100% VUDU now. 2 hrs. of fake stuffed dog heads was a waste of time.

SO i was excited to watch the GREY. but was dissappointed and would not recommend this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Suspense!","review":"I'm not usually big on survival movies, but am on Liam Neeson movies. To this against all odds suspense survival movie, Liam Neeson adds his usual emotional flair simply in the tone of his voice and the mere energy he adds to any movie. The Grey will keep you guessing as to what and who will happen next right up to the last minute where you will on the edge of your seat holding your breath (I know I was)!

Ridiculous plot: their plane crashes and wolves hunt them down...I'm not spoiling the movie for you as this is apparent in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Since when do wolves hunt people?!? Thought it would be at least okay since Liam Neeson was in it--nope.Worst movie I've seen in a long time... Worst ending I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interminable, cliched, uninvolving. . .","review":"This movie comes across as having been conceived by amateurs. You don't care a hoot for any of the characters. Indeed, there are no characterizations at all. The wolves have more depth of character than the actors, which isn't saying much because they look like phony studio props. The movie plods through ice and snow, or finds its characters sitting around the ole campfire shooting the cliched breeze, punctuated by occasional wolf attacks, and flashbacks that add nothing of depth to the story. There's no dramatic arc whatsoever. The movie simply doesn't engage you on any level. It was apparently based on a short story written by a friend of the director. But it comes across as something you might get the guys in high school together to do -- hey, let's shoot a film, and we'll just sit around and improvise cliched dialogue and see what we come up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Well I wanted to see this.. looked like some kinda remake of Alive. Totally worse. If you have any knowledge of wolf behaviour you wont like this. totally unrealistic. Just a buncha dudes being picked off by insain wolves.

You hope it will get better and it doesnt. Not worth the time viewing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Liam Neeson apparently lost his stupid faith at the end.","review":"One person realizes his life of boozing every weekend is empty.Another (Liam Neeson) recognizes that he's not getting any help from god, with or without faith, so he stops wasting time asking for it. Those were the two high points of reason in the film. The rest was formulaic, and the wolves' actions were unrealistic. People could have taken metal from the plane to make sharper, sturdier weapons, but didn't, so they seemed dumb. Why did they jump off that cliff again? To get away from the wolves, according to Liam neeson, but there were more wolves at the bottom of the cliff, big surprise there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profane and violent","review":"I only rented this video because I am a Liam Neeson fan. But this film would be totally lacking in dialogue if not for the F word."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"Great acting,and must admit the movie kept you watching.The ending however ruined the whole movie.The plot of this movie comes out in the end,and it left the viewer shocked in saying to themselves..\\"This is the plot\\"?One time watch,and not worthy of my movie collection.The movie started off great,just the ending was a huge let down.To bad someone in Hollywood allowed such a stupid ending,that ruined a perfectly good movie at the start.Lots of movies are made with alternative endings,they were asleep at the wheel on this one.Dam."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grey","review":"This movie is terrible. I cant believe it took a production crew, film makers, cast etc. to make this movie. Who ever rated this movie five stars needs to stop writing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I expected action. Repeated battles against the wolves. Instead, men talking and reminiscing and being tracked by wolves that you hardly ever see.Do your self a favor and skip this movie. I usually like Liam Neeson movies, but he made a mistake appearing in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfull beyond imagination","review":"There is no purpose of the movie at all. It's obvious that when a flight crashes in such a place everyone will die. The movie doesn't show how exactly the characters feel in that situation, it's just that the wolves keep coming and kill one by one and the characters keep running away from them.Oh also, they could have just collected the metal derbies of the flight and could have covered up the opening so that the wolves won't have chance to attack them and also they would have been a lot warmer.This movie is for those who wants to die, where this movie explains you shouldn't die by yourself but you're gonna die eventually anyway.And use of the F word is countless.I wonder what the director wanted to say through this movie. It was a total BS where the wolves are the heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!!!","review":"I love movies but this movie was awful. 1) You have to be able to stomach over 150 F-bombs, plus multiple other signs of a limited vocabulary. The trailer was prepared to misdirect the potential audience. I watched the entire movie including the short post-credit scene; still very disappointed. Don't rent it; Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Being fans of Liam Neeson, we ordered this dvd. The film is violent and is probably the worst film we've ever watched. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor use of Liam","review":"The Grey is slightly entertaining mostly because the wolves are terrifying. The script is weak in enough to make one feel they are watching a first draft of a bad dream after eating some suspicious Korean food. One where the dogs eat you. The choices the characters have to live with due to the writers lack of thought make the film hard to swallow. Unless the intent was to say if you made enough bad decisions in your life to put you at the arctic circle, you probably will continue to make disastrous choices and you will end up as food for more organized, more strategic packs. Hey, maybe this is about the war between western civilization and \\"animal\\" jihadists of the middle east. It is all about oil. Now it makes sense....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grey a challenge to patience but worth the watch","review":"Although not quite what I expected. The plot was interesting but the action was disconnected. It seemed that there were some points that while viewing it, I had to wonder how they got to the next scene. Still, I would recommend the movie, but not to those whose main concern is having a 'fairy-tale' ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disney ride is more frightening","review":"Liam Neeson does take on the occasional turkey of a role and this one is certainly a prize winner in that category.The film is completely unrealistic and beyond boring.The special effects are like from the dollar store. In one scene, the eyes of the wolf pack lighting up is laughable as they look exactly like a bunch of lights. They are all exactly spaced apart perfectly with the same amount of light \\"reflected\\" in their eyes. Just eyes, no wolves.So many stupid moments, like let's all sleep inside the plane wreckage but leave one guy outside in the arctic weather as a \\"lookout\\". A lookout for what?Then of course there is the classic \\"Let's move to the trees because the wolves don't want us here\\" line, which should haunt Mr. Neeson for the rest of his career.I could spend two hours lampooning this film scene by scene but why bother?Avoid watching this loser unless you see if for free and have absolutely nothing else to do, as it is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted 2 hours","review":"Plane crash..bad guys fighting...wolves eat everyone...plot missing..more walking than lord of the rings..still no plot..big show down..fade to black..still no plot..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the cold north","review":"Starts with a bang ends with a bang.

Keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those into wilderness/survival movies","review":"I'd seen so many bad reviews of this film that i only dared rent it when all other options were exhausted. Surprisingly, i found it compelling and involving from start to finish. I'd heard most of the complaints about the ending, and i admit that it was disappointing to invest so much time in a character only to find the story unresolved. But I enjoyed the rest of the film as a survivalist's tale. Perhaps it's best to call this a mood piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film","review":"Why Neeson continues to take on roles in B movies is beyond me. This thing reeks from the get-go, and is inaccurate in so many ways it's hard to know where to begin. First off, there is no alcohol allowed on the North Slope. Secondly, his plane goes down and somehow they are able to find a forest on the Arctic Plain, which is barren. And of course The Man won't come to look for them because he's, you know, The Man. Worse, there are wolves exhibiting behavior that no wolf has ever exhibited. And what was with the wolves roaring like lions? I like an action film as much as the next couch potato, but this turkey gives \\"bad\\" a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T do it!","review":"I want to give it low rating but refuse to waste any more time (ie: thinking, organizing and typing an extensive review) on this movie. The best part of this movie was reading some of the reviews on imdb. There are people that actually write: \\"I don't know why everyone is upset, the wolves are just being wolves...\\". Jesus, the wolves are just being wolves. In my entire outdoors life (over 40 years) I've seen wolves maybe 3-4 times & they ran off at any sudden movement or sound. Hollywood has to think the american population has gotten so stupid that they can feed us any amount of contrived BS & we'll accept it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"the grey is awesome!","review":"Definitely one of my favorite movies of 2012.

It starts out good setting the plot.. at least I thought so... then it never gets better, it gets worse really. Extremely disappointing, there is a movie with a seemingly similar plot to this movie called The Edge, they are directed VERY differently and unfortunately \\"The Grey\\" comes out way behind. Would not watch it again, but I am still a fan of Liam a badly directed movie won't change that :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Wolves out for vengeance because you killed one of their own?

However, I can only take a certain amount of vulgar language that is absolutely unnecessary. It seemed to me that the director was adding F#$% to every line on purpose. That in of itself really brought the movie down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 minutes of legit man/wolf fighting...","review":"Seriously, from the previews you think Liam is gonna be balls deep in wolves for most of the movie.

It was like a stuffed wolf toy with fake slobber dripping from its maw. Torches after a plane wreck?

This film is one of the worst I have ever watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful movie about redemption.","review":"Hi. Contrary to what some reviewers seem to think, this film wasn't produced as a survival guide for making it out of plane wrecks in Alaska alive. Nor is it a nature documentary. The laws of physics are bent and sometimes broken. The wolves don't act like wolves. This is a flick about screwed-up guys finding peace in themselves. Maybe the movie isn't for you, but for God's sake don't write it off because \\"an unrealistic amount of light is cast by burning sticks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"like I didn't see that coming... pahlease, and the wolf was terrible, unrealistic. don't bother watching this movie or supporting the demonizing of wolves.

Anyways, this movie is a waste of time and money on all levels. Here is the breakdown.Story Doesnt add up. Main character wants to kill himself but live first through the plane crash?The Characters in the story are all pieces of trash and you hate each one of them.The Characters go from being 100 percent scum bags to angels right before the wolfs eat them.The Wolfs are CGI.The WRiter should stop writting as of this movie.I wish the wolfs would have eaten them all in the first 5 min of the film that way I could have made more of my night like not watching The Grey.This movie doesnt have anything good about it, and no real crowd to watch it. Dont waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor effort","review":"Given the production values and a pretty good cast, I had high hopes, but apparently not high enough, as this movie only pissed me off increasingly as it rolled along. Well executed crash, but unfortunately, downhill from there. Evidently the viewer is supposed to believe that it wouldnt occur to a single survivor to search bodies and wreckage for weapons and food, as though anybody would go off to the Artic without both. And what was in all those backpacks? And you could tumblej down icy rapids with no hypothermia, and on and on. My kingdom for a spear?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself the 2 hours, and do something else","review":"This movie is pretty much a conglomeration of brutality, blood, and complete lack of a story.

Would love to see it but it was rented, and too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arguably one of the worst movies I have ever seen!","review":"Where to begin. I kept fast forwarding in hopes the film would get better. It didn't. Basically, Liam Neeson fights way out of frozen Alaska wilderness with band of misfit dregs of society after a plane crash while fending off one wolf attack after another.Here is a little sample of the dialogue. Maybe you'll get the idea.Dreg of society guy one: F---!!!Dreg of society guy two: We're f----d!!Dreg of society guy three: F--- me!!!Liam Neeson, directing venomous anger towards wolf: Mother------!!!That's pretty much it for the duration of the film. Bad. Really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This movie delivers nothing in a grey jacket. Even Liam can't carry this wandering, pointless script.

I only hope that I can save others from this self indulgent, sophomoric lullaby masquerading as a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will everyone hurry up and get eaten so I can stop watching...","review":"Could hardly make it to the end of this movie. The acting was actually pretty good and the special effects for the plane crash were excellent (thus the 2 stars). Everything else was horrible. The wolves were 'inserted' at the appropriate times to enhance the drama/suspense; however, when they became a distraction for the action - poof - they were gone. The howling was done the same way... dialogue, dialogue, tension between actors (ok, cue the wolves) HOWLING (ok, stop so we can get some more dialog). This was so corny. Also, during the scene in the snow when they leave the airplane wreck the wind is blowing so hard you can't hear anything else, yet when they stop to help somebody they speak with library voices, and it's just fine, the wind is gone. Oh and did I mention I should have walked out when he curses God near the end. Don't waste your time with this. Buy Unknown or Taken instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times can the f bomb be dropped in 2 hours?","review":"What a waste of money. The story was weak. The plot was weak. The characters were thin, barely developed, and the dialogue poorly written. The effects (wolves) were amateur. And how many f bombs can they drop in one movie? (As many as 150 or more according to \\"plugged in on line\\". )I won't even give this one star. Please, please don't waste your time or money on this film. Liam Neeson... how could you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Liam, but hate movie.","review":"Movie is fit for juvenile audience. Mature movie go'ers beware. Ending was really really bad in every way.

I expected an action flick but was stuck instead with something closer to a psychological thriller. Everything about the wolves threw me off. They didn't have a single realistic action. The ending provided no sense of completion. I didn't fall in love with the characters until the end of the film and by then it was just depressing to watch, knowing what would inevitably happen. I have never had to say this before today- I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grey falls short","review":"I just wish I would have read more reviews on this movie before taking the time to watch it.I understand some feel it's a think piece on how one meets the end, and the wolves are a metaphor for the grim reaper, but even taking that into account the movie fails on so many other levels it left me very disappointed.It's a insult to think that the cast survives a plane crash in a harsh arctic climate and decides to follow one mans poor decisions. These are supposed to be ruff and tumble oil riggers who work in this environment yet the very basics of survival are lost on them? Shameful writing. About the only upside of the film is the look and feel of it. Even the beautiful scenery can't make up for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie was terrible.

I really liked the wolves but at one point they no longer look like wolves way to big, movement wrong, eyes looked weird. Later I found out they did use in some parts men in wolf suits. That really made me giggle. Its a great action flick if you ignore how these men argue each other to death. The wolves in real life would never challenge them as a group over territory that was just silly. The idea that a wolf den would cause such chaos is also silly. The wolves were great except for the ones in suits. The plane crash is excellent best part of the movie worth the price of the ticket. See it for fun I did and I had a good time! Watch out for the men in Wolf suits. You might spot one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Language is ridiculous","review":"The movie was ruined by the constant and I mean constant use of the F word. It was in just about every sentence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Ok. Let's start with the good points. There are some pretty good fighting and killing scenes involving the wolves. That's about it. The film maker obviously detests the oil industry and those who work in the industry. As a result, the oilmen are all a bunch of losers. When the plane crashes, do the survivor's stay with the plane where people will be searching for them? No, of course not. The EVIL oil company won't spend money looking for them, so let's walk across Alaska in mid-winter instead. Yeah, right....... Needless to say, this idea was pretty stupid even without the pack of killer wolves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, Payday for Liam Neesan","review":"See above.

You will get your badly needed slumber during the long and quiet segments with the actors chatting. Suddenly the sound will increase by 100% with dramatic music during the wolf attacks. This will be your alarm clock so you don't oversleep. You will definitely be snoozing for the very disappointing ending. Stay tuned for a brief scene after the credits which may of been included due to audience complaints.

The only real question to my mind is which is more ridiculous, the overused scene of a desperate man screaming to the sky for a miracle or the idea that wolves would maliciously seek revenge on humans. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"Didn't really get this movie at all. The whole wolf thing confused me.

It pissed me off a few times because of misrepresentations of the behavior of wolves, but, hey, it's a fictional movie...so...Liam was brilliant, as always, and the acting of most of the others was also very well done. Character development was shallow, but I don't think that was the point of the movie. We knew enough as the movie went along with some extra revelations when Liam was \\"dealing\\" with the wallets towards the end.While reading some of the other reviews, I got the impression that most people either left the room or turned off the movie before the end of the credits. Big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grey 'man against nature'","review":"Interesting and engossing movie. The characters all change over time and begin to realize what life is and what death is. The cold harsh environment that they are forced into had me hoping the best for them.

Seven large, strong men with spears could have wiped out the whole pack.That's just one example of a bad story that's just too unbelievable.

The drawn out emotional drama only emphasizes how the movie fails to depict a realistic story of survival where all remaining energies must be focused on survival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad on all Counts...","review":"It hurts to give such a negative review about a film with my favorite actor. Unfortunately Liam had to know after reading the script that this was a film being created that would only be a win for him. So often this happens with actors who have achieved great success that they begin to lower their standards for the right film, the right script. This was one of the poorest films I have ever seen. The 'F' word used in every sentence and sometimes multiple times, only because the writer could not do a better job. The realism of their plight was lacking, some of the wolves looked fake, all in all I would like my money back.

The main character is played by Liam Neeson, a hunter who is hired by an oil company he works for to protect the company's workers that are working on the pipeline from wild animals, specifically wolves. This movie revolves around a plane crash and the few survivors' attempt to reach safety under very treacherous conditions and under constant threat from the wilds.A word of caution - this movie is very violent! I started out not liking this movie, but it gripped me and held my attention throughout the movie. Just a tip - if you decide to watch this movie, make sure you stay until the very end of the credits because otherwise you'll miss something."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film is a joke","review":"Why bother with suffering through a bad plot, thin acting, and hype? The crash scene is okay and its Alaska - the scenery is outstanding. Nothing can save this film from B movie rating though. It's more of a lesson on what not to do if you want to survive a plane crash in the wilderness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult movie","review":"This movie is not about wolves; they are just the background.

The Alaskan wilderness is not presented nearly as well as it was done in the several recent great documentaries about it. And there is a sort of \\"antireligious manifesto\\" included: at the beginning you see shot of a lit neon cross in the night, leading you to associate it with a chapel, immediately followed by a nasty bar brawl, and then at the end of the movie, a long, blasphemous, and vulgar tirade against God.I used to like Liam, but I lose respect for actors who participate in offensive blasphemies. What's their point? To follow the newest pro-pagan fad in Hollywood, or to impress individuals like Bill Maher?

This movie was a big pile of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grey","review":"When I purchased this movie, it looked like and I hoped, something authentic. It isn't even close. As a biologist who has worked with wolves in the past, I can say that the writer/director's depiction is a complete fabrication and utterly inaccurate. Might be best to read something on the subject next time and do a little research before creating this sort of adventure movie. I was also disappointed that Neeson went along with the sham. He does a disservice to wildlife and wolves. This movie was closer to Little Red Riding Hood than something modern and accurate. It has action, violence and suspense, but little more. Thumbs down. I doubt I will view it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly it is a 1","review":"Huge Liam fan.....

It's amazing they could make this bad an action/adventure film with so promising a premise.For starters, the film is at least 30 minutes too long. The extra time is padded with pointless conversations and inane philosophizing about life's meaning.There is absolutely no chemistry between Neeson and the other actors (all of whom, besides Neeson, are completely miscast).The cinematogaphy is bland, the scene sequencing incoherent, the editing amateurish, the story unimaginative.There aren't even enough wolf scenes to make the film worthwhile.

The few that survive find themselves dealing with not only the extreme cold, but a pack of hungry wolves. One of the men assumes a leadership role because of his knowledge of the wolves. This is an intense and exciting movie that avoids being a standard action film where characters you don't care about are killed one-by-one. The brutality of the wolves is evident and the efforts of the men to survive are amazing. You will find yourself invested in their determination and saddened when the effort is for naught. This is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"Unbelievable, boring and on going to a point of self mutilation.

As a result, I waited until I returned home to watch the video.After watching it, I am glad that I did not pay for the wi-fi. I personally did not care for the movie.

The trailer spins it at sort of a man vs wild primal thriller a bit like Anthony Hopkins' \\"The Edge\\" meets LOST. It's not. It's contrived, over-acted, cliched and full of \\"why's\\" such as:Why don't they just stay with the plane;Why don't they make spears to defend themselves;Why don't they build shelters to keep out the wolves;Why are they trying to out run wolves;Why is he taping airplane bottles to his fingers;Why aren't the animated wolves convincing;SPOILER ALERT::::::::::The ending was really dumb--think Sopranos series fanale."},{"rating":"1","title":"May contain \\"SPOILERS\\"","review":"What a regretful amount of negativity.Man and beast.

A great acting experience which unfortunately did not have a comparable screenplay.There are those who would say \\"you missed the point\\".What point? Do not pray for help? Do not expect any divine intervention? Struggle yourself to survive and then curse God?This makes no sense and neither does this rather poor excuse for cinema.Incidentally, I was never a fan of primary credits at the end of a movie But to have a final scene afterwards is ludicrous.An audience expects to be entertained and not to be indulged in hopeless delirium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the last five years.I foolishly saw it in the theater and could not believe how stupid the characters and story are.

When I watched it the first time I was expecting more action and more fights with the wolves. The second time (about 2 months later) I watched it and just let it be with no crazy hype from the commercials. I think people were expecting Liam Neeson to kick some wolf tale but that wasn't in the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery was terrible.","review":"We tried watching this via the Amazon PS3 interface. The sound was terrible. The spoken parts of the movie were so low, I had to turn the volume up to 35 on my TV (normally it's at 14), but when a sound effect or music sequence came up, it shook the walls and made my ears bleed it was so loud. We lasted about 5 minutes having to adjust the volume ever 3 seconds. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if this was the first time it happened, but it wasn't.The consolation I got was that the Amazon rep I talked to immediately refunded our rental price. That's why I will always remain an Amazon customer.Now for the movie itself, it was pretty good. If I would have spent the money to see it in a theater, it would have been so-so.

In fact, it appears to start out with some credible entertainment in the beginning and when the plane crashes--however quickly denigrates into a monotonous and unrelenting chase by a pack of fanciful, fake appearing wolves. Somehow the actors can only speak in 4 letter words to express themselves. ***SPOILER ALERT** Ends with Liam Neeson vehemently rejecting faith, considering his prior suicide attempt, focusing on his own self-absorbed nihilism and then dies.

The pop psychology, done from a distance, with just the right amount of politically correct sociology really gets old in sports books. The Author contradicts himself several times and does not understand at all the mentality of managers or players in the late 40's and 50's. He gets off on the strangest tangents, and I can't for the life of me figure out what he was driving at. It's a pointless book that reminds me of an article in a checkout stand tabloid.

I am fed up with McDowell treating Christians as if they were stupid children. This is the final book of his I shall ever read. The \\"moral truths\\" which McDowell presents are either one of two things. First, some of them are so incredibly obvious that no person seriously doubts them, and any fool could have figured them out for himself. Or second, they are outdated and anachronistic relics of a past that is best left behind. Reading this book made me think that McDowell belongs somewhere in the mid-1800s rather than on the verge of the 21st Century. Clearly, if his point of view is followed, Christianity will be pulled backward, rather than moved forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"McDowell should stick more closely to matters of faith...","review":"When McDowell honestly sticks to matters of faith, he does a little better, but here he falls into his regular pattern of sneaking in right-wing conservative opinions and presenting them as \\"Christian\\" values. Granted, our children need more guidance, and they need to learn right from wrong, but McDowell's opinions and interpretations might tend to mislead rather than enlighten. In fact, they can tend to foster and contribute to the religious hypocrisy, religious bigotry, intolerance, prejudice and divisiveness out there. He conveniently forgets or ignores some of the most the essential teachings of Jesus, and he seems to be oblivious to the fact that Jesus would actually be an advocate for many of the things and many of the people that McDowell hates. I'm sure he means well, but his views reveal that he has been heavily indoctrinated by ideas that have more to do with right-wing conservative politics than with true Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fundamentalist christian masquerade","review":"I've just finished the book recommended by a friend.

There have been times when people have bumped me hard and if it wasn't for that strap...my clarinet would have been a goner!

This easily gets Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dylan Classic","review":"\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is a classic Dylan CD which has been remastered to sound fresh and new. He is known for being a lyrical poet and this CD is a perfect example of this trend. Created before Dylan became religious, the themes of lost love and longing dominate the music. Those who love Dylan will be enamoured. Those who are annoyed by the off-key nature of his voice and the twang may be unable to appreciate the genius of this work. A few tracks, such as \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" have been used as the background for more modern songs, so the uninitiated will find them familiar.

He has made many great records prior to this but none this direct or emotionally powerful. To be the best Dylan record, it goes without saying that this is one of rock's greatest acheivements.

I will stop at this point other than to say some stuff shakes me up. To Dylan fans I was camped behind the bandstand at Newport and the private Sunday morning concert of Dylan's going electric, was one of the best I have ever heard him.

That's the criteria by which I measure magnitude of the impact of this work. \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" still is searing to me, \\"Isis\\" becomes so joyously salient with every new experience, adventure and the first snowstorm of every Winter.

If you are searching for one definitive Dylan album and would like to skip a greatest hits collection, you can't do wrong with this album.

Beautiful, personal songs well expressed with a sweet folksy band behind him.Bob proves himself a most honest confessionalist in this perfect set of songs that is always a great pleasure to listen to. The songs have great impact and stay with you long after you play them.My favorites include \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\", \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\", \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\", \\"Idiot Wind\\" and \\"Shelter from the Storm\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob's Best","review":"I have been listening to Dylan since 1963 and I owned this CD when it first came out in album form. It is my favorite of all of Dylan's work. Perhaps because it focuses more on human relationships rather than politics ,it is more timeless. And the musicianship is terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"How can a single artist transform his sound, narrative, writing-style for each release? Bob Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's best album since Blood On The Tracks","review":"This is a great album. Even if you do not think you like Bob Dylan, buy this album. Lyrically, it is a masterpiece.

(even better than most greatest hits LPs) From the classic \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" to my favorite \\" ... and the Jack of Hearts\\", Dylan captures his listeners attention like a giant fireworks display and wont let you go until the last track if finished.

The product was delivered on time. The product price was great. The condiotn is very good and it plays without a scratch .I would buy from this seller again. A must for Dylan fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm pretty sure that the meaning of life is hidden somewhere on this one","review":"Thank you, Bob Dylan. Not to sound too sentimental, but I can't imagine a universe without this wonderful music in existence. Tangled Up in Blue is truly a work of art, a stream of consciousness song, a trip through Dylan's psyche, a great folk tune that will live on long after Bob is gone. The rest of the album is pretty much a trip through the last days of Dylan's marriage; confessional, painful songs like Idiot Wind, Simple Twist of Fate, Buckets of Rain, Shelter from the Storm (a great piece of poetry disguised as a \\"rock song\\")...with a few songs to break up the intense confessional tone. I would take this with me to a deserted island, listen to it over and over again, and find something new every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"ten tracks of peaceful bliss","review":"Bob Dylan's Blood On The Tracks is the best work he ever released on a single album.His vocal ability is as great as his guitar playing.This album should be passed on to future generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape quality extremely poor,. Should have known better!","review":"I've never received a poor-quality tape from Amazon before, but there's always a first time and this was it. It's worse than my old tape.

Sounds like it's being played on a noisy old ferris wheel going up and down!Thanks for asking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture of the Great Over-rated","review":"\\"Shelter from the Storm\\" is great; \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" is a good song. But listening to \\"Idiot Wind\\" or \\"Rosemary, Lilly and the Jack of Hearts\\" is enough to make you want to puncture your eardrums with an ice pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like Karo syrup with red food coloring on the tracks","review":"Fair album. About as good as Highway 61 Revisited.What annoys about his writing is the way he tosses in mindless lyrics that have nothing to do withANYTHING...but the guy does it because he needs a rhymer. Way to go, Bob. You've gotten away with it for decades--and those who worship the ground you walk on don't know any better.To be honest, I have liked some of this man's work: Knockin' On Heaven's door is a clasic; have liked TIME OUT OF MIND, have liked THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN; think his CHRONICLES is a fine autobiography...I just don't happen to think every time the man sneezes that it should be hailed as a work of genius and/or a masterpiece.My 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Mickey Mouse lyrics just don't do it for me","review":"Call me crazy, but when is an artist in our lifetime going to write something of substance? Not since Creed's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters. This one from Bob Dylan doesn't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves. Some of Dylan's acoustic work is good, and I give him props for his work at the controls, but where is the heart, where is the soul? Where is the topnotch singing? This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.Now, if you're looking for good rock, check out Bush 'n' Creed. Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek. Speaking of geeks, does anyone know when Coldplay's fourth album will hit stores?KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...AND KEEP CHECKIN' MY SITE!!LATER!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songwritter but the vocals ruin it all.","review":"Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen should have stuck to writting the lyrics/songs and letting others do the singing. Although Bruce is a total phoney (he likes to write songs about rough times at the same time being a multi-millionaire), Bob Dylan at least made an important contribution to the folk/rock movement.So many-an album by Dylan is ruined by his whining/whaling/screeching/yelping and nostril-itis. If you want to get rid of the rats and cockroaches in your house, forget about buying spray or getting an exterminator. Simply put on a Bob Dylan album at full blast and watch the rodents and roaches run out of the house in all directions as fast as they can.If you want to check out Dylan, check out the legends that have covered some of his tunes (ie, Joan Baez, Jimmy Hendrix, etc..). How anyone can like listening to this gibberish is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"All of Bob Dylans music just blows and it sounds worse nowyour voice is boring and your voice is ignoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob on the Tracks","review":"Another classic from Dylan, and possibly his last real masterpiece. I prefer Blonde on Blonde, but there's not much to take issue with on Blood on the Tracks; it's subtle but solid from start to finish. (Just as an aside, I never realized how much Bob sounds like a cross between Lou Reed and Ian Hunter at times.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lyrical Masterpiece","review":"Few artists can match the impact that Dylan has had on the music industry and Blood On The Tracks is simply on of the best albums ever made. No one before or since has been able to match the passion and the brilliance that Dylan demonstrates on this record. \\"Idiot Wind\\" is one of the best written songs of all time and \\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" still manages to stop me in my tracks whenever I hear it...possibly my favorite of all Dylan's songs. This record should be a cornerstone in every music lover's collection and is the perfect place to start for those who are new to Dylan. Quite simply the perfect album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best acoustic Album EVER!!!","review":"Bob Dylan is an Icon of Universal music. \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is his best Album without a doubt. Tracks like \\"Simple Twist of Faith\\" or \\"Idiot Wind\\" are among the best songs ever writen. In my collection of 536 cd's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" ranks at number 3. Don't miss this gem to your collection. It is PERFECT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Do What You Must Do, And You Do It Well","review":"It's hard to find sufficient words to describe this album, but 'masterpiece' is certainly a good start. Blood On The Tracks simply has no weak points, but simply a series of peaks. Even for a casual Dylan fan (like myself), this is an essential disc. This was my first Dylan record when I bought it on vinyl back in 1975, after hearing 'Tangled Up In Blue' on the radio. But I was captivated by the rest of the record, especially 'Lilly, Rosemary..', 'Shelter From The Storm', 'Twist Of Fate' and 'Buckets Of Rain'. It's now the first Dylan record I bought on CD, and the re-mastering sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good, but just a smurf hair overrated","review":"This is always trotted out as the best Dylan album, and it is, in fact, very very good. But better than Highway 61, or just different? Better than Desire, or just different? Each one is so unique- I don't see how they can be compared really. But yes, really really good. More laid back, contemplative dylan. Not so much feaked out imagery as the earlier stuff, not so much scary medicine show Xianity as the later stuff. Totally masterful and brilliant- sensitive, angry, bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is It...","review":"This album changed my life.All I wanted was to hear a pair of speakers...When the salesman asked me if I had heard the new Dylan, I had to admit I hadn't. Not very cool...but what had Bob done recently that was worth mentioning.Well, Blood on the Track took me by storm. I wore out my first vinyl copy and had to buy a second. You won't find any Dylan that touches your heart like these songs. These lyrics will haunt you. I didn't sleep for weeks. Tangled Up in Blue....If You See Her Say Hello...Shelter From the Storm...these songs are dynamite. Absolutely his greatest achievement.Dylan's gift to mankind. Make sure you have your own copy to weep over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Dylan \\"Album' etc","review":"I grew up with Dylan, listening mostly to the classics lke maggies farm, Like a Rolling Stone and tambourine man, but, after a long hiatus from his poetry and music, I was driving in my car after having dealt with a tough fight with my wife of 25 years, when I heard the song \\"Shelter From the Storm\\" after which I actually found the reason I needed to not only fall in love again, but to actually pick up the acoustic guitar again and start to play. That has to mean something about his talent, Lay lady lay, is also quite special. Dylan wil no doubt be cool again, just you wait and see.Steve Castellanos stevencpr@aol.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Dylan's First Masterpiece In Seven Years, And His Last","review":"BLOOD ON THE TRACKS was Bob Dylan's first masterpiece since 1968's JOHN WESLEY HARDING, and, unfortunately, except for THE BASEMENT TAPES (actually recorded in 1967), his last. As his marriage was falling apart, Dylan wrote many songs for this CD about love gone wrong, yet also found time for the raging, angry \\"Idiot Wind\\", easily his nastiest song since \\"Positively 4th Street.\\" Dylan's belief that Indonesia's 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist was trumped-up and unjust makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEY PICASSO, NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR STOCK PROBS","review":"great cd, but who cares about picassos stock problems w/amazon? this is a music/book site, not a wall street complaint post"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's talk about the SACD 5.1 Mix","review":"Blood on the tracks has been reviewed so often, I just wanted to say this 5.1 mix is amazing. I've heard this album a hundred times and with this mix, I'm hearing instruments I never noticed before. Really amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Dylan Faces the Past","review":"There is a lot of introspection in the work, surprise, surprise; but its not the Bob Dylan we expect, popping out to chastise us and society as a whole for our shortfalls. Man, there is joy and poking fun here! The tracks are all excellent, Bob Dylan's voice has never been better (I stand against all the NASVILLE SKYLINE proponents), and the sheer depth of the musical presentation is beyond anything he has presented before. I can see his looking back in tracks such as TANGLED UP IN BLUE with a whimsical, almost \\"did I do that\\" flair, while sadness within himself shows in SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE. BUCKETS OF RAIN is a fun song- a front porch sing-along kind of thing that endures despite time. I think thats the deal with BLOOD ON THE TRACKS... Time be damned, we all look back, but only Bob Dylan could do it with the style and chagrin we all love, envy and admire. Buy it and protect it children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of what Dylan it is you seek","review":"I'll probably be kicked in my Cyber teeth by all of the Dylanophiles online, but this has to be said:If you are into Dylan for his carnalvalistic lyrical rides, then DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM.

The book deals with a teen-age girl who wants to marry but can't because her family tradition won't allow her to. The tradition is that she is unable to marry because she is the youngest and will need to take care of her mother.I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. The book gets kind of confusing but overall it is a good book that deals with love and desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un libro muy especial","review":"Como Agua Para Chocolate fue el primer libro que lei en espanol. Me gusto la historia, especialmente los presonajes. La autora desarrolla muy profundamente los sentimentos, suenos y deseos de los protagonistas. No podia esperar para ver que iba a pasar en el proximo capitulo. Fue fascinante leer sobre esa epoca y el effecto que tenia en sus vidas. La manera en que la autora ha mezclado la preparacion de la comida con los eventos importantes en las vidas de los personajes me parecio muy especial. Tambien el libro es bueno para los estudiantes de espanol porque es facil para leer y no necesitan traducir cada palabra para entender la idea general. El libro hizo su magia en mi espanol tambien, porque despues de leerlo, pude hablar mucho mejor!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"De mis favoritos","review":"Uno de mis libros favoritos. Me encantan los personajes, el uso de exageraciones metafóricas --como cuando Tita nace llorando y hay sal para muchos años--. Es uno de los libros que leí en menos de 24 horas porque no pude soltarlo. Lo recomiendo sinceramente.Es una historia divertida, con momentos reales, con momentos 'mágicos', y algunos trágicos.

It is a beautifully written Mexican story about a girl named Tita who is denied her first true love. It tells of the suffering, struggle, and power of women living in a deeply-rooted heritage full of war and countless traditions. Uniquely written, the novel is a story told in twelve monthly installments interwoven with recipes that enable Tita's freedom and individuality to shine through her deprived childhood. Her talent and love for cooking are easily understood as she demonstrates the power of food on the soul. This novel focuses on Tita's quest for love and happiness, which, in return, bring out the reader's most intimate emotions. It is a fun book persuading the reader that perhaps magic and reality are one in the same. It is a romantic fairy-tale as well as one of the best page-turners I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best story I've ever read!","review":"I bought this book for my goddaughter who is a senior in high school and taking Spanish 4.

I am afraid that the moment will come when I need to quickly remove the camera from the tripod and not be able to and then miss a key moment.As I continue to use the tripod and head, I will update this review, but in the meantime, I would suggest it to anyone looking for a well rounded tripod kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad disc","review":"Discs # 1,2,5,6 are not working.My DVD player is region free.Also tried from my computer with several different programs...some said there was an issue with the disc copyright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, decent Anime","review":"Saw this show on TV back when I was 10.

Just a note, this is the International English dub, not the TV dub, so those like me who saw it when they were kids may notice some dialogue changes.All in all, an entire 6 Disc anime series plus nostalgia for 18$?

I have FMS and have this wand sitting right beside me at my work area at home and use it on my back, shoulders, arms, hands, hips, legs all the time. When I have a head ache, I use it on the center of my forehead and my head ache usually will leave. I've also used the wand on my scalp. I love it and have had it for some time. It's never failed and is one of my favorite products. Well worth the money and not as expensive as some of the other wands. As a matter of fact, I previously owned a massage wand that was more than double the price of this. It lasted about 6 months, caught my hair in a crevice (hurt!), and quit on me.

For me it was definetly worth the money, and I am very satisfied.Over a year later I am still very satisfied with this wireless transmitter, I believe once in a while it is a bit jerky when the neighbours use electronics that interfere, but then I change the channel and everything is fine again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this thing","review":"Bought the Lyra for two main reasons: (1) It's very inexpensive compared to the competition (e.g., Apple's Airport Express or Linksys's Wireless Digital Media Adapter), and (2) it works with Musicmatch, my preferred music player. Setup was quick -- about 10 minutes. Sound quality is adequate -- not CD quality, but good enough for MP3s. Note that this device is not very high-tech. Its sole purpose is to allow you to stream songs from Musicmatch to your home stereo -- and that's it. This device does not enable on-screen displays, etc. The only ding: the stereo jack to RCA connectors (for connecting the receiver unit to your home stereo) needed to be jiggled a bit to obtain a clear output to my stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"just the basics","review":"I had tried one of the more costly units that required a tv be hooked into it as well. and after must frustration was only able to get it to work if i shut off my firewall and went offline, also could not use the computer for anything else when it was working. if the microwave was used in the next room the whole thing would fail and rebooting the computer as well as reloading the music files into it's folder was neccessary. way too complicated.

I was a little concerned about interference/reception, since I live in a 25-story apartment building, but the Lyra transmits from my office, through an interior wall, to the stereo in my living room with no problem.I already had MusicMatch installed on my computer, but the Lyra also works fine with Windows MediaPlayer (note that the remote only works with MusicMatch, however).I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't Live Without It","review":"okay...probably an overstatement, but to some extent, as a Rhapsody customer, I'd simply not have one without the other.

This thing sounds great. It's indistinguishable from true CD sound. Try this: Play a CD on your stereo's CD player, simultaneously play a copy of the same CD on your PC. The PC links to your stereo through the Lyra wireless. You can switch back and forth between the two at your stereo and there's no difference in sound quality. Really!It uses 900Mhz, so your 802.11 and microwave don't interfere.I've used other similar products, but the sound quality is really poor. With the Lyra, I get great reception all around our house, and in the garage, which is about 60 feet from the house - still super CD quality sound. I liked it so much I got an extra one so I can have a receiver in the garage and one at the entertainment center.It's the best value out there for a wireless audio system. Maybe others have more features, but they cost way more than this does. Buy it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds unworthy","review":"WTF! The sound quality is SO cheap! There's almost no distortion, but also no bass, or treble. No wonder why it cost me $20. My Shure earphones sounded like claws on blackboard. The only thing good about this is that I can control Musicmatch with the remote. If this thing is so call \\"crystal clear digital\\", then apparently it's not sending enough digits. And did I mention that I tested the receiver and transmitter only a foot apart. Unless you own some sort of give-away stereo, or need another way to scream across the room, this transmitter is unworthy of a hookup.BTW, it sounds just as crappy with Musicmatch. The transmitter basically acts as a soundcard via USB and of course transmission via RF.If you want to get an idea of how this thing sounds like: take a normal mp3 file, and compress it to the lowest bit-rate, or turn on your radio, oh sorry, radio sounds far more superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"There are many far superior products that satisfy the need for remote access to digital music.

I've always used the MusicMatch software so that was no problem for me. It is the perfect thing for parties!

Since I had the compressor, I used it on the cars and bikes also. Worked great, I loved it, nice compact design, not too heavy, and it doesn't draw too many amps. But after 2.5 yrs, it simply died. Motor couldn't start the compressor against more than 50 psi in the reservoir. Repair shop said the electronic device that adds power during the start of the motor went bad, and it would cost more than a new unit to replace. I contacted DeWalt and asked if they could help, even though the 1-yr warranty is expired, since it had such light use. DeWalt was very nice, but told me I was on my own. I ended up putting this 2.5 yr old unit, like-new, out for the trash.

If you backed it off so that the pressure on the tool side of the regulator was 0, the unit would build up pressure until it cut out at 135psi. As soon as you tried to bleed any air into the tool side of the regulator there would be a rush of air and the pressure would drop to 20 psi with the compressor running.I bought the DeWalt unit because I thought they made a quality product.

It performs perfectly with trim guns all the way from a 15 ga. trim nailer all the way down to a micropinner. To me it is perfectly suited for the jobs where you have to put shoe or crown or toekick panels in as a finishing touch when the job has been otherwise completed. Great for any capstone pieces in the trim package.It has limitations but they were not surprising. It only has a 1 gallon tank so using a blowoff tool is out.

Reading the story I found to be confusing with all these friends and how the story jumps from one thing to the next without anything inbetween. I felt there was no real ending rather the story just stopped. I wondered throughout reading Beijing Doll if it was the translation that was off rather than the story.Overall made me depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"I was very excited to read this book upon seeing the reviews ... I was sorely disappointed. Being in China has absolutely no relevance to this girl's life ... her experiences seem similar to any American teenager attending school. She is middle-class, rebellious, a bit lost in her teen years ... not exactly the most unique and interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beijing Doll","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"Wild Swans\\" by Jung Chang and \\"Red Scarf Girl\\" by Jiang Ji-Li, I picked up \\"Beijing Doll\\" in the hopes that it could show me how modern Beijingers work and live and look at communism. Man, was I ever disappointed.There's nothing original about Chun Sue's story and very little that's interesting. No wonder she had so much trouble getting the book published -- it reads like an unedited diary. After the (n+1)st run-in with her \\"bourgeois\\" parents and the (n+2)nd imploded relationship, the reader may find him or herself wondering if Chun Sue will ever look beyond her own self-absorption or learn from her mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I just finished reading this and I don't know whether to feel sorry for the author or disgusted. The word that comes up for me is \\"apathetic\\". Everything and everyone in the book is apathetic. Chun Sue goes to bed with so many men/boys in this story and not once is there any mention of pleasure either for herself or for the males. There isn't any real point to the story and it is like an extended diary. Also, she must have come from a pretty well off family as she always had money, her parents let her get away with everything and do everything she wanted with no consequences (oh, her father did throw something at her but neither parent plays a part in the book). I get the feeling that this is Chun's world and everyone else in it doesn't matter or is just there to amuse her. Not recommended and I'm not keeping my copy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Authentic","review":"I actually lent this to a 20-something year-old friend from Beijing who found this book not only to be true to her feelings growing up there, but emotionally satisfying as well. This is not a typical \\"teenage-angst\\" book nor does it follow your traditional Western storyline. Rather, it reads more like a memoir, an abbreviated autobiography, a snapshot of a Chinese girl's life in the postmodern, urban Beijing. This is no \\"Joy Luck Club\\", it was written by a 17-year-old girl without formal university creative writing training. Take it for what it is: an honest and authentic window into a Beijing girl's life in present China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmmm, not so sure about this one.","review":"This book is \\"choppy\\" and that makes it difficult to read.

Same situation. You think you are following the instructions and the lights still come on at the wrong times. So, this transformer is not good for me.

Red and black trippers too confusing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, not very good quality","review":"We purchased this item to replace a similar unit in which the timer had failed. What we recently discovered is that the timer does NOT control the power to the transformer. The timer controls the low voltage output to the lights; which may put less stress on the timer, but otherwise is unsatisfactory. The transformer hum is much louder than the previous unit. Our timer is located in the front hall closet which should prolong the life of the unit, but the transformer hums day and night, no matter whether the timer is on or off. This is not only irritating is also not efficient from an energy-saving perspective. We should have paid more for a better model."},{"rating":"2","title":"replacement power pack","review":"My original power pack died from the heat and age.

This transformer performs OK until the timer quits working. That's why I had to replace it. The old one is still functional but it renders itself worthless without the timer. I'm not about to go out and manually turn it on/off for it to work. This will be my third transformer. The first one was great because it went on/off based on light conditions. It was much simpler but quite expensive. That one totally stopped working so I decided to replace it with a cheaper one. The first cheaper one lasted almost 3 years. This year I wrapped it in protective water proof material so it's not subject to the elements. I'm not sure if that will help or not. I found the ML88T to be much cheaper on Amazon as apposed to purchasing it at Lowes or Home Depot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Replacement","review":"Lightning zapped my original Malibu Transformer.

Never had a bit of trouble with that timer until the switch that turns and activates the lights finally broke (the clock was still going). This unit is exactly what I needed. Received it quickly and it was packaged well. The unit was easily hooked up and is functioning quietly and efficiently. In fact I think this design may be a bit more protected from the weather than my old one that ran night and day for 30 years. I highly recommend this as long as 88 Watts is enough for you.

Shades of \\"Princess Bride\\" and all the other great mythology of filmdom! No wonder this Daniel Wallace tale has been translated to cinema. And I will enjoy the movie version more since I have read the novel base.It is hard to believe that this father is merely an Alabaman, from Ashland, no less. The twists and turns of his story are much more universal than the modern world. In fact, the father's adventures seem more like tales from the old country, wherever that may have been.Read it and lift your winter spirits.

The relationship between Father and son is more believable, the novel ends the same way as the movie does, but the way the novel sets it up it's sadder.If the movie made you emotional the book will double that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, this was a bore to get through!","review":"I picked up this book as a recommendation from someone working at my local Barnes & Nobles. It started out sort of cute, funny little stories about someone's life. The problem was, that was all that it was - just a series of short little stories, tall tales actually. It did not go anywhere, did not develop, nothing. It would be fine for a bathroom read, but it just did not hold my interest. In fact at one point, I had 30 pages left in the entire book and I literally had to force myself to finish it, just skimmed it, and read to the end.This book will be going in my pile to resell to Half Price books and I will not be passing it on to anyone.

He tries to figure out what his father has really done in his life, while Edward is on the deathbed. I like this book because of the relationship between Edward and William. And it's really interesting because of the myths of ancient Greece and Rome. William imagines the whole life of his father as a big adventure, by using myths, because he just don't know, who Edward really is. Water is used, as a big symbolic part in this book and it's interesting to see the many ways to use water as a symbol. I didn't really like that the book is so short.

Now I did like the conflict between father and son and how this is resolved in the father's own special way, but besides that I didn't care much for the book.

If you don't knit, I can't imagine why this book would attract you unless you have somehow wildly misinterpreted the \\"harlot\\" part of the title.Ms. Pearl-McPhee is a dedicated (obsessed?) knitter who is not afraid to admit to her reading public that she might have \\"stash\\" issues and that \\"Marital relations\\" do cut into her knitting time. Anyone who has been knitting for a while will recognize her lace shawl experience, coveting yarn that will probably never leave the \\"core stash,\\" and the wild exuberance that makes one think that one can complete knitted gifts for their entire family if one starts in November. Nothing deep here, but provides lots of chuckles for the knitting addict."},{"rating":"2","title":"yarn harlot","review":"This book was and excellent read.

Knit Lit, Two Sweaters for My Father, Beyond Stitch 'N Bitch... they're all worthy in their own way. But what stands head and shoulders above the crowd is Stephanie Pearl-McPhee's musings and thoughts. Funny, touching, well-written... what more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mistress of the Yarn Stash.....","review":"Reading this was so theraputic. Stephanie is the voice for every knitters inner stash-a-holic. I read this book on a 5 hour drive (I wasn't driving) up to Portland. I laughed so hard my husband - who has a stash of wood large enough to build another Spruce Goose - asked me to read passages to him while he drove. He actually laughed! So we drove along and I read most of the book outloud to him. After reading Yarn Harlot I feel much better about my stash of Icelandic wool that my husband brought me from Iceland. It's much to good to be knit up into anything. Just looking at it is enough for me for right now. In the mean time I'm ordering another Stephanie book and can't wait to enjoy another great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a HOOT!","review":"This book is super funny and worth the read.

The book is funny, although it's not as good as her first book, \\"At Knit's End\\", which I laughed hysterically to the point of tears. Nonetheless, this book gave me great enjoyment and lots of laughs, brightening up my day and enhancing my joy at being a knitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts laughter in your life","review":"It is everything you would want to read and have a great laugh or smile on your face.

It is okay to laugh. I never knew there was knitting humor until I started reading Stephanie Pearl-McPhee.

The book goes deep into the psychology of Kung-Fu San Soo, called Fut Ga by the practitioners of the art. This is a no non-sense approach to fighting. It deals with the kill or be killed reality of the mean streets. This book covers a wide range of options dealing with street survival. It covers how to deal with weapons, multiple attackers, and how to destroy any would-be criminal or thug that stands in your way and would try to do you harm. I first bought this book in 1993 when it came out, and have since read it three times. An excellent resource for beginners and for advanced students as well. A good read for those wanting to learn more about the ruthless mind-set of Kung-Fu San Soo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book addressing the most important resource available when confronted with sudden violence - the mind!","review":"I enjoyed the author's ability to address the psychological aspects of combat which are seldomly addressed in self defense books or manuals. The book leaves the ethical questions to be dealt with by pastors and philosophers and focuses on the mind set that must be adopted to win a life or death struggle. I found the book an easy read with the feel of a combat savvy uncle conveying to his nephew real world attitudes and techniques to survive a violent attack. While not a step by step instructional manual, it focuses on key concepts and attitudes that are required to survive outside of the sparing arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"San Soo Student","review":"I love this philosophy.

Holland does neither -- the love he has for those he's helped on both sides of the great divide is quite apparent. This is is his story and it's compelling. And it's a great and fast read.The only reason I gave it a 4 is because, in my mind, it was over too soon!Keep up the great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not to be missed!","review":"This book is not to be missed!I bought this book as soon as it was released, and I finished it in a day and half. John describes his life story with fascination, and has a great sense of humor. I was amazed at his 'knowing' since his young childhood, and always perserved his seeking for the truth, never giving up. His intutions in guiding him to California and to England, made me realize my own psychic potential. The best part was the last chapters describing how to develop one's psychic abilities by meditation and psychic games. This book is a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Shows psychics as NORMAL people, not freaks","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's written as if John were talking to you and not over you. He doesn't use a lot of fancy specialized words that go over your head and he doesn't try to scare you with stories of creepy ghosts and evil spirits. He tells his story simply and in a very straighforward manner. He even gives you some tips on how you can work on your own psychic skills. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start for Learning Mediumship","review":"I've read countless books but this one really hit home. Not only does he go over his struggles with mediumship, he shows you how to do it. John Holland is an excellent writer and I have found him very compelling. He doesn't seem to be in it for the money or the fame, it just seems to be a part of who he is. I feel he is very credible and I think it's an amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Listening","review":"We borrowed these audio cassettes from the library. My daughter listened to them over and over. Friends of hers who happened to ride in the car with us listened too, and they didn't want to get out when we arrived at our destination because they needed to finish the story they were on. Very powerful current day illustrations that all kids relate to. They make the parables of Jesus come alive. It's a shame the title isn't more catchy because some kids will miss listening because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"short sighted","review":"I bought this for my daughter a few years ago, but she wasn't ready for it until now (she's 8). I grew up with some really interesting kid's books about the parables and wanted my kids to know the stories. I hadn't read this book in-depth (should have) before starting to read it to her. Tonight she asked for the story about a young girl hanging out with her grandfather for the day. It started well, but by the end, it implied that alcoholics, people experiencing spiritual apathy and non-believers were non-virtueous. That's not a message I want to send my kids. Wish I'd kept my old books that just told the stories and didn't apply moral superiority in them.

I had to adjust my hands so much that I eventually used one of the gym's mats over this one. You can get a great work out with this mat becasue of the amount of time you spend adjusting yourself.

Narayan presents the engaging adventure of the five Pandava brothers' efforts to reclaim their empire. The story itself has nearly everything anyone could want in a good book: edge of your seat action and edge of your mind inspiration. In addition to celebrating the Pandavas' super-human strength and feats of daring, the book also catalogs many types of human relationships: mother-child, sybling-sybling, husband(s)-wife, king-courtier, mentor-apprentice, even writer-reader..... Long after you finish reading this book, you'll be realizing why Hindus recognize it as one of their two most sacred books---it's got everything! And yet it rarely stoops to the level of being preachy. (Narayan also has a shortened prose version of the other sacred Hindu book---The Ramayana.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i love r.k.narayan's narrative, but the way he retold the great epic is disappointing. he relies on the power of his narrative and forgets to stick to the epic style. the book captures most of the ideas, but it disregards the beautiful and magical details that embellish the epic, just like they embellish the culture it belongs to. the retold mahabharata may be a good read for those who want to have an idea of the epic, but then the idea can be obtained from the internet and for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle East Science Fiction","review":"If you only read one book about the conflict, this should emphatically not be it. Tanya Reinhart comes from the Noam Chomsky school of anti-Zionism (Chomsky was her PHD thesis supervisor)...that's all you need to know. The publisher describes this book as a middle east primer, but it is anything but that. In fact, this little book, while providing interesting insight into the twisted mindset of an Israeli leftist who is happy to defame and demonize her own country, its leaders and its institutions (as well as just about every other actor in the conflict, including the US and Arafat!), is in fact a highly creative (read extremely one-sided, fabricated and paranoid) work of propaganda. An entertaining work of science fiction, but not the place to go for a balanced understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Majorly biased","review":"The book is majorly and unprofessionaly biased towards the Palestinian view. There seems to be little if no consideration of WHY Israel acts the way it does. As such, it portrays Israel as an aggresive predator state and somewhat questions its right to exist. Clearly, the author has no understanding whatsoever of Middle Eastern political history, and her ignorance is sadly reflected in this account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and counterproductive","review":"The history presented here is basically bogus. That is the main problem with the book. Oh, sure, there is no consideration for human rights, not for Arab rights nor Jewish rights. But the big problem is a lack of honesty, after which any recommendations that are made become suspect.What is the best way to end the war of 1948, in which five Arab nations tried to get rid of Israel, a nation that formed because it was the only way to defend Jewish rights of life, liberty, and property in the region? In my opinion, I think some way needs to be found to get Israel's neighbors to grant the Jews of Israel these basic rights! But you'll never see this issue in Reinhart's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, Unbiassed, and Challenges the Popular Notion","review":"Despite the many detractors of this book, this book is a wonderful and honest piece on the current situation regarding Palestine and Israel. All the facts are documented, and character attacks put out by the reviewers before me show the brainwashed and rejectionist mentality that effects western academia and media. This book goes well with Norman Finkelstein's book Image and Reality of the Israeli Palestinian Conflict and Fateful Triangle by Noam Chomsky. It seems that whenever scholars or people speak out against the unlawful practices of the Israeli government, people are labeled as anti semites and this and that. This cant be applied to this author or noam chomsky or norman finkelstein. All of them are Jews and all of them have documented the evidence.

I use an electric mower, blower, edger, chain saw as well as woodworking tools, so this cord sees plenty of use.The one gripe I have, and it is only worth 1/2 star deduction, is that their Amazon listing clearly states it has \\"Lighted Ends.\\" Ends--plural. But only the female jack is illuminated. The male plug side is also transparent, so you can see there is NO neon tube installed on that side.

That was one of the first things I noticed right out of the package.

That is certainly true with this book. It has three meager pages at the front of the book dealing with drying. The rest of the book is taken up with a catalog of different plants that can be used in dried arrangements. Each pages has one or two plants on it along with a color paintings rather than a photograph. - Personally I prefer photos in a book like this. There is drying information for each plant but it is buried in the very short text that accompanies each picture rather than being broken out in a separate heading like other items are. The items broken out - color, region it's native to, height etc. - to me are not as important as how to dry the plant for use. I was not very impressed with this book, others have done it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Air Gun ammo for varmints!","review":"These little air gun shot shells are great for varmints. Since I received the Gamo Shadow Express Air Gun that fires these I've gotten 6-7 chipmonks (which ARE pests in my area) 1 pack rat and a squirrel.

This same weekly often extols the virtues of local bands that I've never heard of and usually never hear of again. It would seem that the reviewer of this book had as much on-track knowledge of good literature as the music reviewers in his shared rag have of what makes a good band. This book is a painful example of an author who apparently was a monument unto himself. The stories in it are boring and, in many cases, written with a pompous air. The ones that aren't, are mostly depressing. I doubt that I will give this author a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA RP2365 Slim-Design Portable CD Player","review":"Yaa I got this CD Player like 3 weeks ago and it's not bad ... so this CD Player has a asowme 45 seconds ESP wich is averge since most CD Player have only 40 seconds ESP. The sound is great and the headphones a great but i would go with some earbuds I got that. I also like the fact that I can play CD-RW in this CD Player, but the bad thing is it only has about 10 to 11 hours playback so get some rechargeable batteries I recommend NI-CD or NI-Mh batteries.

The kids hadn't had it for a few days when the CD portion broke. It keeps saying \\"no disc\\" even though it is spinning inside. The only thing that works on it is the FM radio. I guess we'll keep it for that, but the price isn't worth a radio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I bought this player in december and it still work perfectly. It never skips, ( which is great, because i use it when i run). The bass is amazing, and its the clearest sound i've ever herd on a portable player.

I proudly recommend to this to book to anyone who wants to improve his/her andcomprehension skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I assumed that Martha had grown along with the trends, so I was sorry to see that the colors in the book are the same ones that have been in her magazine for, like, a decade. There isn't very much useful information in this, and I kind of resent the fact that she is dictating a very limited (and limitING) number of color palettes from which I am supposed to choose. Choice is everywhere in the design world, and the trend is NO trend, so Martha's approach seems very old-fashioned and dictatorial. Even that wouldn't be quite so bad if she were using more current colors than her old stand-bys."},{"rating":"1","title":"hnnnnngh... just subscribe to her magazines.","review":"please, if you regularly buy martha stewart living magazines, DON'T bother buying this book. unless of course you want to see more of the same, but packaged altogether with nice binding and a deceptively original cover. it's not even actually \\"more\\" of the same, but actually \\"the same\\" -- this is a compilation of reproductions, old stuff that was published over the years. not too fresh, and particularly aggravating to someone who's a subscriber."},{"rating":"1","title":"How old is this book anyway?","review":"How can a new book look this old? It's the same old sagey, seafoamy greens and pale yellows that Martha has pushed for, like, 20 years now. I like Martha, but I was assuming that her new book would be about new colors that are more on trend than this. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great color schemes","review":"This book contains a great collection of palettes. They are all pale monotone color schemes, so if that is your taste this book can provide a lot of ideas and inspiration. It includes eleven palettes: off-white, blue, golden brown, lilac, citrus, \\"spice\\", blue-green, yellow, celadon, gray, pink. Some cautions: the book does not really cover how to put a scheme together, it is short on specifics and thus is not a great first time how-to book. It does not cover bold or multi-colored schemes. With only eleven schemes, if you you don't care for at least a couple of them the book won't be very useful. But if you already know the basics of choosing a color for a room and you have admired the pale sophisticated work that has been profiled in Martha Stewart Living magazine over the years this is a nice compilation. I really like the book and would definitely recommend its addition to your decorating library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew, Martha!","review":"Let me say up front -- I LOVE Martha Stewart. I shouldn't have been surprised by this book, but I was. Everything is lovely, but it's so pale, almost to the point of being colorless. I found very few ideas I can work into our busy, colorful home, but that's not Martha's fault. Maybe I should go back to Mary Engelbreit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this player","review":"It seemed like a really good buy - under $200 for a 20GB A/V player,however, don't let the disk drive capacity and the recording features fool you....unless you don't intend to listen to MP3s on it. The biggest annoyance, one that puts you off using it, is a migraine causing loud click at the start of each track. It is there no matter what volume you set the unit to. Secondly, it takes forever (a minute or two) to start playing a track from the menu. Third...don't leave home without a pin to reset the unit every now and then. It just would not turn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, poorly made product","review":"The toggle switches are poorly made, first they were very difficult to use and now they have both broken off!!! This product is not worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid $400 to be a beta tester.....","review":"The software is flat out awful in this device. The GUI is clumsy and unstable. If you want to change songs you have to stop the music, go all the way back to the main menu->audio->artist...oops, hit a button that says \\"This feature is not available\\"..wait 5 seconds for that to go away...I have not been able to have this thing play 3 songs in a row without locking up either. If you thought like me that you can spend the same price as an ipod plus get video, jpg and CF, trust me it doesn't succeed at any of them...get the ipod. Or get the Archos...it plays divx movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea. Poor Result. A \\"Video MP3\\" Player that Wouldn't","review":"Imagine buying a MP3 player that will not allow you to record/playback copyrighted material. Well that is exactly what RCA has released- a \\"video MP3\\" player that will not allow you to record any copyrighted material. I thought it would be great to record some of my DVD's to this device so that I could watch them on the road just like I listen to my CD's on the road with an MP3 player but witout that capability the Lyra is useless to me and I imagine most other people. I did however record some shows off of the TV as a test and the results were very acceptable although the picture would freeze on occasion. Also the user interface is very clunky. I am sure other manufacturers will improve on this idea in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA has a winner with this","review":"I bought this unit with some concern as the reviews were a little mixed. After a month I can say that it is one of the best gadgets I have ever owned, including the iPod. Used on its own, it makes PERFECT videos off a cable box or VCR. I used it on a recent trip to London with 25 kid's videos recorded. Whether used on its own (as on a plane) or plugged in to a TV, the replay was excellent with good sound. Reviews said there was macroblocking and other artifacts -- perhaps with the old software, I have seen almost none.MP3 playback is on a par with the iPod but with greater loudness available. In sum, in one little device I can hold my entire family photo album, a few thousand songs and over a dozen movies. It is worth more than what I paid for it. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"My wife bought this for me for Christmas last year. It doesn't work - for a whole number of reasons.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The Lyra is a great product. The problems mentioned by everyone else are fixed with the new firmware upgrade on the website.

It was well worth the money and far superior to the AV320. Awesome!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks","review":"The first day I got the RCA player it broke. The warrantee doesn't cover anything, but the hard drive. Then we followed the instruction to update the item and it freezes up.

They said the could not start a request until exactly 30 days have elapsed. They said IF a refund was approved it would take 8 to 10 weeks to process the check.Now I'm out $280 including tax and shipping without even having the units in hand for paperweights or skeet targets.Also tech supoprt said it supports 1 gig sd cards but aftger testing many brands and sizes I found it only supports 256k cards.DONT BUY RCA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"you may be like me and think that this is the coolest new thing to hit the market but its not its a great idea and all but its just not ready yet if you want somethign good get an ipod they rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Company!!!","review":"Bought one of this company's mp3 players and I lost my cord which connects it to the computer.

Bad Software","review":"I have already exchanged my Lyra for a replacement because the first one locked up. The second one has taken 2 fatal hardware crashes. Functionality wise the rocker buttons are the worst. I never know what event if any will be processed and it takes forever for the event to be processed. The next issue is the shuffle all functionality is poor. With over 2000 files I should never hear the same song very often. However, the first song played each session is always the same and the same song repeat between sessions. I have heard the same song 3 and 4 times a week. My guess is this file number is used as the seed to the random file number generator, therefore the probability of generating the same file number increases dramatically. I should also be able to shuffle all songs for a specific Genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Media Player Review","review":"Worst piece of crab I've ever purchased.

Let me tell you if you have any doubts forget them because i was thinking th same thing then when i got it it proved me worng. This product delivers everything it says and my friend has a ipod and this is supier to its sound. If ur worried about not being able to record dvds dont worry, you can! Just read the other reviews and they will help you greatly. The screen quilty is very sharp and clear and playback looks great on it.

I bought it mainly for the photo function and the video playing ability. Video can be played but only in Mpeg-4, not mpeg-1/2 as promised. Quality of video is okay, but that is not the point. All 3.5\\" screen could give you a reasonable viewing experience.Accessories are rediculous. The designer of the case should, let's say, lose his job. The ear plug on the car kit does not even fit the device (it is for phones rather than headphones).Basically, RCA rushed this device out without even thinking that it will ruin its reputation, if it had one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Very simple. This unit is supposed to record video from anoutside source. Somethimes it does, sometimes it just shutsitself off.RCA won't do anything about it and just ignores me. I'm buyingthe Archos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed...","review":"First of all, the battery life was supposed to be 8 hours. After then initial charge, I was lucky if I got a complete movie out of it.Initially, support was responsive to my problem, but I ended up waiting an additional 30 days for my replacement unit as they were on back order.Upon receiving my replacement unit, I found the battery life to be comparably short (to the first)- this after several hours re-creating my folders and play-lists.So I learned to live with the brief battery life, but two weeks later, the unit dies completely.I'm sure my experience is not indicative of the typical quality for this unit, but it's been quite dissapointing nonetheless. I have heard the battery problem is not unique to my unit, so don't expect 8 hours. I do hope your unit last more than two weeks, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyra is a good looking piece of Junk","review":"The Lyra is a great concept. Storing vidio, audio, and pictures display. The reality is that the product is not fully functional. So don't expect to have the features that will make it useable. You will constantly see \\"this feature will be availabe in a future release\\". The user interface is clunky and there are a number of file formats that are not useable. If you try to contact Thomson (RCA) to find out when updates will be available they will tell you nothing. It can only be surmised that the promised updates will never be available.When you install the basic operating software expect to be pushed marketing information. Buy this subscription, this software upgrade, and on and on. This product is a nice looking incomplete marketing night mare.Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another product built to break","review":"CONS: Can't really use while walking/running(too big). Headphone jack stopped working. Most of the time it had 5 minute waiting period (frozen) for loading songs. You cannot scroll music while listening, hence going back to the menu and having to wait the five minutes again. The knobs came off so i had to select songs only by growing my fingernail long enough to reach the selector. If you still are adamant about buying this, MAKE SURE you carry around a paperclip to reset this device for its inevitable freezes. The best part is...it stopped accepting the charge from the power source. What a piece of garbage!PROS: 20 gigs/plays/records (some) video / looks nice and feels good when it is shattered with a hammer"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok........ I guess","review":"Purchased early january. Love the video features. Did like the photo features. Mp3 features lack a few things. The video recorder/playback is cool, works fine for me. Being able to connect to the tv is great. The photos were cool until it lost the ability to read jpeg(i still see the photo but it doesnt fit the screen). I get an annoying, file format not supported. Mp3s play ok but you dont get the ability to search for another song while listening to the current selection. Adding costume album art creates, file format not supported, and no play. Desperately needs a current playlist to add songs on the fly. It takes eight seconds to load a song once selected. A lot of features still unavailable. Overall I feel I didnt get my moneys worth considering that two months later and im already troubleshooting problems. I have all current firmware/application updates. I use it with a brand new dell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Toy...","review":"I just recieved this RCA Lyra for my 14th birthday...llike another reviewer, when constructing a *wish list* I looked into the acclaimed IPOD and also competitive Archos MP4 player (similiar to the RCA LYRA). Probably like most of you, from reading reviews, good and bad, this item is a lot to spend your money on. I hope this review changes your mind. This incredible device strives where other competitors fall. Easily able to move files, audio, video, pictures, and word documents onto the device is amazignly simple. When looking forward to the device, I was expecting a screen lacking crystal clear picture =yet I recieved a detailed picture on a small, yet sufdficeint screen. If questiopning to buy this product I encourage you to do so. Although not able to record live TV like the archos, this device can rtecord dvd's and vhs's as well as cd's. You can plug the device into any car to hear it through the cars internal speakers as wells as put in output into a television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but that's all","review":"This player looks great and the specifications sound nice. However, the firmware is really bad and RCA did not provide a working update. There are problems with so many files, that are not supported. Many DivX don't work at all, some work with bad synchronization errrors. Even some MPegs, a much more standardized format, don't work at all. With some MPegs, I just see Fatal Errors. All the files I tried, and it was a lot, worked pretty well on a PC, a DVD-Player, and even on an iPod. If you want to watch videos, look for sth else, that'll save you some stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Returning This","review":"After reading reviews and seeing that most others are having the same problems I am with the RCA jukebox, I'm going to return mine after all. I'd rather not have one at all than be a $400 tester for RCA on this prematurely released product.As others, I am going to go with the Archos. I cannot afford it now, but at $300 more, and 60 GB more, including more features, and it's not a 1st generation, it'll be worthwhile to save and get a superior unit.Update: I returned the RCA jukebox and bought the Archos 20 GB. It was only $100 more and is worth every penny. I won't elaborate here because this is for RCA Lycra reviews. However, I must say that Archos provides software for you to transfer video to the proper codec. Please don't waste your money on the RCA JOKEbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THEM","review":"I LOVE these seat covers!!!

The story is completely riveting and the plot is fresh and topical. Very much a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" thriller -- except unlike all the rehashed plots you see again and again on law and order, this is the first time I've seen this one taken on (in book or on film).While addictive, it's not one of those page turners that's too shallow to leave you satisfied. The characters are developed so deeply - quirks and all - it's like you've known them all your life. The second book in \\"the locator\\" series continues that development even further. Even though I read this years ago, the story has always stuck with me. When I saw the new \\"Bones\\" episode featuring Greener's characters in a crossover/potential pilot called \\"The Finder\\" I was thrilled.

Great gift idea for grandparents (I believe there's one for grandpas as well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"What a great treasure to leave behind when someone passes.

Needed to find another one since had been ten years not sure that was possible so I search and found this one on Amazon. Just like the first one for my second grandson..Now they can have their own. Was in excellent condition just as listed.. I love it for it's individual content related to each child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Binding!","review":"I agree that the questions and illustrations are great and that there is a religious undertone. I'm sure the contents will be precious to my granddaughter. HOWEVER, the book is not perfect bound. The pages began to loosen in the center before I even finished writing in it. By the time she read it, the whole center section came out. An heirloom that takes untold hours to make should be made to last.

I will always cherish my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"After giving it to my Mother, I want to get started on mine!","review":"I saw this book on the shelf and immediately knew I wanted it for my Mother. Before I wrapped it, I read through the beautifully decorated pages, and realized that I wanted it for myself. Alas, they were sold out at the store. I knew that this book would be something that I would want to fill out and give to my grandchild (or grandchildren). I don't have any yet, but most of this book I can write now. This is a lovely book for Christians who want to share their experiences, strengths, and hopes with their future generations. Thank you to Thomas Kinkaid for another truly wonderful book. And thanks to Amazon.com I am getting one for myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD/VHS...unless all you want is a documentary on the Clancy brothers. Unlike what the Amzon listing & advertisments suggest, this is only a documentary. There is very little concert footage at all (just small portions of the reunion concert). The documentary is decent for a diehard fan...but make sure you realize that you are only getting a documentary that runs less than the 60 mins the details suggest. While the documentary is somewhat intersting...you are only getting a documentary with a little concert footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, entertaining video for preschoolers & kindergartners","review":"My daughter, Kelly, who is 3 1/2, fell in love with this video from the rental store. We rented it twice and she was so upset about returning it the second time that we decided to purchase it. It is a nice, sweet, magical story about Christmas. It is the perfect length, about 30 minutes or so, and sends a good message about faith and hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thuille? Better Dohnanyi or Dvorak.","review":"People who enjoy listening to the Thuille piano quintets have probably never had to learn and rehearse them. This music is \\"cute\\" to listen to once or twice, but extremely trite and boring to learn. I've been a performing pianist for 50 years, and I can't bear to play these pieces. They are just difficult enough that they do require some practicing, and not interesting enough to make the practice and rehearsals enjoyable. All of the chamber music groups that I've performed with have the same opinion. Sorry. Go for Dohnanyi or Dvorak if what you want is big, romantic, and interesting chamber music that includes piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed but concerned about \\"Bug's Life\\" performance probs","review":"Just bought/hooked up my unit. Impressed with video and audio performance. I think I can see a slight offset between the sound and the video on \\"George of the Jungle\\" and \\"Face Off\\" not sure if all DVDs players are like this... or maybe this RCA has this characteristic? I need to rent \\"Bug's Life\\" and look for the problem others have mentioned. Overall good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time Owner","review":"I was browsing and found that RCA (Thompson) was still making this unit. This was my first DVD player that I got about NINE years ago. It is STILL working. I am not a great fan of RCA but I can't fault this one. When I bought it the unit cost more than $200, so the $60 price tag now seems reasonable. For less money I think you should look at Sony, though. It has updated features and a slim profile. (You usually can't go wrong with Sony products.) Unless this unit's quality has changed much over the years, I could recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better","review":"I got this player because I have an RCA TV that only has a coaxial cable input and a stereo that would only handle virtual surround. Since I'd only had the TV for a year, I wasn't going to buy a new one to accomodate a DVD player, so I settled for a basic unit (the RC5220P) with a converter for \\"digital\\" movie enjoyment. The 4:3 display has never been good. Image quality has been tolerable. After a brief 2 years of service, the video card just quit and service will cost at least half as much as a new player. Hmmm...wonder if I should get a new RCA player?"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product ever","review":"I purchased this product last year for my husbands birthday and we have had nothing but trouble ever since. When we first set it up we used it a couple of times and it stopped working. My husband had to send it back to RCA to get it replaced at least twice before he complained that he didn't think it was packaged properly. It finally came packaged properly and worked, for about 6 months. 2 weeks ago it completely stopped in the middle of a movie and hasn't worked since. You've got to be kidding me.This is the biggest waste of money and time ever!! It's a total disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poor Reviews are True","review":"As mentioned in previous reviews the system does crash in a consistent manner. Mine took a year to fail, but it freezes after several minutes of play and the chapter selection fails completely. Also, Thompson Electronics, the service support for RCA, is expensive and provides very poor service. Their solution to fixing my problem is to send a refurished system without even looking at my system. They cannot send a new system, since RCA stopped producing this product. I think that should indicate something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes up and has problems reading disks!!","review":"Have taken this model back to the store and exchanged it three times now. Each time it works fine for about 3 weeks, then starts freezing up, or tells me I have inserted an incompatible disk---even though it had already read the same disk before with no problems. Right now it is reading about 50% of the DVDs I own. It's going in the trash... That's a shame because I have always loved RCA products before. I'll think long and hard before I buy RCA again."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems here","review":"Given that I've received nothing but top-notch performance from this product, it's distressing to see so many negative reviews from others. I've fed it the most sophisticated discs I can find (including \\"A Bug's Life: Collector's Edition\\") and have had no problems. I suspect poor quality control on RCA's part. Based solely on my own experience, however, I give it five stars for video and audio quality and overall performance, and dock it one star for the lack of the generally common zoom feature and front panel chapter display (laserdisc owners can identify with the latter). Overall, an excellent player and an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"'A Bug's Life' problem with RCA and ProScan model DVD-Player","review":"There is a widespread problem with RCA dvd machines being able to play, 'A Bug's Life'. This movie is one of the best ever made for the format, and the first all digital transfer of a film. I suggest if you have an RCA brand (or Proscan) dvd-player that you get this disk and see if it works. Usually, the player wil throw back an error message after five minutes, saying \\"Incompatible Disk\\". If you do put it in enough times, you may be able to get it to play on the forth or fifth try. However, if you are not happy with this performance, you may take your player back, because this is a manufacturer's defect and is subject to a full refund no matter how long you've had your dvd-player. I think the problem may be as rampant as 1 in every 2 players. Be sure to check your system out."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR from good","review":"We bought this unit when it first came out. It was good in the beginning and then it just ate it. It would freeze up and pixelate(is that how you spell it? If the player was any good, I wouldn't have to worry about spelling words like this). Some movies worked well and others didn't get through the opening menu. I bought a lens cleaner and a scratch repair kit...it didn't help..this was the beginning of my denial stage. Then I admitted to the fact that it was the dvd player. I'm looking for some closure here! But reading all these reviews isn't helping any. Oh wells, I guess I'll just add buying a dvd player every year to my fixed expenses..just like car insurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"i am suprised at rca this time. in the past, they made some very \\"clunky\\" looking products... out of all the dvd players i looked at before purchasing, this one was the most elegant and streamlined. setup is a breeze and the menu & remote are very straight-forward. good value and simplicity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted two months","review":"I was incredibly pleased with my RCA DVD when i bought it at the end of August. The first problem I noticed was while watching \\"A Simple Plan.\\" The screen flickered during the really white snow scenes. No problem . . . just the disk I thought. Then after two months of ownership the DVD decided to eat DVD's rather than play them. The tray would close and grind and click away until it was good and ready to let go. Needless to say, I took it back and bought a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORKED FOR ONE DAY!","review":"I bought this DVD player 6 months ago for my Mom's Birthday, which was a few days ago. I always buy early and wanted to take advantage of all the deals around Christmas. The first time we plug it in we get the menu and the DVD starts. Then nothing. I have 40 DVD's and every single one doesn't work. I get a no disc error. Tried returing it to RCA and they say no! I have to pay some huge labor fee. I am past amazon's return policy, so basically i spent all this money and havn't even gotten one single use out of it! This is the second DVD player we have owned and it ...(stinks)! we bought one for ...(less money) at target that has lasted over a year and works perfectly! Do NOT BUY RCA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I hope I save somebody the time and trouble of buying this piece of garbage. As some of the other reviewers have experienced, mine starting acting up after three months. I was told by the manufacturer that for $80 I should send it back for a \\"reconditioned\\" one. Went to Mail Boxes Etc... and sent it back. I received the \\"new\\" one about three weeks later and I am having the same problem with this one. The kicker of this whole mess was the woman at Mail Boxes Etc... told me that sometimes the same people send the machine back three to four times! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DVD VALUE AROUND","review":"There are some pretty nasty reviews about the RCA RC5220P DVD player. I just want to say that I have had mine for four months now, and it has not had one single problem, and I am glad I decided to purchase this brand. Most reviews say that it will crash after two months, if this is true than mine is two months past due. And my family and I use it quite regularly, so it's not just sitting on the shelf. I am certainly getting my moneys worth out of it. The picture quality is outstanding. The sound is the best. It is also very quick when loading a movie. Pop in the movie and it is loaded in about 2 seconds. The same quick speed goes for when you skip to a chapter. Overall, I'd like to also point out that this DVD player may be cheap in price, but it definitely is not cheap in performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to unplug it between viewings!","review":"Am on my third one of this model...each one with the same problem. After a few viewings, it began to get choosy about which DVDs it would read. Sometimes it would not even acknowledge that a DVD had been inserted! I finally figured out how to fix it, since RCA could not. When it does this, you have to unplug the machine from the outlet for about a half hour. Apparently this resets something and allows it to read again. Now, until I can replace it with a better machine, I unplug it each time I turn it off. So far, this works. It's a shame...I have always liked RCA until this machine. It performs GREAT when it works, but I will think twice before I buy an RCA product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player did not perform very well","review":"I purchased this player because it was the only one I could find that had an RF adaptor to hook up to my old TV. I have purchased some RCA products in the past and had no problems. That was not the case with this DVD player. After having hooked up the player it ran about 10 minutes and lost picture and also had distorted sound. I left it sit for about a half hour and tried it again with the same results, no picture and distorted sound. Some people have had good luck with this player but I DID NOT. It was returned the next day for a Magnavox. I have only had the Magnavox for about one week but so far no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONLY model that will work with ANALOG tv (coax. input only)","review":"Many people are busting on this player. I've only had mine for 1 week, and it's been flawless. I offer 2 ideas about it. 1) players made back in q3 of 1999 might be a different batch than those available now. So, some improvements may be available now that were not in this model last year. 2) this player has a RF adapter, so that you can play it directly into an analog tv. I bought the converter at a local store, and it works great. So, now, I don't need to buy a new T.V.I hope it keeps working this well, but for saving me the need to buy a new T.V., there was a significant hidden savings in this player. It's the only one I could find that had this feature.It played the Matrix, etc. without a hitch this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from RCA","review":"This player has major problems with certain disks. It can't even begin to play John Carpenter's Vampires. \\"The Matrix\\" (dual layer disk) gets about half way through, then only plays every other chapter. The player's computer software(firmware) loses it's mind all too often even on disks it has previously played causing the \\"incompatible disk message\\" which requires resetting the player by unplugging it. If you play back movies using the Dolby Digital sound setting you get periodic pops in the soundtrack and times when the sound goes away for a few seconds. I have to say overall it has been a very pathetic DVD player thus proving once again that \\"you get what you pay\\". If you have one of these players and think it's great, just wait over time with more movies played you will change your mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From RCA DVD","review":"Stay away from RCA DVD players-the player which I have owned for 2 years has broken (despite my going to extreme steps to take care of it), and just now, I am discovering that many other people are complaining of the same problems with their RCA player. Movies will not play all the way through, and the chapter search just goes bersek when you try to use it. By the way, the RCA people are of no help when you call customer service-all they tell you is that it will cost $170 just to have it looked at (when I could practically buy a new player for that price). As soon as I get the money, I'm buying a Sony Player, which is what I should have gotten to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just DIED","review":"Received this DVD Player as a gift and it worked pretty good for about a year. Inserted a DVD last week and it just died. Took it to an RCA certified repair shop for repair and was told that when they called RCA for schematic info they were told not to attempt repair. Repairman said he was given a 1-800 number for me to call and for an outrageous amount of $$ I could send it to RCA for repair/replacement. What a great service policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginners DVD player","review":"After reading the reviews here I was very skeptical about purchasing this unit. I have several RCA components and wanted RCA because their stuff works so well together. Sure enough, we bought the unit, plugged it in, and our existing RCA TV remote started controlling the DVD player without a hitch (of course the remote that comes with the DVD unit also controlled all of our other RCA units without a hitch too). We even rented Bugs life to make sure ours wasn't one of the \\"bad\\" units. Everything worked fine, even in wide screen mode!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great DVD player for about 2 months","review":"I bought one of these for my father after seeing how great my roommate's was but after 2-3 months both of them started flickering and would freeze up from time to time and now my fathers only plays about half the DVDs he owns and my roommates can't get through 20 minutes of a movie without flickering then locking up. I found out from talking to people on the internet that about half of these units have MAJOR hardware issues. Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with Unit","review":"I bought this unit after purchasing, and returning a more expensive Samsung 709. The 709 kept skipping on The Mummy,after the layer change, and a few others. After purchasing the RCA, I had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever playing the movies I want to.Great audio, Great video! The only con to this unit, is its lack of features such as zoom, vcd play ability, and lack of track display on front panel. But hey, for this price, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the reviews - DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"For some reason I read the reviews, and chose to believe the good ones and not the bad.This unit has played 3 DVDs for me.

I already through away all the packing so I can't send it back, and you see the difficulty that people have had with RCA.DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA DVD Player works fine 4 me","review":"I've had the RCA DVD player for about 2 years and I have had no problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!!!!!","review":"This attempt at low cost digital video is just the type of propaganda that you would expect from a company trying to meet standards set by the front runners in the field of digital video. In the future, you should try to surpass your competition. Although I am an avid RCA consumer, I am at this time reluctant to purchase this product, for the simple fact that i am accustomed to top of the line performance from your company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! But there is something odd","review":"I was all geeked up to get this DVD-Audio (the first I have ever heard). It really is a great buy, and you can hear the difference. One thing I noticed, however, is that some tracks are different! I am huge Metallica fan, and play guitar, so I know this album extremely well. On \\"Don't Tread On Me\\", it goes into an extra little part right after the first verse! I am assuming this was intentional. If you doubt what I am saying, put the DVD-audio on, along with the CD. You'll hear what I am talking about. I haven't listened to the entire album yet, so I am not sure there is more. Has anyone else noticed this??? It is a good buy though. The clarity is good, though I bet it would be better with a dedicated DVD-Audio player (rather than just my standard DVD player, with 5.1 Dolby Digital). But let's face it, this is one of the greatest albums ever recorded, so any way to hear it at optimum quality is cool :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Metal Fan!","review":"I don't know what happened to me because normally I sit at home with a glass of Cab and just chill out to vintage Joni Mitchell or some of the anti-war anthems by Joan Baez and just call it a night.

I will be giving this to all my knitting club friends, for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame","review":"I bought this album after listening to and loving the two albums Mater Of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All. I went to HMV with this CD in mind, because I had heard Enter Sandman, Sad But True, and Nothing Else Matters on the radio and liking them. I bought this album despite the fact i had heard that this was the album Metallica sold out. Well, let me tell you, they did sell out. I preffered Metallica when they played 8 minute masterpieces, not 4 minutes of mainstream crap that ANYONE can say they like. I hate it when people say they like Metallica when all they have ever heard are the Black Album, St. Anger, or anything off the Load albums. If you want REAL Metallica, then buy anything before the Black Album. The first four albums are incredible. Don't buy this one.GOOD MUSIC: Mushroomhead, In Flames, Lamb Of God, Meshuggah, Pre-Black Album Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Killswitch Engage, Fear Factory... the list goes on.Keep ShreddingJack Metal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enter Sandman... literally!!","review":"Wake me up when it's over...It's hard to believe this is the same band that played \\"Kill 'em All\\", \\"Ride the Lightning\\" & \\"Master of Puppets\\".

And Justice For All may not have been as commercial but was more polished than its followers, and a SINGLE on MTV(emphasis) was released. All fans should have been expecting this. And Metallica even said themselves \\"How much faster and heavier can we get(in 1991)\\"? So the songs on this album are definitely heavy enough that it fits the songs, Metallica maintain most of its songwriting principles such as songs based around E5 power chord,multiple solos in one song, hard, long(no pun)and guitar solos. The low point on this album is easily the last song, while the rest of this album doesn't allow you to skip a single track. However, if you are looking for a way to get into Metallica, do not use this as your guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the swan song","review":"a lot of people are talking about this album being the sellout album of metallica. although i think it was the beginning of the end, i still feel this ablum is metallica. maybe not as technicle and complex as the old stuff, but its still cool. i mean you can say all day long this album is crap sell out stuff, but come on, you'd have to be lying if you said enter sandman, unforgiven, nothing else matters, and where ever i may roam were not classic tunes. good album in my opinion. 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't get enough of this band as they are great! They are one of my favorite bands period! On this album, I've liked each and every song..The weakest songs are probably NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, and OF WOLF AND MAN. I think Nothing Else Matters makes me thinktoo much of my girlfriend, Waiting For A Girl Like You as she's stuck in the rain and makes me a little bit sad. The rest of the other songs are fine. This album came out when I was just born. So on my 15th birthday, I'm gonna play this great album. The best songs are ENTER SANDMAN, UNFORGIVEN, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, GOD THAT FAILED, and MY FRIEND OF MISERY. I can't get enough of those tunes.

I like Master of Puppets better. It's hardcore metal but you can still understand the lyrics, it's not just screaming and non-musical riffs. This one though has hit songs you gotta hear like Enter Sandman, the mellow Nothing Else Matters, and Of Wolf and Man. I really like the drumming on this album which doesn't overuse the cymbols and high drums like the snare, it has those deeper drums and what the term is I have no idea. The songs are kind of basic where you thing \\"How did these guys get this riff? It's so simple and obvious but so awesome!\\" So uh...

They backed away from their typical 8 minute long songs and moved towards more simple songs. I like MOP better because it is musically superior, but this album is still a must have for any Metallica fan. They still open most of their songs up with a cool intro and every song has a good guitar solo.

I love especially \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" \\"The Unforgiven,\\" \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"My Friend of Misery,\\" and the non-Apo songs \\"The God that Failed,\\" and \\"Of Wolf and Man.\\" The last two are really amazing, and \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" borders on downright creepy at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly not their best, but worth listening to...","review":"While this album has its graces, this is where Metallica turned to mainstream rock rather than the fast-paced heavy metal that they were known for (again, I use the word \\"sell outs.\\"). HOWEVER, this album gets a lot of flack for it being the \\"commercial album\\" when it is certainly not a bad album. In fact, this is their last good album. \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" and \\"Of Wolf And Man\\" (my favorite here) are excellent songs. All the other songs are either ok (like \\"Unforgiven\\") or just plain blah (I really disliked \\"Holier Than Thou\\" and \\"Sad But True\\"). In short, while it may sound closer to commercial rock than to heavy metal, give it a listen and you'll find some good music here. So what if it's not Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets?"},{"rating":"2","title":"its pretty good i guess","review":"its alright, its a little slow but well compossed. you can apreiate the slowness but were's the thrasing.

Great lyrics, fantastic production, Metallica finally took the time to make their opus."},{"rating":"2","title":"From good to the kick@$$ album","review":"This album not only made history by bringing Heavy Metal back from the dead but also by making number one on the charts for more then a year and a half.If you listen to their old stuff,it's fast with good rythems and Leads.Then the black album makes a great soundtrack for everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"This is one of my all-time favourite albums. It has to be heard to be fully appreciated. Get it and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the greatest cds ever.","review":"If given adequate finances, I would have encouraged Jaymz and company to release every song on here as a single at the least. Kirk Hammet had some of the best and most difficult guitar riffs ever employed by a guitarist since Jimi Hendrix, recorded on this very album. Not to mention each song was more meaningful and understandable that anything they've ever written. Im just glad this album wasnt a rare like Acoustica or Live Sh*t. I along with the rest of the United States would have missed out on one of the greatest albums in the history of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but the some of the songs are overplayed!","review":"Yes, they are. If you turn to any heavy metal or mainstream rock station you'll probably hear Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Wherever I may roam, Nothing else Matters and Sad but True. This album is mainstream, however, musically it is a classic. After this album Metallica never recovered. Nonetheless, you decide!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last good Metallica CD","review":"This is not a classic but it's good in its own way. Here's a song rating:1. Enter Sandman 5/52.

I'm not sure what the project is but Trujillo had mentioned to Joe Crummey of KABC that he had thoughts of leaving the band temporarily, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Album","review":"Here we have Metallica's breakthrough album, the Black album. This is what put Metallica into the mainstream, and it is indeed a masterpeice. Every song on this on is a classic. The talent is all there. The production is crystal clear. Everything about this album is epic. A lot of people complain that this is all a little too mainstream, but I disagree. I believe the boys to be in top performance, just because it's a little more accessible, doesn't mean that the talent is gone. Kirk plays some of his greatest solos on this album. I believe that everyone is in top form. Jason Newsted also gets a chance to prove himself on this one. As a bassist, I believe his basslines on the slower songs to showcase his talent the most. He packs a lot of emotion, especially in Nothing Else Matters. Overall, this is just a fun and enjoyable cd with talented musicians and songwriting. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"COME ON PEOPLE","review":"This is a great album. But I like LOAD AND RELOAD even more than it!

That's why it sold so well. And it did have that Metallica sound, yet to those who knew Metallica best, the \\"the Black Album\\" lacked any sincere fire in the soul. It was empty. It was bland. It was Metallica only going through the motions. And creatively, it was the end of the real Metallica.If you want to buy a Metallica album, buy \\"Master of Puppets\\" for it's muscle and purity. Or, buy \\"And Justice for All,\\" which is complex and takes a while to get use to, but if you're patient, you'll come to understand that \\"And Justice for All\\" is one of the greatest albums in rock history.If you have a brain the size of a pea, please don't buy \\"And Justice for All,\\" because you will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap for teen boys","review":"seriously who would Listen to this junk besides prepubescent boys. This isn't rock or metal, this is just junk that should never have been made. Songs on here Like enter sandman and sad but true are just sad pathetic pieces of crap, in fact the whole album is crap.

Anyone who Likes this this band doesn't know anything about true good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline of metal","review":"Few alblums disgust me as much as Metallica's self titled release. Certainly, this piece of garbage does mark the beginning of Metallica's enterence into mainstream music-and its terrible.

They found some great acclaim with the song \\"One\\" on the AJFA album, continuing with their great thrash tradition. So what do they do? They totally CHEESE out with this album. I agree with the one guy above; this album sucks ass. If your just trying Metallica, I suggest \\"And Justice for All\\" and any previous album. \\"Garage Inc.\\" is exceptional - the covers rock!

They abandoned us who considered ourselves fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out","review":"There are 2 kinds of Metallica fans, pre-black-album and post-black-album. And that is because this album marked the death of Metallica and the birth of just-another-heavy-metal-band. By any other band, these songs would have been awesome, but by the band that built they're fan base on bludgeoning, epic(in content and length)songs, this was a total and complete sell out. Shorter songs, commercialized lyrics, horrific solos...it's been 10 years since its release but because the let down was so immense, I can remember it like it was yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the most highly underrated album ever!","review":"For most of the \\"Old School\\" Metallica fans this album was considered a huge disappointment. And widely considered the beginning of a huge downward spiral for the band. I will never begin to understand why? This album is yet another masterpiece for Metallica.

So what, This album is still better than 99% of the crap that's coming out nowadays. 15 million fans can't be wrong, Highest selling Metallica album EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic by any means","review":"I was 11 when this came out and I bought this and Justice at the same time. I was new to metal and I was a kid but I knew I was listening to Justice constantly while I struggled to get beyond the third track here (it was cassette.) If you liked well played thrash or any kind of music, it boggles the mind why you would want this stuff that gets boring after a few listens. Roam, Struggle, God that failed, Through the never are just filler. I loved Sandman back then, but I liked Smells like teen spirit too."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"If cliff was alive when tallica wrote black album he'd probably laugh in their face. The album as a whole blows. A select songs on it are good, ie my friend of misery, unforgivin, through the never and struggle within. Enter Sandman is the most overrated piece of crap song i think i've ever heard (prior to hearing st anger) Load and Reload were worse, and words cant even express how bad st anger was. This was the album that started the mighty Metallicas downfall. You cant go from Master Of Puppets, Disposible Heros, Dyers Eve and such to Enter Sandman, or Mama Said... sad what once was the forrunner of thrash metal has come to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterile","review":"Ah, Metallica's \\"breakthrough\\" CD. Yes, how wonderful it was that this great band learned how to \\"pare its excesses\\" and focus on \\"tight song structures.\\"Uh, hello? I LIKED the excess on Metallica's albums. That's why they were great; they made the excess work for the music, instead of against it. This CD, called the \\"Black Album,\\" is just a dozen songs with riffs stolen from Tony Iommi and lame nursery rhyme lyrics. Sure, Hetfield's vocals only keep improving, but if I want great singing I'll listen to Elvis.Maybe if half these songs hadn't been overplayed so much on the radio and MTV, I might like them. But that's not the case. This is boring arena rock, unsurprising and sterile."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is metallica?","review":"any long time fan of metallica will tell you this is not a metallica album. It IS a Bob Rock album. The mix is good, the songs are catchy, simple, commercial, and short. All in all a great album for any other band.

How could you help it? This was without a doubt the greatest Heavy Metal album ever in print. Before 1991, a metal band winning Album of the Year was unheard of. It seems that Metallica had turned more heads than anybody could have possibly imagined. This is a CD who made Gods of a group of men, and made fans out of an entire country of people.

The guitar on all of these is incredible especially \\"Wherever I May Roam\\". Over all any metal fan needs this album. And though it is over ten years old it is still somewhere around a million copies a year, that makes a classic CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Sound!!","review":"I'm a huge Metallica fan and listening to this DVD was like hearing it for the first time. The sound is incredible. I was pretty much swallowed by all the instruments coming from all over the place. I definetly recommend this to any Metallica fan.

I can't wait until more releases!!Carlos"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD does not live up to its hype!","review":"For all of the hype surrounding Metallica's self-titled CD, it did not live up to its full potential.

It is my belief that this is a CD that Metallica should have never released!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Metallica's worst album for all their early fans. Very slow and moody.

He's lost them somewhere.","review":"I challenge anyone to listen to this drivel back-to-back with And Justice for All or Master of Puppets and say with a straight face that the Black Album is good. Hetfield used to have \\"Kill Bon Jovi\\" taped on his guitar. Now he has Bob Rock, Bon Jovi's old producer, and makes \\"Slippery When Wet\\" sound like Motorhead. It's sad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning Of The End - A Clear Turning Point (for the worse)","review":"I listened to it once in 1991 and gave it away.

This album is arguably one of the best albums ever to come out by Metallica. It has the best mix of their heavy metal days and of their creativity to produce some pretty good ballads such as Nothing Else Matters. I'd have to say this is their best album ever. Almost all the songs on here are really good that's including songs that weren't hits (who knows why). Overall, if you're planning on getting it, BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enter Sandman Is The Only Good Song!","review":"I'll give this CD 1 star because Enter Sandman is a good song.Other than that I've heard Wherever I May Roam and it is whatmakes Metallica suck.

Metal died in 1991."},{"rating":"1","title":"The official sell-out anthem- Sandman","review":"Ok, One was a great video, but they should have stopped there. This album is the true turning point of Metallica. Although this album contains many good songs, it shifted to a drastic commercial appeal. There is no need for an album to have 1/2 of the songs end up as singles and vidoes, that is just a cry for coperate attention, and the trade-mark of 3 year bands who are popular after their first album, then realize they [are bad]. Many people love this album and I have no idea why, it is not Metallica's finest work by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak castrated radio metal","review":"This album is for anyone who does not like angry thrash metal and more poppy type tunes such as \\"Enter Sandman\\".Its Metallica with its fangs removed and turned into a radio friendly hard rock sound.There are a few good songs such as My Friend of Misery, The God that Failed and maybe one or two other songs but really, if you want speed metal thrash you must go older, matter of fact everything they released after this album is garbage too.I do not mind when bands change but really Metallica jumped about 20 sharks and they have become a joke in the metal scene.Get Master or Justice... Forget this album was ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't Own This Album Yet?","review":"What are you waiting for? This album is excellent from front to back. Definitely classic Metallica, and classic Metal. There are 12 reasons to get this album. Track one is one reason, track two is another reason, all the way to track 12. This is one of those \\"just put it in and press play\\" albums. No filler here. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. If you have more money left, get Master of Puppets, ...And Justice For All, and Ride the Lightning too. Then you will have yourself a nice little Metal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I remember when this came out when I was a kid and it sounds sooooooo much better on vinyl than a digital recording.

Metallica is a must have for any rock collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"EEEkkk!!! Make them stop!!!!!!!","review":"This is the first and the last Metallica album I will ever buy! My parrot sings better than that John Cougar Melloncamp fellow! Chimpansee's are not free you know that is why this album must have been so expensive to make. But I really did love the group and their music. It was the music and the group that I prefered not like. CHILI CHEESE FRIES!!!!!!!! From bands like Airsupply and Snoop Doggy Dog, their present was felt on this wonderfully diagnostic tribute to industry which made failures of men and heros of everything else in mind! Wow is this the best of nothing else to be seen!!!This album makes a moccery of what it means to be a proud Canadian. As you can clearly see the bird does not fall far from the tree!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"My record skips on every song and it is not because of my record player.

It's beyond bad. And yes, I'm one of the many fans who feels betrayed by this album.

A must","review":"Metallica was a true pioneer of the heavy metal era. Top singles like Enter Sandman and Wherever I May Roam helped establish thrash metal of today.

From Sandman to Struggle, there is no bad song on this record"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a long time Metallica Fan and Metal expert","review":"After Metallica released this album, it told me one thing-They are getting old and tired. The only time after that when actually go back to the hard and heavy is during Garage Inc.

For real Punk Heavy Metal pass this album and buy Master of Puppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"The begining of the end","review":"After great masterpieces such as Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All, Metallica decided to go mainstream, isn't that a synonim for selling out? From fast thrashing songs full of masterfull solos, Metallica turned into another mid-tempo 5 minutes radio songs. Regardless, all that shouldn't matter, the songs are plain \\"not-as-good.\\" Definitely it's a must have, it's also way better than the albums to come from Metallica, but this is the end, of Metallica as a metal band. Don't expect headbanging stuff here. Expect hard-rock. Highlight: \\"The Struggle Within\\" great intro, great riff, great solo, definitely one of Metallica's most interesting songs. Low: \\"The God That Failed\\", just not a good song, slow and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This album has taken a lot of flak and also some praise as being the last good Metallica album. This album features something never heard before on a Metallica record, namely production. It actually sounds like they did more than one take on the songs, in fact the whole album sounds like there was a lot of hard work put into it. The album has moments of greatness, but some lows as well. The album does not hide the fact that it is not And Justice for All or Master of Puppets. It'd bold and innovative, given that in 1991 there was nothing like it on the radio. Since then there's been hundreds of acts trying to ride the coat tails, but this record stands out as the original. Definately worth a buy, but there are better Metallica records out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Music...Dissapointed with the quality","review":"Excellent cd and won't waste anyone's time reviewing the music. If you are looking at hard rock or heavy metal, you already know something about Metallica.Just wanted to review the DVD Audio aspect of the cd/dvd. To keep it simple, while it sounded better, definitely had more of a feel for each individual instrument, it in no way is a major step up from a typical cd.I quickly tossed my old tapes out the window and bought as many cd's as I could afford when they initially came out. But, after hearing this DVD-Audio representation of Metallica, the chances that I will restock my collection of cd's with DVD-Audio are slim. Oh well...at least I won't go broke!Haven't heard the SACD format yet so maybe there is some promise there."},{"rating":"2","title":"metallica's best album","review":"metallica is a great band. this album was my first introduction to them, and i love it. songs like \\"nothing else matters\\", \\"the unforgiven\\", \\"holier than thou\\", \\"sad but true\\", and \\"through the never\\" are true classics. anyone who listens to good music should own this album. i think it defines metal. if you're new to this type of music, this album is a good starting point. i am very young so i have been forced to catch up on the 30 great years of music previous to my birth. this album was a turning point for me and i hope this review will help others to step into the light. it shows the softer side of one of the greatest bands ever, and i believe everyone has a softer side they should express. this album is well worth the 15 or so dollars you will spend on it. it is ESSENCIAL.

Sure, they picked up a lot of new fans, certainly more than they lost. But I'm one they lost for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Aged a Bit But Still Good","review":"This is probably the album where Metallica sold out.

Right after this, they sold out BIG-TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL!!!!!","review":"I woke up early on a Tuesday in August of 1991 just so I could buy the new, self-titled Metallica album. I went straight home, put it on and listened to the whole thing once...and never had a desire to listed to it again. For those of you who are considering buying this recording:YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED--THIS ALBUM IS A LOAD (PUN INTENDED) OF RADIO-ORIENTED CRAP! I have heard (unintentionally, mind you) snipets of later releases, and I have to say that Metallica's sound is very different from earlier releases, and this album was the turning point. If you think Master of Puppets and ..And Justice For All are the best metal albums you have ever heard, steer clear of this one. I blame producer Bob Rock (who produced Motley Crue, Bon Jovi) for this album--I blame Metallica for the others that came after it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked!","review":"I totally hated this album because There was so much hype involved with meatallica. This was my first metallica cd and I was totally amazed at what I heard. Critics said that thes guys were speed metal but in my opinion there not. The song writing and vocals were horrible as well as the repetitve and bad sounding guitars and put it all together and you got a shitty cd. So don't be a fool cause Metallica isn't cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This album is terrible. There are one or two okay tracks on it, but you can download those free on the net. For the most part, this thing is all about power: power ballads, power chords, power trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP-TALLICA","review":"Its basically come to this .. a band that was setting standards with metal innovation have fallen behind creatively - and they get rewarded with insane commercial success. So here you have dumb riffs that dont develop and weak songs from start to finish. Put that together with a super-glossy sounding production package and you have the biggest disappointment in music history. This album was created for one reason and one reason alone - sales. If Metallica had retained their integrity, they would have made a real metal album - not this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"We knew the great times couldn't last forever...","review":"This album is what made me lose all faith in the former gods of speed metal. I remember when I first bought it, and so excited for the first listen, I was quickly so disappointed!!! This piece of garbage should never have been released. A whole cd goes by without a redeeming second. If you want real metal, stick to Slayer, Testament, Megadeth, or even Manowar. This album is useless, get \\"Puppets\\" or \\"Lightning.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sellout album, but still good.","review":"This is a good cd, too bad they had to be stupid and sellout.

Confusing?","review":"Well, unless you're a REAL Metallica fan - Yes! But then again - who cares? Not me! A lot of my mates have slagged off Metallica, but none of them have actually heard them. So, if one album could turn them on to Metallica - It would be this one. The Unforgiven - YES! Enter Sandman - YES, OH YES! Nothing Else Matters - YES, OH YES, OH YES! In fact, all the tracks - OH YES (etc.) By the way, guess what one of my mates did. He had 1 of 12-made gold C.D'S of the black album - and what did he do? He gave it to a D.J to play in Africa, it wasn't played so my mate forgot about it, he forgot to pick it up at the end, the club shut down and my mate never got it back. DUH! Anyway, get one of the best albums of all time NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of it all...","review":"Metallica's mythical black album will not only be remembered for its great metal tunes and ballands. It will also be remembered for ushering a new era in metal. It brought forth and evolved the metal image as we see it today. It thrusted hard core metal into the main stream to the masses and it rocked! Perhaps this album will be remembered for what it did rather for how it sounds...though either reason is good enough to give it 5 stars. The beginning of it all...Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last heavy album","review":"This is an historical album, in the sense that it marked the crossover from heavy metal to more commercial pop metal. Not only for Metallica, but for a lot of other long-haired bands.The more I hear this album, the more I appreciate it. Not only the fantastic The Unforgiven and hits like Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters or Sad But True. In fact, most of the songs are quite good compositions. An experience from the greyzone between soft and hard.A historical album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning of the End","review":"This album was long anticipated, it came out, and anyone who was already a fan of Metallica had to be disappointed, I know I was.....this is the beginning of the end, forget anything after this point......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked awesome!!!!","review":"The black album is the best metallica CD if not the best CD of all time. From the awesome gutiar to the great singing this is one album that every metallica fan should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's Best Album Ever!","review":"This album was a extreme change in Metallica's musical style. It combined the heavy metal of the early years with the unique sound of the classical guitar. End result? A beautiful sound with a dark theme. Songs like \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"The Unforgiven\\", and especially \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" really send chills down my spine. \\"The Black Album\\" should have been their last album because it would have been a great way to end their illustrious career. At any rate, this album is a must for anyone who likes heavy metal, Metallica, or even classical music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the music and the feeling of the cd was outragoues","review":"Metallica put alot of feeling towards this particular album but in all acuality Marz Headlin used a suprizing 5 rifts in some these songs and also five rifts in And Justice For All."},{"rating":"2","title":"black history","review":"metallica are simply the best metal band in the world of the last 20 years.why?co's they keep reinventing themselfes on every album, like they did on this one.other bands come make a hit and than desapear,but metallica has been around for 25 years.they sold millions of albums whithout having a song, played on tv or in the radio.period:this album showed the world what the metal fans already knew they are the best!some say this is a more comercial album,i dont think so,it has got some of the heavy songs metallica ever made like 'sad but true'or the 'strungle whithin'.also got 5 number 1 chart songs:'enter sandman''sad but true''the unforgiven''nothing else matters'and 'wherever i may roam'.the millions of people that have this album cannot be rong:BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a kid.","review":"Only 14 year olds who like to pretend it's still 1991 (they weren't even alive) dislike this album because TR00 METAL FANZ tell them to. Everyone else who's a rock fan appreciates it. The old fans grew up and eventually outgrew that teenage nonsense to embrace this masterwork.This album is not for everyone. Some people would rather listen to untalented metal bands that nobody's ever heard of in order to maintain their \\"individuality.\\" They're sheep who restrain themselves with their insecurities.

Still a CD worth buying, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica - Metallica","review":"Metallica's 1991 release featuring \\"Enter Sandman\\" is a really good album. \\"Enter Sandman\\" is one you shouldn't miss.

It's Equal to\\"And Justice For All\\"","review":"Songs Like \\"Enter Sandman\\" And \\"Sad But True\\" Are Awesome And \\"The Unforgivin\\" is pretty good as is \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" but If your gonna buy this one you have to by \\"and Justice For All\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Good album but it lacks the flash of all the previous albums. I think it's because of Bob Rock.

Great riffs, melodies and special techniques. Great one!!! A must have in any collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is freaking the best","review":"WOW!!!! I liked this cd so much that after i got it i didn't stop listening to itI didn't think a metallica cd could top And Justice For ALL But this one did it"},{"rating":"2","title":"...And Metallica joins the mainstream","review":"I was torn on whether to give five or four stars to the band for this album. After long contemplation I opted for five. Here is my rationale. I think that we would all agree that this album was a huge commercial success for the band. With the help of Bob Rock they were able to cross the gap from metal stream to the main stream. Yes, they lost some of their edge and aggressiveness, but they gained more audience by diversifying their sound. I think that the biggest departure for them wasn't their music but rather lyrics. Instead of singing about social ills they came down to much more mundane topics. Well, that's true not only for Metallica but also for R.E.M., U2 etc. No matter what, it's still distinctively Metallica..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metalli-holic... and never goin' back!","review":"I just recently started listening to Metallica. At first I didn't think i'd like it, but (moms) IT'S MORE THAN JUST NOISE!!! Of the few Metallica cd's I have so far, this is my fave. #4, The Unforgiven is the best song on the cd! It's slower than most of the other songs and has an awesome sound. If you're new on Metallica and can't decide which one to make your first Metallica cd, I'd suggest this one. Reload is also a good one. Personally, I don't really like their early stuff. That's why I like this cd so much, because its a lot more mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something's missing......","review":"This album represents Metallica's commercial peak, but can it live up to their classic 80's albums? A reasonably close comparison proves, sadly, no. While working on excellent radio songs such as \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", the Sandmen have an unforgiven amount of songs that are half-baked in structure, and lyrically. \\"The Struggle Within\\" suffers from unbalanced, rushed choruses that are fugly to listen to, and some songs such as \\"through the never\\" \\"of wolf and man\\" are so pretentious, they will have diehards howling louder than the shape-shifting wolf.And then some of the songs are only as good as their (then) new approach will allow. What I mean is that this album is less electrifying than such Sandmen classics as Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets. I'll admit that it's mostly extremely well done, but the spark is missing...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports For All Sorts Was Great!!!","review":"The product was just like I remembered it from the first time I owned it, but Sports For All Sorts was awsome. They shipped quick, and the customer service was great!!! Thanks Sports For All Sorts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Album","review":"This cd is a favorite to many people. Played by a band known as Metallica \\"The Black Album\\" is by far one of their best. This 80s rock band blows other cds out of the water. The unique and head banging style of the guitar, bass, and drums in this cd is not even comparable to any cd out there other than another oof their own. The songs on this cd such as \\"Enter Sandman\\" is definitly a known hit rocked by this awesome band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Ten Years Later, It's Still Good...","review":"It is hard to believe this album came out in 1991. The Black Album is Metallica's best; past, present, and future. I must've listened to this CD a million times and never get tried of it. If you don't have this album yet, you're not a true 'tallica fan. If you do have this CD already, buy another one and put it away for the grandkids. They'll love it, too in 2091."},{"rating":"2","title":"You like it hard? This is HARD.","review":"MetallicA has always been a force to reckon with, this album proves this without a doubt. From the incredible force of Enter Sandman to the slower, yet still powerful Nothing Else Matters. Many say this is the greatest metal album ever made, I can't help but agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular.... The last good album Metallica put out. (Short review)","review":"Since Metallica has only put out 5 good albums (Kill 'em all, Master Of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, ...And Justice For All, The Black Album (being this one)), I will say that this album is for any metal fan. It is the album that proved all of Metallica's talent. The album starts off with a bang, and dosen't let up. I think that THE BLACK ALBUM might just be the best abum of the 90's. My favorite songs are \\"Enter Sandman, \\"Sad But True\\", \\"My Friend OF Misery\\", \\"The Struggle Within\\", \\"Of Wolf and Man\\", and \\"Through The Never\\". So forget that ST. ANGER crap, this is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call This Their Best?","review":"If you do, you're wrong. This is their first bad album, also their first sign of selling out with shorter songs and a new producer. Master Of Puppets and ..And Justice For All are far superior to this highly commercial bandwagon album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overated album in the history of anything","review":"The hype and hoohaa surrounding this album does not even come close to justifying the actual musical credibility of this album. Metallica's previous works were good (although overated aswell) but this album and all the hype surrounding it is responsible for the musical spiral in which this band will never climb out of.The logical conclusion is that rather than this being a natural evolution for the band, which this is clearly not, this album was written as a mass marketing tool, a sellout album. A natural progression would have this end up sounding similar to Meshuggah's Contradictions Collapse and None, a truely underated album by a band that plays real music, rather then metallica, an album equated to an advertising billboard appealing to the \\"cool\\" generation rather then on music and people who listen to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the bass guitar?","review":"I put off buying this for awhile - but finally gave in. At least on my system, it sounds like the bass guitar is hardly in the mix. I can hear the bass from the bass drum just fine - but comparing it to my regular CD (and the excellent DVD Video Cunning Stunts) the bass guitar is way down in the mix. This really takes a lot out of the music and makes it sound thin. I don't think I will play this very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enter Sandman is the Only Good Song","review":"Listen, I was born when this came out and Enter Sandman is one of my favorite songs.

I have not received a response to where my cd is? It has been 6 weeks since I placed the order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enter Sandman in the only good song!","review":"Wow, Metallica really hit rock bottom with this one. No wonder it bombed on the charts. Grant it, it's better than everything they made before it (Master Of Puppets is their worst), but that doesn't merit any respect. Enter Sandman is a pretty good tune, and Sad But True is ok, but it all falls apart after that. The guitar work is simply nueasiating. Check out Megadeath for some true music. If you want a better Metallica album, check out Garage Inc. It's sad, but they're only good when they play other artist's songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album sucks,sad but true!","review":"i bought this when it came out iwas horrified when i listened to it,i threw it off a bridge and watched a truck smash it , metallica died with cliff burton,he would have never played this wussy crap,and they go down hill with each release! this is not the metallica i discovered in 1983,this album sounds like stuff they used to make fun of,no thrash here! avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Metallica","review":"One word to describe this album? How about \\"brilliant\\"? while there are many other words that can summarize this cd, you really cant think of just one. I was pumped about getting this cd from one of my friends, and i felt even better after i heard it. Theres nothing better then a faster and harder song arrangment like \\"enter sandman\\", \\"sad but true\\" and \\"wherever i may roam\\" while mixed with slower (but still powerful) songs like \\"unforgiven\\" and \\"nothing else matters\\". this album doesnt stop there though. The Black Album doesnt sink at any point and i was glad that there were no instrumentals because those can get pretty boring. this cd is worth the money and 5 stars. even people who dont necessarily like metallica can easily find things in this piece of work that they will like. i look forward to hearing the rest of what metallica has written and u should too. ( i also recommend \\"master of puppets\\" and \\"ride the lightning\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica is awesome!","review":"I love metallica so much! This album just goes to show how much their music has evolved over the years, i think this is THE best album that metallica has released (well until st. anger comes out that is)every track has so much emotion in it, along with awesome guitar riffs/solos.

I have always been a big fan of Metallica, heavy music, and music from across the world and all cultures. These guys are one of the best at the genre, they tear through your eardrums with powerful guitar riffs, slamming drum rolls, and badder than evil vocals! This however is not their best piece but it is much better than saint Anger and I also like it more than load and re-load. This album is what brought them to the mainstream, but the real reason why I think this album is important because it turned people on to their past 4 smashing albums as well and that they were a cool band for years before the 90s rolled around.Don't get me wrong this is a great album with some very good tracks like Don't Tread on me and the classic sad but true! It is also sad but true this was their last really good album too, the 4 that came after it all fell pretty short but death magnetic came closeLater!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite 'Tally","review":"This is still my favorite 'Tally album.I can't stand all the \\"oh they sold out\\" blah blah blah.They made a great album - get over it!I wish they'd go back in this direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENTER NAPSTER","review":"For those of you that think Metallica is a good band and heavy,get alife.
