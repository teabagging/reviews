Unfortunately, for me, there's too much drum machine and not enough guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky, but not satisfying","review":"A typical example of the quirky electronic music the 80's seems to have been dominated by; the difference this time is the talent of lyricist and lead singer Stan Ridgway, whose bizarre little stories almost rise above the drum machines and repetitive electronica. I say almost because Ridgway is much more successful at getting his tales across on his solo works then this more than occasionally discordant CD. There are some good tunes here, particularly the insanely catchy \\"Mexican Radio\\" (\\"I wish I was in Tijuana, eating barbecued iguana\\" That is a great line!) and the title track, a fever dream trip to a very wild west. I find Ridgway's solo material more mature and interesting; unless you really wanted to hear \\"Mexican Radio\\" and his early work I would skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Mexican Radio","review":"Wall of Voodoo / Call of the West: \\"Mexican Radio\\" was the big radio hit but all the songs here are very good.

I have to say I wasn't disappointed. This is very good new wave with catchy tunes, good instrumentation and well crafted lyrics. The only reason I left off a star is because it is possibly the most depressing album I've ever heard. All the songs are about the futility and monotony of life.Like I say, it's a very good album, but I find myself not listening to it because it makes me want to kill myself (not really, but you get the idea)."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally","review":"I had been looking for this title on iTunes, but I guess they did not see a profit in making this music available.

However, a 30 GB, as I discoverd, is much slimmer and therefore does not fit snugly into the case. It probably won't fall out, but the screen doesn't stick to it completely.

It also features Tim O'Brien on half of these tracks. The following year these two would form the nucleus of the progressive bluegrass band Hot Rize. Fans of that band will find much here to enjoy.While much of this is essentially straight-ahead bluegrass, Wernick throws in a few new wrinkles--phase-shifted banjo here, a flute there, even a synthesizer on one track (\\"Wichita Lineman\\"). As Tony Trischka says in the liner notes: \\"The thing that knocks me out is Pete's ability to work within a bluegrass context and still come up with new sounds.\\"Though he may not be as well known as fellow banjo pickers Bela Fleck, Bill Keith or Tony Trischka, Wernick is one of the instrument's major innovators.

I like disc 1 of this two disc compilatiion the best. Each band on this comp has its own distinct set of influences and its own sound, but as a whole this comp is very well done with the \\"American Indie-Pop\\" theme constant throughout. A lot of the songs could be described as cute or twee. It could also be called low-power pop, though a few of the bands here are fans of distortion and lots of it.The second disc doesn't quite measure up to the quality of the first, but there a couple songs on it which are good. This comp only gets 4 stars because there are many tracks which I don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"arnold turner","review":"Very disappointing. This is a brief treatment of a vital subject.

The design of the map is at flaw. Rather than capturing the majority of JAX on one side, the printers made it so that half of JAX is on one side, half on the other. If they had printed it horizontally, rather than vertically, one would be able to view all of JAX on one side of the map. The map is an absolute no for wall or flat hanging.

I was most suprised that even the teenagers who had never heard of him before were sitting down to watch. Victor Borge is a one of a kind performer that only comes along once in a lifetime. I have seen him live and on TV, and even though I know what he is going to say, I still laugh. His comedic timing and touch at the piano are legendary, and something you never get tired of seeing or hearing.

Good quality, easy to transfer to my Tivo.I think Mark Snow's music in this episode is really what makes it. I especially love the harpsichord creepily playing the first few notes of Bing Crosby's \\"I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas\\" when they pry up the floorboards, a VERY subtle musical callback to the song that's playing when they pull up in their cars at the very beginning of the episode.

I decided to give this door brace a chance and ordered one. It is heavier and sturdier than I expected. It was easy to change the length to the one I needed. If someone is able to push the door in without a great deal of effort, breaking the frame, etc., then the length and angle weren't correct. It may take some adjusting, but this brace works very well and is extremely sturdy, especially with the high quality pin that comes with it. I don't think it would work well on carpeting though. I am back at this site to order a second one for my back door. This is a great product for peace of mind, especially at this price.Mace 80115 MACE Big Jammer Door Brace"},{"rating":"1","title":"better than nothing (I suppose ;-)","review":"The item seems to be rather poorly designed. The upper end cap isn't nearly wide enough to properly accept my door knobs. This allows a couple inches of play (before door meets any serious resistance). Another thing I don't like is the angle of the brace. I would much prefer a wider angle between the door and the base/foot of the brace. I realize that the bar is adjustable in length. However, if the bar is lengthened (the angle increased), the foot will not sit flat on the floor (it'll be cocked up with only the heel touching).It's clearly better than nothing. And, I've modified it (cut and filed), so that it works better than it did. But, I still don't have much confidence in it.I'd gladly return it for a refund, except that I've modified it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little piece of mind","review":"I wanted to see if it would work so I undid my two locks and just placed this on the knob.

After reading the technical readouts on various websites, I purchased this JVC Player for this particular ability. Additionally, the gold finish went well with my Sony WEGA. At first, the DVD player worked fine. However, after three months, this JVC started skipping on DVDs (New and Rented)and as a matter of fact, once, it completely jammed. It made a terrible sound (sort of like my DVD was being completely destroyed) and I was forced to unplug it and replug it back in. There was indeed some damage to my DVD. Now (about 8 months after purchase...I've been lazy about bringing it into a service center), it cannot go completely through one DVD without skipping.

The troubleshooting provided by JVC's web site did not solve the problem. It just caused more frustration because the machine responded to the onscreen troubleshooting, but nothing changed in its inability to play DVDs.I found JVC to be highly customer unfriendly because the customer service available by phone can tell you nothing about solving problems with the machine (types of problems, costs of service), offers no understanding, and merely points you to a list of service centers.Added note: I doubt the cleanliness of my machine or DVD condition affected its functioning.

But after finishing the book you see how important it is that it's all in there, because it makes you adore Black Gold even more! This is a true story about a determined racer and a jockey who loves him so much he'll do anything to be with him, and a determined old trainer who made a big mistake.... It's amazing for any horse lover and I 100% gaurantee you'll love this book! If you don't love horses, you might find yourself really getting into them after this.

A young boy named Jaydee who wants to be a jockey enters the picture and we watch both colt and child grow up, one to be a racehorse and one to be his jockey. So much fun to read, it makes me forget the sad ending, but you dwell on the determination and courage of Black Gold in his last race to help ease the pain. Young and old should enjoy this coming-of-age classic and thrill to the world of horse racing, and the love between a boy and his mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children and adults will find a new hero in Black Gold","review":"Black Gold is a heartwarming story about an undersized thoroughbred everyone said would not make it in the racing world.

Instead of simple ABAB structures they unleash something completely unexpected three-quarters of the way into a song and it will blow you away. While \\"Domestiques is definitely less Baroque than \\"Peloton\\", its craft is apparent. In a way, it's hard to imagine they all got kicked out of other bands because they couldn't play.

Several compilations were made from this superb material, such as those mentioned in the review posted above. In essence, it is one of the very first samba-jazz recordings, which has launched a new approach to Bossa Nova and opened up the scene for several other great Brazilian jazz musicians, including J.T. Meirelles, Eumir Deodato, Roberto Menescal etc. This CD represents a historical moment. A five-star and MUST HAVE recording if you are Brazilian Jazz, Bossa Nova or MPB fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Bistros","review":"This book does not go beyond a superficial description of the interiors of the bistros.

So entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"First off, yes this is the guy from Back to the Future; which he tackles in the opening moments of the special.Now his brand of comedy won't be for the younger crowd because some of the jokes relate to being in your 40's and being a parent. There are also a lot of pop culture references that today's youth wouldn't understand.Now understand that I'm 28, so by no stretch of the imagination am I the target age demographic but I can appreciate the jokes none the less.With that said, it's not one of the best comedy specials I've seen but it does have it's moments that stick with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories of a Kansas publicity hack","review":"The spine says Four Star Press, it should say One Star.

If you're interested in legends such as Peggy Rea and Julie Warner, which stars come from the Kansas City area or publicity events like the Kansas City Tap Challenge, this book comes highly recommended.

Not exactly realistic but clear and uncluttered, not an exagerated cartoonish style of so many children's books. the text and story line are creative. The rhyming and rhythem are fun. But why does everything always go wrong in these books? My son doesn't like them for this reason. All of the sheep books are theme he should like but he doesn't enjoy them at all because calamity after calamity and then the story ends. No fun times or successes. Problems, a few solutions and promlems. Nothing to attract him to the books. He does enoy stories where their is a problem or a challenge and then solutions. Anyway, I wish he like them because they are nicely illustrated and creative. Just too negative and a little scary. this review could be for any of the series, whether the jeep wrecks, the storm aboard ship and subsequent sinking of the ship (and why are they pirates?!), lost in the woods and rained on...etc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and realistic story about a group hike","review":"This book is a hit with the 3-year-old I gave it to and with me.

And I love cartoons/animes, so it was good to see a longer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"It looks good","review":"I saw about 10 minutes of this at the San Diego Comic Con this year and it looks good.

Dracula's remains have been stored in a cemetery in Gotham City for hundreds of years, only to be mistakenly unearthed by Oswald Cobblepot, otherwise known as the Penguin. The Penguin unknowingly unleashes the forces of darkness upon fair Gotham and the Batman is the only one who can stop him.Released prior to Halloween 2005, this dvd is a great addition to the Batman legend.

Clear prove that Warner's animation and their DVD work is a bloody joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This movie is a poor execution of a lazy concept. The entire plot is one cliche after another, predictable to the point of being unintentionally funny. The movie even throws in a few cliche plot points that aren't even relevant to the plot, as if the writer just like them enough to want to include them. The dialog is filled with just the sort of ham you'd imagine, but it's so uninspired that it's devoid of any fun. There's nothing interesting or creative about how Dracula is portrayed, or anybody else in the film for that matter.This movie also features the worst portrayal of Batman I've ever seen. He comes off as being really dumb, and socially clumsy when not in costume. Overall, he actually comes off as being a bit girly at times. Some character development or backstory for him is hinted at occasionally, but never actually made part of the story.Overall, there's really nothing about it to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!","review":"What were they thinking? This is the worst Batman version that I ever saw. Please, folks, leave this alone and get anything else.

It was just perfect for my digital camera. I couldn't find a case that would not only carry, but protect my camera. Most of the cases out there for small digital cameras are nylon--and if I dropped it with my camera inside, it would very easily become toast. This case has some stiffness on the outside that gives my camera a lot more protection.I liked this case so much that I bought a couple more for my mini disc player and MP3 player.I only wish they came in more colors that the three offered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful low-priced edition for serious study","review":"This edition is perfect for serious study for anyone willing to confront the New Testament appreciatively but critically. Though low-priced, it is very extensively annotated and cross-referenced, more than the Harper-Collins Study Bible and much more than the Oxford Annotated Bible. It is a Catholic version with the imprimatur of the Vatican, but is very scholarly and self-critical. For example, regarding Jesus' entry into Jerusalem where Matt. 21:5-7 describes Jesus as riding on both an ass and a colt fulfilling the prophecy of Zech. 9:9, this edition points out that only one animal was involved, and the duplication was a Hebrew literary device (parallelism), and \\"that Matthew takes them as two is one of the reasons why some scholars think that he was a Gentile rather than a Jewish Christian who would presumably not make that mistake.\\" The edition also has very extensive study guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"After purchasing what I thought was a new Leapster Game System for my grandaughter, I found out it was really used.

On one hand, the story that is the backbone of this film is interesting - the effects of childhood abuse and isolation. On the other hand, the screenplay is horribly written. The characters are completely unlikable, and the only one you feel sorry for is the dog (which might not even be real!). And don't even get me started on production value. In which backwoods town does this take place? The cops look like incompetent morons, everyone drives twenty year old cars, the busses look like they have been running since the seventies. The acting is horrible too - did nobody learn how to emote? Overall, the only good thing about this whole film is the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, With Glitches","review":"Thr3e is a rare movie. It has some amazing, little known actors.

Then I heard that it was out in a movie and was pretty excited about that. I guess the best thing I can say is if you have read the book then at least the names are the same. Other than that this movie was really of no resemblance what so ever. It was full of bad acting and I just wasted an hour and a half of my life that I wish I could get back. I don't think the script writers even read the book and Ted Dekker should be ashamed of himself to let this have his name on it. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Well, I was in the mood for something different and not mainstream, and since I've never heard of this movie it did a great job of whetting my appetite. It wasn't something completely different, the plot and the reveal have been done a thousand times in other movies, but it mixed it up enough to keep things fresh and enjoyable.This is the story of Kevin, a seminary student working on his final thesis. His life changes when a riddling psycho calls demanding that he confess his sins. From there, Kevin must find out who it is before the psycho kills everybody in Kevin's life. With the help of his childhood friend and a cop, he begins thinking that the killer may not be who he originally thinks it is.In the end, I found it entertaining and well worth the time to watch, though I can't imagine myself doing it again sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"uplifting harmonies","review":"The first three tracks on this cd alone will make you happy you purchased it. Beatitudes starts with \\"blessed are..\\" and no matter how bad your case of the blues, you will raise your head by the end of the song. Run, Run, Mourner Run showcases not only the separate harmonies working together but a playful interaction with the live audience as well. Wade in the Water is a fluid, soulful rendition of this church song. All of the good reasons you might go to church are contained in these songs. The cd continues with adventurous harmony, political statements and rises to climactic endings as in Our Side Won. No one can beat their arrangements and voices working together - truly the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And in this case the parts are excellent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied with Live at Carnegie Hall","review":"I have seen Sweet Honey in the Rock perform live and enjoyed them tremendously.

Of course, the exercises are the most valuable part of the book. I would really like to have this book, but it is unusable in its current Kindle form.Question: Doesn't anybody at the publishing house test these things on Kindle before they release them on an unsuspecting world? The fact that a thing is available for Kindle would suggest to the normal mind that it is formatted for Kindle and works for Kindle, particularly something from a professional publisher.

Well, the PSP version of the game is better than the GBA version and trust me it is the more nervewracking of the two PSP remakes. For one thing, it has a unique way of leveling characters which can prove to be quite innovating for the player. Nonetheless, the game can either be easy or hard depending on how you want to play the game. In my opinion, this game is for those that not only never experience Final Fantasy II or are hardcore fanatics that know what this is all about. Other than that, this is a very good game and regardless I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intuitive","review":"For it's time at least. Now a days not so much. But the game is easier than it was back on the nintendo days.The leveling system is pretty cool, if not a small pain in the ass.

First, you can only play on courses that use one foot marked flags. This is because you have to sight in on the green and then count the number of marks up on the flag.

This DVD has THE worst quality image and sound I have ever seen in a DVD.

Mike reveals the message of God enjoying us and that we can have passion for God just as he has passion for us. Knowing how God truly feels about us is how we have passion for Him.

The revelation that this book brings will change your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passionate but Shallow","review":"Mike Bickles shows us that being passionate about Jesus and writing about that passion are two different things.

My advice: look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and thought provoking","review":"I'd been praying and asking God to open my eyes to his love for me because, honestly, I just didn't feel it. This book led me to scriptural truths about His love for me and my prayers are being answered. It was wonderful, He spoke His love for me through a co-worker I barely know.

There are two problems - switch life is 2 years or less depending how often its used. The float rod is regular steel and rusts causing the float to stick, which causes the pump to stay on or off. I can't figure why Wayne would make a great pump with lousy parts. Yup I can typical American manufacturer; no life testing and poor quality control. Recommend you stay away from Wayne pumps.

I have been working with ASP.NET since the release of Beta 2 of ASP.NET 1.0. I started reading this book today and have realized that the content is based on the Beta.

The book does assume familiarity with ASP.NET 1.x. This was a positive feature for me, as Dino calls out the salient differences that will need to be considered in migrating a 1.x code base. Other reviews note that English is a second language for Dino. I did not find this to be an issue. It's not English literature, it's a technical book, and Dino's writing is just fine for that task.The book is based on Beta 1.

While this album contains some classic Camel sound, there are also some pleasant surprises. As always, there is a lot of great guitar playing by Andy Latimer. In addition, Andy plays more flute than usual on this album. In places, the flute playing is reminiscent of Ian Anderson. The album also features Guy LeBlanc's fine keyboards. Five of the seven songs are more than 7 minutes long, with the title track clocking in at more than 11 minutes. This album is not as melancholy as Camel's other recent albums. In particular, \\"Fox Hill\\" is very upbeat. If you like melodic symphonic rock, you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Gods Smile Down","review":"Joe John Santafripponi's seal of approval.

There are no clunkers here and I am giving it four stars simply to differentiate it from African-music Rough Guides that give me more pleasure (e.g., the Congolese Soukous).

This is an autobiography of a man who rose through the ranks of the Corps and his personal experiences during that time. There is nothing about the current war or the current administration. I kept reading it, even though, when I was half-way through it, he had only reached 1991 and I was having my doubts that he would ever get to the indictment I was looking for.

While General Zinni was a truly outstanding Marine Corps officer he's no writer and his story suffers for this. At the conclusion of this book I had one question I kept asking, what was the real subject of this book as it meanders through Zinni's professional career from a young lieutenant through the multitude of staff jobs. While the points Zinni wants to make about integrity, speaking out, leadership could have been presented in a paragraph they are slowly, and with every imaginable military acronym, described in unimaginative detail.

Zinni's interviews on the book misled me profoundly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prostitution, vanity press and false advertising","review":"This book brings to mind the words \\"prostitution\\" and \\"Vanity Press\\". Tom Clancy clearly prostituted himself by selling his name to a book he apparantly only skimmed and certainly didn't write, and \\"Vanity Press\\" because this book could not have been published without Clancy's name. Not only is the book poorly written, but it is little more than the constant drumbeat of Zinni's ego. While I am sure that anyone who earns 4 stars is a fine military officer, I am not interested in reading the litany of their \\"Glory Days\\" ramblings. To add insult to injury the book never delivers on the advertised Iraq/Vietnam analysis. The only part worth reading is the brief final chapter \\"The Calling\\"--but do it in the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Radically Bad Departure for Clancy Fans","review":"Readers of Tom Clancy will not appreciate Clancy's radical departure from his normally conservative and common-sense style of writing. Retired Gen Zinni is a warrior diplomat who disagreed with the Bush Administration on the decision to attack Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein from power. He is in the minority of the military establishment and their support for the war, but he did strike a cord with Tom Clancy who, as he continually states, finds no \`casus belli' or reason to go to war.So, if you disagree with the Bush administration and want to \`pile on' read the book. Reader's looking for Clancy's normal fare should avoid this book and see if he returns to his writing conservative action novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"As a former member of the US Military it was my great pleasure to serve under General Zinni. He has impeccable credentials. As a conservative I find his outlook sobering. Partisans may knock the book, but they can only knock it as partisans, not as informed. I support President Bush, but not those who have failed in their leadership at the Pentagon.Zinni and Tom Clancy weave a classic and judging by it's reception with members of the military, it is on target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy's and Tony Zinni's Battle Ready","review":"Good book.

First of all this clipper will heat up to the can't touch at the head end of it at all (half the way through). Second it does not cut the dogs hair to my satisfaction. It certainly does not do well enough to do half of one large dog without heating up. It has been properly maintained, but doesn't even measure up to the job that my 30 year old Oster does that I had purchased many years ago to do kids hair.

The author does a good job of describing many of the features of Frontpage, but the coverage is not in depth.

Don't rely exclusively on the vendor's reviews and reader's feedback.To me, this book presented just an overview of too many subjects (ADO, ActiveX, ASP, etc).

Kivy doesn't presume any prior musical or philosophical training on the reader's part, so this is highly readable. If you are new to the field, whether you are a philosopher, a musician, or neither (I am a philosophy student with some music training), you will still find something of interest in this book --- Kivy tackles philosophically interesting issues that all music lovers must have wondered about at some point or other. Whether you agree with what he says, he writes clearly and makes thought-provoking, intelligent points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kivy","review":"This book was used as a text in my philosophy of music class. The professor chose the text because she knew that we would be opposed to his views. He barely deals with vocal music at all, claiming that it is not \\"pure music\\" because it has text. When dealing with opera, he feels the \\"problem with opera\\" is the fact that it is not cyclical. He mentions that when opera was first introduced that emotions were thought to be cyclical, and opera to the best of it's ability tried to accomidate that. However, it the mid 18th century that was discovered not to be the case and it was realized that emotions are linear. Just because the history of music has cyclical background does not mean that with this discovery it should remain as such. Linear and cyclical writing are tools used by a composer to convey certain emotions or to help define an event. Overall I felt Kivy was too verbose. If I were not a music major, I would have found it hard to truly understand what he was talking about"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great set for the money","review":"If you don't want to spend allot of $$$ on one of these grill sets; this is the way to go.

Even if your not interested in tennis as a sport, just like Mario Golf, you'll enjoy playing this fun filled tennis game.

Great game Well Done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing good fun","review":"Ten minutes into this title, and it's easy to see why the older Mario games still fetch a high price on ebay half a decade later. Mario Tennis is a perfected version of classic video game tennis featuring a Mario all-star cast. Play as everyone from Mario to Bowser to Donkey Kong Jr., and also Waluigi and Daisy, who were introduced/re-introduced with this game. You get the rules of real-life tennis, smattered with some power-up moves, and lots of tournaments and modes to compete in. It's the gameplay that's the real kicker; by yourself you'll have a reasonably good time unlocking stuff, but with four players in a doubles tournament it becomes absolute madness. Controls are tight, and the gameplay allows both experienced gamers and newcomers onto the court.Nintendo may have eventually over-milked the 'Mario sports' sub-genre, but the Nintendo 64 version of Mario Tennis is a solid investment. Still worth picking up if you want a fun sports game."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most entertaining sports game","review":"this game is for everybody!

In this game even more characters are featured. I was quite shocked that they even have quite a few different tennis courts. There are even a few mini-games feautured, which helps to extend the replay value. The multiplayer mode is quite polished. I really enjoyed playing doubles in multiplayer mode. Teamwork is critical in doubles mode. I was also amazed that the characters all had their own attributes, and it is suprising that Mario Golf's characters feature so much variety. The Cup Mode is fun, but this game is all about multiplayer mayhem.

The truth is if you are only one person playing in your family don't buy it. I beat the game in 3 days. But my family plays with me so I like it. The music sounds very good. The only bad thing about this game is the voices of the players, like when they serve they make sound like Manaca Selles. Nasty noises made by every character.

I agree with a previous reviewer that these two were too much of a mismatched pair. I couldn't figure out why they were together except the sex was good for them. There was no chemistry. Sad that this will be someone's first and last Martin novel, because there are so many others of hers out there that are so good. I would urge anyone reading this as their first Martin story to at least try one more before making any decisions about not reading her ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark...","review":"I got this only because I felt that Michael and Theresa needed more and I wasn't done reading about them. I didn't care for Gemma in this one at all and the witch thing totally turned me off. She didn't fit with Sean. They weren't endearing at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read as part of the collection","review":"I'm not at all in agreement with the negativity I see in some of the other reviews of this book. Yes, if taken out of the context of her other novels in this series, this might not meet an expectation or two. But having that benefit, I couldn't wait to read Gemma's story. Having a mother very much like hers, and a grandmother that had the same medical condition and symptoms, it was easy to put myself in her shoes. I loved that she also explored the whole firehouse culture as well. And, it's a great spin off of her first two books, with cameos of past charaters it is good to hear from again. I've read every one of this series, and can't wait for Anthony's story to come out in January '08."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I didn't like this book as much as some of the previous ones in this series. But overall it was a good book and definitely worth reading. My two favorite stories in this series were Janna's and Terry's. You don't need to read all of the books but it does help explain who some of the other characters are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the first book I've read by Deidre Martin, and it will be the last. The two central characters are believable personalities, but definately not a believable couple. They are so mismatched that I couldn't bring myself to even finish the book. I tried, I even made myself read more than 200 pages before I gave up, and I don't think I've ever done that before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I really enjoyed the other books I read by this author, but this one was a BIG disappointment! First off, the lead characters sleep together almost immediately - which would have been fine if I had sensed some sort of great passion between them. The whole book left me cold, and almost depressed, as one thing after another prevented these 2 from getting together. If I had wanted to read something sad and drama-filled, I would NOT have chosen a 'supposed' romantic read. NOT what I was hoping! Not sure if I'll read this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Page Turner!","review":"This is the fourth Diedre Martin romance I've read, and I have to say the worst. The chemistry between the two main characters, Sean and Gemma, is barely believable. I've read authors that can take a man and a woman at opposite ends of the spectrum and, with really great characterization, circle them around to one another until they -quite believably- fall in love and head toward a long life together. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a master at this. Dierdre Martin is not. Beyond that, be prepared for scene after scene where the two main characters don't interact. The subplots are too thick and too boring. I agree, if this is your first Dierdre Martin novel, don't give up hope. The others aren't this bad. I did end up finishing this, but only because I'm obsessive compulsive about finishing what I start, not because the book is a page turner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO Disappointing!","review":"I enjoyed the previous two books by this author so I was eagerly awaiting the publication of this one. Unfortunately this book is horrible. There is no story, the characters are boring and the entire \\"romance\\" was forced.Gemma and Sean spend the entire book realising they aren't right for each other AND IT'S TRUE! Then there is a lame substory about Gemma being a witch that is never really explored.I could go on, but the only thing really left to be said is don't buy this book. It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"This book is just another trashy romance novel, unfortunately. The characters lack depth and the story is basically just a conglomeration of different opportunities to describe another sex scene. The story is not even compelling enough to wade through the tacky cliched love scenes, and finishing the book is a task to the patient reader. This book's only redeeming quality is the colorful cast of characters- if they had been more fully developed this story might have been more worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended. Too much family drama, not enough romance.","review":"Overall I thought this book really missed the mark. First of all, too much of the story focused on her crazy family -- a horribly mean mother and a grandmother who needs so much care that it sucks the life out of everyone. It wasn't at all interesting, and worse it wasn't even intrical to the romance story. Just depressing. Then there was a LONG break in the romance - at least 100 pages. He was a bit of a jerk and an idiot, and not the typical romance novel heart throb. She and him were not a good fit, no matter how hard the author tried to make the \\"opposites attrack\\" concept work. I could never believed for a second their romance would ever work. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"This third book of Deirdre Martin's proves once again what a fabulous writer she is. Total Rush is the continuation of her series (however each book can stand alone!) with the heroine being Gemma Dante (Michael's cousin)! The quirky owner of a new age store in NYC happens to have a hot new neighbor, firefighter Sean Kennealy! Everything sure heats up when her fun and witty life blazes right into Sean's fireman brotherhood life! Deirdre does a wonderful job having opposites attract while making the entire story believable as well as loving and caring.The chemistry with these two characters is so hot and the emotion will make your got churn then smile. You can't help but laugh at the perfect ways she captivated many fireman's lives! My words simply do not book this the justice it deserves. The main word that comes to mind is simply FABULOUS! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Drag","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I liked her first book, and I thought the second was ok. When I read the back of this one I thought it looked good. I'm a witch, a major hockey fan, and I come from a big Italian-Irish family filled with cops and firefighters. Those are the themes of this book, so I thought I'd love it. Wrong! It was really terrible. Ms. Martin is actually a good writer, but this story was so uninteresting. Gemma and Sean hook up and get physical way too soon. They have nothing in common and can't communicate so they break up. Then they are broken up for over a 100 pages while Gemma deals with some pretty serious family issues. Of course, they eventually get back together, but my question is why? All they seem to have in common is sex. This is not my idea of romance. I honestly can't see these two actually having a real relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin Scores Again!","review":"This is the third book I've read by Deirdre Martin, and I can't wait for more. I was a little nervous when I started this one--a witch and a fireman? But Martin works, well, magic. It's funny and touching and real. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a can't-put-it-down read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new book by Deirdre Martin","review":"This time the hero is no hockey player, but a firefighter. Sean Kennealy is Gemma Dante's (cousin of Michael Dante, hero in Fair Play) neighbor and has so his problems with Gemma's Wiccan beliefes, especially with her burning incencses. But also they have some troubles at the beginning they soon come together. Everything seems okay till Gemma gets problems with Sean's being a firefighter plus some other problems.The book is as much a fun read as Body Check and Fair Play was. It's a really good book.Too bad that the reader as to wait till early 2006 till the next book by Deirdre Martin will be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is A Disappointment","review":"I thought from the topics covered, and the approach to the topic, that this book had significant potential. However, it was so poorly executed, I stopped reading without even getting halfway through.Much of the discussion that takes place in the so-called \\"case studies\\" include opinions of people who are writers, journalists, psychologists, etc, who have made no special study of ethics or morality. If I want the opinions of average people, I can talk to my friends.I was hoping this book would have some insight, and to a certain extent, this is provided in the first section. But beyond that, this book is of little use. I will need to look elsewhere for a good book on this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners Only","review":"While this book had a lot of potential, it doesn't live up to it.

It was about time they had a chance to show their talent. Tsotsi is the story of a young boy of a township orphaned by AIDS and struggling with instinct and reflexes to survive. Caught in a whirlpool of violence, theft and murder, he eventually finds himself confronted with... a baby. The baby is the embodiment of all the love he lost early. As usual, one can cope with poverty if one has a minimum of love. Every single scene is a shock generating intense questions and wishes. As a mother, I felt my maternal cord vibrating throughout the film! Anyway you don't need to be a mother to vibrate at the film. Anyone, any age, any colour or white people can identify to Tsotsi's feelings because they are universal. Er... the BNP might object he committed a murder and feel nothing for him. Is there redemption? I can't say more. Don't miss the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Oscar goes to . . . .","review":"\\"Tsotsi\\" is the 2006 Oscar Award winning feature for Best Foreign Film. I got an opportunity to see the film after its re-release at a local independent film venue. The film is an intense depiction of a South African street criminal whose hardened exterior is softened by the power of love. After Tsotsi jacks a car he discovers a baby securely strapped in back. Unsure what to do with the child, Tsotsi takes on the role of provider and in doing so begins to reconcile the trauma of his own childhood. An excellent film and story. Commendable performances by Terry Pheto and Presley Chweneyagae. The soundtrack rocks as well.

The coverking is well fitted and not difficult to put on. The elastic all around the bottom ensures the cover doesn't get blown around by all the wind we have in the Bay Area. The silver color is nice since it doesn't heat up as well - a plus in sunny California! The Integra exhaust is not covered by the car cover, so i don't have to worry about a hot exhaust melting the cover. The rear-view mirror extensions make it easy to line up the cover before pulling it tight. I especially liked the extra plastic grommet that was included so we could poke a hole for the antenna if needed; on our car the antenna does not always retract properly so this was a nice feature. It appears to be made of a more durable material than most outdoor product covers I've bought before (grills, etc) so I hope it will last a long time. time will tell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only order this cover if you want your finish scratched","review":"Bought cover for my cherry 99 Acura Integra coupe to cover it while I was on 6 week trip to Asia.

If that's your case GO AND BUY IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serrat sublime","review":"Reconozco que no he escuchado toda la discografia de Serrat, pero debo decir que este disco (de 1971, en la primera etapa de su carrera) me parece casi tan bueno como Dedicado a Antonio Machado, son diez canciones extraodinarias con grandes melod��as y letras superlativas. Si tengo que elegir mis temas favoritos de este disco, pondr��a a Mediterr��neo (uno de los mejores homenajes jamas escritos al Mare Nostrum), Pueblo Blanco (ese homenaje a todos los pueblos que van desapareciendo), Que va a ser de ti (sobre una joven que se va de su casa paterna, una tematica similar al She's Leaving Home de los Beatles aunque mejor), y Vencidos (conmovedor tema basado en un poema de Leon Felipe referido al Quijote). Pero repito, todas las canciones son buenas, de hecho, varios temas de este disco se han mantenido en el repertorio en concierto de Serrat casi cuatro d��cadas despues."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind!!","review":"Serrat paints pictures with his words, voice and music in the way other artists use canvas and color.

I was first exposed to this recording in a high school Spanish class. I was blown away. Through some difficulty, I eventually came to own the LP. My comprehension of the lyrics has faded, but my appreciation for the music has not. Serious ear candy. It's amazing stuff to these very American ears.

In between these are some wonderful tunes, and some not so perfect songs (Sidi Brahim being one that I don't much enjoy).Renbourne is a major figure in the world of folk music and he is a very capable guitarist (though not very flashy). His backing band here is very high caliber and the tabla (Indian drum) is a great addition to the group.If you like Altan, Willian Ackerman, and Niel Young (like me), you should give this record a listen. It will be worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"Lighter should be training pigeons, not children. Her slight book offers unrealistic, simplistic examples of interactions with children, has a self-important author's voice, and little compassion. She suggests making an adolescent coming home late spend the night in the garage, for example. If I were that adolescent I would have a key to let myself in the house, but subjected to this kind of life, I might choose to move elsewhere. Basically the author is devoted to the concept of positive reinforcement with total parental control. More caring, respectful paths are described in other books. The trees to make this book were wasted. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third in a recommended set","review":"Ron Smith's third volume in his highly-recommended set of Chicago chart books, following the 1960-1969 and 1970-1979 volumes. Again, though, I've given this must-have book four stars for one striking omission. Smith does identify every tune to reach Chicago's WLS weekly music survey through the end of the charts in mid-1990 by title and artist, along with the debut and peak dates, highest position reached and weeks on the survey, along with the top songs of each year and the entire decade. What is missing is a listing of the number ones week-by-week or at the very least some indication of how many weeks a given number one hit spent at the top. Still, this is an essential reference for those whose interest in the charts extends beyond merely the national Hot 100. Here's hoping that some other people with access to source material get the same idea and do similar works on some of the other regional markets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this company!","review":"Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.

It shows how to do a few martial arts moves in the back of the book, which is one of the few good points of the book. 12 year olds and younger might want to read this book, but I don't recommend it to anyone above that age.

I had to take it down a curb and it almost tipped over.

When the infant carriers are strapped in the 3rd seat (jump seat) does not work. Specifically, the seat closest to the handles leans back too far into the jump seat making it impossible for a child to sit back there. They would slouch forward. The stroller is also huge but i expected that. I wish it worked for us but it just didn't. My friend who also has 3 kids (11 mo twins and a 2 yr old) loves this stroller though. She doesn't use the carriers. I guess if you don't want to use the carriers the stroller might be your best bet. Without using infant carriers, this stroller is not conducive to newborns or small infants. I really need something now so I can get put of the house.

I would have to complain about the way you attach/remove the trays/seat holder rails. The are rather hard to get on and off. The steering could use a little work as well.

It also had a much harder edge the previous albums. The majority of the stand-out tracks are on the first half of this CD. \\"Romeo Is Bleeding\\" is an excellent song, but fans who like the Rock & Soul blend Hall & Oates are famous for will find the song a little harsh & heavy on the electric guitar. \\"Love Out Loud,\\" \\"Out Of The Blue,\\" and \\"Hold On To Yourself,\\" follow the same pattern, but to a lesser degree. \\"The Sky Is Falling,\\" \\"Throw The Roses Away,\\" and \\"Promise Ain't Enough\\" also stand out and remind me a lot of classic ballads like Sara Smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"Every now and then something surprises you and this was it for me.

Instead what I find is a, although structured, very unconvincing book. Not to mention in the few areas that he talks on Buddhism, he just has an assertion with no evidence to back it up. While he does recommend many other books at the end of sections of his book, this seems to be very distracting. And when he talks on politics, it just feels so... I am not to sure how to describe it. An attempt to be comprehensive, but falling VERY short of it even being worth reading. The most interesting part of the book, to me, was his personal story of how he became an atheist.

Especially with games as fun as Pokemon Puzzle League. It's a basic and familiar premise: match up 3 or more blocks of the same color and watch them disappear. Based on this simple idea, several different types of 1-player modes were created, as well as a 2-player mode. All are fun to play, and some of the 1-player modes are quite challenging.Now about my addiction... err... the possibility of addiction... If you constantly play this game (espceially the 1-player mode), you will get too good at it, and the challenge, as well as the fun, will be lost. Fortunately for you, this should take many many months during which you will enjoy several games with your friends and by yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best puzzle game ever","review":"I would just like to say that this is the best puzzle game I've ever played.I have rented this game only once, but about 5 minutes playing and it was my favorite puzzle game. The 1-player modes are excellent.The main mode is a game were you play as Ash Ketchum(the main character from the TV series)as he climbs up the ranks,defeating Gym Leaders,his rival Gary and a few of his friends before facing the Puzzle Master himself.For hardcore puzzle gamers,there's an alternate 1-player game called Spa Service,where Team Rocket steals your Pokemon and you must eliminate all blocks above the flashing line,while the blocks are constantly rising.There's also a 2-player mode featuring 3 different modes of play.Tons of practice exercises can help advance even the newest puzzle gamer.The game is recommended to anyone who likes Pokemon,Tetris Attack or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"tetris on speed only more competitive","review":"My roommates in college and I played this every day for a semeseter. Some of our friends bought N64 just for this game. The Pokemon element is annoying and has nothing to do w/ the game and only makes people look at you funny when you try to tell them how cool the game is. Were this Mario's puzzle league it would probably have the name recognition Dr Mario enjoyed. the folks at nintendo botched this one. If you play this long enough you almost enter the matrix so to speak, you can set up huge combos, the head to head 2d mode is my favorite and it's a blast to play w/ your friends. Drinking a little when you play seems to help too.

It illustrates how expectations on women, especially those of lower economic status, can cause hardships for young women. Carmen sets many stereotypical expectations on Anna as to how a proper Latina girl should act and grow as a woman. Anna, on the other hand, wants no part in domestication, and to be looked upon as an object for men. She realizes she's very curvy, but finds that she does not have to hide this just to be noticed by men; she does not have to partake in a stereotype just to please her mother, or to become and object for the \`male gaze'. Anna's character criticizes society's expectations on women, and reminds us that even a woman, a Latina woman with little money, can break free from the \\"proper\\" feminine characteristics and expectations; ideals passed down through the generations. Anna also reminds us that real women are not stick thin and are still beautiful and strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inter-play between Ferrera and Ontiveros","review":"\\"Real Woman Have Curves\\" has the aura of 100% believability. Although the entire cast is excellent, this film centers around the tetchy mother-daughter relationship wonderfully portrayed by astonishing newcomer America Ferrera and consummate professional Lupe Ontiveros. It embodies the pressures facing a second-generation Latina daughter vs. the expectations and disappointments of her hard-edged (but ultimately loving) immigrant mother.For a great take on what made their performances so great, check out Entertainment Weekly's 2002 \\"Special Year-End Double Issue\\" (the one with Denzel on the cover). The magazine rightly tabbed the Ferrera/Ontiveros duo as one of 2002's \\"Great Performances,\\" noting that they give us \\"the real picture: the everyday growing pains, the cherished moments of tenderness, and the full-out battles that shape the complicated dynamic of this (or any) mother-daughter pair.\\"Exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Dresses Aren't Just For Skinny Girls","review":"I liked this movie.

This movie has all the parts you're looking for in a good film: real characters, great dialogue, and a story that you actually care about. I've never been big on spoiler reviews, so I'll just say that I find it hard to believe that anyone could watch this movie and not be moved by the down-to-Earth feel that it possesses.

This film is very enjoyable and it can be appreciated by any age group. It seems like a good family movie.It's about a Latino family and their struggles with their dress shop.

With the first two, the crosshair became completely detached and began to spin freely within a few weeks. The crosshair on my most recent replacement also shifted slightly, but I was too lazy to return it once again since i still beleived it was accurate on my .22. I recently switched it over to my .308, and can honestly say it is nowhere near being accurate.

The text doesn't provide enough detail for a novice woodworker or particularly for someone attempting their first instrument to get started. In particular the instrument list should be modified. Simply stating that it includes plans for a lute is misleading when the lute in question is a very Early Medieval type with a skin soundboard. It is more akin to a primitive banjo than what I was looking for. Also, all the drawings are reproduced at such a small scale to be virtually useless and none contain details such as full scale bridge designs or instructions on how to generate one's own patterns. The only useful content in the work is the chapter detailing his method of fretting. It should prove quite useful Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

With just a little more effort this could have been a great book on building a variety of instruments but I think the writing was done in a minimum amount of time.The Gothic Harp, in which I was most interested, didn't have any info on stringing, the critical part of a harp. Oh, don't expect any info on the harp on the cover, it's not in the book. So why is it on the cover?As I said, his other book, Make and Play a Lute, is very detailed and has all the info needed.

Dvd is fine for viewing the basics. It is older, 2006, and short, 26 minutes. Information well explained. One fault is no captioning. The narration by Lisa appears to have been recorded on the first and only take. It would be nice to explain where muscle groups involved are located on the body. I did not know all the muscles mentioned and did separate research for that. Biggest drawback to this dvd is the \\"letterbox\\" format. Although wide screen, there are black bars top and bottom. The bottom is cut off and the feet, floor and kettlebell at rest are not seen in most general views. This basics dvd is best studied with your dvd player set to repeat a chapter until it is understood. There are many chapters (exercises) on the dvd and they go by rather quickly.

The idea that the hero's zealot parents, to discourage vanity when they saw how \\"ridiculously good looking\\" he was going to be, told him instead he was ugly and didn't allow mirrors in the house? Come on! No better-the heroine, by herself after her fathers death, was more worried about writing a romantic Gothic novel than finding a future husband? When I got to the part where the hero, of course, is a avid fan of Gothics, even though his religious parents MADE him read Gothics growing up to \\"scare him\\", I just quit in disgust.This author can and does write better than this.

If you are hoping for some guidance that is less than 100 years old and drawings/pictures that are readable try anything by Danny Proulx, because you won't find it in this book. I guess I should have looked beyond the title.This book is a collection of very small print articles from the early 1900's.

Most Americans were relieved after we left just looking at saving American lives, but the hell of living under a communist regime is often overlooked. Thousands if not millions of people killed, many more imprisioned and/or 're-educated', and still many more risking their lives to try to escape living in poverty and oppression.The movie was well made. The acting was very good, the filming was great, and the stories were compelling. Although it was confusing at parts with its flashbacks and switching locations and timeframes. It almost tried to get too much in. But still one of the most significant movies about Vietnam ever made and well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey from the Fall (DVD)","review":"The movie was \\"excellenty\\" produced.

The shipping was okay, it came a day or two late. Anyway, before i gave it to my friend, i tested the one i bought for myself out. when applied it does look pretty, but i had to go over my eyes 10 times, because i like it dark. it was like a crayon, totally not what i was expecting. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, because its small, last maybe 2 weeks, and it take a while to apply if your looking for dark eyes. i'm not sure about the top lid as i only use it on my inner bottom lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, but smudgy","review":"I was looking for a good, thick, kohl/Kajal product.

It starts out as a sweet May-December romance but mid-way through turns into a whiny diatribe. At a G8 summit in Reykjavik the \\"heroine\\" attacks the Western leaders at a formal dinner for not giving more money to the world's developing countries. She doesn't really seem to want workable solutions to the problems of disease and poverty; she just wants more money be thrown at them. And it's strange that this wonderful, caring, considerate woman doesn't seem to give a second thought to the fact that she is ruining the career of the man she claims to care for by issuing her rant to his bosses. People with a simplistic approach to solving the world's problems will love this movie. People with a brain won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoyed and disappointed","review":"What a waste of wonderful Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald (Gosford Park) on a preachy, holier-than-thou anti-establishment force-feeding session. I was prepared to enjoy the personal story of Lawrence and Gina, but alas I just felt manipulated. Once I realized I was a prisoner in the Evangelical Church of Righteous Indignation I was unable to appreciate such scenes as the one in which Gina says, \\"and it is possible in Reykjavik to have a night of something quite close to love.\\" In fact, I ended up just thinking Gina was petulant and bad-mannered, and frankly unkind to the man she's supposed to be falling in love with. Shut up, Gina! Shut up! Supposedly this movie is 1 hour, 35 minutes long. It seems much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy but disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this film.I love Richard Curtis's writing and Bill Nighy is just fantastic. I fully support the \\"Make Poverty History\\" campaign so I expected to adore this film, but after what seemed like about seven hours, I went and made a cup of tea.There was no action, and I don't mean car chases. No one did anything, nothing happened, they just sat and talked. It was too long and too preachy.An opportunity missed, I'm afraid, Mr Curtis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude propaganda: captivating in the beginning but in the end you feel cheated of two hours","review":"If you like to be taught by crude propaganda, you might like this. I love the actor Nighy, but this piece of writing is really trashy in its simplicity. The romantic comedy part of this film is basically there just to draw you into the picture. Then the propaganda begins. The propaganda is for a good cause, but it is so crudely crafted so it makes you cringe. And of course being a British production, it is the Brits that are the good guys. Fine, but so simplistic.If you are a left-leaning anti-establishment person you will probably like this film. Personally, the key problem I have with the film is the crudeness of the propaganda. I still give it two stars because Nighy's performance is great and I was really pulled into the film, before I felt cheated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Poison","review":"There could have been a great theme here about an outsider shaking up powerful men, but it's buried in the insufferably naive, pompous, and pretentious idea of 8 leaders eliminating all poverty. Tyrants, armed tribes, and dictators are the reason most children die. I wonder how many of the \\"do gooders\\" that applaud or cry at this nonsense will ever write a check toward drilling a well or financing a medical trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good way to kill a few hours","review":"This movie is a sleeper. Not meaning it is a boring flick, but rather that those looking for something to watch could easily overlook it. The characters, an older bureaucrat and female, ex-felon, are sympathetic due to the pain the flies forth from the story of their individuals lives. In the process of going through the motions, these individuals come to find each other. While you will never be sure they are in love with each other or are simply lonely, you get to watch them attempt to create some type of relationship that can become spiritually fulfilling for each person. In the process, you get to witness some intimate moments, as well as some uncomfortable moments. All in all this becomes a really good movie to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Play, Good Movie","review":"Two separate threads throughout the movie - a yearning \\"never-to-happen\\" love story and a more blatant \\"poverty-is-wrong-and-you-can-do-something-about-it\\" theme.Kelly MacDonald is the stand-up Scottish support, although she has the weaker part, Bill Nighy (always a little strange) plays the tired civil servant beautifully.The quotes in the movie, and the closing from Nelson Mandela should reflect on Tom Brokaw's \\"Greatest Generation\\". The thought is the same, in terms of what you do for others, not necessarily for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"If you like what I call quiet humor, the first half of this movie is wonderful. The second half also is very good.

This very timely and poignant film, set against the backdrop of the 2005 G8 Summit, is a mix of romance and politics that both entertains and povokes. Think Love Actually meets Lost in Translation and CSPANs Road to the Whitehouse. Bill Nighty (Love Actually) is brillant as a charmingly pathetic bureaucrat who goes against his past socially withdrawn tendencies in to find companionship with Kelly Macdonald. Richard Curtis(Love Actually, as well) does a fantastic job of melding current affairs into a wonderfully written script. Great settings, great dialogue. A must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge yourself first.","review":"The concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded \\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" turned out to be a left-wing political message. I wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character \\"Gina\\"? Gina browbeats the members of the G8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world, particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows. Does the thought ever cross her mind (or the person writing the script?) that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS, all varieties of venereal disease, children born out of wedlock, poverty, etc? Maybe Gina should look at her own life before judging others so harshly.This movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an R rating for nudity and language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good theme, but not very subtle","review":"This is a good movie and the acting is excellent.

Admittedly, it is a bit predictable, which detracts from it. But, it is good, powerful and the message is undeniable. Bill Nighy is, as always, VERY good in this movie. He has an on-screen presence that is incredible in whatever roll he takes on. Great movie with a bit of mystery and a great moral."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you LOVED \\"Love Actually\\"...","review":"then you probably won't be impressed by this film. Sure, Bill Nighy is fab, as usual, as is Kelly MacDonald, but it's pretty hard to swallow their random relationship. It's also hard to believe that she could so easily infiltrate the G8 Summit. There are several sweet moments, but they're just as implausible.SEMI-SPOILER:Why exactly does she kiss him when she does? I don't buy it.I'm a fan of movies with a point, but it just doesn't work.

Riddled by several suspects, each with a motive and opportunity, Danny is forced to re-examine his close friends, his faith and even the reverent image he held of his confidant. THE SECOND SORROWFUL MYSTERY, packed with Irish folklore, false leads, scandal, love, lies, and laughter, is a great classic detective story that will keep you captivated right up until the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining -- a mystery with something extra","review":"I was a big fan of Jonathan Harrington's first book, The Death of Cousin Rose, but he tops himself here with a fast-moving, atmospheric mystery that will delight even the non-Irish (like me.) Harrington retains the small-town Irish feel that made the first book so charming --- but this time there's more ambiance, more suspense, and a lot more humor. I read this on vacation, and at times I truly felt as if I was transported to another world. There's a very funny chase scene that has to be read to be believed - and there are even snippets of religion and philosophy at the end. This is more than just another mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

They also look really nice as part of a block tower mixed with other types of blocks.I have two minor complaints/observations:1. The name \\"crystal\\" implies that the beads will be translucent and have some sparkle to them. While the beads are \\"crystal cut\\", they are actually opaque and do not have any shine at all. It seems that they missed a chance for added visual appeal and were a bit misleading in the name.2. The clear acrylic that encloses the beads seems to be scratched on the inside from the beads. As a result, the window part is cloudy and has small impressions of beads on the inside. On close inspection, this is pretty significant.

The information makes sense to me - not just my brain, but my physical intuition resonates with this way of eating.

I do think we should have more detailed background on what our specific ancestors ate.For instance, I have a native American friend who, through process of elimination & re-introduction has discovered she can eat beans and corn with no problems whereas I cannot. Her ancestors have had enough time to adapt to a diet including them. I suspect the grain barley would be OK for me because it was eaten for thousands of years by my Celtic ancestors.

Fat, and more specifically saturated fat, has been unfairly villainized by modern paradigms and this book does nothing to clear this misinformation.

Ancient man might have been designed to eat the type of foods recommended in this diet but modern man does not face the same kind of environment or challenges that ancient man was faced with on a daily basis.

Additionally, the author is British and apparantly doesn't have a very good grasp on American law as it applies to obscenity and adult films.Finally, although the book is entitled \\"an illustrated history of adult cinema\\" the illustrations are mostly video box covers and very few of those or the other photos have any sort of caption which makes them rather disjointed from the accompanying text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Body Moisturizer with a delicate scent","review":"This is my second jar of Maria Evora Espana Carob Mineral Body Moist.

The tape only lasts for 25 minutes, where 15 of those are just a guy talking about TMNT 1 and 2, while you see clips from the first two movies. Pretty much like a regular movie trailer. So that leaves 10 little minutes for behind the scenes footage and interviews. If you are a big fan like me, you'll enjoy those 10 minutes, but even a die-hard fan, has to admit that 10 minutes is way to short. You get to see how the actors and puppeteers work together, which is really exciting, but that's about it.It's worth the time, but not the money.

However the YYYs are NOT the saviours of rock, they are NOT new, innovative, or especially talented either. They do have a hot female singer that likes to scream, and for some people that is enough.

Taking after The White Stripes no bass effort, the band consists of vocals by Karen O, guitars by Nick Zinner, and Brian Chase on drums. Who needs bass when Nick's entrancing guitars can carry the duty of 3 men alone.

Douglas McGrath beautifully brings Dickens' masterpeice to life.The Story: We find the title character (Charlie Hunnam) a recently fatherless teen who takes his mother and sister to their estranged uncle (Christopher Plummer) seeking financial aid. Little does the family know that all Ralph Nickleby has to give is hate and lies. The odious uncle sends Nicholas to Dotheboys Hall, a \\"school\\" for unwanted boys, where he encounters the cruel Squeerses (Jim Broadbent, Juliet Stevenson) and the abused Smike (Jamie Bell), with whom he escapes and sets out on his adventure to rescue and reclaim his family.The Thoughts: With a star studded cast and excellent score, Nicholas Nickleby is poignant and comedic. A definite must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dickens of a Movie","review":"Sorry for the pun. Seriously, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. Fabulous actors. Christopher Plummer is amazing. You hate his character and feel sorry for him all at the same time. Great story. You root for the underdog. You feel good when he succeeds. You hate the man who tries to destroy him. Has a little romance in it, too. All-around good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"smike","review":"Jamie Bell's performance as Smike is well worth the time/price spent on the movie.

One of the classic tales of a youth becoming a man and overcoming all sorts of hardships and heartaches along the way. When his father dies and his family becomes impoverished the must venture to London in hopes that their father's wealthy brother will assist them. But their wealthy and miserly uncle has schemes which lead to everyone's detriment including, in the end, his own. Along the difficult path of Nickleby he finds his way, unravels the mystery of his uncle, finds love, and reunites his family building his own. This is not another tired retelling of the classic tale but a living, breathing new life for it. All members of the cast were very well placed and the film will be a doubtless treasure in anyone's collection. The only nudity is the infant Nicholas and only briefly so should not be a concern for young viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat","review":"The filmmakers do a great job turning the sprawling, obscure Dickens novel into a taut, compelling film. While it is not perfect, NICKLEBY contains some delightful Dickensian character-work, especially by Nathan Lane, Jim Broadbent, Juliet Stevenson and Christopher Plummer (a deliciously arch arch-villain).The greatest work here is the work of adapter/director Douglas McGrath in tandem with Dickens. McGrath stays true to the story without being a slave to it, letting the actors bring the characters to vibrant life, creating a world of good good and evil evil without it ever becoming a cartoon. A fun movie, and one that is entertaining for all ages -- a true rarity in the now demographically-segmented world of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY U.S.A.","review":"This movie made only for DVD players in Europe ONLY.

But was presently surprised by a great story, that had me laughing, talking back to the screen, and cheering in my seat while I watched it.The story starts out quite dark, it was almost too depressing to keep watching. It follows a young man at the death of his father, where he becomes the head of the house and responsible for his mother and younger sister. They make their way to London to enlist the help of his uncle, and father's brother.Lots of drama in this movie, wide variety of interesting characters, great dialogue pacing, and it ended with a really feel good ending.

Other quotes, stories and ditties are common knowledge to Eagles fans, or available by reading web sites, articles, etc. Therefore whilst mildly enjoyable, the nature of the material renders this publication superfluous unless you are only mildly interested in the Eagles.

You will find tons of feedbacks left on the forums to recommend this model and there's no need to talk about it.The point is. If you are looking for a $43 DVD player and expect to perform like a $275 one, this model will definitely disappointed you. However, if you're looking for a powerful region free plus dual format DVD player, you will hardly find one better than this.P.S. I didn't have the problem with black and white. I bought 3 of them, hacked into region free and gave them as holiday gifts. None of them have that problem. Maybe I was lucky.

It was cheap, and it was one of the few DVD players that were small enough to fit next to my TV on my chest of drawers. Great deal, right?Well, I've had this thing for about 5 months and I can tell you, it won't last. Often times the DVD that's playing will just freeze, forcing you to restart the DVD player. Other times it won't even read the DVD when you put it in, and just gets stuck on the \\"Loading\\" screen, which forces you to restart the player. I've also noticed that if I stack more than 4 DVDs with cases on top of the DVD player, it also effects the playing.

It just doesn't play Region 2 DVDs, which I find frustrating.However, since I buy nearly all my DVDs from Amazon.com (which offers Region 1 products) the vast majority of my collection plays in this little machine.Besides, (...) offered, so I got to save some money after all.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Junk","review":"I got it last Nov from Radioshack.

That is, when it's turned off, it continues to draw enough current that it stays warm to the touch. Initially, although I can't imagine why it should need to do so, I didn't think it was a big deal.Then a few months later, the unit conked out. It powers up, but it no longer puts out a usable signal. Lots of snow, no color, rolling picture, etc.I can only guess it's because something in the electronics overheated and failed.So, if this unit appeals to you, I highly suggest plugging it into something that will cut power to it when you're not using it. Something such as a power strip or a switched outlet on your home theater receiver or cable box.If you plug it into the wall or another always-on outlet, don't be surprised if a few months later you find it has baked itself into becoming a high-tech doorstop (like mine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy!!","review":"Well, it fits the space that I needed it for, but it's very noisy and I have to return it.

It can be easily made region-free (please note before you do this that, according to the Cyberhome web site, changing the region code will void the warranty). Best of all, it will convert PAL format to play on a NTSC television. I've had a few minor glitches: Sometimes when I open the tray it will immediately re-close. A few times it would pause and skip during playback, but when I rewound back to the spot it started, it played fine (NOTE: The only times this has happened has been on double-sided disks, that is, disks with material on both sides such as with the first three season sets of THE DUKES OF HAZZARD).

I can just get a new one; are they kidding?However, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least we had 13 months together rather than it failing right away or after only a few uses.

NO response from the company. If you want to throw your money away, just give it to me. I need to buy a new DVD player.UPDATE:I have figured out that if I start a movie and play it for about 5 minutes, the sound finally kicks in. Plus it is ALWAYS at the EXACT same time. For instance, in Finding Nemo, the sound ALWAYS kicks in when Nemo gets stuck and his dad has to help him out (at the beginning). I am a bit more happy because it DOES work, I just have to put in a DVD about 15 minutes before I want to watch it to make sure the sound kicks in.Either way, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First 6 Months it was great","review":"I loved the size of this unit.

Small size makes my tiny studio apartment not too messy.Cons: If you pause the dvd/vcd for a long time (I tried at least 2 hours on purpose), then played the dvd again, the picture would be distorted, but then I just turned off the player and turned it back on, it was fixed. So it's not a big issue. Also, it doesn't have display available. It doesn't really bother me, but again, it would be nice if it had the display LCD.Final thought: I bought 5 cyberhome CH-DVD 300s, and there was only one that didn't power on when I pushed the power button on the player itself. I brought it back to BestBuy, and they told me there was no problem with it, but I exchanged it anyway.

I'd bring them to other people's DVD players and everything would be fine.Eventually I had to slam the top of the player in order to stop the skipping. While most of the time that worked, it would just skip somewhere else later.

Sometimes 'loading' the movie will take several minutes. It has even taken me up to 5 minutes to get the tray to open to remove the DVD. I'm electronically capable enough to assure you that this is not user error.The region free capability others have mentioned means little to me in my daily usage.

It's less than a month old, and it's a certified piece of junk. The player often stalls or gets stuck, it's noisy (you can often hear it humming even with moderate moderate volume on the TV). Sometimes, the only way to get it to function is by unplugging it and plugging it back in (even the power button won't respond), a pain if your outlet is behind a large cabinet.Spend the extra money to get a brand name DVD player.

But make sure you stick to the one system (NTSC or PAL), or buy yourself multi-system TV. Cause this player can NOT handle PAL<->NTSC conversion.I tried several PAL DVDs (multi-zone disks) to watch on my NTSC TV. The result was horrible :(Instead of interpolation, it just skips every 6th line (you can imagine how straight lines look like).And it can not handle anamorphic PAL DVDs, image is stretched vertically.One has to have PAL TV to watch PAL DVDs, I believe.Other than that it's a good player (for $43 :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's disposable!","review":"This DVD player is the Bic lighter of home video.

This machine boasts Progressive Scan capability, but on HDTVs there is a noise bar (parellel lines running across the screen, faint but very perceptible in dark backgrounds) -- none seen on other TVs. And this is the best part, say the machine dies on you -- just get another one. Beats paying $50 on performance plans.

It started to skip and have jerky playback on all movies. Even brand new flawless dvd's only play part way before it stops working correctly. It also gives off a lot of heat, and with a (big)fan running on it constantly, we do get extra play time before it has problems.

I figured it would be an ok player to last a short time until she could afford one on her own. Unfortunately it had problems playing about 1/2 of the movies we tried in it. It would frequently freeze up on a frame for a few moments before continuing, or lock up on that frame altogether without continuing. The latter happend on the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition. When it did lock up, very often it would take a long time for the remote control or the front panel buttons to respond again, such as to go back to the main menu or even eject the disk. The same disks had no problems playing in another DVD player, so it was definitely the players fault.

The good news is that it will play a MP3 DVD, so you can get a LOT of music (60+ hours) on one DVD. The bad news is that MP3 playback has lots of hiccups, extraneous noises (sometimes very loud, be very careful when playing it loud, you could toast your speakers). It also plays MP3s only in alphabetical order by 8-char filename (no shuffle play).I love it that you can reprogram the thing to be multi-region. That with pedestrian ability to play DVDs for only $30 (Circuit City) wins 2 stars. But I won't own it long enough to see if it dies an early death, like everyone else says."},{"rating":"1","title":"This player doesn't play DVD+R disc","review":"I bought this player at BestBuy and it worked fine for me for a few weeks until I put in a DVD+R disc and it didn't play as advertised.I recommend don't buy this player.

But make sure you stick to the one system (NTSC or PAL), or buy yourself multi-system TV. Cause this player can NOT handle PAL<->NTSC conversion.I tried several PAL DVDs (multi-zone disks) to watch on my NTSC TV. The result was horrible :(Instead of interpolation, it just skips every 6th line (you can imagine how straight lines look like).And it can not handle anamorphic PAL DVDs, image is stretched vertically.One has to have PAL TV to watch PAL DVDs, I believe.Other than that it's a good player (for $43 :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the region code free setting???

No luck. Then I called Amazon, they said they will replace the unit.Last week I receive the my replacement unit. I think this unit is comparatively better. The reason is, it displayed the DVD movies in color for 20 to 30 minutes.

About a month ago, it started to malfunction and then stopped working altogether. One of my DVD's is jammed inside of it and, most likely, I'll never see it again.

After more back and forth with their horrendously awful customer service I got a new unit.It was fine for a while but now it has this strange sound issue. Sometimes the sound lags behind the picture, then it catches up, then it lags again.

I brought it home, set it up and put in a DVD. Right away, I noticed something wasn't right when the player would \\"jump ahead\\" to Chapter 2 instead of starting at the beginning of the disc. It did this with several DVD's. My next complaint was the freeze-ups and pixellation on the screen. Sometimes the unit seemed to \\"get stupid\\" and wouldn't respond to the remote. That, along with reading these other reviews, was enough to convince me to pack everything back up and return it to Wal*Mart. Not surprisingly, the customer service rep said that a TON of these things came back for the same reasons. Live and learn I guess. Stay away. Typical mass-market junk.

This was one of the few I didn't research before I bought it, and I've learned my lesson. Within the first week the remote stopped working (not that it worked well to begin with). A battery change did nothing. It occasionally will not recognize a DVD I load. If I try to play burned DVDs, it always skips for a while and then freezes towards the end.

We don't watch that many dvd's, so it's use has been moderate I would say. It has been the most sensitive player and we have had to return rental dvd's several times due to very minor scratches that caused it to freeze or skip. Now it won't work at all. What a waste of money. I'm doing my research this time to buy one that hopefully will last more than two years and even if it doesn't, at least maybe it will be enjoyable while we have it.

The important thing is, it plays EVERYTHING. I mean if you ever buy asian movies, euro movies or whatever and it is in another region code, this will play it. It plays dvd's vcd's dvd R's etc. Everything you thrwo at it, it will take it. I think you might have to press some button to make it all region but it is easily find on the internet.

Therefore, now that I'm shopping for my new one, I am ONLY looking at units with a one-year parts AND labor warranty.

The rich Egyptian style music never gets boring and gives you a taste of the MiddleEast. Veena and Neena have an easy and sensual approach to teaching the bellydance moves that'll transform you into the Goddess that you are! It's fun, low-impact but effective, sensual, liberating, and a true artform! If you're interested in Bellydane than trust me this video is the BEST start you could find.

Everything was broken down in such a way that it was easily understood, and Neena and Veena went slowly enough that I could see every aspect of the movement, then brought it up to speed. They even put the movements together into a short dance, so that I was not left wondering what to do or how to put it all together. Not only is it fun learning the movements, I found that I'm a lot better coordinated than I thought I was. Learning the art of bellydancing is going to be a great experience, and Neena and Veena are excellent teachers. I recommend ALL of their videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm impressed!","review":"As a professional dancer, I own many instructional videos on various styles of dance. I must say that this is the best belly-dancing video I've ever purchased.

I became a James Patterson fan after reading this book. Although the entire Alex Cross series is exceptional, this is, without a doubt, the stand out book.I was so disappointed when they cast Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. Alex in the book is MUCH younger. There are so many aspects of Alex's life and character that were left out to accommodate the elderly movie Alex -- such as Alex's children, grandmother, relationship with a character in the book, etc... (don't want to give too much away - *wink*)That was a HUGE turn off to me when the movie came out.

After reading Hide & Seek, Along Came A Spider and currently engrossed in Kiss The Girls I'd have to say the contrast of Gary Soneji and Alex Cross kept me from a few school readings I should have done. Alex Cross PhD has become my new Psychology professor with his series. Patterson's layout style of to-the-point chapters gives you a shock just when you need it. Without losing you in the words he lays out the picture perfectly for you and never has to retreive you from the lost world. Just when you're guessing about a character they're right there for you to catch up on.

Authors like Stephen King, John Saul, Jonathan Kellerman and James Patterson spring immediately to mind.I get no feeling from any of these characters! They are not real to me, they hold no interest for me. It's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind -- profound mediocrity.The scenes are also dull and choppy. I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere.I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author.

Along Came A Spider is particularly enjoyable once you've read the follow-up books and have been scared into locking all the doors & windows in the middle of the night after the evil Soneji reappears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very good, and boy was I glued to this one!","review":"Along Came a Spider was the first Patterson novel that I read, and it was one of the best books that I have ever read! I was able to read about 100 plages in one sitting, and I had never done that before! For once I could follow the plot with ease, and I can see that Alex Cross is dedicated to both his personal and professional lives. I'm also glad to see that Patterson is not hung up on race, with Alex's love relationship. If anyone wants to get into Patterson, this should be the first book that they get their hands on. I am looking forward to reading more of Patterson's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"The book is an excellent read.

Women's murder mystery was way better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Quality Not Up To Standards","review":"In early April I found that you were offering a hardcover printing of Along came A Spider by James Patterson so I placed one on order as a gift for my wife. Subsequently it was back ordered and I received it almost 12 weeks after I originally placed the order. Upon opening the box I found that it was not a \\"real\\" hardcover book but a paperback book with a \\"hard cover\\". My expectations were that it would be a full size book printed on white paper not this imitation of a hardcover. To me, as to a lot of other consumers, the term \\"hardcover\\" implies a certain level of quality above that found in the average paperback. This was a Mother's Day gift and needless to say, I was rather disappointed in the quality of the item received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy.","review":"The biggest thing to me is when I read novels by black authors about black charaters, their voice is different, the things they see and report are different.

The problem here is that the central character is never fully developed. Neither are the supporting characters. Patterson's writing style is to write in the first person for the main character and third person for the other characters. This lets us look into the minds of his characters, but he never makes me feel I am really into the story. The main character is constantly touting his own good traits and just comes off as phony to me. I do like the way he has a good twist for the endings of his books. I have read two and just don't know if I can read any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"badguy\\" Soneji is a very entertaining psycho!","review":"The book is very exciting when Gary Soneji comes on, because you know that something terrible is going to go wrong.

A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Read it in only two days because you want to find out what is going to happen next.

You start to see patterns and the stories become easier to figure out. It's almost as though Patterson has a template he uses to write his books. The thing I hate most are the italics. I don't need italics to suddenly \\"realize\\" that I'm supposed to be shocked or feel some emotion. I'm not an emotionless drone that spends all of my life outside of work watching the idiot box. Patterson really ought to start writing for \\"real\\" people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was awsome!!!","review":"Ok, it's probably one of the best books I've ever read. I'm only 13 and I havn't read very many books yet but this one is the best. I'm now reading Cat and Mouse, part 2 of Along Came a Spider. Gary Soneji/Murphy is one of the best psychotic characters I've ever read about. Alex Cross is the best detectives I've ever read about. This is the kind of book you can never put down.

Very poor scenario description. A lightweight women driving her motorcycle with a large 6'-2\\" man on the back going 130 mph on a BMW motorcycle through Washington DC at night in the dead of winter for over an hour and right from the office AND with no mention of wind chill or frostbite. Let alone finding any road in Washington DC you can go 130 mph without traffic. Most of the scenerios are just unrealistic. Author never made me feel as though I was there, it was just not convincing and not well thought out. Not a well thought out or investigated story, no real drama. Very novice writing with a limited vocabulary. Author better research what the suspect's rights are after he is arrested. Never heard from the suspect's attorney until almost the day of the trial, violated the suspects rights from the get go. Before I read another book by this author he has to do more research on criminal law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story And Great Characters","review":"This book was very fast moving and exciting. The best thing I appreciate about Patterson's books are his characters, especially Cross, his hero. In this book, Patterson brings out more of the personality and day-to-day life of this caring, intelligent, good man. I don't think I have read a thriller with a more likeable, interesting hero. John Sandford (Eyes Of Prey) comes close, and Rory Smith (Devil In The Metal) is just about there with his heroes, but Patterson is still the king in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful and Surprising Thriller","review":"Upon reading the novel, I encountered some very intricate and useful details about the book. I didn't have to worry about a slow or annoying plot in Along Came A Spider because it moved very quickly. Patterson did a great job of moving the characters right inot the feel of the novel. The characters were superb. There were many instances in which I felt like I was Detective Cross and my decisions would determine the outcome of sticky situations. Along Came a Spider was able to grab my attention and hold it. After the first couple of pages, I soon found myself unable to put the novel down at time that I knew I should have. Along Came A Spider truly impressed me to the fact that I can not wait to finish reading Patterson's next thriller, Kiss the Girls. If similar characters are involved, then I am sure the next one will be as delicious as Along Came A Spider."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great way to start off the series","review":"You will not be able to put this book down. Patterson has created the perfect antagonist with Gary Soneji. The writing is brisk and fast paced and the suprise ending will leave you guessing until the end. The book is damn near classic. The only regret is that towards the last 150 pages the books seems to be dragging on. I rate it more of a 3.5 than a four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aussies are left out","review":"I don't think it's very fair the Alex Cross series and the womens murder club isn't available in ebooks to Australian Kindle users. When is it going to happen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the worst, but close","review":"Can someone tell me why James Patterson would have his black hero play and sing Public Enemy tunes on a piano? I thought it started decently enough (reminded me of John Sandford) but as I kept reading it became more and more ridiculous. By the time I got to that \\"Public Enemy\\" line, I had it. No more Patterson for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good....","review":"Action packed with a mystery to solve. I got through this book pretty quick and the ending was a complete shock. I just started the Alex Cross series and I am glad I did. Along Came a Spider was superb plot. Patterson gives great discriptions of each character. Especially when he wrote about the killer. Creepy. I highly recommend this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I am very disappointed with this book. The story may have made a beautiful movie (which I have never seen), but it does not pass master as reading. The characters are cardboard cutouts from the standard psychopatic egomaniacal killer to the Alex Cross'es family. There is one (yes, I mean ONE) plot twist that is more or less interesting, the rest is so rote it is funny. The writer has no skills whatsoever in building tension. He also cannot put together an interesting description. I will not even touch the dialog with a ten foot pole. And why on Earth do viewpoints have to shift all the time? We don't learn anything interesting when they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book with a mediocre ending","review":"Great thriller throughout with some unbelievable turns. With all the imagination used to create the body of the book you would think the ending would have had more development and forethought.

I want to be suprised at the end, not fed the predictable"},{"rating":"1","title":"The grass is too green","review":"When I read a book and I keep reading and I get nothing of the main story I say that the writer is green dyeing the grass, since I already know that the grass is green with out dyeing it, I think that I don't have to read words that doesn't say anything, for example:The Jezzie-Alex's affair could be written in five lines at the beginning of the book and five more at the end so you can understand why she was a bad agent. The book has chapters and chapters of this affair.What happened with Alex's family is part of the book, but whatever they are going to have for breakfast every morning, who cares?The trial is boring and it repeats everything you already know....

I mainly read it because I enjoyed the movie \\"Kiss The Girls\\" based on the Patterson novel of the same name. I thought that story was intriguing. This one, just didn't move me much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This did not meet my expectations for such a celebrated author. It was entirely too elementary- but having just finished the Millenium series, most anything would be. Hilariously simple dialogue, including internal thought processes...I might become an author if this is what sells. The ending was laughable- lethal injection for someone not directly involved in murders?? And executed only a year later?? Those cases take YEARS to complete the appeals process...This isn't a book for people who are analytical, as it falls apart from the beginning. I finished the book (Audible audiobook) in the hopes it would eventually smarten up- but I should have smartened up: I won't be following the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"second time around","review":"Reading _-Along Came a Spider a second time is just as good as the first. For newcomers to James Patterson's latest books, it's a great recap of Alex Cross's history. Who he is, why he is are being built upon this book and more of his early ones. Am introducung Patterson to my husband and my son is great fun using this and his earlier book. All still pageturners"},{"rating":"2","title":"Along came a spider - Page turner for sure","review":"Just completed \\"Along came a spider\\". This is my first James Patterson novel and boy what a novel this is. How many twists and turns you can keep in a novel. Every time, I felt that Alex Cross has cracked the case, the novel takes a new turn, Gary Soneji character was scar for sure but the FBI agents who went for the ransom money was still more scarier. Ego, Greed, sex, action everything is there in this novel.If you want to read an action packed novel that keeps you hooked to the book, this one it is and I am doubly sure about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"So mad at this book. It was pretty good for the first 3/4. Then it completely goes off the rails. First is some annoying, distracting moralizing about interracial dating. It's totally out of place in a psychological thriller. Did the author need to fill pages for his book contract? Then the farce of a trial. Somehow the allegedly split-personality killer gets hypnotized during the trial. Yes, hypnotized. During the trial. You could not make this schlock up. Well, I guess you could. If you were an overrated hack. There's 8 hours of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"This book sounded good based on the synopsis and the plot line made for nice escapism. Unfortunately, I found most of the characters to be completely unbelievable. The dialogue from the main character, Alex Cross, was particularly bad and sounded like a white person pretending to be black. I am a fan of good thrillers and I can be fairly forgiving of flaws in novels but, in this case, I found the characters and dialogue so off-putting that it detracted from the otherwise inventive plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"James Patterson once again writes a book that I don't want to set down.

(I'm running out of shelf space for my print books!) But I refuse to pay more for an e-book than I would for the mass market paperback--especially not $2 more! I've been in the publishing industry for 15+ years, and I know from the inside how unnecessary that is (especially for a backlist best-seller such as this one, which has already paid for itself). Little, Brown, please be reasonable and reconsider! I won't be trying this series at all until the Kindle edition is priced lower than the paperback.

Hero whines too much.

I gave one star because there is at least enough action to keep me awake on the drive to Charleston."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been bitten by the spider!","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my chair from the first chapter.

It is completely devoid of any craftsmanship;the plot is unbelievably sloppily laid out;the characters are one-dimensional."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY A FIVE-STAR PLUS!","review":"Of all the James Patterson novels, this one is definitely at the top of the list. In this and subsequent novels, kidnapper, Gary Soneji is to Alex Cross as Hannibal is to FBI Agent Clarice Starling.Without going into the specifics of the book, all of which have been provided for you in the editorial reviews, this book is one of my all time favourites of James Patterson. It is packed with suspense, drama, a super A-1 plot and great characters. Be prepared for a long night ahead because it is a book you will not want to put down from start to finish. Also, at the top of the list is \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Cat and Mouse.\\"If you have read Patterson's later novels,\\"When the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Cradle and All,\\" and are disappointed with what you have read, do not be discouraged. This book has all the punch and power of a real super thriller! You will not want to miss this book or the movie of the same name."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Disappointed to say that I dont see how this book gets great reviews. A friend suggested I read it, because I enjoy reading murder mysteries especially ones with reoccuring characters, but this book is dry. I read \\"Kiss The Girls\\" immediately after ACAS hoping it was better written, but it was worse. In both books the suspects exhibit better intelligence than the detective yet the detective somehow solves the mystery without explanation.It has an unabsorbing storyline with shallow unrealistic main characters. An easy read with predictable outcomes.Disappointing.Still looking for well written mysteries with reoccuring characters along the lines of the EARLY Cornwell stories and early Jonathan Kellerman."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually awful but yeah suspenseful","review":"i liked the sample and didnt know what people were saying when they were complaining about the writing but after actually buying the book and reading just a few pages further i completely get it. gooooodness i cant believe i bought this book. the two stars are for the pretty cliched but still suspenseful plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific series!","review":"While on medical leave from work I sat down to read one of Patterson's books and ended up reading the entire Alex Cross & Women's Murder Club series in 2 weeks!!

I can't wait to find out how it ends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross","review":"This is the first of Alex Cross and you need to hold on to the bottom of your seat. It is fast moving and you need to read just one more chapter before you put it down. I did not read these books in order. However each of the series is a book that will stand-alone. Alex Cross just matures with each book. I prefer this series of Patterson's books. He has a real talent in keeping your interest. By Ruth Thompson author of \\"Natchez Above the River\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best mystery novels I've read!","review":"This was the third book of Patterson's that I've read and it couldn't have been better.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get started on a great author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking, Fast Paced, Scary.","review":"I first wanted to read Patterson after watching Kiss the Girls. I am so happy I did. Detective Alex Cross, the protagonist in the book and movie, is a cross between the real life John Douglass and Mike Hammer. I ended up rooting for him throughout this book full of twists and turns (not always for the best). Gary Soneji, the villian, is a psychopathic killer who literally frightened me and made my blood curl. And Jezzie Flanagan, Cross' love interest, puts a complex spin on this thriller. The book is fast paced and I never wanted to put it down. I just hope I get to read more about Alex Cross in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book despite...","review":"This was my first Alex Cross book, and overall it was very good, and would read another. The villian in the novel is intelligent, cunning, and very dangerous, and so the hero in return must also be intelligent, and insightful. Patterson succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat through out much of the book, and I found most of his twists, and turns very entertaining. Sadly what I did not find entertaining, intelligent, or even fresh was the routine use of the \\"Black vs White\\" mentality used by the star of the book Alex Cross. I found the use of this really insulting, and it turned me off almost to the point of putting the book down. I could not understand why its inclusion made this a better book, or a better character. I certainly hope that in the future Alex cross books, that Patterson was comfortable with himself as a writer that he no longer had to include such petty plot devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I want in a book!","review":"This book is wonderful! Suspenseful, twisting, and delicious, James Patterson has crafted quite the protagonist in Detective Alex Cross. Fans of Jeffery Deaver and others like him with devour this one!When Detective Alex Cross is removed from the murder of a poor black family to head the investigation of the kidnapping of two prominent white children, he is less than thrilled. He can see injustice all around, but is powerless to change the course of events to his liking. Making the best of a bad situation, he throws himself into the investigation and quickly learns that things are not as they seem at all.Most of the book deals with the examination of the kidnapper/murderer and that is easily the best part of the book. The villain is as twisted as they come, and the uncertainty of whether he really is crazy or just acting is possibly the most chilling part of all. Even the romantic elements of the story are shadowy and twisted in this page turner. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a stretch","review":"I am a true Patterson fan, but did not enjoy this book. It does keep you interested enough to keep reading, but that is all that it has to offer. I felt that there were too many \\"side plots\\" going on which weren't necessary; as many people have also written, 500 words could have covered the amount of plot that happened in 500 pages. I felt that the ending was a stretch... it served well to patch things up nicely for a neat conclusion and left readers open for a continuation in the series, but did a patchy job at that. I don't always want a \\"tidy\\" ending, I want one that is interesting and intriguing yet believable.I do enjoy the \\"Alex Cross\\" series, and loved the next novel in the series \\"Kiss the Girls\\", so if you have read this one and weren't a fan, don't discriminate against some of his other offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad","review":"This book is completely uninspired. Huge swaths of pages are almost unreadable. This is fiction at its worst, pressing every button to garner the highest thrill quota. Patterson does do a little better with his following novels \`Kiss the Girls,' and 'Jack and Jill,' and this is his first novel I presume from over ten years ago, but it pales in comparison to some other better works. Try Jim Thomson, Edward Bunker, or \`Silence of the Lambs' (Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here).This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader's cerebral cortex. Its only saving grace is an interesting twisting plot line that really packs a well thought out wallop.Read the two in the series that I recommended and stay away from the rest of Patterson's toxic waste land."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"I read this expecting something enjoyable. That was my mistake. I'm all for books that have no purpose other than to entertain, but the Cross character seems arbitrarily black, like that, by definition, gives him a personality; I didn't buy any of the rest of it, either. I think a book is cheating when the only reason you're reading it is because you want to know what happens not because you care, but because it would irritate you not to know. This book cheats. Bigtime. I recommend Ridley Pearson or Richard North Patterson if you want something in the genre that's at least decent. I would have given it no stars, but they wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How a book like this can become a bestseller is beyond me.","review":"This popular and highly acclaimed novel is amateurishly written and incomplete.

After thinking about it some, (but not too much), I've come up with a few things that I think Mr. Patterson ought to consider:Thou shalt not create motiveless protagonists and antagonists.Thou shalt not create absolute protagonists and antagonists.Thou shalt not make your Caucasian readers, (especially those who are male) feel terrible for how they were born.Thou shalt not promote racism by masking it beneath grandmotherly charm.Thou shalt not forget that your readers have a gag reflex, when writing about Alex Cross's family life.Thou shalt not use excessive italics and (shudder) exclamation marks to emphasize that which even the most dimwitted reader knows to be important.And perhaps most importantly, Thou shalt not forget that sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson","review":"NEVER NEVER a disapointment This book is no exceptionI always think he can't outdo the last one but he always doesCan't go wrong with this thriller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson","review":"Another great James Patterson book.....he keeps you on the edge of your seat and it is hard to allow anything else in your daily schedule until you read the entire book............"},{"rating":"2","title":"It had its share of twists and turns","review":"This was different. In the beginning it was a little drab lacking the action I thought it was to have. But towards the middle it picked up speed. I truly enjoyed the mastermind of \\"\\"The son of Lindbergh\\". I loved how Patterson captured the truth in his disturbed character.The psychological perspective is what grabbed me into this book. It does a minor in depth diagnosis of the different criminals that are presented. It's almost like the show \\"Criminal Minds\\" but its Dr. Cross doing the digging.Also, the graphic detail of the kidnappings and murders. Oh that is the best part. Patterson wasn't afriad to take it to the level with children. I know that some people are very uptight about that but others, I like reading the thrills and chills. And this one sends the chill right up your spine. Its horrible, graphic, disgusting and all the other bad words.... But I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story and narrative so far","review":"This is my first James Patterson novel and I do like how the book is written.

The story is plodding, kept alive only by single-word paragraphs and two-page chapters. The line-by-line writing is juvenile and the story developments - such as a split-personality killer being hypnotised in court - feels more like a parody of a psychological thriller than a NYT best seller. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Along Came A Spider","review":"This was the second book i had read of JP's. I'm glad it was because now i am addicted! - this book was fantastic, thrilling right to the very end i couldn't put it down. I read this book in a little over a week prior to this i would usually read novels over a period of about 2 to 3 months. JP has changed my whole overlook on reading novels and the Alex Cross series is a fantastic chain to begin with - top rating for Along Came a Spider."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson's Best Book!","review":"Of all the James Patterson books, Along Came A Spider had to come along, this is an engrossing read, It took two sits for me to read this, it grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go, It follows Detective Alex Cross and his adventure to Stop Gary Murphy/Soneji who appears to have a split personality and he's been accused of murdering two children, one is a famous movie star's child. It's up to Alex to hypnotize Gary and get the truth, he meets Jezzie Flanagan an FBI agent whom he falls in love with. This book will shock you until the ending which has an amazing twist to it. I recommend Beginners of James Patterson this Book, I also recommend it to any body, If you like this read Cat & Mouse which has Gary Soneji in it to. I cannot wait for Violets Are Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Soneji is a frightening character!","review":"James Patterson has created one of the most frightening characters in recent memory. What makes Gary Soneji so scary? Well, I think it is because Patterson has made him so believable. Gary Soneji is someone who could be living next to you right now.This book is fast paced and scary. It is a great read, especially if you have seen the film. They are very different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Patterson","review":"I've read almost every James Patterson novel (once you start you really can't stop) and I enjoyed this one the most. It's as fast-reading and exciting as the Alex Cross books, but the story is infinitely more amazing and the imagery is surprisingly sensitive and beautiful for a writer who can often be so blood-and-guts. If you like Patterson even a little bit, buy this right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson--the master of dumbing down prose","review":"I truly believe that Patterson believes three-fourths of the world (if not more) is illiterate. This book irritated the hell out of me. For goodness sakes, I am a sentient, intelligent person who can structure a sentence and appreciate a good phrase.What is this regurgitated madness?

I regret asking her to get it. I've used dozens of telescopes and could never get this one to work at all and I do mean at all. I put it in the closet for a few years. My child is asking for one so I pulled it out. One knob was broken off. Still couldn't get anything to work and in less than 5 minutes another knob fell off. I'm never buying any Bushnell product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I got this as a gift a couple years ago for my 5 yr anniversary at work. I tried it a time or two back then, then put it back in the box. I pulled it out tonight to try it with my kids, and the focus gear stripped. This has about an hour of use on it total, and has been stored indoors, it its original packaging. When i tried to focus it, I felt a grinding, and as it extended I can see the teeth on the track are stripped off. Now it won't move at all.I didn't pay a cent for it, and I'm still annoyed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Boredom!","review":"This is the worst \\"biography\\" I've ever read. So much that it took me more than a year to complete.It's just a succession of VERY long-winded, very boring critiques of each of the writer's plays. Biographical facts are only half-heartedly tacked on at the start, and reading them I came to find out that I didn't even like Orton and his \\"friend\\" and felt they got the exact fates they deserved.This book was so stagnant and such a frustrating read that I actually began to hate the author! I wish I had NEVER ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS GAME","review":"I saw this game one day and I said, \\"what did they do to conker!?...?\\". I was so mad I didn't know what to do. I was really upset. Conker was such a cute squirrel and so nice looking and friendly until they made Conkers bad fur day.This game is a very bad game, and I don't think any kid no matter what age should paly this game, even if you are a hundred years old. This game is nothing but bad violence! This game also has other bad things I will not mention. I Think this game should be banned from the public. And I hope if you are smart you will listen to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"This game is so, so NASTY! Everything is sick and gory! A do not buy! I hate it! I hate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like just plain nonsense to me","review":"What is the plot to this crap? Huh? You don't have to buy this game to notice how stupid it is. Even the title suggests stupidity. Just another lame excuse for everything that makes a videogame a waste of money. Hallelujah it's one for one in the negative camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty squirrel.","review":"Way back when this game came out the hype was unreal.A mature game for adult gamers...on Nintendo?Yup.And from the companies then golden child Rare to top things off.Ok...So besides a dirty, drunken, foul mouthed squirrel what do we get?Spot on control.Excellent graphic.Interesting moments of game play.And of course a dirty, drunken, foul mouthed squirrel.The game play was what Rare did best, mainly hop around and collect things.Either you like the platformer collect a thons or you don't.Granted, by this time the formula was getting a tad stale after Mario, Banjo Kazooie and countless other collect a thons by various companies.Still...an interesting game that was WAY ahead of its time in terms of adult content.Conker is worth checking out for the sheer vulgar over kill alone.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"vulgar squirl","review":"this game is fun and good graphics. so many creative levels and people.this game is 15 hours long. not long for a video game. its for people over 17 for the vulgar bathroom humour. i have seen the type of humour in PG_13 movies. is it for people 17 and up? i say 13 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAHAHAHA!","review":"I laugh every time I turn this game on. It's a never-ending comedy. Usually, I look for games with direction. I immediately knew this game had no direction. But it's funny! I live to fight with potty-mouthed dung beetles and hook up a fat bumble-bee king with a big-breasted sunflower. Mutant robot haystacks, singing piles of... exploding rats, and drunk scarecrows; these are the makings of a classic.Buy the game. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST GAME EVER!!!!!!","review":"This is the best game ever for the N64. First, it has the best graphics ever. And the best sound. And the best gameplay. I don't think it should have a M rating. I read the review that said it wasn't worse than a PG-13, and the one that said 20+. I went with the one that said PG-13. I was right. I am 13 years old and I don't think this game is so bad. It is a little above teen, but it isn't anywhere near an M. I would call it a T-M, for ages 15+. I know I'm 13, but I'm more mature than most 17 year olds. I have heard every curse and insult in this game at my lunch table at school. The game seems like it encourages drinking, but the drinking usually is used so that Conker can do dumb thigs which take you to new places that would seem very odd and stupid if he was sober."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conker's Bad Fur Day","review":"Truly the best game I have seen in my entire life. With the best multiplayer of all time. A bit pricey at ... but well worth it. The game has an M rating but isnt really that bad. So if you are 17 or older and have a little extra dough go buy it now and you will laugh yourself silly. It isnt impossible to win but it is still pretty challenging. Are you still reading? Well go buy the game already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very hi-tech for n-64 game","review":"i think that they did a very good job on this game. hard in some spots but thats the fun part : playing till u get it. there was a lot of things u have to do in each level and i'm still not sure if i have done EVERYTHING, i always find more stuff as i go back. plus the story line was good and the little spots of video during game time was a good way to keep the story going and acted as a break between levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Game Get It!!!!!","review":"This game is the best. It has great multiplayer mode. The chapter levels is really fun and funny. Conker says everything that you would probably say. Does funny things. Every game should be like this. By this I mean the swearing, the multiplayer, and his actions. This game is fun and funny as hell at the same time. I don't know any other game like it. If you like blowing things up and laugh at the same time buy this game now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Game Around","review":"Never before have I played a game that has managed to make me laugh so much, I had to stop and rest because my stomach hurt.And it doesn't stop there - the mix of graphics, sound, story and plain ole' fun was enough for me to aimlessly play this game for hours...Rare knows how to push the Nintendo 64 to it's limits, and they take the time to ensure every game reaches those limits. Not to mention; they understand what gamers are looking for in a game.<>All in all, Nintendo puts it best- It's not the hardware or how many polygons it can push. It's the software; making our games fun is what counts.\\"Although I can't wait to see Rare push the Gamecube to it's limits, Conquers BFD will more than satisfy me until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Outstanding!!","review":"This game is the coolest game ever. It has realistic scenes like a movie. This game is a clonning between Banjo Kazzoie and Donkey Kong 64.I would buy this game. But before I go if parents are seeing this revew, a little secret for you lads.......... If your child is under seventeen....PLEASE...... DO ......NOT....... BUY..... THIS..... GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"much fun!!","review":"i dont know why people say its only for 17 year olds and up they still let me buy and rent even though im 13.i give this a five star game cuz of the gore,blood,gameplay,cussing,graphics, well its all good.i stayed up 3 nights without even sleaping playing conkers bfd.its takes you about 1 or 2 weeks or months to beat conkers bad fur day.(it took me 2 months to beat this game!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"fun idea, but....","review":"I liked the idea of a adult themed game for the Nintendo platform. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired (especially from a well-respected house like Rare). The cut scenes are fine, and most of the controls are intuitive. But I found that the lack of a decent camera ruins the game. Usually you can't see what is happening around you, and the camera moves during crucial game maneuvers. Just a poorly coded camera routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conker could kick Mario's ...[but]@$$ any day!","review":"Well, its true. Anyway, I haven't officially BOUGHT the game yet, I just keep on renting, and renting, and renting, and renting, ect. This game is definately one of the greatest games available for the N64. First up is graphics. They are beautiful. BFD looks as good as Banjo-Tooie, while keeping a smoothe framerate. Next, we have music. Instead of the normal MIDIs that dribble out of games, BFD uses MP3s for its music, and it really does show. Also, the Great Mighty Poo's song is SOOOOOOOO catchy. 3rd, we have voices {for once}. They are great. Conker has an endearing little lisp, Berri {Conker's girlfriend} has that like, y'know, Valley Girl talk. All of the voices are incredibily done. And, most importantly, humor. This game is funny, but in that South Park kind of way. Also, to Nintendo, if you ever make a Super Smash Brothers 2, BE SURE TO PUT CONKER IN IT! Because we all would like to see who the REAL king of the video game mascots is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"#@&%;!\\" Game Ever !!","review":"I have to say, I've never laughed harder at any game I have ever played in my life.It,s pure genius, the violence, the vulgarity, the profanity.... I loved every minute of it. The different movie spoofs throughout the game made it hard to stop once you start, wondering what was comming next.I also enjoyed the various gameplay and different themes , and it was not hard to play, but not easy either , it was just right. I guess what I'm tryin to say is I see nothing wrong with this game, it's one of the best games I have ever played ever. I even liked the horrible ending, it was the perfect ending to the perfect twisted, sick game. Buy it, you'll like it. trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"conker bad fur day","review":"conker bad fur day is the bestest game of all. But one thing why does it have to say beep when it says the Fword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game created, and earns its M rating","review":"Ok, this game BLOWS your mind in the first few minutes, and it is dog garn HILARIOUS. I don't know what these other people complain about for the \\"bleeping out\\" of some of the words. If you noticed, the bleep out some of the stuff just enough so you can make out what they are saying anyway (and I find it twice as funny). Also, haven't you people noticed all the adult innuendo in the game? Geez, there's some stuff in there I would not even here at school. Plus, every scene is funny, such as a few barnyard items wondering who is going to kick Conker's butt, to the dramatic and now hilarious Saving Private Ryan scene, to even the MATRIX!!! How cool is that. The multiplaer is also a blast, with the best game being War, Beach, Deathmatch, or Heist for their violence and bad language. To put it short, BUY BUY BUY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY!","review":"If you can stand the toilet humor and foul language, it is absolutely hilarious. The Matrix, Alien, Saving Private Ryan, Terminator, Dracula, and many other movies are rolled up into the gameplay. The graphics are one of the best I've ever seen on N64, especially with a cheat for the multiplayer levels (you can find those on the internet). Every level is so different from another and keeps the game interesting, and my friends and I can't get enough of demolishing eachother in the muliplayer games with evil teddy bears. This game is a must have for every N64 collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER","review":"they should have come out with this game sooner it is so much fun there is this one part where thier is this farting mouse andwhen he farts a big green cloud comes out of his but it is so funny and if you run into the cloud conker throws up there is t5his really cool part where you learn how to use a slingshot and you have to shoot these bugs and there is this one part where there is this big gargoyle in your way and it wont move so you have to hit it with your frying pan it is so funny i think this is one of the best games ever made way to go rare"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the hate towards the game?","review":"I was looking through the reviews and I came across some review that just made me laugh. I can't understand how people can hate this game due its graphic content and its gore. Sure this game wasn't going to be developed this way but I think that RARE did a pretty good job in making Conker's Bad Fur Day. The first time that I played this game I was instantly hooked, despite being eight years of age. I can understand why people don't like the controls because at firs they are hard to handle but once you get used to them, the game becomes a great single or multi-player experience. This game is definitely one of the best games that I have played besides The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The storyline is by far the funniest and the most well-crafted surpassing Ocarina's. I've been looking forward to getting this game soon, if for the right price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hangover [Squirrel Edition]","review":"This game is context sensitive (sensitive to context). If you like shooting rodents in the head with sniper guns, blowing teddies to smithereens, and getting drunk to pee on people, this is the perfect game for you.

One hell of a find!","review":"This author who took the time to actually present himself with an upclose and personal view of what prison life is like is profound.

The choice of champions included goes beyong the usual list of world titleholders and Olympic champions to stars true skating fans rarely see and would love to know more about, such as spinning phenom Lucinda Ruh.Most of the stories are personal, giving more insight into the skaters lives than a collection of competition results and technical explanations would. For anyoe who follows figure skating, this is a must-have book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read!","review":"While this book is not long on depth, it does give some entertaining insights into the thoughts behind the images. Great for younger readers as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"Despite this book's title, the author provides no useful information regarding the art of angling with flies, and readers seeking advice on fishing the waters of Colorado, where the author lives, should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for teens","review":"The reference to \\"books\\" in the title is a lead-in to topics of a more serious nature. The book is aimed at teenagers and the problems that may confront them.The author, a teenager in the 1970s, came from a troubled home. In desperation, she reached out to her pastor for help. He was the Reverand Kenneth W. Rogahn of Messiah Lutheran Church in St. Louis, MO. The story is about the many types of issues--guilt, forgiveness, gossip, parents, and others--that faced her as a teenager. It shows how a very compassionate pastor responded from a Christian perspective, with answers framed in a way that makes it easy for teenagers of today to apply them to their own challenges, stresses, and doubts.This book should be of much interest to teenagers who are reluctant to seek counsel from their parents or to those whose parents have been of no help."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I really loved this book! It seems like all the Christan books for kids my age are about obeying your parents and not going to far on a date and all that stuff. I learned alot from the paster and the auther without the book being so churchy or religous. This book was fun. I wish the auther would write another book continueing where this one leaves off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story!","review":"This book will make you laugh, cry and take a real look at yourself and your relationship to others and to Jesus Christ. I fell in love with Pastor Rogahn. He covers everything from gossip to sin to nonconformists to making fun of others without sounding as though he's preaching. This would make a great book for teens to study together in youth groups, discussing one of Pastor's topics each week. The author makes you feel as though you're right there in the pastor's library with them arranging the books. This is a wonderful true story of the friendship between a troubled young girl and her pastor. Great book for teens or for anyone who would like a refresher course on what it really means to be a Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The..??","review":"I like John L and think he's a great actor but this movie wasn't up to his level.It started out real good almost like a documentary where he's talkng about life on the streets and what its all about.

Very satisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"Empire has to be one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. If you watch the first like 30mins, you say to yourself, wow this movie might be cool but then you find out that the plot just falls apart and in the end, the movie just [isn't good]. All this movie had to do was make the plot thicker to make it good but it chose not to be any good. Just so you know, Fat Joe is in the movie for about the first 10mins. And the two main villains like the trailer portrays (Denise Richards and her BF) are pretty pathetic. And even when they get to the conflict height between John Legiuzamo and them two, it ends absolutely pathetically.I have seen better conflict/drama in tv shows. You are just better off watching old sopranos or kingpin."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked this movie","review":"i liked this movie. its sort of like scarface. but its definately worth renting. i'm glad i saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You judge a man by what he respects","review":"You judge a man by what he respects or disrespects. John Leguizamo, who would be otherwise marked as a brilliant talent has chosen to denigrate the best and brightest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Thought It Was A Comedy!","review":"This film was terrible. Leguizamo as a South Bronx drug dealer. I was kinda shocked that as a member of the audience I was expected to take this movie seriously. how can a drug dealer get bamboozled out of nearly million dollars by some preppy, wetnosed, somewhat inexperienced wallstreet broker and his girlfriend? And the ending? Oh that wasn't expected. I guess you shouldn't tick off the slightly overweight Columbiana by not payin' her. She's liable to send her psychotic brother after you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's \\"Carlito's Way\\"","review":"Actually, this movie could be a spin-off of the \\"Carlito's Way\\" character, Benny Blanco from the Bronx, also played by John Leguizamo. The story is pretty much the cliched druge dealer trying to go straight routine but yet everytime he tries to get out....they pull him back in! Leguizamo is also just not believable as a major tough guy drug kingpin. A gay hairdresser from Queens? Yes. A macho drug dealer? No. Also what good is having Denise Richards in a movie if she's not going to be naked? That's like putting Arnold Schwarzenegger in a movie where he doesn't kill anyone. It's pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movies are better than this one","review":"This movie is so bad that I'm not even goign to say HOW bad it is. Suffice to say, John Leiguzamo is rapidly goign the way of Cuba Gooding Jr., making really, really, really bad movies for cash. Talented people in movies so bad, Sharon Stone passed. The plot has such a simplistic point that it's a wonder it go made. Is the dumbing down of movies going dumber and dumber to now capture the young rap lovers? Yes, yes it is. This movie is so bad that I was surprised someone didn't say Leiguzamop's name aloud to pander further to the audience as if we couldn't read. Oh and he dies in the end on the run in such an obvious place---he runs from the Latin mob to Puerto Rico--------that I was upset at first when I saw he was still alive. And when you're gratified that the lead character dies, you're in a REALLY bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire","review":"It is a great movie! Inspirational may be a word used for it.

Romero's Land Of The Dead, The Honeymooners) plays a hotshot street thug from the South of Bronx who winds up making a business deal with wallstreet hotshot, played by Peter Sarsgaard (the upcoming The Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Soon, Leguizamo's life turns upside down as he finds out that his business partner is trying to scam him. This is a very intriguing story but it leaves nothing to fill in the gaps except for a good performance by John Leguizamo which keeps this from going down in the dumps. Also starring Denise Richards (The World Is Not Enought, Valentine) as another ditzy woman with sexual ways, Rappers Fat Joe and Treach (Jason's Lyric), Nestor Serrano (The Negotiator) and a weird role for Isabella Rosselini (Death Becomes Her, Immortal Beloved) as a druglord...very weird and the hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRACKS","review":"1.

She's been having a rough time. Getting rejected by the Ocean Agency, eviction, and the death of her only relative, her grandfather. She's taken in by a group of investigators that will do anything for the right price. All of her coworkers are pretty quirky and crazy. She's a tough little thing so she sticks with it and has fun, even if she doesn't realize it. She has amnesia. Her family apparently died in an accident years before. But there is a dangerous secret the Ocean Agency is keeping from her. Can she regain her memory and remember the truth. And what will happen if she does.This anime is a lot of fun. There is plenty of drama and action. The laughs keep coming too. These scantily clad chicks never stop getting into danger. The animation and the voice acting in this series is good.

I almost have my blue belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and discovered that while reading through these very helpful step-by-step instructions and detailed photographs, I had many more things to learn about Jiu Jitsu. An awesome book to read because of the real-life-fighting value it has. Royler Gracie is one of the most skilled Jiu Jitsu practitioners I have ever seen. I highly recommend picking one up, regardless of skill level.

I e-mailed D-Link and the response I got was, \\"It appears your keyboard and mouse are not compatible.\\" It appears? It appears I'm going to tell everyone what a piece of crap this product and your service are.Granted, I was planning on buying a different mouse and I may still try to use this KVM, but I've got a feeling I'll end up buying the Connectpro KVM that everyone is going on about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Fine but I Hate It!

These strips are not made for the user to be able to adjust the size of the area being treated, so in my case it is not my best option. This would work better if the user could cut the round medicated disk to size first, or else be able to choose from a few different sizes of the medicated discs in each strip.

The cartoony look highly appealed to me, so as the RPG environment. There is so much to do apart from the main storyline, like collecting Star Pieces. The controls are easy to get used to, and the sound effects are cool too! The only flaw is that you won't probably play it again for the second time, as there's no multiplayer stuff in the game.Graphics 18/20Gameplay 36/40Control 13/15Sound 9/10Replay 6/15Total 82/100"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Cool Game","review":"Hey this is a really cool game.

These facts + so much more are what make Paper Mario the best RPG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun and super addicting!","review":"I absolutely love this game! It may seem childish and cartoony, but it really is an incredibly deep game! There's so much stuff to do in between each chapter: play plames, buy stuff, deliver letters, search for star pieces, get badges, check Mario's mail, upgrade party members, get different spells, whatever... It's really easy to get the hang of things after you beat the first castle. And it's really addicting, too! It's pretty easy to sit down for hours straight and just keep playing and playing. I've already logged about 12 hours playing it, and I haven't even gotten to the third castle yet! And even if you're faster than me (of course you are, because I'm slow) it'll be sure to last you a good long while if you do everything there is to do. I definitely recommend it!

I would like to see one a little more like the originals for N64 but this is a close one. I must admit the beginning is very long and boring, lots of reading. The gameplay is deep and addictive (i love games like that) and is easy to learn. This should be a favorite for all gamers in decades to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is such a great game!","review":"Paper Mario is one of the best N64 games I've ever played! The graphics are bright and colorful. The story line is entertaining. The game is of a medium difficulty, it's easy enough to pass, neither my roommate or me needed the hint book, but the game is full of things that you need to figure out! Its an addictive game, and its one that you probably will want to play again even after you beat it. The only thing I didn't like about this game is the battle mode; instead of just jumping on the bad guys to kill them you actually enter a battle mode. I got a little annoying after a while. I think that people of all ages will enjoy this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Surprise","review":"I remember a few years ago reading about this game in my Nintendo Power magazine. I got really excited when I heard about a sequel to Super Mario RPG. But when I looked at the screen shots, the game looked almost pathetic. With the flat, barely animated characters and fuzzy backgrounds, it looked like a game for little kids. But I was wrong. The game is lots of fun. There is much to enjoy about it. A good story, and all the places to go and side-quests to go on (a bit too many actually) make the game better. The game isn't that hard though. There are many people to talk to and a lot of different characters in your party, from a smart, spunky Goomba, a cute lightning guy, and a Lakitu.The graphics aren't that of a normal game, but that is why it's called Paper Mario. The music is very annoying. Where did Koji Kondo go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The original","review":"Lacks the polish of its predecessors but a great game in its own right.

The graphics are very clever and the 2-D and 3-D effects blend magnificently. The game just wasn't as addictive or fun as the original. The story was just same story almost every Mario game has-save Peach from Bowser. The games and puzzles were very easy. It only lasted for about 1/4 of the time RPG did. Also, the sidekicks Mario encounters are boring and just good versions of the bad guys in the game. What happened to Mallow and Geno?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good game but its just not worth it","review":"I rented this game and was glad I did. The gameplay, graphics, and characters are ok.

Mario Rpg was made by SQUARESOFT, and if nintendo hadn't made so many stupid decisions(the n64 not using CD's ) squaresoft would still be working for them, and the n64 wouldn't be so childish and terrible.

At first I thought this game would be excellent because I LOVED Super Mario for the SNES. When I put the game in, I wasted so much time on a LONG and boring intro that you HAVE to watch. 2nd Mario talks to EVREYBODY in the game, which adds to more boredom. May I also include there is no sound? 3rd, everytime Mario has a battle with a stupid bad guy, it goes into a scene similar to Pokemon. You do your attack, than Mario gets attacked himself! What is that?! If I made the game, I would just make it so Mario and him fought normally!4th, the graphics are just terrible.5th, the music REALLY got on my nerves.So ignore the majority of people that say it is the best.

I finished it within a week, but that was only 'cuz I rented it and I don't like returning a game I haven't beaten. It probably would've taken me a lot longer if I hadn't been so dedicated to it. The battle sequences are a lot of fun, especially once you upgrade your party members. I was a little disappointed that the BP(Badge Points) maximum was 30, which means Mario is limited to activating a very few powers at a time. Still, that did not deter me. It also would've been nice if the Castle was back on the ground after you beat it, but that may be good for some people 'cuz you can go back and battle Bowser again after you have beaten it. I felt that way about Ocarina Of Time, 'cuz the bosses were so cool in that game.

Don't get me wrong, the game is a great game but I would like to see a true sequel from SQUARE for the GBA or GCN. Also I would like to see more appearances of Mallow and Geno.

These are just a few of the MANY problems with the game. I don't know what to make of this(not the game). It seems that Nintendo has come out with quite an extensive trend of incredibly stupid games.

My only criticism is, I felt the ending was ever so slightly anti-climactic. Nevertheless, it's thought-provoking and highly imaginative, boasting a rich array of characters; some endearing, some scary - all memorable. It's also original, even if the 'hero having to learn and grow to find himself' theme is not. This book will stand up to repeat readings, which is important for young readers. You don't have to like cats to enjoy it, though you may look at them in a different way after reading \\"Varjak Paw\\".What I would love now?

Ignore the clich��d and pedestrian opening chapters - from there onwards the narrative opens up into a breathtaking and powerful coming-of-age story, by turns charming, sinister and exhilarating.Said knows how to keep a narrative moving effortlessly and it's a shame that few adult novels manage to be so frightening or uplifting. There are strong female characters, dastardly villains and glorious set pieces and it's no insult to say that parts of this novel reminded me of both Watership Down and Kafka on the Shore. An added bonus were the atmospheric illustrations by Dave McKean, who really understands how cats move.Personally, it impressed me far more than Harry Potter or His Dark Materials and would be my pick for best children's story of recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad software","review":"You must shutdown your antivirous to install.

Every time I use it or every other time I use it, I find myself having to pull it away from the wall part way through a cleaning session because it runs into the wall and stays there or climbs it's front end up the wall so that only the back wheels remain on the floor. Also several times found it had mysteriously floated up to the surface of the pool. I used the Robo-Kleen for 1 month during last year's season and 4 months during this season before the motor stopped functioning. And now it is out of the warranty period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was happy until...","review":"It worked great for the first season and I was extremely happy that I bought it. I hate cleaning the pool so the fact that I could drop this in and let it do its magic was to me, well..., magic. Per the instructions I put the unit in storage this past winter and just re-opened my pool a couple weeks ago to find that my robotic pool-sucking friend lost all of its powers. It seems not only to have lost its suction power but it also doesn't move around the pool as gracefully as it did last season. I made sure there wasn't anything clogging the propeller (there wasn't) - beyond that I can only hypothesis that there was some internal malfunction. The warranty expired so now I am grappling with the prospect of purchasing another robot or going back to the manual method. Because of its lack of durability I can only give this product 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product wont last","review":"I had Robo-Kleen in june 07 used it half of last year, this year it doesnt work.

Second one bought lasted the same time period, this time, seems to have a mind of it's own, and the wheels just won't work, not enough \\"steam\\" to get them to move across the pool floor. It is still under warranty but not wanting to go through the headache since the shipping costs alone could buy me one of those bug cleaners that uses your pool filter and it has much better reviews than this thing. Since we have a sand filter now, it won't be as much of a headache to use one of this type for our 24 ft above ground pool. Robo Kleen works great when it works but not reliable and return process is not worth it. In my opininion, this product is a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sux!","review":"Read the reviews before you buy it - they almost all say that it works great for weeks then craps out!

It is quite flimsy, so no surprise. I tried to locate spare parts on the internet. No luck. Called the manufacturer. They don't sell parts. They told me we could send the unit in and they would fix it. Estimated cost $140-$180. For a $3 part!

The second year I had to have it repaired 2 times. I had a cleaner that worked off the pump but gave it away when I bought the Robo-Kleen because I was so impressed with it. It's now totally broken and I am now going back to those cleaners that work off the filter. They cost a lot less and don't break. Even if I had to replace it every 2 years (which I didn't), it would still be cheaper and less of a headache than the robo-kleen. I'm giving it 2 stars only because when it worked, it did do a good job.

UUA promises loving support in one's own spiritual journey and demands nothing except that which one can or will consecrate to others in the congregation.

So reading this book now, after almost 20 years of being a UU was a very UU experience. I disagree with the authors on some points, but that's what's great about the UU faith. I learned a lot through this conflict, so from that perspective, this can be a great book. If you read this expecting a dogmatic \\"what a UU is\\", you'll be disappointed.The sense I got from the book was that this is a good introduction if you are coming from a Judeo-Christian faith, or that is what you are most familiar with. If you are an Athiest, Wiccan, Buddhist, etc, the latter chapters may seem to be coming from a very different perspective and may not be as clear or relevant to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice overview of the Unitarian Universalist religion","review":"Our UU group is reading this 2 chapters at a time & discussing weekly. This is a good pace because the material is better digested in bits. The Forrest Church chapters and the John Buehren chapters which alternate through the book are written in very different styles, but this works well. Not a 5 star because so many of the quotations from UUs are from 100-150 years ago - are there no current UUs worth quoting?This is a good book for those already in the UU church or for those seeking information before joining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother's Christmas Gift","review":"We haven't used the product yet, but it came quickly, and in great shape.

And what was up with Servo...with that slow monotone voice, he reminded me of an old teacher I had in high school, and that isn't a good thing.So Unless you're a completist, I wouldn't bother picking up 'The Crawling Hand'. It has the distinction of being the only MST3K movie I've ever passed out while watching.I'd definately rather spend my money on Manos: The Hands of Fate, Eegah, or the Pod People (just to name a few)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first MST3K I ever saw...","review":"came from an era when I was barely out of training pants, and I thought \\"The Crawling Hand\\" was hilarious; the show, also, had a freshly original, B-show vibe unseen on television. Well, over a decade has passed since I saw this episode, and watching it recently I couldn't believe how primitive it seemed. As mentioned in other reviews, there are long pauses in between riffs, Tom Servo's voice could induce sleep, and the deliveries are toneless and lack enthusiasm. Save for a few moments (far and between), this is a truly painful experience, and that's coming from a FAN of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many 'Hand' Puns...","review":"Overly thematic on the jokes, not enough pop-culture references as in later MST3K years...Just not as enjoyable as the other's I've seen.

And even though I knew that the first few seasons weren't very good, I bought it anyway. I did laugh alot... but I barely made it though the movie... It was interesting seeing the old set though. The host segments weren't too funny... The invention exchange wasn't very funny or interesting. The riffs were pretty funny, but they made too many jokes about hands and Gilligan's Island(since the actor that played the skipper is in The Crawling Hand). And as for Josh Weinstein... well, his voice just isn't very funny. And I like Frank!(who doesn't appear in this episode)... Ok, I think that I am done now. Overall, this episode IS good... it's just that I wish that I spent my $20 on an episode from a different season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly Interesting","review":"This is the one first episodes of MST3K and the earlist you can get on video. It's delight to see how things looked in the old days, particuly to anyone who bacame a fan from the SciFi channel episodes. The quality of the jokes is not up to the standard it later became, but are still good enough to give several good belly laughs to anyone with the slightest interest in the show. A good buy overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"MST3K's early years","review":"It's not a BAD effort, but it is from the first season (1989) and is really quite different than you may be expecting. Tom Servo has a different voice, and they are all green in the foreground instead of the black you may be used to seeing them in the theature. They are also kinda slow when it comes to offering jokes directed at the movie, so much so, you find YOURSELF making funnier ones without getting in their way. There are much better ones, so get it if you are trying to finish off your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my money!","review":"I am a huge fan of this series and was shocked at how appallingly bad this episode was. Despite some good knocks during the movie, this was a waste of $ which I could have spent on something else (perhaps \\"Catalina Caper\\" or \\"Wild World of Batwoman\\"). Being a veteran fan of the show, I read in the Episode Guide that the makers of the show wouldn't release any of the early episodes because they weren't up to the standards of their later work. How right they were. I should have listened to them, but unfortunately due to my curiosity, I wasted my hard-earned money, valuable time, and the makers of the show have irreversibly embarassed themselves. Let's hope that they redeem themselves with some excellent future video releases (a few more \\"Shorts\\" videos, please, hosted by Tom or Crow or Gypsy?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts me to do this...","review":"... but I can only give this video two stars. I love MST3K to the deepest depths of my soul but even I found it hard to get through this episode from the Comedy Central years (Season One)... Dr. Larry Erhardt (TV Frank's predecessor) is annoying in the extreme and I wanted to fast-forward through most of the host segments with him in it. Even Joel seems a little lackluster in this one. Buy this ONLY if you are a die-hard fan of the show and want to complete your collection or you are just very interested in the early years of MST3K and have money to burn. Some of the riffs made me laugh out loud... but there are startlingly few of them (even compared to Comedy Central years: Season Two--when I started to watch the show). If you are a first time viewer of MST3K or became a fan during the Sci-Fi years, I would recommend Eegah, Skydivers or either Shorts 1 and 2 to start you off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it, it's bad.","review":"It's not the special effects or sets, it's not Servo's voice, it's not Dr. Erhardt (though all of those things are terrible, no question - probably worse than the movie). The Crawling Hand is, like most of their early episodes, just plain bad due to bad, unfunny writing. Sure, they were new at it and hadn't found their niche yet, but that's no excuse to release a turkey like this (or any of their early episodes) to video, where it may be some poor soul's first exposure to this fine show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bergan Aut-O-Dine","review":"I bought this dog feeder to replace my old Bergan Aut-O-Dine feeder.

However, while it describes the basic steps, it falls short of giving you the detailed information required to develop, back test, and assess the results of a technical trading system. Basic common-sence stuff about testing and money manegement but insufficient depth to actually use this correctly. No discussion about referential statistics (statistical significance, std deviation, std error, etc.. all the maths you NEED if you really want to build and test a robust system) Also, Pring correctly point out that no system will work all the time but doesn't clearly explain (aside from waiting for mounting losses) how you should look for warning signs that the system is performing below expectations.

This game is not really good because you don't get to play much of the game. The bad part is that you can talk to Pikichu only at ceratin times of the game. And plus Pikichu only understands about ten to fifteen words that you say. Sometimes you have to speak loud and clear because Pikichu won't understand you. The bottom line is this game is a waste of money (And you wonder why they lowered it to half price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey You ...","review":"This game is so stupid. You have to say Pikachu about a million times just so you can get the little yellow butthead to turn around. The comercial is bad too. The kid cares for the stupid Pikachu more than his dog.

Pikachu is a cute & funny Pokemon & the idea of spending a day with one of your own is an exciting idea for any Pokemon fan. But the game doesn't work. Pikachu rarely recognizes any of the commands given, and getting him to do what you want him to do is virtually impossible, (pun intended.)

I hate Pikachu and this game is completely based around Pikachu and there is even Pikachu on the box! What stupid person thought of Pikachu the germ of the world and the stupidest Pokemon ever known! Pikachu is stupid in the show. He walks alongside Ash all day. I wished Team Rocket would take Ash's Pikachu and when he fought them to try to obtain it back, they never give it back.

We hooked it up right away. But after about 5 minutes the excitement faded and he went to play with his other toys. Even with my husband and myself feeding him the lines to use, he couldn't get Pikachu to do what he wanted. When he finished playing, I gave it a shot thinking maybe he wasn't saying the words clearly enough, but it still did it's own thing. Pikachu would walk past the item we told him to get and do something completely different. As soon as we finally got one thing done on a stage(if we were lucky), it would say it's time to leave and so we got no where in the game.

Rent it, or if a friend has one, try it out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't even call this a game!","review":"This game is nothing more than Nintendo trying to capitalize on the Pok��mon craze. First off, the graphics are horrible. They are blurry and not very detailed. This is due to the fact the game has been out for a few years in Japan and was just recently released in the US. But the big problem of the game is how boring it is. The voice system is cool at first but it gets very boring after the first level. The problem is, you usually can only say one or two word phrases and half of the time, Pikachu doesn't understand your voice. An example of the tedium of this game is the fishing level. You would think a fishing game would be cool but all you do is tell Pikachu to \\"reel it in\\" everytime the fishing line moves. This goes on for about 5 minutes until you do another level that is just as boring. If you must try this game, rent it but don't waste your money on this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the mockers","review":"Do'nt believe what other people say.

This game has crude graphics, an out of date processor, the whole plot of the story is garbage by any standards, and finally the controls to control Pikachu are impossible to handle. The hole idea behind this game is just a few minigames combined with a few stone age puzzles. Presently this game is the worst apitamy of the Nintendo64 console. I would not at all be surprised if they come out with a new game that follows the trend of incredibly pointless games. They have obviously put about a few days of effort into this or somebody needs to be fired. If you are planning to buy this game, save your money and get help. Save your money for a more challenging game for you or your toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst game ever-do no buy it unless u want 2 waste ur money","review":"this game is easily described- stupid and boring. i liked pokemon when i buyed it and thought that it would be a really cool game. boy was i wrong. it is boring, and the things u do are just plain ritarded. i bought it on sale so i didnt have to pay the full price-otherwise i would have screamed. just listen to me and do not buy this game, unless you want to torture some one with the boredom of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have voice rcognition unit and microphone.","review":"I ordered this game from videonational.com and it arrived with missing parts.

He is heavily in to Pokemon both cards and Nintendo games. It was too high a price to pay for something that was played so little. He was easily bored after just a few times. At (this price) you really can't go wrong. Some kids may love it. But if your child is looking for the usual \\"Pokemon action\\" in a game, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"Alright, I may not be the biggest Pokemon fan there is, but I know a flop when I see one. I don't know about you, but I'm sick of seeing those little Japanese toys that you have to feed and take care of, and if you leave it for a second it dies. I suggest pulling out one of those old Tamagotchi's, it will save you some cash.Overall, I give Hey You! Pikachu 2 stars. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because even though this game is pointless, that Pikachu sure is cute! I would only recommend it to people who's kids are die-hard Pokemon fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is [bad]","review":"This game is [bad].I hate any game that has to do with pokemon.My little brother bought this game thinking it would be fun.The first time i played it i almost threw the controller at the ground and then set it on fire.He never understands what you say,he gets angry for no reason, and he throws [stuff] at you and laughs.I tried to sell it on ebay buy it now for 1 pennie and still no one bought it.

I played the game and talked to Pikachu and all that (It wouldn't recognize my voice most of the time). But after I did everything, which took about twenty minutes, there was nothing else to do. If you want to rent the game to try out the voice recognition that is good. but dont waste ... to buy the game and not like it after you've played it more than three times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ahead of its time","review":"This game is trying a very cutting-edge kind of technology and putting it into a video game, which has never been done before at this scale. That means that means that the character interaction with the player hasn't fully developed. Pikachu doesn't respond to you half the time when you talk to him. If this game were on Gamecube (not N64), the graphics would be a lot better and the technology might fit in better. But over all, it's gonna be a while before this technology is fully mastered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I like Poke'mon, but do not buy this game!

This is the best one made yet; it is not a game. Sure the mini games are fun, but they are unrelated to Pikachu in any way, shape, or form. The lack of instructions and a VERY limited vocabulary leed to sheer frustration much of the time, and Pikachu recognizes only high-pitched voices, as the main audience is pre-pubescent. The game is a little addictive, but you end up asking yourself, \\"That's It?\\" And it is...it's not a big game, and it is at times not very fun either. It is life with Pikachu, which should be fun, but it's more like spending your life with your dog. He's fussy, noisy, and sometimes dumb. no real difference here. Rent this game if you're under 10, then go spend time with a real pet or a Tamagotchi or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't BuyThis piece of junk","review":"I got this guitar when i first started out mostly cus it fit my budget and a didn't know squat about guitars.

The story goes forward only because Preston is so tight lipped that Ike must stay in Huntington Beach to figure things out. This struck me as a bald-faced plotting device -- rather than something believable evolving out of Preston's character. The ending is fantastically ghoulish, and totally random. Nothing in the story lays the trail for it. Again, it didn't evolve naturally out of what came before. A good story should be a surprise without being a surprise, if that makes any sense.On the positive side character development is very good, for Ike and Hound especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surf life in Huntington Beach","review":"This is a great book about the dark side of surfing life in Huntington Beach, California.

I have kept it in the nursery to charge, but our newborn is still sleeping in a bassinet in our bedroom. Each evening, I grab the nightlight out of the nursery and put it on a shelf above the bassinet in our room.

The upside was I amassed all 3 seasons and watched them all back to back and while all 3 are fantastic, season 1 is just extraordinarily good.

It is so great to see a strong female character on television. The character of Veronica is intelligent, resilient, spunky and all-together amazing. Veronica Mars doesn't follow the mold of other shows, and really captivates audiences. Nothing that happens is ever obvious or expected.

Veronica Mars is a very worthy show to get any young person involved in. The shows deal with issues ranging from everyday high school problems to serious crimes. The themes are real problems that kids deal with and don't talk about. All issues are handled tastefully and never crude or over the top. This is an excellent show for any young person lacking confidence, struggling or just being a normal kid. The female roles in the show are exemplary: strong, confident and real. I recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronica Mars is smarter than me","review":"Veronica Mars is easily the best show on television right now. It's smart and sassy with intricately woven plots that keep you guessing at every turn. The superb writing staff of VM could teach the writers of Lost and Desperate Housewives a thing or two about pacing a believable, suspenseful long-term mystery arc, and they have more respect for the intelligence of their viewers than most other shows put together. The ensemble cast is unparalleled for talent and chemistry, and Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring are two of the best actors I've seen on television in a long, long time.No matter what anyone says, smart television is not dead: it's just moved to Mars. If you're not watching this show, you're missing out, and it's a must-have for DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronica Mars rocks! (She also takes cash.)","review":"No description could ever really capture the deliciously dark, twisted, tangled world of Veronica Mars. Suffice it to say that the acting is absolutely incredible, from its stunning title character (Kristen Bell) to its quirky guest stars (Harry Hamlin). Not to mention the intensely compelling Jason Dohring. They, with the help of some brilliant writing, can alternately elicit both uncontrollable giggles for their cleverness and gut-wrenching sympathy for their heartbreakingly real turmoil.Seriously, this show has completely spoiled me for all other shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This show is one of those few that really gets you thinking. Each episode of this season you're given little tidbits as to the whole Lily Cain mystery.. and it leaves you guessing... I absolutely love this show.

I've definitely been trying to recruit, recruit, recruit!! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!!","review":"I suppose that I will be one of many when I say that this show is fantastic. Don't think it's just for teenagers. This is a show that will appeal to any audience looking for witty dialogue, clever plots, and great actors. Try it! You'll be surprised how much you like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronica Mars Season 1","review":"This show is amazing! How did I miss this show when it was on TV? Too bad they only gave it 3 seasons :( Love, Love, Love Veronica Mars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I totally agree with the other comment... ended way before its time. I loved this show and watch it over again from time to time. I wish it had more than just 3 seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronica Mars","review":"Veronica Mars encompasses everything great in television - humour, tragedy, romance and mystery and compresses it into one compelling hour of must-see viewing. The cast is absolutely amazing and the concept, flawless with our teen heroine, Veronica Mars, employing, not brute force or promiscuity, but quick wit and intelligence to solve the many cases on her agenda - from locating a girl's lost dog to solving who really killed her best friend.For anybody who wants to be genuinely entertained and astounded a the same time, forget about heavyweight shows like LOST or The OC. Go watch Veronica Mars instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is the only thing I was looking forward to see every week on TV. Excellent writing with main story going across all the episodes and sub-stories that get resolved at the end of each episode. Veronica Mars is a 17 years old daughter of a private investigator, a former sheriff. She's helping him with his cases, has her own to solve and she's decided to find out who killed her best friend Lilly Kane. Almost all the answers get answered by the end of the season. Excellent acting from all the actors. I cannot praise highly enough Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars and Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"I missed the whole first season of Veronica Mars because I was watching other shows. I asked for it for Christmas this year just for the heck of it. I was hooked after the first episode, and finished the entire season in 5 days. This show is incredible. It has a likeable female lead, played by Kristen Belle. The supporting cast is also excellent, especially the characters of Logan Echolls(king of dry humor), Weevil Navarro, Duncan Kane,and Keith Mars. The show has a great plot, with a overlying mystery that takes the entire season to solve, but with a mini mystery and lots of drama in each individual episode. It also has the perfect blend of reality and oh-yeah-like-that-would-REALLY-happen suspense. It has ironic sarcasm and is full of fantastic one liners. I would recommend this show to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUV VERONICA","review":"I just can't get over how much I love this show. I just got done watching the season finale and i am so bummed cause I can't wait till the second season. I've watched from the first episode on and every show just amazes me! Who would have thought that upn would make such a great show! I can't wait till the first season comes out which should be in September according to the creators website."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sold","review":"I had heard all the reviews and it wasn't until Joss Whedon started praising this show that I decided to buy the DVD and give it a try myself. I had heard the comparisons to Buffy, Alias and Nancey Drew, which are right on, but this show is so much more. You have great scripts with witty dialogue, a central mystery(that isn't drawn out like Lost), great looking people to look at every week and most of of Kristen Bell who is wonderful in this.I look forward to Season 2 and hopefully it will have more extras which is the reason why I took one star away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show since Buffy!!","review":"If you loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then you'll love Veronica Mars! High school drama, solving mysteries, and great characters. This show is amazing!! It's fun, witty, and very smart. Veronica is a strong female character who goes to High school where she is not the most popular girl and at the same time she is trying to figure out who murdered her best friend. Every episode will take you one step closer to who killed Lilly Kane. Watch it! you WILL get hooked!!!!!! Best show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw Dropping Show","review":"This is by far the most amazing and spectacular show on TV. Currently airing on UPN at Tuesdays at 9PM ET/PT, it tells the story of a very smart, witty and resorceful teenager who attends High School and after school works in her Dad's Detective Agency. I started watching this show a month ago and loved it so much i saw Season 1 in two days and it's now my favorite show. If you liked Buffy and Alias you will LOVE this show.Alex"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Hear Me Now?","review":"One of the very best books I've ever read on this subject! Many scriptural references adds to credibility. This book changed our lives and after 38 years of marriage, my husband and I are fully communicating on all levels (physical, emotional, spiritual). We are using this book in our small groups study and find that many couples with lack of communication in their marriage open their hearts, become vulnerable, and find that deep, satisfying communication takes place. We have suggested the book to many couples and receive nothing but positive feedback on the results of reading the book!

After anchoring the mounting brackets to the wall and then fastening the rings to the bracket I immediately noticed that the rings were not properly aligned with the mount. The rings are crooked by about 10 degrees. You can wiggle the ring to straighten it but it just returns to the previous position. I have uploaded a picture to the product to illustrate the problem. I have not seen any other reviews with this complaint so perhaps the problem is restricted to only a few of the inventory with the oil rubbed bronze finish. I cannot stand having hardware that is not square and plumb so I chose to return the towel rings to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peeling Chrome!

It is a unique examination of the current welfare system and its flaws through the eyes of personal experience and from the viewpoint of a lawyer. Ms. Cave objectively explains the tremendous struggles that a single mom faces financially, emotionally and psychologically. She also weaves in this personal account the current policies of the welfare system, its intended purposes and the huge gaps that remain in the enforcement of child support laws. This book is not only an engaging autobiography of one woman's triumphant journey from being on welfare to practicing law, it provides the reader with a primer on how the welfare system is suppose to work and where it falls short. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to understand the problems facing single parent families, from lawyers to teachers to pastors and social workers. Thank you Ms. Cave for your transparent account and your inspiring message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warrior's of the Sun, a great read","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. As a guy who can take something as dry as \\"Darwin's Origin of Species\\" to the beach for the weekend, this is a real page turner. The author does a wonderful job of assembling journal entries along with well documented historical data, into an enjoyable read for the interested lay person. It reminds me somewhat of \\"Undaunted Courage\\" by Stephen Ambrose in both its well documented historical accuracy, and attention to readability by the consuming public. I bought this book mainly out of a life long interest in Southeastern Indian culture, and an interest in the terrain of the region before European settlement. The book delivered in spades on both accounts. I am surprised Hollywood has left this story alone. There is enough violence, death, greed, deceit and sex for 5 movies in Desoto's story.K Cook"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorite law books","review":"Of all the case books that I have used thus far in my law school career, this book by far is the worst.

The author explains the 25 different types but never gives any physiological reasons for the differences. Once you determine your type she refers you to a vague 4 - page section that lists the dietary requirements and restrictions for your type but once again, she never explains the reasons for the restrictions. There is also a very disturbing, detailed section for each type called \\"at your worst\\" which describes hideous personality traits that I found very offensive, inaccurate, and totally unrelated to the books subject. If your looking for a book that can help you achieve a healthy, proportionate body then read Body for Life by Bill Phillips. It's uplifting and the program works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"Very confusing book. Found it difficult to find my \\"type\\". None of the types matched me and the personality traits were not me at all if the body type remotely fit me. I couldnt decide what type i was at all.

I found that carbs and proteins at lunch works better for me than salads for instance. Following these kinds of suggestions has given me more consistent energy and mental focus throughout the day, and I feel about 10 years younger. I didn't have to give up things I love, this is not a hard diet plan to follow at all. Another bonus from the book that's not mentioned much is the personality typing.

I had this book in my wish list when my brother bought it for my birthday. A complete waste of his money and my time. Pedantic drivel of an author who deems himself reflective and his thoughts important...and who must love the sound of his own voice...going on and on... I, unfortunately, suffer from the concept that once a book is started it must be finished. So, 3/4 through the thoroughly forced read and still not a glimpse of the \\"Indian slave, name unknown, who some seven hundred years before had traveled to the Middle East.\\" So I don't even know if he ever does make an appearance...and certainly don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is a must read book.

Ghosh, an accomplished scholar in social anthropology, provides a personalized view of the subject. Trading in the middle ages had many socio political implications and had many human tragedies. Indeed, slave trading can be seen as the worst form of human tragedy that we can imagine today. But in those days people of different religions and background profited from it.Ghosh also provides a very readable history of the study of history, how the documents and information related to these periods were discovered. He has been very successful in holding the reader's attention. The book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence in Amitav Ghosh's Work is the Rule","review":"Widely-travelled and widely-read friends with a great deal of time spent in India first recommended Amitav Ghosh's writing to me, and one of these women is a writer of considerable excellence herself.

Each of the important characters is well-defined and realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with one thing lacking","review":"I really enjoyed this. A good combination of history present and a very interesting structure. I also like the angle of a person from a developing country going to live in another developing country instead of the usual Westerner goes to live with the natives.

Suddenly, the moon starts to hurtle itself toward the Earth and it's up to Link to stop a runaway with a demon mask from bringing the moon crashing down.

So when I got Majora's Mask, I liked it...mainly since its storyline went in spirals. You need either a really good gaming brain or a player's guide.

I heard one guy say that you couldn't save your game. ... you use the owls. All in all this game is great. Buy it the first chance you get cause its going to become an instatn classic.

I have been a Zelda fan since the SNES and have loved every Zelda game released on a Nintendo system. However, this game has a level of emotional involvment unparalleled in any video game. As I progressed I found myself becoming involved in the life of this land, and it's not a static world as in previous games, people go on about their day whether you're there or not. Don't be intimidated by the time system, as you get used to the game you can plan ahead and reduce the frustration of lost items. Also, don't try to finish the game in a day by blazing through the dungeons, this game is designed to be savored over time. By helping out every person in your notebook and collecting all the masks, you will gain the best ending and the greatest sense of accomplishment.

Buying the sequel, i was overjoyed with expectations that it would be everything like it's predecessor, perhaps better. But nintendo let me down horribly. The entire game has a playful, childish feel to it, a feel that never matures into a deeper, more involved storyline as it has in past games. Majora's mask completely loses the sweeping epic feel that made the previous games so brilliant. Despite the fact that you are supposed to be trying to save the world, one cannot shake the feeling that Link's quest is somehow trivial. The 3 day time system is weakly implemented, as it doesn't allow for in depth dungeon exploration, or any roaming of any kind. Do not buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Graphics - Game Play is Disapointing","review":"I love the Zelda Series. I have played every single Zelda for Nintendo since the very first one for the 8 bit system over 12 years ago came out.MM is not that much fun. The graphics rock, but the time limit makes the puzzles hard in a way that is not challenging, but simply pain. The game is also small compared to the last Zelda, which was huge!I guess you could say MM is an okay game, but if you loved Zelda, esp. Orcana, you might very well be disapointed. ... The second Zelda game for the original Nintendo was also very different than most of the others and less interesting. I hope Nintendo hears this and makes the next Zelda better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ocarina of time was much better","review":"the reason i don't like majora's mask is because it has a ridiculous story line. first of all you have to do all this junk to get certain things. plus you have to stop the moon from smashing into the earth that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.this game is not loyal to all the previous zelda games nor does it have any returning characters such as princess zelda. ocarina of time is without a doubt better than majora's mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting A \\"Mask\\" On A Good Game!","review":"It is sad to say the least that what made this game horrible was the fact that there was time added!! How does it ever make sense that you have temples lodead with many things to get not to mention going into ten different rooms just to get to an enemy yet you only have 72 hours game time to complete the task?! Not to mention side quests and loads of things to do. The sotry line was cool and the graphics were great but this comes nothing close to Ocarina Of Time which I enjoyed sooo much! In fact I think Ocarina Of Time was waaaaaay better then this. If you are going to make a game make the ememies hard and the task difficult but don't add time. Picture if you were half way through a temple and were almost done then time runs out!! That would make you want to pull your hair!!

This is a good game in terms of graphics, gameplay, and storyline (the moon thing is pretty clever). However, my one gripe is the amount of time they give you to complete certain tasks. It gets REALLY annoying to have to warp back to the first day and loose ALL of your items when you run out of time. If you are looking to buy this game, wait for the price to drop, and if you don't have Ocarina of Time yet, get that first."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic game with many different things to do","review":"This game has everything you could want in it.

The game has a lot of replay value in the sense that you have to go back and finish collecting all the other things included in the game after beating the main part.

Also by saving you have to find an owl and its a complicated saves process and why cant it be like Orcarina of time when you can save when you want. You cant even be adult Link. When you beat the game you get to use the Majoras mask but theres no point your done with the game. So there has to be one good thing about this game and it fits in a toaster.

You collect alot of mask and they let you do something special or change you to a diffrent form. You go to 4 temples to kill the monsters in them. You have three days to beat all of the temples and stop the moon from destroying clock town. You can play a song that alows you to go back in time and keep playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews by FreaK","review":"This game is an insult to Zelda fans everywhere. Zelda isn't even in the game, for cryin out loud! Neither is Ganon, who has been in every other Zelda game. Jeez I hope Nintendo's next Zelda game will be better. I don't think it'll be all that wonderful though, the way it is drawn is gonna drive me nutso. If you think otherwise about Majora's Mask, hehe, email me to get my email address! LoL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you are going to be very disapointed.","review":"if you are expecting a really cool Zelda game you are going to be very disapointed. You just do the same thing over and over and over again. (. . .)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Zelda I Have Seen!!","review":"....Zelda MM is horrible! Unlike Ocarina, it has a time limit. I have had it for one year and I am still on the third temple. I have nothing but thumbs down for this Zelda! The time limit will get very frustrating after one hour. You only see Zelda once in the whole game, and you can't even get Epona until you beat the second temple. If you want to get a zelda game go for Ocarina of Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was an awful experience. It feels like one of disney's midquels","review":"I was fooled by the reviews on Amazon. Majora's Mask has hardly a real sequel at all to Ocarina of Time. It feels like one of disney's new midquels.It's story starts with young Link (um... Nintendo? Link grew up in OOT...) riding through the woods on baby Epona. Which is a problem in itself; how did Link get Epona out of Lon Lon Ranch? Anyway, an imp wearing a mask (Majora's mask) knocks Link out cold, and so the horrible, restraining 3 day cycle begins. Which was not long indeed, soon after collecting my hard-earned items, I would have to go back in time because the clock ran out; this was VERY frustrating for me.I was dissapointed in the fact that this wasn't a real sequel, that Link was not grown up like he was in Ocarina of Time, and that I was fooled by the reviews here. Get Twilight Princess instead; that is the REAL sequel to Ocarina of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, but I'm still waiting..","review":"I haven't played Majora's Mask yet but I've been hooked on the Zelda series ever since I rented OOT about two years ago. If Majora's Mask is anything like the Ocarina of Time I'm sure I'll love it. I know it's been out for a while now but I haven't been able to buy it or rent it because of my inability to get an expansion pack, but I'm still waiting! If its half as good as the reviews I've read says it is, I'm willing to bet I'll be playing for hours when I finally get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad, not nearly as good as the original.","review":"Although Majora's Mask was said to be even better than the original, all the hype of it being \\"Zelda Two\\" covered up the actual poorness of the game.

But I do recommend you get a strategy guide it gets hard at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible disappointment!","review":"Wow, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Zelda is my favorite all time series, but this is probably the single worst game I have ever bought. The only reason it gets two stars is because it belongs to the same series as the other games and has the same great interface/engine as OoT. Don't waste your money on this game, just wait until the gamecube one comes out. The gameplay isn't nearly as fun as old games, the time thing gets really annoying--just watch groundhog day instead of playing this game. The plot is incredibly thin and has nothing to do with old games (why even call it Zelda if she's nowhere to be seen, let alone Gannon, the greatest villain of all time). It really goes out with a whimper--the ending is really bad, without a cool final boss or good ending plot cut scene. You aren't missing anything of this great series by skipping this entry--its better left forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zelda? Fun game, but misleading title","review":"The game is awsome and the game play is fun. But they messed up the legend of zelda by having a game that basicaly has nothing to do with princess Zelda. Now dont get me wrong! I think it's an awsome game with an awsome plot. It's just that Zelda is only in the game for an insignificant five seconds, and it's only a one of Links memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good, the bad and the masks","review":"Following on from where Ocarina of Time left of, Majora's Mask is even better! (Those who say it isn't are only saying that because it's harder!) It may be hrder-but you can still enjoy it!Riding through the woods on Epona, Link is attacked by two fairies. falling off and losing conciosness, Link is unaware of a new foe. The Skull Kid and the Mask of Majora. After stealing Epona and the Ocarina of Time, Skull Kid leads Link into the strange world of Termina.Collect Masks and other items in Termina, all in three days to prevent the falling of the Moon. With the Ocarina, Link can alter time and travel back in time. With a new fairy Tatl by his side, Link can posses three masks, turning him into a mighty Goron warrior, a well-known Zora musician or a hapless little Deku child (it's so cute!)The only bad thing about this game is that you need an Expansion Pack. Try to find it everywhere-it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Majora's Mask is Awsome. A Skull Kid took a mask and it took over him. He steals Link's Ocarina and turns him into a deku scrub. So link travels through the land of Termina to find his way home to Hyrule as well as keeping the moon from falling out of the sky. Another problem is he keeps reliving the same 3 days over and over again. But he can play the song of time to go back to the first day. Also if you look at all the Zelda games they didn't come out in order of events it is like this. Ocarina of time, Majora's Mask, A Link to the Past, Oracle of ages/seasons, The Legend of Zelda, Adventure of Link, and Link's Awakening. I think the new Zelda coming out for Gamecube is between MM and LTTP, but I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"They really outdid themselves this time.","review":"I don't play a whole lot of video games anymore, but even I was impressed by the previous game in the series, 'Ocarina of Time'. If possible, this one could be even better. The key elements that made the last one great - that is, the intense and interactive 3-D world, and the Z-targeting system - are back, thankfully. Indeed, the size of this new fantasy realm is enhanced by the Expansion Pak. Now (and you probably know this by now), the player has only three days (really about an hour) at a time to complete the next objective before he or she has to time warp back to the beginning of the quest. This is a unique device that, once you get used to, adds a new dimension to the gameplay. The storyline and battle sequences in this game are fine; where they really improved was in the realism of the simulated world. You can spend hours learning the whereabouts of the people in the first town alone. Altogether, no serious or casual gamer should pass this one over."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a super game!","review":"This game is totally cool. It is interesting from the first scene.

It's WAY too challenging, even though I like a challenge!3. Figuring out what you do first takes ages and ages.4. Dungeons are nearly impossible to beat, even with strategy.5. Not many places to save(without going back in time).6. Figuring out, even getting to the next dungeon is a pain in the neck!7.

N64 games usually have great opening stories, explaining what the point is. Not this one, I've played it three times and I still don't the plot, or who's actually good. What a waste of my time.

No question about it. Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks to it--namely, that you may feel after you've finished it that you have just played OOT all over again. I understand that Nintendo had to reuse some scenarios to come up with a new game so quickly, but they copied a lot, folks. Pretty much the same cast of characters--Link, the Mask Salesman, Epona, Gorons, Zoras--even little Malon is there, living an alternate life under a different name. Forget all that, though. You'll love it. I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]","review":"This is the biggest waste of time and money ever created. The graphics are the same, maybe a little worse, but the gameplay is awful. The story is not as good as it seems, and overhyped. If you have Ocarina of Time, keep playing it, and if you don't, get it. Majora's Mask is not worthy of the Zelda name.

Tons of action, fun but hard puzzles, awsome masks, and much more. This game tests your puzzle skills to the max and also gives you plenty of combat.

This games a blast to play after you get out of your Deku Scub form and get some good transformational masks, my personal favorite; the Fierce Deity Mask. There are many heart pieces and other side quests along the way that you should take the time to complete as it may help in the end when fighting Majora's Mask.

It is strange, and nowhere near as good as Ocarina of Time, but it is oddly amusing. It is a lot of fun to collect the masks and figure out what you're supposed to do with them. Get all the masks before you go to the moon to reveal a very cool mask that is useful in the final Boss battle! It is also fun to roll around as a Goron, Fly in the air as a Deku sprout, and play the guitar and swim as a Zora. Your fairy, Belle(or Tatl in the English version) can get a bit annoying however, even more so than Navi was. The time limit is also annoying - you can't take more than an hour to beat each dungeon or you have to start all over. Definitely get this game if you like weird stuff or just Zelda in general. I must warn you, however - Princess Zelda is not a part of this at all, and it doesn't really have much to do with the vague but existent Zelda storyline. If you have a choice between this and Ocarina of Time - get Ocarina of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you waiting for ?!","review":"You have the Nintendo 64 console? You have the Expansion Pack? Obviously you should have a controller, so there isn't any reason why you should wait more time to buy Zelda: Majora's Mask.Zelda is a Classic, so every word I type here wouldn't reach the quality of this Game Series. Especially Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which received 10 out of 10 from many respectable Game reviewers. All of these facts, guarantee that Zelda: Majora's Mask is and will always be a Best Seller for N64.About the technical stuff... The graphics are perfect. Using the Expansion Pack for High-Res 3D scenarios, characters, you certainly won't be disapointed. Sound...well, can't remember any reason why this game would lack of an excellent Soundtrack. Control and Fun Factor certainly will be maitained from Ocarina of Time, so, expect quality.That's it, just buy it and have fun! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, bad Replay Value.","review":"This game is really great when starting out. It is harder than Ocarina of Time since you must complete this within 3 days with numerous startovers. This requires the Prima Stragey book or else this will take you months to complete while it took me 7 days (with staying up to 3 in the morning some nights.) In the middle of this game, you will become bored with it, and will continue to play just to finish the game. After beating it, the best thing to do is to sell it since you will probably never pick it up again. This version only has 2 game slots, instead of 3 like OT. If you plan on beating this game, make sure to have all 23 masks and talk to all of the 4 children before going to the 5th.

I gave it four stars since It is EXTREMELY Great Minus one for no replay value whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This game is worth the money. The graphics are excellent, the sound is as good as OoT...and did I mention the graphics? The storyline is really unique, and I really like having all the different masks, which is a really unique way to gain new powers. Also, it's fun to be able to play different forms of Link. Another really interesting aspect of this game is that you can really interact with the townspeople. They are leading their own lives, not just standing in the same place all day. If you talk to them at different times while they are doing different things, you will get different answers. My one complaint about the game is the time limit. It was a really unique idea, but losing hundreds of rupees (not to mention items) can be really annoying. Still, this game is totally worth buying, even if OoT is better. My one peice of advice is to get a guide, because it is really helpful finding all those fairies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good game but the time traveling thing is annoying.","review":"This is a good game. I enjoyed every bit of it, but the time traveling thing made me mad. I want to know what the people that made this game were thinking when they decited to make the game where you have to time travel. It's annoying Each day lasts about 20 minutes and you have 3 of them. It gets really annoying when you're trying to find something and it's on the third day at night. Then you have to come back after time traveling and get it. The game is nothing compared to Ocarina of Time but it is still a good game. I would reccommend buying it but if you don't like exploring what you've already explored a few times, this game is going to make you mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd worst in the series","review":"If you want to get this game be warned. It is the shortest game in the series. Only 4 dungeons. I am a big fan of the zelda series but was disapointed with this. The gameplay is there, game length isn't.

This is a waist of money and you are better off playing the old one all over again! Another bad thing about it is Zelda is in no way connected with the gameplay and storyline. Ganandorf is also not a part of the story. It is also not very difficult and there are only 4 dungeons, not to mention the fact that the masks are also pointless except for the Goron Mask.

I used to be a huge fan of the Zelda series, but it is just dull now. There is no actual excitement. I wanted to enjoy this game so badly, but when I got it, it just wasn't any fun, but now that I look at it, none of the Zelda games are able to be intriguing. If you want something good, go for final fantasy. They have interesting storylines, interesting characters (they actually talk!) and what I believe it takes to make a game worth playing.

The finder scope is very difficult to adjust/calibrate. You would think that for an extra twenty five cents they could have included four screws instead of three to make it a lot easier to adjust. But this device is a marvel of cheapness over quality.The instruction book, (I'll come back to that), says it has hardwood legs. In reality it has flimsey aluminum legs, that appear to have the structural integrity of old beer cans. They can not be folded up for storage without removing the \\"accessories tray\\", which is useless.If you sneeze on this thing it vibrates for several minutes. The eyepiece lenses were very dirty, right out of the box. The instructions are a joke, with lots of errors in English and non-existent directions for adjusting the finder scope.Overall Bushnell should be ashamed to have their name on this sorry, sad piece of junk.

Then the group split apart, Larsen and Sutherland disappeared, and Dalglish is keeping a very low profile, doing mostly stage shows for children. To this day I don't understand what happened; dueling egos, perhaps? In any case, Dalglish's hammer dulcimer playing is exquisite, and Larsen is an expert on virtually every other instrument known to man. Thunderhead is my favorite of all their albums; their trademark combination of airy grace, sinuous melody and poignant harmonies is, to my mind, heard to better effect here than on any other album they ever made (and their other albums are great!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a pretty dang good cable.","review":"Really, a good cable is a good cable. I dont really have any complaints when it comes to this cable, it does what its supposed to and the cable has pretty good memory so its fairly quick and easy to coil back up when packing things up.

It shipped on time and seemed to be in good physical condition, but I wasn't giving me a signal. I tried it out on a few different instruments and machines just to make sure that I wasn't the problem, but the cable was a dud. It's a shame because I really wanted this cable. In it's defense, I bought this used because I'm cheap, but even then, I would still expect it to function like new. I returned it for a full refund. I'm still going to buy this cable, but when I do it will be in person at a local guitar shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifetime Warrantee problem","review":"Monster Cable's lifetime warrantee seems non-existent. If you try their 1-877 phone lines to report a warrantee claim, you will be asked to hold for long periods until you give up. I waited 30 minutes before I gave up. If you try to talk to an operator, you will be asked to re-dial and connect to the warrantee department and then you're back in the long wait. And if you manage to get through they will say their computers are down and you need to call again.This lifetime guarantee is just a cheap marketing trick to get the public think you are getting a product with a lifetime guarantee.

Seriously, I couldn't watch this movie for more than 30 minutes without thinking of shooting myself in the head. Was I supposed to do some reading for this movie? And Jason Shcwartzman (sp?), the most annoying actor of all time, makes it go even further down the toilet. And could someone slow down PLEASE?

It was hard to follow and very slow moving and just not intresting. Too bad though because it had a wonderful cast. It is about a guy who works for Open Spaces trying to save the enviorment and he goes to the exterstental dective and trys to find out about a coincedence he had. To be honest I did not watch the whole movie. I fell asleep about 45 mins into it because it was not keeping my attention. I tried to watch it again and I again got the very sleepy feeling. But this movie was just not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made it through 30 minutes...","review":"And turned it off. Complete waste of time. The cover says it is laugh out loud funny.

I love the cast, the director's got a good record, and Jon Brion has a habit of making great soundtracks. There were a few chucke-worthy moments, but most of the \\"philosophy\\" sounds like the writers got stoned and read random selections from \\"The Tao of Physics.\\" Now, I'm definately not knocking the philosophy that they alluded to and hinted at throughout the film, but unless you know what they're talking about already, I would imagine that none of it would make sense. Go pick up some Capra and Jung instead of wasting 107 minutes of suck. Buy the soundtrack instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, both because of the stars and because I enjoy the off-the-beaten path movies. Another reviewer mentioned BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, IGBY GOES DOWN, THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS and ADAPTATION, and I love all those movies, but I couldn't stand this one and couldn't wait for it to be over. The only reason I kept watching was the vain hope that a twist at the end would tie it all together/make it all work but it didn't.I didn't like most of the characters (couldn't empathize, just didn't care about), and the plot felt like \\"Let's make it weird for weird's sake\\". As much as I love a movie where I don't see the ending coming, I also like it to at least make some vague sense, and this just totally didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely BRILLIANT!","review":"I Heart Huckabees manages to both completely make fun of and explore the \\"big questions.\\" Brilliant direction and conception top off the solid performances by the cast.

Are you there?","review":"This may be the worst movie of all time. Okay, maybe not the worst, but it's pretty bad.

Although not for all tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining film. . . and isn't that what counts?","review":"I found that I really enjoyed this movie, despite that fact that it seems to take itself a bit too seriously.The cast is nothing short of phenomonal. Tomlin, Hoffman and Law deliver excellent performances and I loved seeing Lily Tomlin in a commercially viable film again. But the credit really has to go to Jason Schwartzman. He is greatly underappreciated as an actor and when seeing this film, you have to wonder how is that possible? He blew away the rest of the cast with his performance and I look forward to seeing him in other upcoming projects.Mark Wahlberg was a nice surprise too. I hope that he gets other roles where he can display his acting ability instead of junk like the Italian Job.The movie throws out some neat ideas, but it does tend to border on the ridiculous. The only real message that I received from it was this: Everyone suffers and we should take comfort in each other and realize that we are never alone in our pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"Having been frustrated and nearly driven crazy with the state of the world, I was so pleased as to how this movie released me of some of that pressure like no other movie ever has.If you're an activist or just someone who loves bizarre comedies, I highly suggest I heart huckabees."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"If I could give this 0 stars I would.

Albert is helped by a pair of existential detectives, who are attempting to spread their message despite the negative influence of a French woman who is their disgruntled former prot��g��e. Mark Walberg, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin spend a lot of time talking about the meaning, or lack thereof, of everything and zipping people into body bags or smacking each other in the face with large rubber balls. (I'm not making this up)While it is very tempting to say this movie is complete crap, this would not be entirely true. All the actors give fine, spirited performances and were perfectly believable as their insane characters. It is the plot, however, which left me wondering what the writer(s) had been ingesting, and if perhaps some of it would make me enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE Huckabee's!","review":"What a waste of talent.

I came out laughing and thinking though...I have seen reviews saying that this movie is full of light and pop philosophy and while it may be true that many of the points brought out are not on a very deep level the movie would have lost its comedy element if it had gone deeper into the philosophies. You can't take it too seriously and you have to realize that this movie isn't a college course in philosophy...instead it is a way to laugh at life and wet one's appetite towards philosophy. Like it or not the movie has a good message and is very much worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, underrated film","review":"I can't believe how underrated this movie is. Just because you don't understand a film's concepts, doesn't mean that you should necessarily call it \\"bad.\\" I absolutely loved this film. I gave it a chance, and I'm glad I did. I acquired epiphanies from this movie; this movie is one of the few movies in this world that can help me acquire them. A lovely integration of great acting, superb direction, and a beautiful soundtrack helped make this splendid movie. Just give the movie a chance; please don't measure a movie's splendor by your failing to understand its concepts. This movie is not only worth renting; it's also worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe you don't agree with my opinion....","review":"....but I wasn't a fan of this movie.Perhaps if you're neck deep into philosophy and psychology on a day-to-day basis you'll relate to this movies and have a few laughs. However, as someone who took Philosophy 101 and Psych 101, I still thought the jokes were too off the wall to count as humour. It IS funny to make fun of existentialist theories and general concepts, but it was overdone and tedious. I'd heard this movie was amazing, but in my opinion, this movie is NOT amazing, but it's truly amazing that I watched the entire film and even more amazing that so many big stars agreed to do this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering psycho-babble","review":"Yet another underwhelming offering from David O Russel on another uninteresting subject, this time existentialism. While all of the cast are excellent the movie itself is full of fortune cookie philosophy and metaphysics. It comes off as Russells personal sandbox where two competing philosphies duke it out only to cancel each other out at the end, changing essentially nothing. It tries to dazzle you with drive-by philosophy and kooky characters but ultimately is just a meandering mix of slightly connected scenes that drag you along to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Heck is going on","review":"This film leaves me loss because where as most films have a least a point this one has none. I think the key to comedy is to be at least uh funny or in some way be at least satire This film makes no sense what so ever.Luckily the actors in this film are well established to go on to do other things but why in the world did they pick this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Deserves a Square-Root-of-Negative-One Star","review":"Something this breathtakingly pseudo-intellectual AND incoherent AND uninteresting is without recent precedent. This precious director/\\"writer\\"/blitherer could do justice to the inevitable film adaptation of such best-selling codswallop as \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\". Infinitely more enjoyable than the movie are the reviews posted by countless cosmopolitan philosophes who declaimed the movie was \\"intelligent\\", \\"deep\\", and, far and away the best line, comparable to Voltaire's \\"Candide.\\" Quite. Three cheers for the spirit of Paul de Man. (How about a movie where detectives investigate whether the question of whether de Man has an ideational spirit is relevant to donkey-do? Step aside, Voltaire.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"another sophmoric attempt at the MEANING OF LIFE","review":"The only laugh I got from this movie was the reviewer who said that you should remain in relative ignorance of the plotline. That is easily done - at the end of the movie you will still be in relative ignorance of the plotline. This little piece of film is another attempt at 'the meaning of life'. There IS a meaning in life but you have to crawl out of yourself to find it, so the zippered-up blanket the characters hide in is highly appropriate. I also got a laugh from the reviewer who couldn't give the movie a blanket recommendation. For the writers - you can't make a profound statement in a vacuum - you have to take your audience with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disspointment","review":"I guess at some point I should get used to these kinds of movies where the story that the movie should be about disspears and is replaced by some lame distraction in which someone can spew thier pseudo-intillectual crap for an hour and a half.

OH how amazingly original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy, Hollywood style...","review":"Pompous, grotesque \\"comedy\\" that gives away just how condescending and facile the denizens of The Land Of Make Believe truly are. A sloppy treatise on existentialism where none of the characters deserve anyone's sympathy or attention. If the writers gave half a fig about what they were writing about, this might have been an entertaining film. But the film is content instead to wallow in its own ill-considered cleverness in the hopes of blowing away a dimwitted, half-educated film audience who thinks that anything that smacks of intellectuality is to be praised simply because it is \\"heavy\\". This film will quickly bring to mind another obnoxious, self congratulating slab of intellectual posturing called \\"Being John Malkovich\\", and depending on who you are, that might be a bad or good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stinks","review":"I watched the first 45 minutes as things grow increasingly absurd, but the more the plot struggles, the more unfunny it all seems.

Lilly Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman add zilch. A real dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta shop at Huckabees!","review":"Crude language, Wild philosophy taken to an extreme. The attitudes and language are what makes this movie rated R. Even though it may seem like all fun and games, and you may not want to say otherwise, you know it's more than that. Looking at the title, it sounds like it could be another comedic happy go lucky film. Right about the comedic part, but so wrong on everything else. There are hearts broken in ways you wouldn't have imagined, two Huckabee models and \\"everything else Huckabees.\\" Jason Schartzman plays the main character, and I found out that he's the drummer in Phantom Planet, a great pop band! (I hear he's arrogant though, and this fact only would enhance it.) Dustin Hoffman and Jude Law are in it. Mark Wahlberg is truly convincing in this one. If you like South Park, Daria, or any kind of toilet humor, this movie may just be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really annoying","review":"In this movie, Jason Schwartzman's character seeks the aid of exerstentialist detectives to discover why he keeps meeting an African man in a variety of different places. If you are like me, then you are probably already lost by now. The movie just gets more confusing from there. I guess that the makers of these movie were going for a comedy but it is more like a really annoying melodrama. None of the characters in the movie are particular interesting and the plot is just so stupid.I guess that the movie is kind of absurdist humor in the line of plays like Waiting for Godot or Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead, and books like Catch-22. I really can't say that I am a fan of absurdist humor because I just find it rather plotless and too annoying. If you like absurdist humor then maybe this movie is for you. If you find that kind of stuff annoying, then I would suggest that you skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie in the world","review":"I think this movie is the best movie in the world, hands down.

Political in the sense that I Heart Huckabees is definitely taking a stab at political ideologues and their inability to see beyond their leanings. And personal due to the fact that it is individuals that ultimately make up any political faction, and it is up to that individual to avoid falling into the ideological trap.It's clear that at the end, Schwartzman & Wahlberg take a bit of both sides of the debate in order to determine their own boundaries of contentment. For anyone to try and go deeper than that analysis might miss the point, and not see the film for what it is, an attack on blind obedience & followership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest Movie Ever","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible.

An idiotic story presented in an uber-quirky style that leaves the watcher bored and rolling their eyes. If you want to know existentialism read Sartre.

It has a good reputation and, at least going by descriptions of it, was my kind of movie: a philosophical film.Unfortunately, despite his reported assurance on the set, I don't believe the director knew what he wanted to do with the material. The idea of a couple of philosophical detectives working to get to the bottom of a client's life was definitely promising material, but the whole thing was swamped by pretentiousness.Heck, the idea of a firefighter completely giving up on his life until he got some answers to philosphical questions was enough to carry this movie: they should have dialed down all the philosophy and ramped up the comedy. It would have made what philosphy there was much more powerful and memorable.

Tomb Raider is one of the most fun games, also one of the most maddening, but its great nonetheless. And stop complaining its too dark, it just adds atmosphere, a very creepy atmosphere.So, yes I think people should buy it, and the graphics have improved tremendously since '96' as have the storylines.

This box set comes with the entire first season which does a great job setting up the rest of the series. If you start you are in for a long haul too but its definitely worth it. There are some disappointing filler seasons but this box set is not one of those and is an exciting opening to a great series. It shows how Ichigo became a soul reaper in the first place and in the last few episodes it begins to introduce characters from the soul society. A must have for any anime fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"addicting","review":"I gave this boxset 4 stars because the series starts slow and stays realitivly slow throughout. The story gets very extensive and overall I would give the show 5 stars but like most long term series with the kind of depth Bleach has, it just takes time to develop all the characters, which Bleach continues to do all time. I'm not sure if the series or development of new characters will ever end.

I don't think there's an anime fan out there that hasn't at least heard of it. It has dozens of awesome characters, and countless amazing battles. As well as some incredible drama.

It's insanely good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The case","review":"So if you like Bleach and only want it for the episodes, get it. If you want the case for some reason...kind of not worth it. I would buy it again if i had to so don't get me wrong, but I opened each page to look at the individual disk and the last page literally fell out as i opened it. It was only held together with some substance that I would describe as tape. It works like tape so it holds on only so much. Scotch tape. that is my only beef with the case. I would rather have my dvds held in better, but at least it has the outer case that holds it shut. That helps a lot. Again, The actual dvds, totally worth it.

But, like scrabble, the turns take forever! And, the scrabble concept doesn't really work well with the operators (=.+,-); too soon you run out of space on the sides as equations are much longer than words. You can't put two equations as close as two words and so there is much less opportunity for creativity in placing your pieces (e.g. you cannot make two equations in two directions; sometimes there are only one or two locations where it is possible to add an equation). We were getting scores of 10-30 points per turn, then one person added the following to an existing equation \\"0 X 34567 5/6 +.\\" By hitting a triple equation score and got more than 270 points on one hand thereby effectively ending the game that had been relatively even.

But I appreciate that it will still be useful when my daughter is done nursing. It is very easy to assemble - I put it together when I was in labor (literally).

The pegs on this footstool are what keep it from 5 stars - not only has one continually popped out (requiring some glue) but they also rattle around a bit. What this means is that when you're using it in the middle of the night, rocking in your chair, it creaks and makes enough noise to wake your baby. Which isn't great. But ... an easy solution is to wrap each peg with soft material (I used some velcro strips) so it fits more snugly in the grooves. More snug + soft material = no creaks = sleeping baby.I'd buy it again, just be sure to wrap those pegs before you wake the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stool","review":"Comes exactly as pictured and very easy to put together.

The one thing that I've loved about all of Nora's books is that there is always one part of the characters that you can identify with. They're human, they're believable, and you care what happens to them. And that's what I found lacking in these stories. I found the characters dull and boring, sometimes even laughable (Night Shadow with its Batman-like figure). The stories were tedious and predictible (the last one being the best of the lot). Since they are by Nora Roberts, Night Tales is of better quality than most romance novels out there, but I've been spoiled by her better efforts. Skip this collection and go straight to Night Shield.A few reviewers mentioned that these resembled the J.D. Robb books. I've never cared for those (too dark) which is probably why I didn't like these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fabulous series","review":"There is something about the night people that is intriguing and Nora Roberts managed to write down 4 fabulous stories about them. Night Shift, Night Shadow, Nightshade, and Night Smoke, are all wonderful. And yes, I think some chacacters here (Althea from Nightshade and Gage from Night Shadow) are probably basic characters for Eve and Roarke for in-Death series. I say basic 'cause they come out differently though. Eve and Roarke have harder edge than Althea and Gage and much more complex issues in their life. Anyway, this is a totally great series ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"This album has been a favorite since I found it in my university's library on LP. The sounds are very touching to the soul. It reminds me of the feeling you get after a long journey through the mountains, or the feeling of losing a dear friend and the being reunited again in the future. The songs have great lyrics and composure. I also own Myrrh by Robin but to me this album is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT film","review":"Highly informative and well researched; this is the most comprehensive film on the subject and it is a very very important subject to all life on this planet: human, plant, or animal.

He certainly accomplished this, but he did not go any further than that. For this reason I would only recommend this book to someone who is looking for a cursory reference on how to break down the layers of web development incorporating user centered design principles.This book might complimentCall to Actionsince Call to Action is less structured, but driven more by tangible examples.I hesitate to recommendUsability for the Webonly because I haven't finished reading it. But so far it is extremely well written, detailed, and well structured. I suspect for someone looking for a thorough 432 page book rather than a cursory 174 page book, Usability for the Web will be the preferred alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives a great Perspective on targeting your user","review":"While this book is designed specifically for Web Design, the principles can be used with any product. The information is fairly condensed, and straight forward.This book takes the quote 'the customer is always right' and shows you how to find out what the customer wants, need and doesn't know they want. And then the book explains how to best use that inofrmation to redesign, or improve your product (web site)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for everyone invloved in creating a user experience","review":"This is simply the best book I have read so far about creating a great user experience.

The ratios are balanced very nicely. It is reliable.I had read a previous reviewer who talked about buying the bulk flours listed and mixing your own. Yeah, that's all right & good...if you can guarantee it isn't contaminated. I used to buy in bulk till I watched this lady grab the regular flour scoop & get some potato flour. Now we eat GF for other reasons than Celiac. However, for some this could be bad. Other buying in bulk issue is finding the right ratio. This flour has figured out the balance & is worth it. We don't eat tons of baked goods, so this is a good deal.I have used this in a 1:1 ratio with Pamela's Baking Mix to make Nestle's Tollhouse Cookies. Nobody could tell the difference between the GF cookies & regular Tollhouse.Makes this flour the winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one I'll buy","review":"I've been gluten free for 4 years, and I have a son who has been gluten free for 9 years and another son who has been gluten free for 2 years (we're all celiac disease).

Some were OK, some failed in texture, some failed in taste, some were downright inedible. With Beth's Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, I've finally found a product that works in most of the cookies, tea breads, muffins, and so on that we all enjoy, and is also affordable for everyday use. It can be substituted in an equal quantity just about anywhere a recipe calls for \\"all purpose flour\\" - obviously you'll need to experiment if you use it for yeast breads. Oh, and by the way, it doesn't taste \\"gluten-free\\". We had a very merry Christmas at our house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Baking Mix, But Waste of Money","review":"This is a good flour (white rice). But what you may not know is that it is also the cheapest available flour for baking gluten free. You can usually find it in bulk at big grocery stores for $0.60-1.20 per pound. The other listed ingredients: potato starch, tapioca starch, and guar gum can also be purchased in bulk here on Amazon.If you go to this extra effort, your $23 will go from 6 pounds of baking flour to 30."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great substitute","review":"I have used this in both cakes and cookies so far and they have turned out wonderfully! It's great to have a product available that allows a person unable to consume wheat/gluten to still be able to have some tasty treats occasionally; plus the finished product turns out virtually the same as with wheat flour, so you don't have to make 2 versions, one for you and one for your family!

I don't like the presentation of many of the women in this book, and I find them implausible, too. I was looking forward to this series.

He tells it with an uncanny ability for recall of many of the day to day nightmarish activities. As a plus he descibes his child hood Cambodia and the years that followed his departure from Cambodia.

The book purports to be a love story between a seminarian and an old friend - a college student - in the context of doubt, search for truth, following one's true calling etc. etc. etc.The issues raised and their resolutions are trite and presented in a manner that gives one no confidence in the author. Is he writing for money or fame? out of a misconception of his own wisdom?I suspect that when I first was out of college and reading psuedo-Tibetan drivel, I would have enjoyed this book; so I do understand that there is a place for this book.

It's selling the most absurd Ol' Time religious brew, laced with concepts like destiny and magical cures that are an insult to anyone at all familiar with 20th century physics, to anyone with a clue to a contemporary vision of this creation of billions of galaxies and multiverses in which we are embedded. I can weep -- either sitting or standing -- contemplating all the willfully ignorant people who consider this inspirational.

I learned that differences and similarities are important in a relationship. Presumably, without these things life will be monotonous and without sense. Obviously, similarities are beneficial in a relatioship. They provide the connection of two people. Also, create a challenge between them because they believe that they are competing. On the other hand, differences make a relationship difficult, because sometimes the way people do things is not how we like them done. In conclusion, the importance of life teaches us to understand and accept the mistakes that our partner has. It helps us to love and respect him or her like person because in this world nobody is perfect.

Well, in this case, their game is not any different from the usual, it's a game of pain and tears, a game of finding and then losing and then finding back again what is most important and valuable.Coelho's writing is light, simple, yet profound and deep.

My favorite line is on page 148;\\"Break the glass, please - and free us from all these damned rules, from needing to find an explanation for everything, from doing only what others approve of.\\" That sums up the meaning of the story.

I found this book profoundly underwhelming, profoundly un-profound. Maybe something got lost in the translation; far from seeming 'resonant', the spare, sparse, bare-bones narration and dialogue just felt dull and ineffectual. So the writing style wasn't all that innovative or noteworthy; the characters were sketchy, and as a result, the plot's dramatic climax had no emotional impact. Again, the flat writing style made the book's outcome appear arbitrary - he leaves, he stays, who cares? The two characters probably should have skipped the religious lecture circuit and signed up at A.A. in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"P.Coelho typically says that we should always do what we want to do, even if our rationale advices otherwise. In the fifth mountain, Elijah struggles to fulfill his promise to god. In the alchemist the boy traverses the desert to find the alchemist. Here he has taken a unlikely relationship between a wannabe priest and a free spirited girl as a model for his philosophy.It is true that we should have the free will to do what we really want to do inspite of the probability of failure in our effort. A great virtue to be cultivated by everyone with a striving to grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The Valkyries instead","review":"I felt like something was missing, that this was discription of some experience important to the author, that he had a memory in his mind but forgot that we as readers don't have the background. We never know how these two lovers met, why they fell in love, how they grew apart, or what was so difficult about reuniting. Often the most profound feelings of love and spirituality the characters experience is under the influence of a lot of wine. We don't even really find out how it all ends or why a spiritual life and a simple life in the place of ones birth are mutually exclusive.After reading the Valkyries, I felt like the holes were filled in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and trite","review":"I found the style of writing in this book to be so trite that it was an effort to turn each page. The leading female character, Pilar, is an insecure, inexperienced, sheltered woman who seems to have no confidence in her own instincts.

It lacks the spirituality that stems from \\"The Alchemist\\" or \\"Veronika decides to die\\". It is instead a cheap religious book with some twists on Christianity that may be extremely offensive to both atheists and religious fanatics. The story line is weak and the characters are hardly developed.

It is more like a religious pamphlet trying to pass for literature. The characters are mere representations without a trace of the grit or complexity that makes a character real. They speak in platitudes and parables and not once did they utter a single genuine word. Some of the imagery was lovely and I suppose one could come away from this book with a reassurance of one's faith, but at the cost of one's belief in literature. Basically, it was like reading one long Hallmark card.

It is a smarmy, self-congratulatory love story couched in new age mysticism meant to make the tale sound serious. By the River stupifies the reader with the same thoughts, the same phrases, slightly reworded and then repeated endlessly. The characters are stick figures. The \\"childhood friend\\" character, now a man belonging to a religious order, mouths the spiritual platitudes of the author. Pilar, the female protagonist, was surely written to draw in the romance novel crowd.

This decision is reinforced by the clarity of the translation, which uses such terms as \\"infinite spirit\\" instead of \\"Brahman,\\" which tends to confuse the reader. The presentation on the page is also satisfactory, especially compared to the Penguin edition's sloppy appearance.To those who think Stoler's translation misses the mark because of an emphasis on war in it, this is incorrect. She properly places Arjuna's dilemma in his supposedly real life situation. This is how Hindu texts operated: put a person in a practical, believable situation the reader can identify with, then respond to it with the message from the wisdom-giver. It makes perfect sense, and Stoler does not miss the warfare of the soul also present in Arjuna.Also recommended is Eknath Easwaran's translation into English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly","review":"This is a respectable translation, but don't expect fluid reading as Sanskrit has more modality than English does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bagavath Gita in English -- are you kidding","review":"People, fist of all Bagavad Gita is 5136 years old and not some first century AD poem.

The surreal scenes with blackbirds flying down the Enterprise corridor and a young Soong with his metalwork made a deep and long lasting impression on me.

The cost is convenience: it is harder to clean. But I soak the pot overnight in cold water. The next day, you can clean it very easily.Don't use detergent, as the chemical can seep into the clay. It is not good for your health. Use vinegar or baking soda, as many others suggested here.I do not have any mildew problem at all.

It has such a small handle and low lip it is difficult to grip through the towel. Also, I have to be ready with a second towel when opening the cooker, as moisture drips down the cooker lid.

I so wanted to love this rice cooker but it just wasn't in the cards! I wanted a rice cooker that wasn't coated in Teflon and I loved the idea of the clay pot so there was no hesitation about spending $100 on a rice cooker. I used it about 50 times but had to discontinue using it because mold is growing in the clay and I can't get rid of it. I've tried everything and now the mold is growing inside the machine. I take care of my kitchen appliances and take great care in thoroughly cleaning and drying them when I'm finished using them so I doubt the mold is a result of misuse or improper care. I had to remove it from my kitchen because it stinks of mildew.I also wasn't terribly impressed with the quality of the rice it produces. It's pretty inconsistent - sometimes it's mushy and sometimes it's hard. My $10 Rival does a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"internal problem and poor service from manufacturer","review":"I bought this cooker and keep using it daily.

The big problem and risk - after using it around 6 months E1 error code comes out on every use. As per the instruction manual that is internal and need to call for assistance. I email and call to the warranty center in CA but not get any prompt reply. Finally talked to them and told me that may be too much water added.

Four of the 8 breakers were defective and the defect was apparent upon opening the carton: the breaker would not stay in the -on-position.

The book IS worth reading, but NOT at hardcover prices.If you haven't read the first one yet, then wait and buy them both as either individual paperbacks OR in their eventual \\"single-bound\\" version. THEN you can enjoy it.If you HAVE read the first one, then put it aside and have Amazon \\"email alert\\" you to the paperback's release. Or, try your local library.

The enemy was an interesting choice, well thought out, and presented new challenges developed from Star Trek lore. The mystery of book one was lost and though the story telling was masterful, the climax and resolution were not only much too quick, but below the level of energy and enthusiasm you felt throughout the story. Almost as if Vornhort tied some pieces together to meet a deadline, not to complete what had promised to be one of the better Star Trek stories.An intriguing adventure that ultimately went no where..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good follow-up book","review":"This book picks up seconds after book one.

The crew of the Enterprise start succuming to the aliens that set off the Genesis Wave in order to save their dying civilization.

She wanted this, but she wanted to know where it was placed as well, and by whom. Her endeavors are assisted by divorce attorney Danny Benedict who is in town for secret reasons of his own.

If you have NO IDEA what you are doing, this is great.However, the project examples are so terrible, you have no desire to go through the step-by-step process to get to the lame end-results. Who wants fake red drops of \\"blood\\" falling from Halloween text? It takes 15 pages to get to something I could blue screen together in 6 seconds in Premiere to impress my dog, my friend's infant, and maybe some ants.If you are looking to produce something marketable with After Effects, keep right on looking past this book.

There were a couple things I didn't like about it though. The first is that the cable comes out of the bottom of the controller. This is uncomfortable and weird. The second is that the controller is so light. I like my controllers to have a bit of weight to them, but other people might like it light.Something that boggled me for some time were the mysterious slots in the back of the controller. I did some research and I believe the only thing that makes use of the slots is theNyko Wii Classic Controller Grip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake - NOT made by Nintendo","review":"These controllers are third-party controllers with a Wii \\"faceplate\\" attached to them. On the backside of authentic Nintendo controllers there is a Nintendo stamp on the plastic, on these there is none. I was a bit skeptical when I received them as they have a bit of separation between the plastic halves and are off-colored. The buttons are also not as reliable as authentic controllers.

There's not really anything fancy about which is ok because there's not a need for any extra bells and whistles, it's just a controller. One thing I'm still trying to get used to is that the cord comes out of the \\"bottom\\" of the controller vice the top like I'm used to with other console controllers. There was a big gap in consoles for me (original PlayStation was the last one I owned before the Wii) so this may be normal for controllers now and I'm just out-of-date or out of the loop. The Classic Controller is intuitive and it was easy to use being that I was a big Nintnedo junky back in the late 80s and Super Nintendo later on. So far I've only used the Classic Controller for two Virtual Console games (Donkey Kong Country and The Legend of Zelda) but found no problems during play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird button layout","review":"The controller works like it should but it is annoying that it has to be plugged into the wii remote for it to work. It seems kind of expensive for a simple add-on that has to be plugged into another remote.We played Super Mario Bros. with the controller only to find out that if you want to play two player you need two controllers (even though you switch off turns). One person uses the controller, the other uses the remote. Definitely not buying another one.Also the button layout is a little weird. On the top there are four buttons in a row instead of two behind the others, like playstation. Also there is no trigger button underneath for N64 games. I understand it is a very \\"universal\\" controller but I think it could have been designed a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for older Virtual Console games","review":"If you're looking to buy older VC games(NES, SNES) this controller is very comfortable and lightweight. If you're looking to buy N64 games, I would suggest a Nintendo GameCube controller instead.If you're going for a wireless experience the classic controller is just that, kind of.

Underutilized.","review":"I quite like this controller, maybe not as much as the gamecube controller (which is one of my favorite controllers ever made) but it's still pretty damn good. My only real complaint is the lack of compatibility with my Wii games. I understand the Wii is supposed to be focused on motion sensing but if I don't want the waggling gimmicks I shouldn't be forced to play that way, I thought that was the point of the classic controller. Even in Twilight Princess, a game that was also on the gamecube, you can't use a gamecube or a classic controller to play it on the Wii.

Make sure to get the grip addon thing I think Nyko makes it, it makes this controller at least bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for human hands?","review":"I specifically purchased two of these to play Smash Bros. I was informed that the normal Wii controllers were not very good to use and that I should use either the Game Cube controller or the Wii Classic. I made the wrong choice.The biggest gripe is how uncomfortable this thing is to hold in your hands. It almost feels alien. Is it that we have had some sort of ergonomic sensibility in controllers going back to the Sega Genesis or am I just a wimp? Playing the game with this controller felt utterly and totally unnatural. Also, I am not fond of the wire coming out towards me...another thing that seemed out of place. To play with this controller, using the two thumb sticks is not natural.Go with the Game Cube controller.

The controller feels really nice, and the buttons are great. My only issue is that it's wired to the Wiimote which just kind of dangles on sits in your lap and does nothing. I was hoping they'd have made this wireless on its own, but I suppose they had their reasons.

I also wish it works with more games."},{"rating":"1","title":"One benefit but big downside","review":"Why do I have this controller that will not work on Nintendo Gamecube games that I want to play on my Wii? The only benefit this offers is that it plugs into your Wii-mote and then becomes semi-wireless (still killing your batteries).

You can still play the virtual console games, plus the Gamecube discs, and not have a remote connected 3 feet away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good with one complaint","review":"This controller works perfect, however I am not a fan of the cable coming out of the bottom of the controller.

This is not that book. Instead the author breezes through each significant figure in the history of this school of philosophy and gives us highlights but little of substance. I would recommend that the reader who is seeking to understand stoicism and apply the insights of this dynamic school of philosophy would be better served by reading and applying the exercises found within a course taught by Keith Seddon \\"Stoic Serenity: A Practical Course on Finding Inner Peace.\\" The text for this course can be found on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Enjoyable - Highly Recommended","review":"I was pleasantly surprised.

This will go into my \\"top\\" shelf, I have already started a second reading. Anyone with an interest in Robert DeRopp (if anyone remembers him) would find this enjoyable and intriguing.

First, my battery lasts about 1 hour when the player is fully charged. Second, I have a lot of trouble getting the screen sensors to register. In other words I have to push on the screen many times before it registers what I want as far as switching songs or turning down the volume. It often changes screens without my asking it to. Right now, I can not get the player off of the radio and continue to get error messages.Additionally, I purchased one for my 17-year-old son. His broke within one week.

Think instead about what you get with this book: an author who knew the subject personally, in-depth research into O'Nolan's origins and childhood, an intimate knowledge of the Irish literary scene in the interwar and postwar years, and the ability to show how these shaped the subject intellectually and psychologically. I disagree with a few of Cronin's assessments: I think The Dalkey Archive was the pinnacle of O'Nolan's novelistic achievements. While I agree he should have written more novels, I also feel that his time writing newspaper columns was well spent; there's more wit in most of those columns than in many novels by lesser writers. This book satisfies one of the most important criteria of a biography, that it be a good read in and of itself: Cronin is an excellent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful view of Dublin literary and middle classlife","review":"This is a beautifully written book about a brillant frustrated man, who was a great novelist, newspaper columnist and a competent bureaucrat at the same time.

The author breaks the genre down clearly and provides exercises that have real world examples. It's great that he describes the example and points to a song that exemplifies the technique used. (I put together a nice blues playlist using the examples in this book.) The author moves us gradually through levels of complexity and finishes the lesson off nicely by providing a section of several blues standards that are most likely to be called out at a gig. The examples are provided on the CD and are great little jams in themselves, very entertaining. The bass track on the CD is provided on one side.

It is a romanticized skeletal treatment, covering the basics of the man (raised in poverty, self taught magician, life long mother issues, medium debunker) without any real depth or showing anything new. It is a well done enough production, recreating some of Houdini's daring feats, and the acting is decent (and Johnathon Schaech certainly looks fit enough to pull off Houdini's escapes and high tolerance for pain) but ultimately it is a frame without a portrait, non revealing of the Ehrich behind the Harry.Favorite Line: \\"I fell in love with Ehrich Weiss; I put up with Harry Houdini.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"That's not how it happened!","review":"Before I saw this film I saw as many documentries on Houdini as I could. They got the facts all wrong! That is NOT the way that those people were. That's not what happened that night, ten years after his death. Those hoping to learn anything of substance about the celebrated magician and illusionist will walk away disappointed, because writer-director Pen Densham's superfical and overly melodramatic biography turns Houdini into a shrill, unpleasant narcissist.

How can the authors cover these subjects in a few pages and consider it \\"Complete\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally Poor","review":"I've found this book generally poor as a reference. I've owned it for over one year, and do not recall ever finding an answer that I needed. My answers always came from other books.

This book deals more with C/C++ then VC++. The title is totally misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin about Visual C++","review":"I didn't read C/C++ stuff, but a coverage of Visual C++ is not enough even for a beginner's reference. The word 'Complete' I can't even discuss. Even books like 'VC in 24 hours' may give you more ideas and examples than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near complete","review":"This is a 27 chapter book. For the first 20 chapters the authors cover C and C++, with no coverage of MS VC++. For the last 7 chapters, they try to touch on every concept in VC++ without actually explaining anything. Numerous times the authors will give an example and then tell the student to use that program as a template, instead of bothering to explain the calls that the program makes. The coverage of VC++ material does not give enough information to assist anyone in creating a useful program. As for coverage of complex topics, DLLs and threads each get their own sentence.I am a professional C developer who has been programming for a long time. Hands down, this is the worst programming book that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title questionable, has 107 C programs and 98 C++ programs","review":"Amazing that the writers could not break lose from C programming. Unfortunately they did present most of their examples in the C-language. I counted all C and C++ programs. Easy to see what is C, having C filename extension and stdio header files while C++ programs having CPP filename extension and mostly iostream, or other stream related header files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of info, but where???","review":"As this book is called \\"The Complete Reference\\" for C++, I bought it, hoping to use it as a reference when I needed to remember how a certain function or keyword worked. And where do you usually go if you want reference?The index. The dreaded index.This book has *THE* worst index I have ever seen in a book. Reading the 16 page table of contents is a better way to find a particular subject. Want to know about \\"copy constructor\\"? Not in the index. \\"const\\"? Not there. \\"Conversions\\"? \\"Doc/View\\"? One page each. There IS a lot of information in this book, but you really have to want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes!","review":"I must admit that I did not get through the entire book, even to scan it. Much of the description of the C language was dealing with the pre-ANSI versions and seemed to be there primarily to make the book thicker. In the overview of C++ there were numerous incorrect statements including the contention that cout and cin are classes, when they are actually objects of the iostream class. At this point I lost confidence in the material and put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a reference book, nor is it useful","review":"If you are looking for a Visual C++ reference book do not buy this one. It does not cover a wide range of topics (dll's are mentioned as being too advanced so much for complete) and is written as a text book rather than a reference book. This book may be suitable for someone who has no experience with C++ and is trying to learn the basics, but even then there must be better, more accurate books out there. The only complete thing about it is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Very comprehensive coverage for a single volume. That says it all.

I know the amount of work he put into it. This book is 1000+ pages - what a feat.I bought this book because I have been programming in C and needed to convert to C++. The authors did a good job of showing examples in both C and C++, so that people like me could make the transition.Overall, the book was nothing but excellant. The authors posted their code on Osborne's web site, so it was really time saving when it came to testing their programs.I did not find any technical errors in the book (one or two typos), found the style and manner of presentation great and really learned how to get my C++ code up and running."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot for my money","review":"I actually bought this book after buying the author's book on Debugging. I already wrote a review of the Debugging book - it was great and helped me out of a real problem.This complete reference book was also up to the level of the book I just mentioned. While I already knew most of the standard C and C++ material, what I didn't know was the STL material they presented. They showed how to use the STL in standard programs, but then rolled it into MFC programs. They did this in a way, even us newbys could understand.Great book, guys.

Unfortunately that book didn't have any Visual C++ 6 specifics, which then lead me to purchase this book.With C and C++ background, I initially started reviewing the Visual C++ specifics in this book. Unfortunately, I could not follow the authors' thought process, so I started the C++ specifics, and again, had to stop, regressing to the beginning of the book.Eventually, I gave up on the book. My conclusion is that the authors are unable to convey simple concepts, and have a knack for complicating even the most basic concepts. I would strongly dissuade beginner-level programmers from purchasing this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy any books with this kind of \\"Faces\\"","review":"I bought several \\"The Complete Reference: ...\\" style books. I am really and deeply disappointed with them. They are just cheating every time they say \\"the complete reference:...\\".Honestly, the content of this book is OK (including others in this kind of \\"faces\\"). But, before I bought them, I really wanted to get a good reference but not some kind of entry level's books. Unfortunately they are almost some kind of entry level's books.I hate \\"cheating in this way\\". The publisher or editor or write, whoever made decision on the title of these books, are liars, disgusting liars.So, I won't buy this kind of books again. I will give the lowest rate for all this kind of books just because they use \\"title\\" to cheat on the market!By the way, if you are beginners, don't quit and some books (such as \\"The complete reference: Java 1.1\\" and \\"The Complete reference: HTML 4\\") are very good for the beginners.Just trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I have been a C programmer for years, know a little C++ so thought this would be a good intro to Visual C. It is not. It's pathetic. Things are introduced out of nowhere, delving into the guts of windows include files without even simple explanations. To make any sence of this book you would have to already have years of experience in C++, yet it is supposedly for people of any ability. I wanted to know how to draw some simple dialog boxes, and how to get the user supplied info into a C/C++ program to use...I think I have even less idea of how to do that now than I did before I wasted my $ on this 'reference' (lol)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall C++ book yet","review":"I have ACTUALLY read and used most of this book. The Pappas and Murry give a good intro to the subject. C is taught as a subset of the larger C++ picture (something many authors miss).Examples are good, clean and to the point. Code formatting is also good.I would have liked more Windows programming, but hey - it's already 1000 pages. Guess I'll buy another book for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in a long time","review":"Once I start reading a book I usually finish it.

Michal Sands does a great job re-creating times long gone through the memories of his main character, Mark Nevon. And what a thrilling chase he creates when Mark finds out that his soul mate lives again in a young woman he has recently met. A great conflict is produced when Mark has to struggle between his growing love...and concern... for his soulmate and his faltering marriage. Very true to life. And the conversations throughout are realistic and flowing. I loved the ending. It makes me hope for true love, and it makes me believe there is a reason for our soul mates, even if we haven't realized we've met them yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better than Alice Faye","review":"While I'm not thrilled with the cover, I so enjoyed hearing some tunes that I hadn't heard Alice Faye sing before and several that I do have on other CD's, I can't go lower than 5 stars for lovely Alice. What a voice! Since there are a few songs from 42nd Street, you get a glimpse of what she could have accomplished at Warners Bros, if things had been different. Since you're told from the title, the selections are from screen and radio, the sound isn't studio sharp, but Alice Faye is always quality listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analysis of Grace and Beauty.","review":"Of course ! Woman is the grace and beauty, and this book focus on that kind of beauty as it's title. \\"Raphael : Grace and Beauty\\", it is not only a book about \\"How sprezzatura he had\\", but it also tell us the answers of \\"What are the things hiding inside his works of graces?\\" and \\"Why are they have to be realized?\\". With many essays of many well-known scholars, you will find many useful points of view for your doubt more or less. However, it is easy to read and follow the words. It's format is suitable and luxurious with the outstanding fornt jacket picture, \\"detail from Fornarina\\", that is also the main grace analyzed in this book.

I would say there is a limited scope at best. The book assumes for instance that addiction is a separate disease when in fact many patients in pain have co existing addiction problems past or present which clouds the issues inherent in prescribing opiates obviously. Further, there is growing acceptance currently for the theory that \\"disease\\" is a term applied to addiction too freely, apparently a trend not limited to outside of this book. Also I note a glaring lack of references. I recall seeing similar discourse and material discussed in several separate magazine articles and web blogs unrelated to this author, pre dating the publishing of this book.

Great looks, tolerable capacity; but terrible zippers, shoddy stitching and a laughable headphone output plastic circle (it came off in about a week) far outweigh the benefits, easily making it the WORST bag I've ever owned.

I'm a thin and short woman and I think that the sling design does not have such a person in mind. The bag felt clunky and odd on my back (kind of like an ill-fitting vest perhaps) and I felt the need to readjust it a lot. It is also a pretty painful experience if you have to walk more than like 2 blocks or so. All the weight of my computer seemingly rested on my one shoulder. Besides all that, I found that there was plenty of space for the computer plus maybe a couple of legal pads and I liked how there were tons of crazy pockets. It looks pretty cool, but I would definitely go with the backpack version of this bag instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"great backpack","review":"I bought this bag because I wanted a compact laptop backpack, and it works well. Basically, it is like your standard laptop attache case - but converted into a backpack. As you can see from the photos of the bag, it is slimmer than a normal backpack and designed to hold mainly a laptop and a few packets of paper. It is tough nylon and the strap feels secure. There is a sort of retractable handle on top if you need it. Overall a great compact bag, which I now use every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sling pack ever!","review":"Have had this for 3 years. Bought for just about $20 online, Love it.

It's not a particularly good movie. It tries hard to have that Euro simple minimalist feel to it but American directors that try to do this are basically always missing a beat. It's a high school play at best. The fireworks gimmick is pretty inane. Yes, it moves along like an extended Saturday Night Live skit. The attempts at profound observations are well, silly and predictable. Okay, let's call it like it is: Another American waste of a movie.

After \\"Forever\\" WB should have canned Joel Shumacher and got Tim Burton back. You could basicly see this coming by how campy \\"Forever\\" was. All of the characters were so poorly portrayed, it was like the Brady Bunch were wearing Batman, Robin, and Batgirl's costumes meaning these were not the same characters in the comics. They were different people. I don't blame the actors but the director and the writers. In my opinion, they should have hired Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, the geniouses behind the animated Batman. If you want a good Batman story that involves Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Mr. Freeze, I recommend \\"SubZero\\". I also recommend \\"Mask of the Phantasm\\" which is the best of all the Batman films.

Even though it's the worst in the series, I just can't help watching this movie whenever it's on (hence the extra star). It's almost like watching a car crash, or a two headed dog. You know it's awful and you SHOULDN'T watch, but there's something compelling you. Over the years, I have come to be able to laugh at the jokes in this movie (not because they're funny, because they're so bad) I'm obviously not the only person to feel this way.

(...) This movie stinks. It is smelly. It needs a shower. I don't know what anyone involved with this movie was thinking. I also don't know how many zero's Warner Bros. put on the paychecks of all the people involved to get them to degrade themselves like this. It really is a god-awful movie. It is way too long and the effects are so hokey (Look! Ice that bends! Neato!). All the action sequences are fake. The actors are at their all-time low. I love Arnold to death, but come on, I would have taken a Kindergarten Cop sequel over this anyday. The scenery is overkill, I think Batman Forever was better because it wasn't so harsh on the eyes, but giant hollow naked statues? Someone's got to draw the line here folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"One worthless movie!","review":"I have watched this movie several times to see if i missed any cheap special effects.

Fine performances by Uma Thurman and Michael Gough get buried under a ponderous plot and far too many special effects that really aren't that special.

The other three were very good, this one was horrible (notice a relationship between plot and how good the movie is?) If you really want to see this movie, don't waste money buying it.

As they Battle their way againt Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) they find a new motivation and a new partner to keep the streets of Gotham City safe.I love the combination of Clooney and O'Donnel and their new sidekick(???). Its unstoppable. Schwarzenegger and Thurman played their villian roles flawlessly. Casting deserves an A+ for this movie.The special effects also should be noted in this movie. I don't think they over did the special effects as many other movies do.Definitely a movie you can just sit back and relax to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Smokes, Batman! This film is a BUST!","review":"Joel Schumacher, a painfully average director with a dubious track record (St. Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, A Time to Kill, and Flawless), siphons the dark edge Tim Burton brought to the first two Batman films. While the first two movies recall the darkness of the original comic book, Shumacher's Batman films recall the campiness of the 1966 TV series, and that's not a good thing. In addition to the wooden performances, \\"Batman and Robin\\" is jam-packed with an overly busy plot. There was so much going on in this movie I went dizzy. It takes no psychic to figure where this review is heading: \\"Batman and Robin\\" is a bloated mess that should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad,Bad,Bad","review":"This was a very bad movie to sit through.The cast does terriblejobs at playing their roles,and the script ...The action isslow,and fake.This movie could've been alot better If they workedon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely SILLY!","review":"I'm not going to waste much time and words to describe how silly is this movie! It's simply a waste of money and talent... so many reknown people in the plot for what? They add nothing.

An example of how a big budget and big means can do nothing in front of a nonsense of story and project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please bring back Tim Burton and Michael Keaton!","review":"I haved loved Batman ever since I saw it when I was 7. The Burton/Keaton Batmans were terrific because they were so dark, but Batman Forever wasn't too bad. This installment was very disappointing. The script was terrible, to say the least, and there were so many useless subplots(the motorcycle race for example). Clooney as Batman was pretty good but Keaton is the best. I liked Clooney a lot better that Kilmer. The villans were terrible and they should not let supermodels act(Elle mcpherson). The sidekicks were alright, but Batgirl's character should've been developed more.

Overly campy, pathetic \\"plot\\" that is only recognized for stunning SFX, and just lame lines. I was shocked to see such respected veterans of the first two films appearing in a trashy flick. The plot is the same as FOREVER with some new villains, who played their parts well- for a horrible script. I really the special effects, but this movie deserves to be forgotten. It is a real shame that Batman turned from cool, dark, and with a touch of humor, to appear in such an atrocity.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Batman's arch enemy Mr. Freeze and it is his worst acting job ever, with the other players not far behind. Some of the action scenes are so artificially contrived that they have you snickering and the dialog is at times seemingly directly lifted from the dialog balloons of a 1950's comic book.This is without question the worst of the Batman movie series that began with the classic starring Michael Keaton. While those with a historical interest in the Batman character may find the retro concept interesting, everyone else will find it tedious and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Unfortunately, it's only a silly waste of time.

I saw this in the theatre and I swear I was checking my watch hoping this would end. Arnold Schwarzennegger pocketed a cool 25 million for portraying Victor Freeze. He should have had to return it to Warner Bros for the terrible job he did. As for Clooney. Keaton and Kilmer were great Batman. Clooney wouldn't make a good Alfred. Joel Shumacher is an idiot if this is the best he can do. They should have let the director of the animated cartoon make this instead of that hack.

However, with this movie he really blew it. It was a totally LOUSY movie. It was commendable that George Clooney got the idea of lightening up the mood of the character of Batman. After all, like he said, Batman wouldn't want to grieve all the time. It just isn't normal. The BIG problem was that he overdid it, and as a result the Batman we knew in the past was 'transformed' into a clown in this movie. It is indeed great that the next movie is going to be a whole lot darker than this movie. I am sure that all fans of Batman would want to see a darker version of the hero i.e as in Tim Burton's movies. I really miss the subtly moody touch of the first two Batman movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman on Ice!!!","review":"I honestly don't know why all these whiny comic nerds hate this movie!

Poison Ivy has seduced Robin and turns him against Batman, until he gives Robin a speech about family. They receive help from Batgirl. During all the madness, Alfred Pennyworth is getting sick!

There is no plot; most of the dialogue consists of one-liners and bad jokes; there are far too many gratuitous butt-shots; and most of the acting is so bad that it makes what you might see at a high school play look professional. While there are a few good scenes between Bruce Wayne and Alfred, even these are spoiled by the frequent inclusion of hallucinations of scenes from Bruce Wayne's past (none of which, incidentally, seemed to have anything to do with his decision to become Batman.)

I appreciated the movie's cheezy quality because I love the 60's TV show, but the motorcycle contest with Robin and Batgirl blew chunks (the day glow paint was nice); Bane as a mindless tard blew bigger chunks; George Clooney is the cheesiest, emo actor in Hollywood and he made Batman blow the largest, greasiest chunks of all...and the nipples on the suit...bwahahaha!...such a sad ending to a promising franchise that would wait nearly a decade (God, maybe IT was an entire decade!) before Bats appeared on the BIG SCREEN again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless episode....","review":"BATMAN AND ROBIN does everything that Tim Burton tried to avoid when he brought Batman back inside from the cold - it is campy, cartoonish and plain daft.This movie seems a remake of the old Adam West batman episodes.

He was just too... boring sounded. He never seemed like he was having fun, while Chris O'Donnell took every oppurtunity to bitch about how great he would be on his own.

Alicia Silverstone is supposed to come from England. Where is her accent? Major movie mistake. Do not see this, as you will be bored, annoyed, and deeply disappointed.

But in this movie, he is concerned more on adding nipples to his costumes, showing his behind to the audiences and acting stupidly while iceskating with the worst Robin ever. And Batgirl, why did you have to bring her up? Even in the comics strip she has never been an important factor. And what will be next Batdog?? Mr Schumacher, if you consider yourself a professional, leave Batman alone. Batman is not for laughs. Your directing was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was a disaster!

Watching this film is like watching someone burning millions of dollars in cash before your very eyes. In other words, it's a loud, boisterous spectacle that is also depressing. It's so horrible that I almost cried. Seeing a once respectable film franchise being mercilously slaughtered is a grim experience. While watching this film, one feels that the director had a deep, dark, personal contempt for the Batman franchise, and that this film was part of his \\"master plan\\" to destroy it.Most of this film's cast has gone on to do bigger and better things. This is the one miracle to emerge from this disaster; one would think that this film would be career suicide for any accomplished actor. Oddly enough, the cast survived to do other movies. Yes, it's that bad.And now there is a two disc special edition!

George Clooney was okay in From Dusk till Dawn, but is dreadful in this movie and every other one he has been in. Robin should have been left out of this fourth Batman film because he is the worst character. It is too bad to because Robin was so cool in the comic books and he should have been the same way in the movies. Batgirl sucked too.

This movie absolutely fails on every front and in every possible way. The whole idea of Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze teaming up seems completely out of line as plants and cold temperatures do NOT mix, except maybe for pine or evergreen trees. This movie also is destroyed from the very beginning by a really weak cast and even the better actors involved give miserable performances in their characters. Even the background music fails as well. I can't believe that the movie franchise went from a dark and moving start with 1989's \\"Batman\\" and came crashing down to the ground with this trendy MTV-Oriented \\"Batman & Robin\\".

That is not the case here. The people behind this movie has amazingly managed to make a \\"Batman\\" movie that is less in tune with who Batman is than Adam West as a self mocking comedian who dances around in tights in the daylight while Robin sprouts out horrible puns.Often a \\"die hard\\" fan will feel the need to see everything related to Batman \\"just because.\\" Save yourself the trouble here, this film has nothing to do with the Batman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tour de force!","review":"A POW-BIFF-ZING action-packed extravaganza, I loved every ZOW-BANG-GLOT second of it like a fly loves stink.

Batman & Robin is also much better than Citizen Kane and should be on the AFI's list as the best movie ever. By the way I don't read Batman comic books because they are for little sissy girly-men (haha! get it?

On that note the only saving grace is the uberfab Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. She really camped it up and had a blast toying with the men. The rest are all but a joke. Clooney is ok, but such a let down from Val Kilmer (who really seemed to get it). Chris O'Donnell is good, but relys too much on whining. Alicia Silverstone is just plain fat and ugly. Hello! Batgirl wears a cowl, not an eye mask! Schwarznegger was PATHETIC! The man is not an actor, he is a personality. The whole film was nothing but cheap one-liners and you can pretty much just skip the last 30 minutes (it is ridiculous).

He was this incredibly strong and ruthless crime lord who broke the Batman. In this movie he can't even talk much less fight effectively. Plus, he gets defeated by Robin, very stupid. Batgirl is pretty useless too. Not the right origin and she's just really annoying. It would be better if her part was just used to take up time, at least we'd know they didn't try.

I must admit that Arnold Schwarzenegger was kinda okay as Mr Freeze and Uma Thurman was sexy as Poison Ivy, BUT WHERE WAS THE PLOT! I tell you these brain-dead Hollywood writers has butchered another franchise based on a TV show or a comic book. Batman creator Bob Kane died the year this movie came out, and rest his soul, he must have seen this garbage.

All of the wonderful Burton-inspired touches are gone, and the result here is so loud, annoying and badly acted that it is nearly impossible to pay attention past the first ten minutes. George Clooney would have probably made an excellent Batman, had he been given any decent material/lines to work with, and a relationship beyond the wooden one with Robin. Let's face it, he might be pretty, but Chris O'Donnell has not really acted in a movie since Scent of A woman, and there he most likely was playing off the sparks of Al Pacino.

The acting was poor all around, with flat jokes and cliches abounding. The sets, tastelessly overdone with neon lighting and mismatched coloration, were often painful to view. Even the special effects, which might have redeemed an otherwise mediocre movie, were far below the current industry standard. The vehicles, particularly, looked entirely unconvincing, resembling (perhaps intentionally) plastic toys. I don't think the storyline and plot even deserve mention: there was no suspense or tension, and no character (including Batman) ever had much to say beyond the corniest imaginable quips and puns. The only upside to the film is that the viewer may find him or herself laughing during the movie (as did I and several friends), not because of any humorous dialogue, but because it was so TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?

George Clooney, who I love, is not to blame for this flop. If he had known what he knows now about Batman & Robin, when he got that phone call asking...wanna be the next Batman?...he wouldn't have taken the role. I don't know who to blame this disaster on.

I would rather watch \\"Howard the Duck\\" while simultaneously getting a root canal than see this movie again.Yeah, so it may have good visuals. So do countless other movies, movies that offer at least SOME substance to go along with special effects.I remember seeing this movie at my college theater for $1. I was ripped off.

Oh Joel Schumacher, after your awful displays of direction in Batman Forever and now this so-called Batman and Robin film, I banish thee from ever watching, directing, or mentioning the name of Batman again!

Hammy acting from the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze (Patrick Stewart was tapped for the role, but was busy with another film), the degradation of the Bane character into a monosyllabic, rubber-suited buffoon, far too much neon, tight-fitting rubber costumes with **nipples** (shudder)...no, there is far, far too much wrong with this film. George Clooney was not playing Batman, he was playing Adam West playing Batman, and he was doing a terrible job of it. If the moviemakers had decided whether they wanted a serious film, or a campy parody of comic books, like the 1960s TV show, then it might have had some potential.

It's nonsensical rubbish with Schwarzenegger (who was paid a whopping $26 million for his three weeks of work on this film) fitting in nicely with this offensively bad chapter in the Batman film mythos.

Mugging his way through lines like \\"The ice man commeth,\\" Schwarzenegger is arguably the biggest offender this film offers.Talents like George Clooney, Uma Thurman and Alicia Silverstone are completely wasted under the direction of Joel Schumaker. While the sets and costumes are expensive looking, the movie in its entirety comes off as a cheap, boring ripoff of the old TV show that starred Adam West, Burt Ward and Yvonne Craig.

That was great stuff. Now on this movie batwoman, who really shouldn't have been brought into the movie, was motorcycle racing and robin was beating up neon gang members. It looked like the year 2000! And in Batman bruce wayne was actually human, on this he's some kind of super hero.

I remember looking at this around Christmas 1998 and thought it stunk. It is not true to the comic book or the movies before this one. The one thing that got me was that, What are Batman and Robin doing out in public at a social function? Batman and Robin are vigilantes, and they stay away from the public eye. Also, the Character Bane is way off the mark of the comic book. He is portrayed as a lackey who can only say one or two words. He should have been given his own movie because in the comic book, he broke Batman's back. And why did we make Batgirl/Barbara, a relative of Alfred's. In the comic books, she is Commisioner Gordon's daughter. In the past, I let the minor variations slid, but this movie goes beyond minor. It ruins the mystique of the Batman legend. I just hope they don't make another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked. Bad.","review":"I still haven't accepted the necessity of Robin's existence, as played by Chris O'Donnel.

DON'T WATCH IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Batman & Robin\\" fight a series of one-liners.","review":"\\"Batman & Robin,\\" starring George Clooney, the new Bruce Wayne AKA Batman. Chris O'Donnell returns as Robin, the Boy Wonder. George Clooney isn't the reason the film had a negative impact, he did great as both Batman and Mr. Wayne. The lines, however, is a different story. Line after line comes a one-liner, and one of the most irritating is Mr. Freeze's line \\"All right, everyone, chill.\\" It's funny at first, but then he carries it on and on at everyone he freezes. Mr. Freeze's lines, in my opinion, is what caused the bomb to go off. Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy thought as a villainess she could make herself a queen of a charity ball. The movie's story is half bad because the audience knows what is going on already. Alfred Pennyworth suffers \\"McGregor's Syndrome\\" which would only make the movie more confusing. It is also the disease that changes Mr. Freeze. This movie was just irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman and Robin: An Epic Disaster","review":"If making bad films is an expertise, than Joel Shumacher is GOD!! How could any human being, living or dead, have any less of a clue about film making than Joel. Batman and Robin has leapt up and completely annhialated the original concept of Batman in one neon covered swoop. Batman's creator Bob Kane must be furious to see what a hash that hack Joel has done to an empire of class and high standards.

The acting was poor and the story was even worse. The usually good Joel Schumacher hurt the movie with sideways camera angles and a fake looking Gotham City. George Clooney isn't quite as good as Val Kilmer as Batman and is nowhere near the standards of Michael Keaton. And why is Bruce Wayne looking cheerful?! The only reason he became Batman in the first place was because of his parents' deaths. He seems to have forgotten they were deceased. It's hard to believe the movie's budget was 110 million dollars. I hear Schumacher wants to place an unknown teenage actor as Batman/Bruce Wayne for the next Batman movie. That is only going to make the movie worse, and with an unknown actor, the movie might not even gross 30 million dollars!! For a much better (although not excellent) comic book movie, watch Spawn, which has a better plot and great special effects on a much, much lower budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie like the plague","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!

I was obsessed with Batman enough to see it more than once and confirm the fact that this was just a terrible movie. I know this isnt coming off constructive, but anyone who has seen this film knows what I'm talking about. Joel Schumacher is a great director... infact, one of my favorites. Batman? Not the film for him. I wish they had ended his riegn of terror with Batman Forever. Though, Batman Forever was no where near this terrible... I saw it coming... there were signs like neon lights everywhere, overexaggerated landscapes, nipple on the batsuit, Robin, Batmobile scaling wall, and especially the poor story line. As I watched Batman Forever, I knew that it was only a matter of time before Batman clapped his boots together to activate his ice skates.

Let's be honest. There was no direction. But that's OK because there were no actor's on set to direct. They all faxed in their performances (which would explain why they were all so flat).The set (especially the bizarre gargantuan statues that seem out of place), the nippled batsuits, and the neon everywhere - well lets just say that it wasn't the Batman I knew.It was like no one cared about this film while making it.

Batman Begins had a better plot and was very well done.Maybe the water vaporizer in Batman Begins was a little implausible, but at least it looked good. The freezermazizer looked liked a cartoon.If this film is considered part of the Batman series, then Batman Begins is not.

Finally, the film emphasizes production value over story, a serious mistake in any kind of movie. Too see a franchise Tim Burton has developed leveled to this garbage is embarrassing; to note that this movie was one of the first major DVD releases from Warner Bros. is frustrating. George Clooney (Bruce Wayne/Batman) deserves credit for doing as well as he could with the circumstances; he's the only bright spot in the film, with the exception of Micheal Gough as Alfred.As of June 2001, one can buy BATMAN BEYOND: THE MOVIE, BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM, and BATMAN BEYOND: RETURN OF THE JOKER on DVD.

Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy are unconvincing character additions that should have been left out. Clooney and O'Donnel also don't act good enough for them to be the duo of Batman & Robin. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl also isn't convincing and would be better left out of the movie. This is without a doubt the worst that the Batman series has ever produced and maybe the most overrated movie of all time. I don't recommend this movie to nobody, it's a waste of a couple of hours. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because some of the special effects were cool, such as when Mr. Freeze froze something, but that's about the only good thing about the movie. \\"Batman & Robin\\" is a major embarrasment to what used to be a good series of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened to Batman","review":"Well, Batman has hit an all time low with this film.

The other thing i liked was Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. She played the part well to bad it wasnt in a better movie. George Cloony plays a crappy Batman, he doesnt even have a dark Batman voice.

While Batman Forever - as bad as it was - at least made *some* attempt to balance the cheesiness with some kind of serious drama, this movie jettisons all pretense of intelligence and depth. Blaming the actors for their performances is pointless and unfair, as they had a) a remarkably stupid story to work from (even making allowances for typical action movie plots), b) inane dialoge to utter and c) horrible direction by Schumacher. This movie truly is style over substance, and it's not even good style at that.

Don't even mention Robin or Batgirl, it's far too painful. Surprisingly, there is something good about this film. Arnold is excellent as Mr. Freeze, but he was written as a punch-line charachter, saying things like \\"Cool Off!\\"and then sending someone into deep freeze with his freeze gun. Uma Thurma is also great as the seductive Poison Ivy, but many of her lines are terribly written. The rest of the movie is ridiculous, with stunts that remind me of only one man........ Van Damme.

The extra colors in some parts (like the blacklit Robin / Street Gang fight) was kinda cool, but didn't seem right. With this film, everything about Batman was perverted into a too-cute version of a childrens comic book. Batman, who was driven by his parents death, ceased being the dark nightmare that he is supposed to be. The banter between EVERYONE, that means sidekicks and villians and heros, was so horribly cheesy that it sounds like a third graders dirty jokes. This movie was very obviously designed with one purpose in mind, to make money. Las Vegas was also, but at least Las Vegas has entertainment value, and the neon lights seen EVERYWHERE (freeze's costume, for example) in this movie. Dont waste your money here, get the originals with the Burton /Keaton team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Horsedung!","review":"Not only is this by far the worst of the four Batman films, it is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Clooney was accused of ruining the franchise with his performance in this film, but the astounding awfulness of this picture has nothing to do with him. Writer Goldsman and director Schumacher have discovered a new low in filmmaking by demonstrating a genuine contempt for their audience. The jokes are insulting to the viewer, and the wretched \\"everything is possible\\" take on the action scenes reduce the danger to the heroes to nothing, and thereby destroy any sense of suspense or drama.

By far the worst in the series. Having been burned by Kilmer's \\"temperament,\\" the studio wanted a \\"yes-man\\" and got one in Clooney. The attempt to \\"lighten up\\" the franchise resulted in a film as campy as the Adam West series, but without the wit or charm. Batman is a vigilante, not a hero, and should be portrayed as such; without the neon lights & bright colors.

A waste on uneeded lavish sets, terrible direction and worthless acting (except on Uma Thurman's part). George Clooney is terribly boring and stiff as Batman and Arnold Shwartz (ah forget it! I can't spell his name!) turns in a stupid macho role churning out cheesy lines like \\"Chill, People!\\" and \\"Learn my name well, for it will be the chilling sound of your doom.\\" God. The only thing worth it in this movie is the funny, outlandish Uma Thurman as Poisin Ivy, but even then uses cheesy one liners and has ridiculous plant costumes.

Total embarrassement to the Batman mythos that quite possibly a recovery from may not be possible. While none of the Batman films hit the mark, this one misses by a light-year and the comic book's attempt at reworking the charcater as a mature, dark, and slightly disturbed individual are totally undone into a campy flake with this film.

And so do I, for various reasons. 1: I don't really like George Clooney (especially since I'm not too familiar with him), and he doesn't make a good Batman no matter how hard he tries. 2: There are too many cliches in this movie, like the sidekick wanting all the credit and Poison Ivy screaming \\"Curses\\" as she's getting eaten by her own plant. 3: While I never really liked Robin to begin with (really, who does), I hate the design of his suit. It's nothing like the original. At least Batman keeps the suit from before. And finally: A BAT CREDIT CARD, YOU IDIOTS! WHAT. WERE. YOU.

There are so many things that you can point out from the film that you can even write a book about it and sell it under the joke section. I know he apologized years later for it but it still there's no reason to flip everything around from Tim Burton's first two dark knight movies to this junk.

That's about the only good comments that could be forwarded to this, the worst Batman entry in the franchise. This includes the entry from the 60's starring Adam West and Burt Ward. As a huge batfan, i awaited this entry eagerly, if for nothing else than we would get to see Batgirl on screen for the first time in near 30 years. Unfortunately, the result was lacking, the tone too camp and the plot filled with holes you could park three batwings in. George Cloney deserved a better script for his first outing, being the first actor assigned the role who looked the part of Bruce Wayne. Chris O'Donnell played to a part that was too young for him, the tantrums making better sense if he had been the age of the real Robin at the time and Alicia Silverstone....i cant even begin to describe the nausea i get watching her ruin one of my favourite characters. Avoid if you can, unless you need to have the entire set."},{"rating":"1","title":"STALE POPCORN MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD","review":"Lets get the good in first....wait, there is not good. Batman is suppost to be dark and gothic. However, once Joel Schumacher took over the movie looks like a giant circus. Bright colors and less sinister villians make this movie too cartoonish. Plus adding Alicia Silverstone to the film, only makes your realize this is a hollywood movie, and stars want to be noticed as much as possible. It's not the actors fault, but Warner Brothers needs to get Michael Keaton back and get the films to a darker level like the comic books.

Over-blown, over-done and over-acted, this film practically trashes all the elements that made this series popular. When this particular film series started there was a deliberate attempt to give fans a non-campy Batman after the old Adam West TV show. At least the 60's TV series was SUPPOSED to be over-the-top, but having a more \\"serious\\" approach to the character treated this way is inexcusable. Only George Clooney's underused Batman and Michael Gough's solid-as-always Alfred have any dignity to their roles. Everyone else overacts in one way or another. Schumacher's style was OK in BATMAN FOREVER, but he went overboard using a paint bucket rather than a brush in this travesty. (For those politically inclined, Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura has a cameo as an Arkham guard who gets poisoned by Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy.)

Okay, let me just say that I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was the best thing going for this waste of film. George Clooney, in this movie, he blew. Batman was bland, Robin was a whiny ass cry baby, and Poison Ivy (Uma) totally over acted. It was ridiculous. I made a vow the very first time I saw it to NEVER watch it again, and I haven't. The main reason is because they had Batman and Robin, the dynamic duo mind you, arguing over a woman. A woman! Every one knows Batman and Robin love each other and no female could ever tear that apart. Okay, enough jokes, this movie made my stomach turn over and I was extremely disappointed.

The bad guys have resorted to cliches every other second. Robin is pretty good as he was in the last film. George Clooney blows as batman. He isn't cold or dark. He is probably the worst thing in the entire trilogy. Alicia Silverstone makes a fine Batgirl, but then again batgirl is rather useless. Arnold is the worst mostly because he says cliches that make him out to be an idiot. Don't even touch Ivy or Bane, they sucked.The plot has gotten pathetic slightly.

George Clooney seems completely out of place as Batman, the dialogue is painful to listen to, the action scenes are badly choreographed, and for some reason director Joel Schumacher decided to film half the scenes on a tilted angle.

BATMAN RETURNS went a little bit off course with a man who was 1/2 human 1/2 penguin and there was a lady who became cat like because she was bit by so many cats, this wasn't was not so bad but the action stunk. BATMAN FOREVER was so unrealistic because we have a man where half of his body was Freddy Kruegered and there is a man who steals brain waves but above all that the action was great.

This is bad practice of some publisher to misguide readers by placing the compiler's name on the book's cover as the book's author.

With a lot of the same actors and writers, War Inc. tries to be Grosse Pointe Blanke but with a quasi-political slant on today's events in the Middle East. It drives home some great points and decent comedy on certain events if you know about these things. For the average viewer a lot of the comedy will be lost because they don't follow NPR, or watch anything but Fox news.The movie as a whole fails completely, in cinematography, direction, and overall story. John Cusack's charm isn't enough to save it. You rent it and you'll see that if you're a really big fan of GPB, this comes off as like a spoof on GPB, instead of an unofficial sequel. It's an extremely odd feeling, after watching the same actors who graced us with GPB, to end up with a lame duck of a movie.I know that GPB's magic will never be recreated.

Cusack is hired to take out a man named Omar Sharif, who plans to build a pipeline through the country, thus destroying Tamerlane's plans to do so.The movie starts out as a clever satire of how American companies, often with ties to the government, profit from the war on terror. I wanted to like the movie and after the first ten minutes or so I thought I would. But it doesn't take long before the story completely loses its focus. It seems to be heading in all sorts of direction but doesn't go anywhere, all the while taking itself too seriously, forgetting to be funny.

Joan Cusak was particularly annoying and obnoxious as Hauser's Admin Assistant. Cusak had some great fight sequences in which he kicks butt. Well, kills butt.

Grosse Point Blank was great, even with his sister Joan playing a similar character, this is just a bad movie. John Cusack wrote this (or produced it) and he should stick to his straight man off the cuff roles he plays so well (way back, \\"Better off Dead\\", \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil\\", \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\").

This is just a really bad movie with questionable performances by everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I have in the past really enjoyed John Cusack, but this movie was so vapid. The attempts at humor were predictable and droll, and the characters were just a reflection of John Cusack's image of them - very stereotypical. Obviously, not much thought went into this movie.

John Cusack is one of my favorite actors, and his sister Joan is usually hilarious. Marisa Tomei is a comedic and dramatic genius, and of course Ben Kingsley is an acting ace. Dan Aykroyd is another favorite actor--loved him in Spies Like Us. In this movie, though, they all fall far short of their true potential. The plot is hard to follow, the characters are either muddied and incomprehensible or nothing more than cardboard caricatures. It was hopeless drivel, and after watching it for far more than I really wanted to, I finally just popped the DVD out and gave up. I would not recommend this movie to anyone but someone with nothing else to do and no prospects of ever having a good time anywhere else. On a scale from 1 to 5, it's a definite 0. Even watching John Cusack didn't make up for the lack of a credible plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I mostly like John Cusack's movies but this one was the worst.

I don't understand how a lot of movies that are popular and frequently a media topic are considered \\"funny\\" but are kind of lame, boring, and vulgar. This movie is not trashy, delivers a decent message (though comedies don't have to), has great actors (at least in their comedy talents), and appeals to both sexes. I honestly think there is something wrong with your political views (and I do think there are wrong political views) or sense of humor if you don't enjoy watching this movie. I mean, given all of the SNL skits (but there are really good ones too), television shows, and movies that are so NOT FUNNY that are lauded as the holy grail of comedy--this really stands out as decent comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD NOT GET ANY WORSE","review":"Movie with John Cusack and great support actors/actresses, home run right?

The company's president has sent his hitman, Hauser, to assassinate a Middle Eastern oil minister. Hauser is now struggling with his dark past. He must pose as the corporation's trade show producer to pull off the hit. Now he must entertain a pop star before her wedding, and keep a left-wing reporter off his back. All these things may be more than he can handle while keeping his sanity.This movie is really funny. It stars John Cusack, who is one of my favorite comedic actors. The story is interesting, the characters are compelling, and everything is completely off the wall, yet almost believable. I'm really glad I saw this film, and I recommend it to anyone who need a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made!","review":"The film tries to humorous via the use of satire centered around the Iraq War, Dick Cheney, and the role of contractors. However, the connections to reality are so weak and the plot so ridiculous that it ends up being repulsive and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action is continuous but I was bored throughout","review":"This 2008 film is a try at political satire that fails miserably. The premise is that an American Corporation runs the world. John Cusack is cast in the role of an assassin who follows the orders of his boss, an American ex-vice president played by Dan Aykroyd. After an opening scene which shows Cusack murdering three men in an Alaska bar, he is sent on his next mission, which is to assassinate a Middle Eastern oil minister. The country is a stereotype and there is never a dull moment because there are explosions everywhere. Hillary Duff is cast as a local superstar, Marisa Tomei is cast as an American reporter fighting for justice, and Ben Kingsley is one of the bad guys. Action is continuous but I just didn't care. And in spite of good performances by the cast I was bored throughout. Frankly I hated the film. It gets absolutely no recommendation from me whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Terrible movie. I struggled just to get through half of it.

Avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAR, Inc.","review":"Based on the previews and interviews I have seen for Cusack's WAR, Inc., I expect this to be one of the best and most important movies of the entire millennium (so far!).

At least in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couple laughs, but mostly misses the mark","review":"Had some amusing moments, but overall this satire misses the mark. For every memorable scene (such as the artificial-leg line dance and the \\"virtual embedding\\") there are five more that fall flat. Marisa Tomei looks as great as she always does but is asked to do little; and John Cusack reprises his Grosse Point Blank character, but with far lesser effect. The only surprise was Hilary Duff, who I only know as being a Disney singer - couldn't name a single song - but did a half-decent job as the local wanna-be diva. I really wanted to like this, but just can't really recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected.","review":"I wanted this movie to be good. As a member of Iraq Veterans Against the War who opposes our nation's militarism, I thought this caricature would be entertaining. Alas, it was not. This film failed to capture my attention and failed to provide any stimulation, intellectual or otherwise, throughout the duration.Although I believe it is worthy of watch, it is not the cerebral satire of contemporary American policy that I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Has No Dividends","review":"War Inc. is a bad movie. John Cusack shouldn't have been allowed to have this much scene time.Peter Hammond of the Box Office Magazine compares this movie to Dr. Strangelove.

Unfortunately, this is written by a writer, not by someone truly experienced in the field, and the writer appeared to do minimal research. It appears to be intended to appeal to weak-minded television soap opera viewers seeking a \\"true crime\\" thrill. It's claimed facts on some cases are misleading or incorrect. Some sections repeat other writer's errors that would be easily corrected or refuted by minimal research or thought, which obviously was not done. Colossal disappointment. Not recommended.

I had an older, larger brother to the 601 (the 2002 Onkyo TXDS-797) so when I needed another 6.1 surround for a smaller room I had no hesitation about the 601. It is, as Boomer says, an outstanding value for the price (and you can do a bit better than Boomer if you search - I found it at a couple of places on the web for less than $375, brand new in a sealed carton).The automatic smart switching of the audio mode depending on the type of input (Dolby, DTS surround or not) is a great feature, and the unit is solid and reliable, driving even speakers of modest efficiency (for example, our set of Encore Energy surrounds) to plenty of volume even for old, semi-deaf ex-rock and rollers like me.

I started reading it excited for all of its wonderful advice; however I was very disappointed, as the book selected one passage of scripture to base the whole context of the book.

Over all, it was a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Camelot Movie, another reason not to make them...","review":"While a big fan of the Arthurian legends I failed to enjoy this movie at all. Helena Bonham-Carter, as per normal, was fantastic, but I don't know where Isabella Rossellini learned to act. I began to wonder what at all Merlin would see in her. The main character (Merlin) ran around saying the rather poor lines in a New Zealand accent while silly Martin Short stuck to his American one. Maybe with a different Merlin this movie would have worked. Arthurian movies should estrict themselves to Merlin-like concepts, where we know it is a complete farce, but are enjoying it too much to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best version of Arthurian mythology.","review":"This movie looked so promising on the commercials (despite having Helena Bonham-Carter in it) but when it finally aired on TV, I found that ALL the good things I'd seen on the commercials were it. Don't get me wrong, I love the Arthurian legend, and I enjoy reading/seeing different versions and interpretations of it. This interpretation was not well done. There are so many intriguingly dark aspects of the legend--love, betrayal, magic, incest, lies, etc. I don't think this version benefits from being \\"DISNEYed-up\\" because it robs the story of much of its depth. Sam Neill made a dismal and unbelievable Merlin, and the movie fell far short of its potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another arthurian disappointment.","review":"A wicked case of boredom had me watching this movie on TV. Suffice to say that there would have been more entertainment value had I turned the TV off and watched nothing. Beyond bad from every angle. I don't usually expect much from a movie about Arthur & Merlin with all the other bad ones floating around out there, but _MERLIN_ fails to meet even the lowest standards. Sadly, there hasn't been any good films of this genre made before or since _EXCALIBUR_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful. Watch 'Excalibur', instead.","review":"There are very few movies that (in my opinion) are not worth $1 which is what I paid to rent this bilge, but this movie certainly makes that cut. I spent a considerable portion of the movie speculating on what prompted a group of (presumably) reasonably intelligent people to make this movie. The sad part was watching Martin Short, an excellent actor, and Sam Neill go though their lines like they were reading aloud from a book. They have zero chemistry together, and the attempt of a romance between Neill & Rossellini is so out of place, as to be excruciatingly painful to watch. I don't think it's funny that they tried to pass this \\"chick flick\\" off as a mythological film. That's what Merlin truly is.....a \\"chick-flick\\". I guess the producers forgot to watch 'Excalibur' and learn how to make a REAL Arthurian movie before embarking upon Merlin. My suggestion: avoid it at all costs. If someone wants you to watch it with them, get them to pay for your ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Excalibur","review":"This movie is typical of how an American film company takes mythology from other countries and trashes it so bad that the unsuspecting American viewer thinks it's great fun, and that what they're getting is also an education on other cultures. \\"Merlin\\" is a travesty to Arthurian legends, which comes as no surprise to me with the US film industry these days- compensating good storylines and acting for the sake of turning out no-brainer SFX marvels. If I wanted to see great special effects, I could easily accomplish the same on my pentium. If you want to witness a great movie on Arthur, then go see John Boorman's Excalibur.

I wanted to like it and truly tried to keep an open mind about what I was watching. Instead I found it to be alternately laughable and embarrassing in its depiction of Arthurian legend, as well as in its obvious bias against all things pagan. The plot was bizarre and disjointed and the characters were shallow and narrow minded. I kept waiting for Sam Neill to either chop off Morgan's finger or run screaming from a velociraptor. In fact, I think that death by velocipraptor would be preferable to being forced to sit through this utterly worthless and entirely obnoxious film ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excalibur was better!!","review":"This movie relied too much on computer generated special effects.

Special effects are a bit cheezy, Queen Mab's hoarse voice becomes tiring, some stilted dialogue from others, but Sam Neill does excellent work of coarse.What about Uther's wake? Did anyone notice that his body almost falls off the table when one leg of the table partially collapses? The actors go on just as if nothing happens.

There was all this advertised hoopla on NBC about how great it was, but it was just three hours of my life I want back. The love story was pointless and just plain annoying. The only decent part is when the credits start to roll at the start and end of the film. I would much rather watch a documentary about Merlin than to ever watch this movie again.

My Score: 1 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merlin: a refreshing visit to the Arthurian Legend","review":"First, I didn't like the latest version of King Arthur. Pulling out the VHS of Merlin proved refreshing; the sweet in contrast to the bitter. The VHS, I rated three stars, I added another star as the DVD would included added features not included on tape.The good news is that Merlin consolidates a number of variations in the legend to provide a linear story.The bad news is this is a story that has to be watched in one setting, and with attentiveness: in other words w/o distractions. Too many little items link the story together.The magic is represented through good special effects, although there are more background characters then explained in the plot.If you want the legend; you will want Merlin in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I liked this movie, I first saw it on tv, and have been searching everywhere for it.

As a matter of fact, I have yet to see one NEGATIVE review here that goes beyond the criticism of Merlin to trash any of the POSITIVE reviewers. NOT A SINGLE ONE. If I don't like something that you do and vice versa, well, then we are both entitled to our opinions. But to go out of your way to persecute others just because they don't agree with you, and to close yourself off to the possibility that there might be more than one opinion here......Well, I wouldn't know what else to call that other than \\"NARROW MINDED-ness\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The home video version was CHOPPED!","review":"The original movie was great.

Sam Neill couldn't even save this horrendous movie. The acting was about the quality of modern soap operas, and the script was just pitiful. I felt I would be wasting my time as I stuck the disc into my DVD player, but I choked in utter disbelief. The only part that I liked made me laugh=the reunion of Martin Short and Mr. Ed. Ok, I forgot the horse's name but it sure sounded a lot like him. Apart from this, the film sickened me, and it saddened me that they couldn't come up with something better after many previous attempts. The only thing this movie accomplished was that it made me appreciate \\"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\\" a whole lot more. Now, that was a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"The William hung of Arthurian Fantasy","review":"Like the American Idol reject, Merlin is chock full of SFX to wow the pre-schoolers for its obligatory 15 minutes. There isn't much beyond [that] the stale script and wooden acting can save from the rubbish heap. The one-dimensional storyline appears to run in circles. Sam Neill's portrayal of Merlin doesn't develop much, as his disposition at the end of the film is almost the same as it was in the beginning. In every good story there is a protagonist and antgonist who struggle against each other until an end is met. Britain was still no better off after the people decided to turn against Mab, their designated villain. Now, I wonder how many brilliant minds it took to brainstorm such a lame plot.

THE CHARACTER OF MERLIN IS ALSO ABSENT THROUGHOUT 1/2 OF THIS INCORRECTLY TITLED FILM. IN SITUATIONS WHEN I THOUGHT HE WOULD SHOW UP TO SOLVE A PROBLEM, HE'S NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

Lacking in character development, because we don't know that much more, if not less, about Merlin than we would traditionally have. 30 minutes was wasted on a romance that never developed much all the way through to the end. That's 30 valuable minutes which could've been used to improve other parts of the movie, or the rest of the movie to be exact. 3 hours later, the viewer is left wondering \\"What was the fuss all about?\\" A waste of talent and film on a storyline which would not have seen the light of day were the executives at NBC not drunk all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to King Arthur's mythology","review":"If you enjoyed this movie it's because you never heard of King Arthur's story before.

Stay away from this piece of crap. Or, better, buy all the copies you can find and burn them. All thinking persons in the world will be grateful.

The story pretty much plays out much like most other King Author and Merlin movies but this is not just another Excalibur or King Author - Merlin clone, where this version of the story stands out is how its told and the different outcome of the movie ending.If enjoy these fantasy type movies, its a must have for your collection, this one in particular is getting harder to find.Merlin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good.","review":"When this was first aired on TV I recorded it onto a VHS tape and watched it plenty of times after. I have yet to read any other reviews of this product on this website, many of which appear to be a bit disapproving, but I've always enjoyed this movie. It can be a bit silly at times, but I find it most often to be very watchable and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much different interpretation of the Arthurian legends.","review":"3-hour NBC miniseries tells the Arthurian legends from Merlin's perspective, and is largely unsuccessful. Sam Neill is superb as the titular character (Creating the most convincingly human Merlin to date) and Isabella Rossellini has never looked lovelier (The two also have a lot of striking chemistry), but the film suffers from a poor supporting cast, an abundance of rushed scenes (made even worse on the shortened video version), and a lot of cheesy special effects from the Jim Henson company. Maybe a rental, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lame","review":"This movie is just very lame. I mean the actors themselves are actually quite good, but the story line development is lame. Character development direction is virtually non-existent. The lines are poorly crafted that even people with the most juvenile sense of humor will cringe in pain as each line is delivered. I forced myself through the whole film to ensure I was not judging a book by its cover, but with the exception of a few rare moments this movie is surely one that you will want to forget. This a movie should have been left on the shelf. Don't feel like you've missed anything if you haven't seen this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to turn King Arthur into an uninteresting movie","review":"This is a painfully bad retelling of the Arthurian Legend. The bad guys look more like the bad guys out of Welcome Back Kotter, The good guys look like a high school production of Camelot. Camelot itself looks like part of a cheap 1970s TV show set.The story centers around Sam Neill as an unappealing Merlin, Martin Short as Merlin's sidekick stooge Frik and HB Carter(Morgan la Fey) who, despite being the high point of the film, is completely unable to convince us that she has any affection for the bumbling Frik.Bad guys grimace, music sweeps heroically, rousing speaches and predictability ensue, followed by a forgettable conclusion.Not worth it even for fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Arthur","review":"Recently when at the video store I got \\"Merlin\\" mixed up in my head with with a BBC production of the same name, mistaking the former for the latter. When I got home and realized my error I figured, 'Go ahead and watch it, how bad can it be?' Heck, it has Sam Neill, Martin Short, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Rutger Hauer in it!The answer is that it can be pretty damn bad and a complete waste of time. So much so, that it's difficult to find anything good to say about the movie. Casting: Sam Neill as a believable Merlin? Maybe if the film were made in 1975 and not 1995. Acting: it's as stiff as can be imagined. The actor's have to be treating \\"Merlin\\" as just a paycheck. Direction, cinematography, score? Forget 'em, they're no improvement over the casting and acting.Don't make my mistake; this one is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello?","review":"Can anyone locate a plot for this movie? I won't bother spoiling anything for you because wel...there isn't anything to spoil. Absolutely nothing happens in this movie! Thank god I only watched it with my friends as a joke to add to a school project.Let's just say there are a lot of lines that bring this movie down a lot. I'm sure all the late night hosts have already summed these up in one way or another. I was lost after the first ten minutes, and it's hard to get through the first five! My advice to you is...if you want to see a movie that is at least remotely watchable...AVOID this one. For the love of God!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No EXCALIBUR, that's for sure....mediocre at best.","review":"\\"Excalibur\\" proved that a movie can provide the setting for a spellbinding/magical story, action, intelligent character interactions, and nail-biting suspense. Unfortunately, \\"Merlin\\" fails miserably on all four counts. The culprits here are obvious plotting, mediocre acting, and pedestrian direction. The film has one legitimate surprise (no plot spoiler here), but it's way too easy to figure out the rest of the action before it happens. Martin Short fares the best of the cast, but he's stuck with the stereotypical role of the bumbling side-kick often found in most slapstic comedy films. Sam Neill shows no screen presence as the main character of Merlin who has to make things right. As for the direction, the film moved too slowly (especially at the beginning). Since I was always sure of MERLIN's outcome (unlike \\"Excalibur\\"), the special effects were the film's only lure, and they were poorly done at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title, no storyline...","review":"Merlin is more fluff than substance. Overlong and drawn out, it could've done without many of the scenes. Like When Frik was demonstrating his shapeshifting powers to Merlin during what seemed like an eternity. Or, like When Frik was demonstrating his shapeshifting powers to Morgan during what seemed like an eternity. Or, like When Frik was demonstrating his shapeshifting powers throughout the entire film. Without much of a storyline, \\"Frick Teaches Computer Animation 103\\" sounds more like an appropriate title."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could've been better","review":"Merlin could've been a better movie. I could point out all of its faults from beginning to end, but that would be wasting my time. There's enough here to add a commentary audio track on the subject alone. Unlike many bad fantasy films that are awful from the get go(DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS to name one), Merlin could've been one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. That's what really burns me up inside. The pieces to the puzzle were definitely there, but never quite fitted together. To make matters worse, Kathryn Bigelow(the talented director of POINT BREAK, and the horror classic NEAR DARK) was originally slated to direct Merlin. But negotiations fell through, and they had to settle for Steve Barron(who?!?!?). For NBC, the rest is \\"kick yourselves in the head\\" history. For viewers, another waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it's hyped up to be.","review":"Oh my god, Can it get any more boring then this?!

Forgive what sounds like a childish exaggeration, but while I had looked forward to this very much, I came away from it feeling despair. The cast lives up to its reputation for technical quality but there's no feeling of character, no involvement. Everyone says exactly what they're thinking - sometimes even when there's no one around to hear them - and in case you should happen to miss the obvious, it's said to you in speech, underlined with pantomime gestures and then repeated in a voiceover narration. It feels strongly as though the cast were hired, the effects planned and the network broadcast slot arranged before someone realised that there should be a story. They didn't think of it in time. In the UK this show screened in two parts but I didn't even bother with part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"An eye-popping visual feast, but....","review":"Despite the stunning special effects, \\"Merlin\\" falls short of anything remotely based on Arthurian mythology. Many of the occurences portrayed here are nowhere to be found in any of the numerous books written on the subject of Merlin. Several of the characters aren't even based on traditional sources, but were created by the film's producers because they feel that the audience in general is ignorant enough not to read books to notice the differences. The plot wears thin at times, and there is hardly any significant character development and interaction other than between Merlin and Frick (one of the aforementioned fake characters created by the producers). Such fallicies left me longing for John Boorman's 1981 classic \\"Excalibur\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"There exist TWO versions of this DVD!","review":"There are two versions of Merlin.One is 140 minutes long, and should be avoided!The other is 182 minutes long, and is the full version.

Special effects junkies may get something out of this film, but I found it long, very boring and totally unmoving. The charters in general were shallow and one-dimensional; none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" romance between Merlin and Maeve.

English-speaking horses + toe tapping broadway numbers in a castle hall is not my idea of a medieval fantasy. It's bad enough with Camelot and Kid in King Arthur's Court that we don't need anymore new additions to the ever-growing list of cheesy fantasy flicks. Bypass this one if you can.

The historiclly inaccurate events were told out of sequence, and the all-star cast gave a horrendous performance. The special effects were poorly photographed; notice how the stones from Vortigern's castle just seem to \\"disappear\\" upon collapsing, instead of tumbling downhill. Compare this to the SFX in older movies, such as \\"Dragonslayer\\", which were done without computers and look much more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful TV movie","review":"This is a TV-made movie, to tell the story of Merlin.Sam Neil did a wonderful job in this movie to tell the story of Camelot, from Merlin's side.

Reenacting the rise and fall of a king's wizard, Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) brings strength and compassion to a role that is often portrayed as an old and stiff grandpa. Miranda Richardson does a wonderful job with both Queen Mab and The Lady of the Lake (Queen Mab is especially amazing, her beauty, Gothic undertones and harsh voice will make you swoon). Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club) play's a young disheveled Morgan Le Fey, and Martin Short as Queen Mab's assistant Frik plays the films comedy relief. A great addition for anyone who loves the hidden stories of any underrated sidekick."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAIT FOR THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!","review":"This one is a mind boggler. Many of the scenes were vague and saturated with SFX sequences. I don't even understand why they had to include King Arthur. All he ever does is complain to Merlin about his illness and other problems. Both him and Frik were quite annoying. They accomplished nothing other than to waste valuable time and space which could've been used to help fill in the many holes in the plot. Don't waste your money on this soon to be obsolete DVD! WAIT FOR THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, INSTEAD! It should be available sometime early next year and will differ significantly from the current version. Roughly 30 minutes will be replace by 27 minutes of never-before-seen footage to help make the film more comprehensible.

It's not even good filmmaking of any kind. Not when it achieves nothing but blasphemes the true mythology of King Arthur, and not when the producer thinks that everything there is to know about Arthur can be obtained by watching cartoons and bad movies. Anyone who reads the very books on which the legend is based upon will tell you the same thing. If you're too lazy to read, then go and see \`Excalibur' instead. It's an excellent film by John Boreman(sp?), and is about as close as you'll get to the books without ever having to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!","review":"Oh my god, Can it get any more boring then this?!

Perfect movie for those who do not read books.","review":"Complete waste of money and efforts - and everything just for the sake of special effects (which are, actually, very good). The main characters of the great legend look as though they were recycled from \`A Kid In King Arthur's Court' and the epic side of the story is obstructed by Merlin's love affair - and, to be honest, Sam Neill, though a wonderful actor, is not the right choice for Merlin! Nothing to compare with Boorman's \`Excalibur' which I strongly recommend to those who really love Arthurian legends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad,bad!!!","review":"This must be one of the most low-quality movies ever shot. Firstly: It has no resemblance to the actual myth about King Arthur. Second: none of the actors or actresses did a good job except Rutger Hauer. In fact, I don't understand why such fine actors as Sam Neill and Helena Bonham Carter even thought about doing this movie. They have starred in so many good movies and must have been insane to accept this script. Third: The special-effects stink. You must be a complete fool to fall for them, especially the dragon shown in the picture. So my advice to anybody who wants to see a movie about King Arthur and Merlin - watch Boormans Excalibur instead of this. That is a high quality movie with fine actors and, most important, it follows the real myth to almost 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merlin was a major disappointment","review":"I strongly advise anybody considering the purchase of the video release for Merlin to reconsider. I don't know if the mini-series broadcast on TV was better, but the video was really bad--probably because it was a condensed version. Though special effects were good, the dialogue was impoverished and the plot was a clunker. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was Martin Short's portrayal of Frick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the SCUD, this one mis-fired!","review":"Merlin misses its mark like a deaf bat hungover on a Sunday morning! It is so far off the beaten path that the title seems unjustified. The sets and costumes were from the wrong time period. The acting and script just awful. This movie reeks. There's no other way to put it. What were they thinking? Any chance it might've had of redeeming itself disappeared once Frick walked onto the set. The time of Merlin was poignantly one of sadness, tragedy, wonder, and grace. For a Martin Short or Jim Carrey to partake in such serious literary work of importance as this is a recipe for disaster. Unless Merlin was intended to be a parody, National Lampoon humor has no place in a film like this. My dog even threw up while we were watching! It may have all been a coincidence, but I have my suspicions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY, VERY DULL.","review":"This film has been described as a \`Family Movie' but I can't think of one reason why any kids would want to watch this 3 1/2+ hour dud. Nothing kept my interest. The film falls flat on almost every level, apart from the music. When you watch this, remember it is called MERLIN. And what do we associate with Merlin? Magic. Something that this film has NOTHING OF! I don't get it. Queen Mab constantly refers to Paganism as \`The Old Ways'. I had no trouble understanding that she was referring to Paganism because I have knowledge of this subject. But how on earth is anyone else supposed to know? Nothing is ever explained about the history and friction between \\"the old ways\\" and christianity. The dialogue and acting throughout the entire film is absurdly lame(very, very bad). That's it.

Gee, how could one possibly resist this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam Neil fantastic job as the wizard Merlin!","review":"The story starts off as Merlin as a very elderly wizard with the beard. He tells his story of how he became the wizard he is. He tells about how he was born with no human father and that his mother Mab created him from magic. He also tells about how he fell in love with Nimueh and how he uses his powers against Mab and to help everyone he loves. He also raised Arthur as his own and then tells him he is the true king of Camelot. The acting is spectacular and they don't pick B actors who are nobodys who can't act. People complain that this movie doesn't stick to the real story of Merlin. But come on people! No one really knows the real story or if its even true or not. Theres many differnt versions of Merlin, and Aurthur and the knights of the round table. This is a great movie for all ages it has romance, action and adventure. If you like fantasy and Sam Neil movies this is a movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and Overdone....","review":"Yet another version of the tired and overdone tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This time the story centers around the life of Merlin, but not actually based(not even loosely) on anything we know which has been written about him. The movie is a 2 part mini-series originally presented on NBC over 2 days in 1998. That part is a mystery, but everything else is tedious and predictable. If you need a sorceror's fix, rent Willow or Lord of the Rings instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD AT ALL","review":"GEE... I wonder about the so-called \\"sources\\" people here have been talking about.

If you want to learn about the real Merlin or anything Arthurian, I'd suggest that you watch \\"Excalibur\\" and read the following books: \\"The History of the Kings of Britain\\" by Geoffrey of Monmouth, \\"Arthurian Romances\\" by Chretien de Troyes, \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" by Sir Thomas Mallory, and \\"The Traveller's Guide to Arthurian Britain\\" by Geoffrey Ashe.

(The 'Fay' was gaelic for \\"Faery\\", and Merlin never gave a damn that King Arthur slept with her.).And nobody even MENTIONS that Morgan LeFay was the protectress of the realm of wales, or that she is synonymous with Nimue and the Lady in the Lake. Like many other false retellings, they do not realize that Lancelot was not one of King arthur's knights, and never even SAW the round table!

Almost everyone looks at least 15 years too old for their characters and Sam Neill (usually respectable) sleepwalks thru his part along with everyone else.I'm a Christian myself, but the story's \\"Hallmark Channel Christian conversion agenda\\" was unnecessary and very transparent. There are also a few racial stereotype jokes in bad taste, the special FX are below average, and the sets look like all the other \\"magical miniseries\\" sets. Weirdest of all was the way they chose to present Merlin as a weak uninteresting man who can't do much but evidently has great PR.

They have nothing to do with Arthurian myth at all, and take up at least half of the film's time. Instead of being a decent 2 hour TV movie, it became a campy 2-day mini-series with goofy characters. And, the reason for adding in all of those uncessary characters? Just because. this film is so off that the British and American chapters of the Arthurian Archeological Society (organization for lovers of all things Arthurian) refused to endorse the film, and even gave it unfavorable reviews!

The film had a very Disney-ish make believability about it, the kind where you'd leave the theatre were it not for your 3-year olds tagging along.

It ends up being slain by Merlin, but not before Nimue's face is badly burned. The only purpose of this scene: to show Merlin healing it at the end of the film. Then there's Merlin's jesting sidekick Frik. 10 minutes of perfectly good film wasted on his shapeshifting during a dance number in the castle hall. WHY?!?!? Way too long and drawn out, Merlin would've fared no worse had it been cut in half to 1 1/2 hours. Most of this could've been easily accomplished throwing out Frik's character, which does absolutely nothing for the story. It's ironic that the last line in the film was \\"No more magic\\", because that's the impression I got from beginning to end. NO MAGIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD has the entire movie","review":"Only buy the DVD!

Never has a film captures the spirit of King Arthur as much as this one although it's base more on the life of Merlin. For a film made for TV, it had an actual cinematic feel to it! Special FX are amazing for a Hallmark miniseries and the film actually executes better than most of the other miniseries such as Arabian Nights and the 10th Kingdom. As for the DVD, it doesn't dissapoints. We are given a HBO making-of(with unseen footages)and detail filmographies of the actors and film makers. The 3D menus themselves are very impresive with a D&D feel to it. The picture quality is as good as you can get; the print is clean and does not show much signs of artifacts or blocking. Sound is in Dolby Surround and displays well at key action scenes of the film. Overall, it deserves to be in every respected DVD collector's shelves. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better in a half hour than in 3 hours","review":"When my teacher for English told us that we had to do a project about King Arthur, we thought of making a video that would mock a movie that depicted the story of Arthur in a bad way, and we chose Merlin. I must say that Merlin tells the story in a completely different way than was written in sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", and some of it seems to be made up. Such as, Morgan Le Fey wearing a 20th century leather costume. Arthur didn't get Excalibur from pulling it out of a stone monster. Oh, and about Merlin... he does not live until the very end, he is trapped (by someone other then the evil Morgana) long before that. Well, enough of stating what is wrong with the movie (there is more, but..), because there seems to be a lot of people who really like it. I will say, though, that once we cut down the movie to about a half hour spliced version of it (instead of 3 hours), it was much better to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"It is beyond my comprehension how such a fine cast would agree to work on something as bad as this.

Those who have given it a good rating and complain about the bad reviews... Try reading the books and/or watch \\"Excalibur\\" and you will begin to see the bad scripting, acting, anachronisms, etc.,.. in Merlin. FYI if anyone hasn't already noticed, Merlin has been boycotted by the Arthurian Society of Britain, similar to what christians did with Martin Scorcese's \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\". The Arthurian Society of America is also seriously considering similar actions, and have suggested that anyone interested in Arthur/Merlin to go and see \\"Excalibur\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN","review":"The music to this film is about the only thing I can say good things about. The film itself is overlong and boring. Here is some simple logic. You can either stay true to the source material and be boring OR take liberties with history and be good. Braveheart did it.

I also HATE that actor who play the bad Prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Merlin supposed to be a mythology or a comedy?","review":"I laughed throughout the whole movie, because I found it sooo funny. The legends as portrayed here were grossly inaccurate. The bad acting was quite hilarious as the actors seemed to be bumbling through their lines as though they've been hit with a bad case of nitrous oxide or something. Never before has such an assembly of all-star names gathered together to produce such ridiculous poppycock. Almost as ridiculous as Hallmark's other flop, \\"Noah's Ark\\". As is expected in Hollywood, shelling out millions of dollars for whatever big name star available wins out, while chemistry with the right personnel hardly ever gets a nod. And, coming soon from Hallmark...\\"The Lost Chronicles Of Jesus Christ... watch as we show you how Christ parted the Red Sea, how he started a revolution in Russia, and how he later went on to found Micorsoft Corp.

Lets get that funny guy from SNL to star in a magical fantasy and have some Kiwi be Merlin and perform unbelievable magic tricks like that David Copperfield... stuff like freeing himself from his chains or making flowers appear out of nowhere.

On the overall it's among the worst fantasy films I have seen (and I have seen a lot). First, the costumes, settings, scenery, and special effects are really bad. Cannot believe it!, just get a look at Excalibur to see the difference. But the worst, is how Merlin has become the first \\"politically correct\\" wizard. I mean, from a church point of view: fairies are evil, paganism is evil, and magic is evil. That's all guys! So Merlin has become the mage who dsn't like magic. And so, if your are a church integrist you can safely let your children see this film. But if you appreciate fairy tales, flee this bad movie!! You may instead buy (for instance): Princess Bride, which is much better, somehow still politically correct, but won't try to indoctrinate you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"As a fan and student of Arthurian legend, this is by far the worst depiction of Merlin I've encountered on screen or in print.

Somehow I wasn't surprised by the forgettable writing, directing, and acting. Knowing how many bad King Arthur movies have already been made, I didn't expect much from thisone. I don't mind if liberties are taken when making screenadaptations of books, just as long as it is done so withrespect and retaining the flavor of he original. Merlin does neither, merely proceeding to distort the facts.On the flip side, there was a lot of comedy to go around. Talking animals, Neill & Short seeming more at home with the Laurel and Hardy crowd than anything else. Merlin, however, was never intended to be a comedy making it all the more frustrating for viewers who are expecting good sword and sorcery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good news and bad news.","review":"The feel that one gets of this movie being geared towards children through the use of sanitizing special effects is quite deceptive indeed. Some of the material herein are questionable, as well is the length of the film. 3 hours is way too long for any child to try and not to sleep through. Having braved through many a cinematic epics myself, I couldn't help but close my eyes from time to time. That was the bad news. Now here's the good news. A special ed. of this DVD is planned with tons of deleted alternative scenes re-inserted and some deleted. The coming new dvd will include the new as the original tv version. From what I've heard the newer version is the director's cut. It's supposed to be way more edgier, so hopefully there'll finally be something available that's almost as good as Excalibur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all-around detector","review":"I bought this detector because I wanted to be able to turn on my front porch light when someone drove up in my large yard.

In fact many of their best songs are here \\"Secret Messages\\", \\"Take me on and on\\", \\"Four Little Diamond\\", \\"Stranger\\", \\"Danger Ahead\\", \\"Letter from Spain\\" and the funny rocker \\"Rock n\`Roll is king\\". This alone makes the cd worth it, and then there is all those songs that havent gotten worthy playtimes, like \\"Bluebird\\".My favorite song of ELO is Danger Ahead. It is a upbeat rocker with a tight and typical ELO sound, with a wonderful chorus. I love it, and it makes the cd even better.It may not be the good old ELO as they were on Eldorado and those records, but on the other hand, I prefer the Jeff Lynne dominated style, on the newer records. Those who reads my other reviews knows my knack for his style.I give this cd 5 stars, there ARE some not so good songs here, but the good ones make it all worth it.

From \\"Secret Messages\\" to \\"Four Little Diamonds\\" to \\"Stranger\\" this cd rocks. There is no filler songs on \\"Secret Messages\\" as every track speaks volumes of vibrant raucous, romantic harmony. \\"Secret Messages\\" is definitly an under appreciated gem of the 1980s. \\"Secret Messages\\" is a smooth listen, written by Jeff Lynne, one of Britians all time song writers. A nice sounding, remastered cd with fine linear notes, song lyrics and three previously unreleased tracks.

It is merely good, early American music showing well its Celtic roots. It'svery soft, sweet and soothing and, even in its livelier moments, quite relaxed.

After reading other scathing reviews, I learned that because this plugs into the power slot, and the power supply is plugged into this, that it does more harm than good because it takes away electricity that would go to the console.It really does jacks*** when it comes to providing more air for the console. The design is flawed because although the intercooler brings more air to the internal fans, the fans don't bring in any more air than they would without this. If you want to improve the airflow for the console, buy replacement fans like a Whisperfan from Talismoon. They're cheap and relatively easy to install, and they're supposed to be a lot quieter.

They really shouldn't even have those softeneres there and advise people not to stand theirs up or have anything blocking the vents. People have bought the cooler and it has given them problems. That's because it's using the XBox's power, basically taking power away from the XBox. That's how you burn out your system. It definitely is more harmful than everyone thinks.

When my xbox is on it heats my room up about 10 degrees. At first it worked. It was noticeably cooler in my room. After about a week I experienced the \\"red ring\\". I researched a little bit and found that people had been having the same problem. However, from what I have heard not everyone has this problem. So, in conclusion, I suggest you stay away from this, but if you want to take your chances, I can not guarantee this will not work for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM NYKO","review":"I purchased the intercooler fan about a year ago and have had it connected to my xbox360 until recently when the consol began not working anymore. I attempted to take the intercooler off of the xbox360 only to find that i could not, it turns out that it had fused to the plugs on the 360 somehow. I sent the consol back to xbox and they stated that the warrenty was voided due to using a third party's hardware. I mentioned this same problem to a friend who had the exact same thing happen to his xbox360 as well. I have had nothing but bad things happen when buying any Nyko products (battery charger....)

I was getting this twice a day for about 3 days, so I decided to see if unplugging the unit would help. When I touched the intercooler and cable, it felt like I touched a hot frying pan. So I removed the cooler,and let it sit for a while. Presto, not a problem since then. My xbox worked fine before I put it on, and now it works fine again.

It killed our Xbox 360 and gave us the \\"Red Ring of Death,\\" (three of the rings around the power switch blink red, indicating a component failure). If you haven't heard about this you should do a search and read about it. The first thing the Microsoft tech asked when we called was if we had a cooler on the Xbox.

I've recently noticed that 2 of the fans have now completely failed and do not spin.

So Good....","review":"So after combing the internet and finding information about the nyko intercooler, I must say I was (and still am) skeptical. So far I've had the cooler hooked up for about 2 weeks. I havent had any of the complaints listed here as well as other internet sources yet (melting plastic, power drain, etc.). The 360 does seem noticably cooler to the touch and games on my HDTV do not seem any different. The increased noise is very noticable, especially since my console is on a desktop and I am sitting at a desk playing. However if it was in a component shelf I dont think it would make any difference as the 360's fan is already fairly audible.Overall, I am happy with the performance of the product. It does what the box says it does. I am worried about long term effects of the product simply from the comments I've read on the internet, HOWEVER none of the major game/hardware reviewers (i.e. Gamespot, CNet, 1UP, etc.) have mentioned the potential hazards to the 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I bought this several months ago, and it never worked.The system would not power on, and there was a red ring instead of the usual green one.

Unless you have whatever you're playing/watching turned up pretty loud, this thing will noticably drown some of it out. I ended up taking it off because of this.As for the cooling aspect, I have played many hours both with and without this fan and have noticed no difference whatsoever. I have noticed that the air coming out of the 360 feels cooler, but the system never crashed regardless of whether I had this thing on or not.The only reason I am giving this thing 2 stars is because I would imaging if you WERE having a problem with cooling (like if you lived in a hot climate or had a lemon), then this would probably keep your xbox cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"item does not match picture","review":"i had purchased the Xbox 360 Nyko Intercooler but the item i recieved does not match picture on the page. mine doesnt have a switch to turn it on or off. it stays on so i cant play it when my family is sleeping, (due to the fan sound which they are really loud. i dont know where they get the parts from becuase they dont last. after about 30 hours of non-continous use, one of the fans stoped working. i would say be carefull of what you see, and what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy while it lasts","review":"Well before you purchase yes this item does do what it says, lower my temp and system ran smooth.

When it was sent in microsoft said he had voided the warranty from putting the intercooler on and he would have to pay shipping and repairs. It seems that the intercooler causes your system to draw more power than it is supposed to and ends up frying your power supply in the end.

At first I nervously laughed it off and restarted the system. Things were fine till it happened again and then again.

My A/V cabinet is confined and the 360 gets rather hot. My 360 began freezing with the intercooler attached in Oblivion, whereas it had been totally stable and had never crashed or frozen before. In one instance artifacts began appearing on the screen, which any PC overclocker knows is a sign that your GPU is getting too hot. I get the impression that all the intercooler does is draw much needed power away from the 360 and generate a lot of noise. Keep in mind that the X360 is running something similar to a Radeon X1900 and has three IBM processor cores. The size of the power brick alone should tell you that it needs a ton of juice, and it's probably not a good idea to do anything to disrupt its power supply. As another user suggested, buy a small fan to put behind your tv if you are concerned about heat. The Intercooler on the other hand is a fundamentally flawed product that should be avoided.

I literally had to get a utility knife to cut the plastic apart to remove the unit.

Then about just over a month ago, I got my first red ring of death, and things just went down hill from there. A couple weeks later, and I was having shutdowns almost everytime I played. My xbox has plenty of room to breath, as it sits upright under my desk, with nothing but the floor in a 1 foot radius around it (my desk has a bar for the side, not another wall.

There are now brown burnt marks on both the intercooler and my 360. I have not used the Intercooler since that day and have no longer received the red ring of death. This company needs to be sued.

As a person experimenting \\"alone\\" and just trying to figure out feelings that are normally considered taboo, this book was a great eye opener. It showed that even some of the strangest urges can be rather common if you know where to look. This book is great for anyone interested in the why of bdsm and how do do it safely. Also the other information that is provided is great. There are lists of how to make your own toys, groups that are into bdsm, and other things that are better to experience when you have a good recommendation into what you are getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin Proof","review":"I have 4 of these and they are very sturdy. I have rowdy 2 year old twin boys and the gates have survived intense beatings from walkers, tricycles, and body slams for over a year. Although my kids are excellent climbers, they have not been able to find a foot-hold on this gate. Note: the rubber pressure points are snug and have removed paint from some door frames upon release."},{"rating":"1","title":"toddlers crash right through","review":"This gate is a real piece of junk. (I have 3 of these things- bought at the same time b.c they were cheap.) It tore the paint off the sides of my wall, it marks the parts of the wall where the paint actually remains, my son bursts through it with minimal effort, the handle is really difficult to operate... If your door frame is the slightest bit uneven or off in any way, the pressure thing is totally useless. We are constantly tripping over it b/c the pressure points don't stay pressed to the wall. It just doesn't work well. I have never used it as a wall mounted gate though so maybe that works better. (I have lived in apartments for a while and need to use the pressure mounts so as not to drill in the wall.) Long story short, I don't recommend this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised.","review":"Firstly, they call it a pressure-mounted gate, but fail to inform you that if you need to use it as a true \\"gate\\", you need to hardware mount it. Otherwise it is a pressure-mounted barrier, not a gate. You need to hurdle it or pull it out to pass.Secondly, the mechanism was awkward. It kept sticking. Neither my wife nor I could easily slide the two panels.We returned this and bought the more expensive, but infinitely more usable First Years Hands-Free gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Satisfied","review":"Great gate at a great price. It's really easy to use and the fact that you can take it off the hinge and move it to use in a different dorrway or take with you to someone else's house, is really awesome. The installation was a breeze too. I reccommend these to all of my friends with new babies coming along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok...","review":"We have this using the pressure-mounted setting. It does stick and then it's really hard to work. I have two of them and wish I'd paid a bit more to buy ones that work better. My husband hates it and is insisting we buy another one... that works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to use, quit working","review":"I never really liked this gate because it is somewhat hard to use. I bought another one because I needed two gates and this one was the only one available.The first one that I bought no longer works. The handle used to open and adjust it will not lift.I have the new one pressure mounted at the bottom of the stairs and it works ok for this. My banister post is round and tapered so it is smaller at the top. The pressure mounts on this gate adjust a little to fit, so it is working as a temporary fix.It would work fine for a plain pressure mount, but it is hard to step over."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrified!!!!!! Extremely dangerous!!!!!!!!","review":"I have a very active 1 year old, I got this gate and put at the bottom of the stairs, I was happy thinking my son wouldn't go up the stairs so I turned my head for two minutes, and when I turned around my son was on top of the gate standing on the middle bar with his head almost on the other side, about to cross to the other side!!!!! thank God it was sturdy!! if not my son would have had a terrible fall!!!!!! I got so scared I returned it immediatly for me it was extremely dangerous!!! DO NOT GET IT IF YOUR CHILD IS ACTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a pressure mountable gate!","review":"This item is listed as a pressure mountable gate, but it is not. It is only a gate if you hardware mount it. Using it as a pressure mounted devise it is simply a removable wall, which is not very easy to use with one hand. I'm returning the item today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, this gate is not very user-friendly. I have only used the pressure mount option as I am a renter, the handle does not life up easily, the two panels are very difficult to slide, and once you have it mounted, you better leave it alone. We've had ours for less than a week, it's already bending somewhat from one side to the other. It is extremely inconvenient to step over especailly when you are carrying a baby. I would recommend going with a more expensive unit and stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is my favorite album from the year 1981 and one of Jeff Lynne's most creative moments. Recently hearing it again takes me back to that year, what I was doing at the time, etc. I had this on vinyl and transferred it to a BASF cassette, which I played in my Ford Pinto's cassette player! Anyway, this is a wonderful ELO release, which kind of signaled the end of ELO's run was near - how could they have topped this? Another reminisce: the local FM album rock station in Raleigh played \\"Prologue/Twilight\\" when it had just come out and after the song was over, he mentioned that he got a LOT of calls asking who the song was by. Absolutely essential listening for lovers of melody, tight production, Beatlesque inspiration. John Lennon himself once had complimentary words about ELO - I believe he would have loved this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time again","review":"A fantastic Album.

Wish I had know about it earlier. I especially like the bonus tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time revisited","review":"It was wonderful to hear this fantastic album again. I had Time on a copied cassette back in the early to mid 80's. It is even better to hear it on CD. An electronic sounding voice opens the album, then it burst into \\"Twighlight\\" which gives me goosebumps! ELO were on tour in the UK during the early 80's, performing this album and opened their show with a huge spaceship on stage. It was great to hear the album again and re-live those fabulous 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lights Go DOwn","review":"\\"The Lights Go Down\\", for me, is the highlight of this fantastic album. The vocals and the music make this song one of Jeff's best. And then there's \\"Julie Don't Live Here\\" which I originally owned as the B side of one of the singles. \\"Julie\\" is drenched in the classic ELO sound. As I type this I'm reading all of ELO's reviews while listening to all my ELO Cd's. While some artists from the 70's seem dated I can honestly say that is not the case with ELO. Any of these ELO remastered discs with bonus material are well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An over-looked treasure.","review":"Jeff Lynne has always panned the last three (REAL) ELO albums, saying he wanted 'out' and was just running out the contract. Well, whatever his reasons for saying this, the creativity, and hard work still show, and stand the course of time.(No pun intended.)Time is still one of my favorites, and one I continue to play. Jeff Lynne is one of the true brilliant and original artists alive today. You can always tell an ELO song by it's sound, strings, vocals. And there's bound to be one or two songs that touch the heart of just about anyone.The 'orchestra' may be at a minimum here, but the unique talent is in full force. In fact, I believe this album holds up better than most because of the more 'techno' sound.As a die-hard ELO fanatic I wouldn't be without any of their work, and I'd have to put 'Out of the blue' and 'Time' at the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite records of all time","review":"I think that this record can stand infinite listenings ( you always heard something new, a new detail ). The songs have a very good craftmanship and quality and for me it's more interesting that \\"Eldorado \\" .The production is amazing. The vision of the future that Lynne painted in 1980-81 was not wrong at all . \\"Life's meant to be \\" it's like hearing the today's news and \\"When time stood still \\" it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard ( I still wonder why they put it on the B-side of Hold on Tight ).\\"Ticket to the moon \\" it's such a great song.It's hypnotic.I love this record , it's good music from beggining to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and Wonderful!","review":"I loved this book so much that I started reading it for a second time the minute I finished it. It is a \\"cozy\\" in the best sense of that tradition. Sit by a fire, drink a cup of tea, and enjoy the book and the great recipe at the end. The characters are endearing, and the story is touching. By the end of the book, I was wishing that Lori and Miss Beacham lived in my neigborhood. The book is a great escape, but it also teaches an important lesson about the true meaning of charity. I feel just the way Lori did at the beginning of the book-I have had enough of the bad news and tragedies that inundate and overwhelm us. This book made me smile and made me wish it didn't end."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is hope for the world","review":"I like the description of the Aunt Dimity mysteries as \\"Nancy Drew for grown-ups.\\" If you are feeling down and discouraged, grab an Aunt Dimity story, a plate of cookies, and pot of tea for an afternoon. No four-letter words, no sex, and good always triumphs over petty in these books. My only criticism is that Lori is especially obnoxious in Next of Kin (she always is but seems more belligerent, judgmental, and inflexible here). Her moral reclamation is that much more dramatic after her childishness, so it's easy to forgive Atherton's portrayal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I am a huge Aunt Dimity fan - I have read all the books. This one was a disappointment. The \\"mystery\\" was barely a mystery at all, with a very anticlimactic and unfulfilling ending. Plus Lori, who started off in the series so quirky and likeable, has turned into a preachy goody-two-shoes. Atherton tries hard to make Lori seem like a regular ol' down-to-earth mom in spite of the fact that she's rich and spends her time volunteering for a million projects, but it doesn't work. Nancy Atherton: please give us a meaty mystery and show Lori as a loveable goofball again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book girl","review":"Good shape; quick service; everything came in quickly; nice to business with you. good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best - big fan","review":"I find myself waiting anxiously for the release of Ms. Atherton's next book.

Just wish I could see a better photograph of the covers of the books..and that they were in color. I would suggest that her editor got a different stylist for her book covers though. I don't like any of them. Ms. Atherton's books are ones I could read over again and that is rare for me. I see myself in her cottage because Ms. Atherton makes her books come alive.

This is not a super bright vanity light for your bathroom sink/mirror area. That is where I installed it, and it works, but it isn't quite bright enough. It sure looks good though!Complaints:The edges on this product are a little sharp/rough. I didn't hurt myself on them, but it implies a lower build/manufacturing quality than it actually looks like in daily use. Not really a big deal, as the only person that will know is whoever installs it. The guests and wife are none the wiser.4 out of 5 only due to the lumen output is lower than expected, and the \\"rough-ish\\" edges. Great value!

I can live with my mistake, but would like to replace the broken glass. I'm disappointed that the manufacture seems to offer bulb replacement but not glass. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not practical, and poorly packaged for shipment","review":"This fixture is attractive, but from a functional standpoint is poorly designed, and the packaging for shipment is poor. The first one arrived with one of the glass covers broken. Amazon (with its excellent customer service) promptly sent a replacement. Only after the light was installed did I notice that it throws its light upward and outward, but not downward like you would expect from a bathroom vanity light. The bottom of the fixture has semicircular metal pieces with very small holes (pinholes almost) that sit under the bulbs and block the light from projecting downward. Because of the way the glass shades fit in the fixture, it is not reversible (they would fall out if installed in reverse). The result is that a light over the mirror does a very poor job of illuminating your face (which seems to be the whole point of having a light over the mirror). I would not recommend this fixture."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice vanity light","review":"We bought the 4 light one and it is perfect for our bathroom.We think this is a good match for a small to medium size bathroom and it gives up a very warm light.It took us months to decide what to buy and we are really happy with this find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comptemporary and inexpensive","review":"Both my wife and I love this light a lot. We installed it above the vanity. The bathroom has another ceiling light for the bath and toilet. So this light alone is bright enough for the vanity and sink. Some customers said it is not bright enough for make up. I am not sure how bright a light one would need for make up, but I think it is definitely good enough for daily use (brush teeth, shave, putting on contact lenses, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap","review":"Not at all worth the money. It does't put out much light and the metal housing is very thin giving it that \\"cheap\\" look.Also, after it's been up less than a week, the middle light comes on/goes off when it's in the mood. Three lights don't provide enough lighting for even the most mindless task so TWO lights? Forget about it.I've already written this off as a loss. I'm thinking about painting the cheap housing with a textured metal paint to make it look a little nicer. Can't hurt...."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice attempt but should take statistics 101 first","review":"I was quite enthusiastic about this book and went to evaluate it for one my introductory courses for graduate students in biomedical sciences.

I have a couple of those large 55s in my mic collection.Today's 55SHII takes the second, scaled down model, adds an on/off switch and has updated the mic capsule to a quieter, more modern sounding cardiod pattern, which helps control feedback while onstage near monitors or front of house speakers.The recent line that I've seen don't have the fit and finish that the originals have, but they still have that same classic look. And they sound even better today.So if it's the classic rock 'n roll look you want, there's really no other mic to get.

Like the \\"O Brother\\" albums, \\"Revival\\" is Depression-style American music (not quite country, not quite folk, not quite bluegrass) recorded with modern production values that provide a clarity and richness missing from actual Depression-era recordings. What's more, although they sound like they're at least 75 years old, the songs on \\"Revival\\" are all Gillian Welch/David Rawlings originals.I would also note that Christian music fans ought to be singing this album's praises.

Start with Merle World, Honky Tonk Haze, First Things First and go from there. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the Del Reeves/Lauderdale version of Diesel, Diesel, Diesel on the Rig Rock Deluxe record is better.

As such it is not useful as a technical reference whereby you can look up a topic in the index and go straight to a \\"how to\\" section relating to that topic.If you wish to learn by completing multiple projects step by step it is fine.I prefer a technical reference style publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Only?","review":"As a very experienced developer I needed to learn about SQL Server Reporting Services as quick as possible as for a project I am starting. I bought this title primarily based on the great reviews, I must say I was very disappointed. If you are already a developer or report writer then I would say this book is not for you.The book started out alright but when I got to chapter 3 titled 'DB 101 : Database Basics' I kind of figured I may have the wrong book. Next chapters were on various levels of report creation, no explanation of the report to be created or it's features, just a very detailed list of step by step instructions to make the report.I know many learn by example but I learned nothing here as I can not take the time nor do I learn from following mindless step by step direction. After a few chapters like this I quit reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Core Reference in my Toolkit","review":"Recently I decided to upgrade my shop to SQL Server 2005 from 2000. Being an MCDBA, MCAD and MCSA I was pretty comfortable around SQL Server, Visual Studio and Windows Server but...I had NEVER used either the Analysis or Reporting services - never had the need...I thought.After reading both of Brian's books I realize just how bad I missed the boat. Brian's book does a fantastic job of both selling the service as a valuable asset and getting you well on your way to actively rolling it out. I found the book easy to read and being a big \\"hands on learner\\" really appreciated the exercises. My only grip about the book is the lack of a materials CD, I was a little irritated that I had to go and download stuff to complete the exercises.For anyone new to Reporting Service, this book is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"There's obviously 2 versions of this book: Version 1 uses the Adventureworks data; Version 2 uses Galactic Shipping data.....Installing the Galactic database and info is IMPOSSIBLE!!!

The first couple of chapters were great..then he abandoned all pretense of giving a detailed idea of all the options and possibilities and created a fictitious company and started solving their fictitious problems with reporting services...didn't take me long to realize their issues weren't my issues and he wasn't going to cover what I needed to know because he was sticking with explaining only the features needed to solve his companies problems.Now I'm sorry I spent so much time researching this book and money buying it...now I have to continue my search for a book that just lays out the features and options available in Reporting Services."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sql server 2005 Reportin Service, Brian Larson","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This is a book seems to be targetting retarded. There is a chapter on datbase concepts - if some one does not know, it is unlikely they will be reading reporting services. Too much fluff and descriptions are buried in the fluff. If you skip the fluff, you may find yourself difficult to connect dots. Too much details on formatting fonts, colors which is completly useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Assumes You Are A Little Slow","review":"I felt like this book thought I couldn't connect the dots.

If you've never seen visual studio and/or you've never touched any kind of relational database or any kind of reporting tools in your life, maybe this would be a good book for you. If you just need the bullet points on how it works and someone to point you in the right direction on some of the more complex things SSRS can do, this book won't work for you.Most of what I have learned about SSRS so far, I have learned from the Internet and Microsoft's included documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too prefer the technical reference methodology","review":"I have nearly 15 years of report writing experience using Crystal, Oracle, Access and other less common report writing tools. I need to be able to hit the index, grab a topic and run with it. For example, shading alternate rows is a fundamental report tool. However, trying to find out how to do that in 60 seconds or less was impossible with this book.

This book does a very good job of that. How to write and format reports is covered well and the explanation of report distribution and security is well done. I was disappointed to see that Report Model and Report Builder, ad hoc reporting tools were only covered by an appendix.

It is very sharp and I would not recommend this for people with sensitive nose. I thought my nose just needs to get used to this type. So I tried 3 times and I had to wash my hands off because I might throw up if I kept it on my skin. Finally, I gave this up to a friend. If you know someone who has this, try before you buy. This is definitely not a blind buy kind of fragrance.Update 02/09/2011I stopped by at my friend's place and I was curious to try this one more time to see if I have developed a liking towards this.

At that point the light either does not come on or stays on 24 hours a day. I then buy a new one and throw the old one away.They come with a 10 year warranty now but when they don't work trying to get a warranty on a 25$ item is a hassle and if you have to send in parts and receipts it really isn't worth it. I have to tell you that I have had 100% failure of every one I have purchased and I am installing a new one today.

If the light switch is on and it is nighttime, the lights blink on and off. Switch positions, delay times and motion in front of the sensor have little effect. I am an electrical engineer with 30 years experience and I know how to read an owners manual and troubleshoot electronics. It is not user error. These units were truly defective. I called Heath/Zenith technical support in hopes of diagnosing the problem. The technician was both arrogant and ignorant of his company's product. I will not take a chance on installing warranty replacements, nor will I reward their sorry customer service. I will never buy another inferior Heath/Zenith product. Total loss.

I think anyone interested in theological studies would enjoy it although it does rely heavily upon the Book of Mormon so traditionalists may be turned off. It is written at a high-level of language, which is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. You really have to work and think to read this text, it is not a light or \\"fun\\" read by any stretch of the imagination. It is however, worthwhile.

And I can't say why, but despite Lawrence's beautiful writing, this book is just boring me. I guess it's because I don't like any of the characters. And their endless, self-centered philosophizing is irritating. There have been a couple interesting parts in the plot, but mostly it seems to drag on. I read Sons and Lovers years ago and enjoyed it, and I recently read Lady Chatterley's Lover--that one I greatly enjoyed.

I found it terrible. The characters were completely unlikeable, unbelievable and all the same. I heard good things about D.H. Lawrence prior to reading this book, but I refuse to ever read anything by him again. This book totally traumatized me. The people who tried to censor it 80 years ago were right. Nobody should ever be forced to endure the torture of going through this book.

I did not expect, from the title, that it would be a book for a Christian, but I believe in respecting authority, so I tried to read the book. But I was not able to finish it. It was so dark and full of all kinds of morbid things, that were almost as bad as the pornography. It had no redeeming feature. I felt ashamed while I was reading it, and it was so bad that even the places which were all right seemed suspicious. I thought, how will he find something weird and ugly here? This book was written back when England was full of labor unrest and socialism and paganism and what they called \\"free love\\" so I suppose this had something to do with it.Some of the Christians in my class wanted to complain to the Dean about a hostile study environment for Christians, but we were afraid of retribution by secular humanists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still shocking as a work of literature","review":"Well-formatted for the Kindle, with an easy-to-navigate table of contents. The novel itself is striking -- \\"right between the eyes.\\" Passion has rarely felt so naked, and yet so much of the passion in _Women in Love_ is the passion of intellectual debate.

Although in the novel Lawrence tries to portray the effects of an industrial world on the mind and soul, a very interesting topic, the novel itself is dark, frightening, and way too wordy. Reading this book is like being on an intellectual merry go round that never ends. Even the love story of the novel is demonic and twisted. The story just seems so farfetched from reality -- the characters are just not people you can connect with and the women seem either stupid, cold, or calculating. The story could have been told so much better, and if Lawrence wanted to comment yo such an extent much on man's mind, why not become a psychologist and not waste a reader's time with so much intellectual blabber! Far too dark and wordy for my taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliant writer, dreadful book","review":"Women in Love is a very tedious read. Sure, the author does use the English language brilliantly. But perhaps too brilliantly; some passages take repeated reading to understand what is going on!But the most frustrating aspect of this book is the characters. None of them are the kind of people you'd want to know. And I never met any people who talk drival about love, relationships, their insecurities, etc. Worse, one of the characters is a thinly disguised D.H. Lawrence - and this character is the worst! :-)I was very disappointed with this novel, but not with its author. With such a rich command of the English language I can only hope that he had put it into better use ... and thus deserving his fine reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"This book has no likeable characters, and because of this, no one really cares about the characters' feelings and actions.

His thematic range is virtually unlimited. From anti-war to social conscientious themes on children and the elderly he blows me away with the creativity and flow of his words and music. I have heard him live in concert here in Ballard (Seattle) and was not disappointed. Anyone who is moved by socially compelling themes in a folk/coffee house style should become familiar with Eric Bogle. He also has a lot of fun, funny, lively, music as well!

Plot has all the ingredients of gang violence, murder for hire, protection racket, crooked law enforcement and rich elites who make their own laws. Everyone pays in the end except principal character who gives himself a second chance in life...although he does not struck as a long term planner or deep thinker.What makes this movie worth seeing is in the title.

As someone who lived in Italy and even honeymooned in Tuscany, I looked forward to this book. I wasn't really sure what it was. Part cook book and part story of a year in Tuscany, I felt it lacked focus. More importantly, it lacked romance. Her characters seemed distant, almost cardboard figures. I wasn't drawn into their lives. Say what you will about Frances Mayes, but her book brought alive the magic of Tuscany."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE TUSCAN HOUSEHOLD","review":"I found this book very disappointing.

Instead of an entertaining read filled with scientific facts, we get the tragic and predictable story. Given the slow pace of medical research on most complex disease, the odds of even a billionare being able to save a brother in a short time frame are near zero, let alone a family of more modest resources. The writing style seemed overly simplistic, and i kept thinking that there were many facets of the story that to me, would be much more interesting, but didn't get told for whatever reason. With great respect for the author, i found this particular book unappealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total empowering","review":"From start to finish it never lets go. You become so involved that to put it down is unjust. You become so involved with each person you feel you know them personelly and by the end you do.

There have been many researchers in many universities, not only around the country, but around the world working on this topic, and they should have been given much more recogition for their efforts and their contribution. For that reason, I found The Calcium Diet, by Edita Kaye to be a much more balanced approach which talks about all the new research and gives a time-line as well as generous credit to all the researchers working in their field.

If you are fan obsessed, love the band to death and have the money to spend, then this is way worth getting! I bought it and am glad I did.

But wow, I am really disappointed. The first 3 songs are great, but as soon as you get to the 4th song the rest just bore you. It's like Jon got really bummed out, began taking some \\"mood altering drugs\\" (because his big record label dropped him) and then started listing to John Tesh CD's. Way way too much piano, and way way too depressing. I hate say it, but I see why Elektra records dropped him. I hope he doesn't go down the MINISTRY trail and start making a bunch of bad CD's. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because I'm a big fan. You may want to check out the Kidneythieves. Female singer, with an edge that VAST used to have. As you can see I don't write many reviews, but I had to put my 2 cents out there this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful.","review":"I don't know why so many people have said such negative things about Crosby and everything post Visual Audio Sensory Theater. I loved Music For People. In fact it was Music For People that first introduced me to Crosby. I love all of Jon's music - everything, and Nude is not an exception. He writes wonderful music with striking harmony. The one song that really stands out on this CD is the third song - Don't Take Your Love Away. The vocals are hauntingly beautiful, as are the lyrics and the melody and the harmony. The song is just AMAZING, for lack of a better word. My second favorite song on the album is Ecstacy. The lyrics remind me of Pretty When You Cry, but the overall feel of the song is just fun. I love the entire album, but those two particular songs outshine the rest. I eagerly anticipate Nude 2. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese Fantasy","review":"Wow, this album was nothing less than a truly moving experience.

I fell in love with the first CD back during my college radio days. I was really taken aback when I saw a live performance back in 1998. (I actually did get to meet Jon several times after that.) I was hooked from then on. This third album, 6 years after that live performance, is fantastic.Nude harkens back to VAST's early days, when their sound was darker, more gothic in nature, more alluring and mysterious. (Even though their second album was good also, it was also very mainstream sounding, hence why this album was released on another label.) This album attempts the difficult task of recapturing that sound and making it unique and new. I think that is accomplished.My favorite tracks are \\"Thrown Away\\" and \\"I Can't Say No to You.\\" I think fans of Beck, Nine Inch Nails, and other eclectic rock groups will greatly enjoy this album. I have listened to it approximately 40 times since my purchase, and continue to listen to it willingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!","review":"I first found Crosby's VAST through a free promotional CD that came with \\"The Search for Senna,\\" the first book in K.A. Applegate's \\"EverWorld\\" series, and Jon Crosby has been my favorite musician ever since. The sound of \\"Nude\\" seems to grow organically from Crosby's first two albums (both of which I highly recommend): it has the existential depth and moving use of samples of \\"Visual Audio Sensory Theater,\\" and the earthy vintage sensibilities of \\"Music For People.\\" This album is essencial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to sleep.","review":"The first album was superior: great balance between new world and loud rock - 5 stars. Second album got more pop-oriented and less dramatic, but was still listenable - 3.5 stars. Nude starts off good and then descends into an inescapable abyss of just plain boring. The energy and passion seems to have burned out. This downward spiral for these three releases leaves me shaking my head..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vast is capable of so much better","review":"They've proved it on both of their previous albums. \\"V.A.S.T.\\" was a riveting album with an astoundingly original sound that captivated the mind as well as the ears. \\"Music for People\\" was a big departure stylistically, but featured several brilliantly crafted songs. \\"Nude\\" fails to measure up. \\"Turqouise\\" and \\"Don't Take Your Love Away\\" were the only songs that stuck in my head for more than a few minutes after they were over. The music doesn't sound very dynamic at all, and the lyrics sound a bit more trite than they have in the past. Vast is certainly an artist that is worth hearing, but \\"Nude\\" is not the right album to use. Listen to \\"V.A.S.T.\\" and \\"Music for People\\", and hope that the next release is a return to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmm..","review":"I really like this album a lot, but i cannnnnnot believe that \\"Evil Little Girl\\" and \\"Bruise\\", from the Turquoise and Crimson album, were left out.

This is really the worst movie I've seen since I had to sit through a few hours of student films at my friends graduation (and even a lot of those were better). The budget on this film must have been counted in pizza slices given to the actors. I could only wonder how the people making this film could not see how bad it is and would actually decide to publish it.

I also noticed I have less back fatigue (my job is sitting) if I wear these. Not as shear as regular hose but not noticeable really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good war thriller !! GET GOERING!","review":"In the best style of a Jack Higgins, an Alistair MacLean or Ken Follett, French writer Alain Paris wrote a very exciting, intelligent and fast-paced war thriller.This time, instead of a \\"commando\\" trying to kill Winston Churchill (as in Higgins's book, \\"THE EAGLE HAS LANDED\\"), we have a commando, ordered by Hitler and Martin Bormann, destined to kill Hermann Goering. THe commando has a German leader and five British volunteers from the SS British Corps, a divison of British renegades who fought, teoretically, only against the Russians.Very clever plot and beliavable action, and also has a lot of historic accuracy about the facts of those times. (the action takes place in the last days of April, 1945).Maybe they translate it to the British language soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salty!","review":"I was upset when I received only 1 box instead of 6; Amazon issued a refund, but I wished I had been able to get the full set. I've been happy with GF Pantry mixes in the past, but this was disgusting. It tasted like a big bowl of salt. I made it with chicken, and my husband and I could barely stand even eating just the chicken (which didn't have too much of the sauce on it). We eat our fair share of salt, but this was ridiculous. I'm so glad Amazon messed up my order and I didn't get stuck with six of these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong color.","review":"Got this paddle because i love halex and i wanted a orange and black paddle. i got the paddle but it was blue and green. looks completely retarded. still a good paddle though. i wish amazon would have provided a color selector"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites in my collection.","review":"At the beginning of WWII Louise and her husband were on Masbate Is., phillipines. Spence (her husband) was an engineer who built and now ramrodded the IXL goldmine. They got word of the Jap attack on Pearl Harbor via radio. The few Americans and Filipinos started making preparations for the upcoming invasion. I believe they endured about 2 yrs. before they were evacuated by a sub to Australia. They island hopped a little bit before settling down to a life well inland. One of Louise's friends had a baby while they were on the run. Some of their missionary friends surrendered to the Japs, who then slaughtered them. They had many close encounters with the enemy, but always able to stay alittle ahead of them. Well written and makes excellent reading.

They worked well but since the webbing was one long piece it was difficult to adjust them to fit my small dog. By the time it fit my waist it was a bit short for reaching my dog and not have him so close he felt like he was going to be stepped on. I came across the Buddy System and I love it. The waist strap adjusts independently of the leash length. I also love that the leash portion can move along the waist strap so if your dog gets a bit behind you he doesn't tug on your waist as bad. I also love that you can add a leash and that there are lengths for big and small dogs. I also love the extra buckle that comes with each leash so that when you let your dog off leash you can clip the other end onto the belt and not have it dragging behind you. It's the perfect hands free leash system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is useless. They miss Sango and Shippou for one thing. and for another, NONE OF THIS INFORMATION IS NEW. I THOUGHT I was buying the novelazation of Inuyasha that was released in '04 in Japan which contained the first chapters redrawn by Takahashi and some other information, like what happened to Kagome's dad. Turns out this is just useless, everything in it you can find out from watching a episode or three of the series. And it's CONSTANTLY repeating itself. Yes. We know. Kikyou died. Now she's not. Why do they have to repeat it every other paragraph!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miroku Haters","review":"According to this book, Miroku is 'a bad monk'. One of the reasons given is the time he beat up Jaken, who tried to kill him with the Saimyosho insects. This book fails to recognize that most of the time Miroku is nicer than Inuyasha. He is always there to help Inuyasha, Kagome, Sango and Shippo in battle. His advice tends to be wise, he is extremely intelligent. In the episode with Juramoru and Kageromaru, he jumps in front of Sango to save her.Aside from this, the writers don't know how to spell Tetsusaiga. There is very little mention of Sango and Shippo, and it is overall a substandard read. I don't idealize Miroku, I know he's lecherous and a con man, but this book made him out to be downright evil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as others have said","review":"I found this book entertaining and definitely not as bad as the other reviewers said. It's not necessarily a book for the older fans; I believe this is something for the younger and newly addicted IY fans that aren't as well-informed about the series as others (especially the die-hard ones) as well as the ones that don't understand the dynamics.It's not necessarily a Miroku-hating book, they just seem to poke fun at him, almost as if they're making the book like the anime, interactive with the characters voices and opinions. They depict Miroku as a lecher, yes, but mostly in jest (My advice, don't take things so seriously when reading this), but the other reviewers also failed to mention that they also show Miroku as brave, friendly and all around strong.Take a chance on this book, if not for yourself as a collector of IY items then for your children or a younger fan you know. It gives enough information to let your imagination run around and think for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must get for all Inuyasha fans","review":"I thought I knew everything there was to know about InuYasha.

Calder's involvement deepens when the brother of his girl-friend, Molly, is arrested and charged with the murder, and his enquiries lead both hm and Molly into personal danger."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of a remarkable series","review":"This book introduces Keith Calder, canny Scottish gunsmith. The complicated and often irrational legal system, which fails to take the realities of Scottish country life into account, forces the local inhabitants to engage in outrageously complicated and frequently technically criminal accommodations. Incompetence and corruption in government and law enforcement compound the problem. Add the occasional murder, and Calder needs all his native shrewdness to find the solutions. This world, at first seemingly exotic, eventually becomes startlingly reminiscent of our own. Although somewhat dated, the books in this entertaining series retain their relevance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"When I used to read the Saddle Club books, this was one of my favs. I loved the way Stevie schemed Bob and Lisa's relationship and Veronica's failed scheme added to the hysterias!

However, I was mistaken: on this disc there are just EIGHT of them! (So few in fact that a photo is provided- so we can put faces to the familiar names...) This tiny group nonetheless makes a strong case for two of Josquin's Masses. Though their sound throughout is wonderfully conducive to relaxation and meditation, I have to say that the \\"Missa La Sol Fa Re Mi\\" emerges a notch above the other: it amply shows Josquin's skill at drawing the most magical sounds out of simple, basic four-part polyphony (impressive and breathtaking particularly when you consider that Josquin's near-contemporaries frequently used five-part choirs to produce a full-bodied texture and timbre in their choral works). A beautiful disc- well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and informative!","review":"This book is wonderful! Every section gives you a in-depth overview of the vegetable, herb or fruit; detailing different varieties and how they rank in terms of taste and/or hardiness, how to propagate, grow, maintain, harvest and store. Plus gives tips of typical pests/diseases and how to avoid them. Very helpful are the \\"companion planting\\" paragraphs, explaining which plants do best next to each other. And to top it all off, each section includes a \\"culinary\\" and \\"medicinal\\" section, informing you of the best ways to use your crops once harvested. The pictures are beautiful and the wording is easy to understand and to the point. This is a great book for any gardener's reference shelf.

It taught me a ton of tips and tricks that seed packets and other gardeners wouldn't tell me. Probably because what I needed were bare bone basics about specific plants that a gardener with experience wouldn't think about it [it'd be second nature]. The sections are clear and understandable, well organized, there are recipes for after you harvest, and even a plant killer like me has successfully grown a small vegetable garden. I recommend this to everyone who wants to learn more about plants; and even successful gardeners would benefit from this encyclopedia. I recommend this in combination with square foot gardening as it becomes fun and easy to grow your own food or flowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, good shape","review":"This book is useful and beautiful; I have barely begun to plunge into its lush images and instructional content. Many of the images are of the cutout on white images familiar from Eyewitness Books, and these are particularly informative as one is not distracted by backgrounds (although the full images are wonderful too).

My poor rating is because of this...the story itself was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many misspellings","review":"Good story but the typos drove me crazy! I spent a lot on this book to continue the story of the Calder family only to have so many misspellings that I lost count!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At Least I Know About Tara's Life Now With Ty","review":"I love Jessy and had read the books out of sequence as I found them to buy.This was not my favorite in the series but each person has their own choice in that respect.It was a good book to read and I enjoyed it, especially learning more about Jessy's life and her interactions with Ty on the ranch teaching him the \\"ropes\\" of working on a ranch with animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"For marketing-impaired persons like me...excellent!","review":"I admit it: I have a tin ear for marketing. I flunked Marketing in the MBA program. I hated it, I hated the professor, and he hated me.So this book was a major turn-around for me. I found it very useful, practical, detailed, un-hyped, and respectful of customers. Silverman helped me set up a word-of-mouth marketing plan for my business that was coherent, understandable, and worth the effort. This book also made me think again about unproductive marketing I was doing--such as advertising in the newspaper, which reached nobody whom I wanted to reach. For these reasons, besides that of helping re-tune my tin marketing ear, this book gets a BIG 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is geared towards big companies...pass it on","review":"This book provides a functional introduction to the concept of word-of-mouth and what is sometimes called viral marketing. However, it definitely won't be the last book you'll need on the subject. The examples presented in the book mainly focus on larger companies with significant budgets. They also tend to have either established brands or established products. The products neatly fit into clear categories. In other words, any type of marketing campaign with a significant budget and well-written copy would have worked.Most small businesses without a large marketing budget or pre-established brand or product won't find much of this book relevant. I find this ironic since word of mouth is generally regarded as a method accessible to smaller businesses. If you work for Coke or Dell this book is for you. If you just started a new online business or small restaurant this book is probably not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"?","review":"How do we know that any of these reviews have been written genuinely by true consumers, or whether they have been planted as part of a systematic \\"word-of-mouth\\" campaign for this book?;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough pracitcal steps, limited to a few industries, too much padding.","review":"I just finished reading the book this morning and here are my thoughts.The book covers some important concepts like the importance of working out the steps in a customers decision process and is interesting to begin with, but towards the end of the book I really had to push myself to keep reading. Some books I simply can't put down, but this one I had to push myself to finish.This book talks about the importance of things, but doesnt give enough practical steps to put them into practice in different industries.I felt like this book was written as a promotional item for the author as opposed to a practical down to earth manual and there seems to be too much 'padding' and not enough practical steps.Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I read the book, but I dont feel like I could apply most of it to my business and I feel like the same content could have been put across in a book half the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I'm annoyed that I actually spent money on this book. It took the author 217 pages to write 10 pages of content AND it was boring.Get \\"Anatomy of Buzz\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"17 Post It's","review":"Visitors can always tell how valuable a book is to me, by counting the number of colored flags sticking out from the pages.

Perfect addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I recently purchased this book and I was pleased when I received it.

Not enough of it!","review":"'Christmas Carols and Motets' by The Tallis Scholars' is a superior album of unfamiliar Christmas music. It is deeper and more artistic than the more modern 'Christmas Day in the Morning' by The Cambridge Singers'.The pieces are in Latin, English, or German, with many of the Latin pices done in polyphony with up to seven voices. It may be due to it's Christmas subject, but I found most of these pieces a lot more enjoyable than the average Medieval hit parade recordings done by, for example Anonymous 4.The only thing I missed on this recording is that for a CD of non-copywrited material, it was rather short. Give Me MORE!Otherwise, first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, works great","review":"This is more like a contact cement than a \\"primer\\". I used it with some of the double sided tape sealer to join my pond liner. You can find directions on the Internet, but basically I poured some of this on one of those abrasive scrubber pads, and scrubbed the area to be joined (both edges of the liner). This insures the primer adheres very well to the liner. Then I unrolled the double sided tape, leaving the paper on one side still. This was on top of a 2x4, so the liner was flat and even. Then I folded the other liner on top of the tape (which also had the primer on it), and pulled the paper off the tape. Then I pushed the liner smooth together with my hands, then used a heavy roller to push the liners together hard. I can't imagine it will ever leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing missing is Godzilla !","review":"Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations in a ridiculous story including a submarine,terrorists,the evil dead,and the lamest hero that you will ever come across.Otherwise,an outstanding read.Oh,and God helps out too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first one","review":"I didn't have a book to read-this is a bad thing-I bought this book because of the cover, I love submarines.

First you shake them for about 30 seconds then you take off the cap and press the tip of the makers against a flat surfaced and you can watch the paint moving down to the tip of the makers.

Toss into this a murder within the first pages and a controversial scheduled visit to Detroit by the Pope and you've got the groundwork for an exciting story. Kienzel doesn't disappoint either, as conflicting reactions of faithful and faithless Roman Catholics vector toward the anticipated arrival of the Holy Father.

I am very disappointed at this and will be returning my copy to the local bookstore where I bought it.I did some research on google and found that another book, Java for Dummies, also includes a CD that people have complained about for having a Trojan virus. I'd just like to draw attention to this as it's rediculous that books about programming have viruses within their supplemental CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"The book has a couple of strong points. First, it is truely designed with the beginner in mind. It's easy to read. Far from technical. QBASIC software is built into Windows, so it's accesible to anybody with a PC. And it gives the reader a look at other programming languages which he/she would hopefully want to move on to after completion of this book.Lots of weak points: The mistakes in the authors programming examples were abundant. He spent much of the book teaching QBASIC (a language few people will ever productively use except for recreational purposes). My opinion,beginners wanting to learn programming for recreation would be better off learning HTML (which is covered moderately in the book) which has some productive value. Finally, the author is trying too hard to be funny. Granted his bio states he wants to be a stand-up comedian, but it didn't work for me while reading an intro-technical computer book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but don't expect to be a real programmer","review":"Not too bad, however there are some glaring problems. For example, one of the hardest things for a beginner to understand is recursion. This topic should rate a whole chapter near the start.
