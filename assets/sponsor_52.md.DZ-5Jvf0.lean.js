The music was decent on here but I could not stand listening to Tray talk about himself over and over again.

First off I wish they would have included more live shots of them actually on stage. I also wish they would of showed more of the European tour scene (namely Copenhagen) considering there was only 3 stops. All in all its a good disc though and has a great look into the Great Went.

However Trey Anastasio is the most self centered person in all of rock. He was so cocky in this video it leaves little to the imagination why the band is on break currently. For those of you who like to compare Phish to the Grateful Dead...think again. Just watch this video and think about all the interviews you may have read or watched with Jerry Garcia. Jerry was far more talented and he never uttered the words \\"I\\" or \\"me\\" in an interview. He was the most modest man in rock. Trey on the other hand can't get enough of himself. His favorite words are \\"I\\" or \\"Me\\". I was litterally embarrased listening to him speak. I live in VT and if I ever have to chance to meet Trey I'd love to ask him where he get's off with that attitude. How great can he be if his music only appeals to stoned 15 year olds? Perhaps the rest of the band realized that already...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!!!","review":"This movie captures Phish at their prime in the late 1990's.

A great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look at one of music's best kept secrets","review":"This outsider's look in directed by Todd Phillips is a great introduction for people unfamiliar with the group up to the largest fans. The movie shows backstage, and onstage antics of the band from late 1997 until summer 1998 highlighting such events New Years, one of the Europe club tours, and one of the many summer festivals. In addition to showing the movie Bittersweet Motel, it includes some great uncut live performances of songs taped at the War Memorial in Rochestor, NY (12/11/97 specifically). These songs come through in great DTS or Dolby 5.1 sound, and the shots are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and Gentleman....The Trey Anastasio Show","review":"Wow,I do dig Phish to some degree.

Maybe I am too critical because I am spoiled and listen to alot of Zappa and Grateful Dead so I know how bright a musician can be. Trey is NOT it.

I read it myself however, before reading it to them and was greatly disappointed by the references to the hamburgers as recently deceased acquaintances of Minnie and Moo.

The hamburger episode just didn't seem age appropriate in a child's book where kids relate to characters. Beginning books don't often deal with death, let alone animal cannibalism.At issue, at one point, Minnie and Moo (the cow \\"stars\\" of the book.) are offered hamburgers which they later surmise to be their friends (now deceased) that we met at the beginning of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannibalism 101","review":"I read this to my daughter when she was about five years old and she was horrified by the fact that the cows go to a party and eat hamburgers.Moo says, \\"This is tasty!\\" Minnie gasps, and tells her that beef is made of cows like them, and they assume that Moo has eaten her friend \\"Madge Holstein\\". They even have a burial for the cooked meat and Moo apologizes to \\"Madge\\" posthumously.We received the book as a gift and I hadn't read it before. After I read the page about the cows eating their friend, I did some quick creative storytelling and ended storytime promptly to try to minimize the damage! I gave it to my vegan, PETA-loving sister, thinking she might appreciate it, but she thought it was too creepy to read to her children as well. It wound up in the trash.There are too many great children's books out there to waste precious storytime on this one.

I never find it very entertaining, because I don't find absurdity appealing. I love humor, but not the absurd. That said, I'm willing to accept absurdity that has its own internal logic, which this book doesn't. How does the story progress from Minnie wanting thumbs to Minnie wanting to go dancing? There is no connection at all: you don't need thumbs to dance. And then, why must the cows dress up in wigs, dresses, girdles, and lipstick in order to dance? Again, no connection between dancing and wearing dresses. And the cannibalism is a huge turnoff. The last two sentences make no sense at all, because two of the characters mentioned were never in the story to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegan nonsense","review":"My daughter brought this book home from school as part of her nightly reading list, and when she got to the part about the cows eating their friends, I stopped her and read the rest myself.

His thesis, which he explores with case after case, is that historians employ a double-standard with regard to covering history, basically serving a propagandistic role in our society, camouflaging the bad deeds of business and government, even as they claim to be objective and neutral outsiders.It's a similar argument that's made with the media, and no less important here. He argues persuasively (and thoroughly) for a radical approach to history, changing the role of historian to sideline cheerleader for the status quo to active participant in true social change.Because this book deals with a lot of history, it may be of limited interest to folks who aren't already into history, hence the four-star rating. But for anybody who does find history interesting, I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent exercise ball video (even for beginners)","review":"Most ab workout videos cause me a great deal of pain in my lower back due to an old injury. This video is amazing! Not only is the ball supportive but the video gives you variations for certain moves until you are stronger.

If you are out of shape or overweight, this a great video to add to walking for exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after a long day at work","review":"This is a great abs workout and very relaxing. The method involves lots of stretching and focusing on breathing. Lots of different exercises are introduced. Some are easy and some are more difficult. My mom says that there's no way she'll ever be able to do the move where you lie on your back with the ball between your feet and then put your feet and the ball over your head, but she can do all the other moves. Because there aren't many repetitions of each move, it doesn't seem like the workout is that hard, but I can definitely feel it later. This is not one of those ab workouts that will make you sweat or cry in pain, but it is still very effective though a little slow and long at times. An added bonus is all the stretching and relaxing over the ball which makes this a great workout for after work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzanne Deason rules!","review":"I first bought the balance ball kit with the sample video.

The 1st film was solid and featured quality actors and direction. This sequel has none of the same cast and was straight to video. It basically repeats the same plot theme of the 1st movie.

With a plot as transparent as cellophane and a solidly second-string cast (couldn't they afford ANYONE we have heard of), the movie wastes our time with some serious implausibilities spliced together with laughable dialogue and a downright silly ending.Did the producers really think that this film covered any new territory that the first missed?

Once again, a naively innocent young man seeks initiation into this supersecret clan of collegiate powerhouses who demand secrecy in all they do. When a young girl is accidentally murdered and the crime covered up, our hero steps up to expose the organization, but not without resistance from the group. There's not a whole lot of suspense generated, with the outcome fairly predictable. Robin Dunne doesn't have the charismatic presence to command the movie and the supporting players don't fare much better, although Lindy Booth does well in the role of the innocent Kelly. This direct to video did well enough, though, that it spawned a third entry, this one with a girl trying to infiltrate the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Idea, but Poor Plot","review":"I don't know how Universal hurt a movie that had such a great idea, but couldn't produce it correctly. It is hard to screw up this story. You have a story about a secret society, one of the most powerful in the world, and instead of developing that plot, it looked as though this was a skit on Saturday Night Live making fun of the story itself. The acting was particularly poor and it was hard to have a strong level of empathy with any of the characters. Not one stands out. All the characters appear shady, dark, depressing, and yet, it is quite clear that not all of the characters deserved this trait. We didn't really learn that much about the secret society (other than it likes to keep secrets) and the school the students were attending. Where is it? Yale, I presume; but there is little discussion on what the students are like who aren't in the secret society. I think this movie could have been done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do movies like this keep getting the green light?","review":"THE SKULLS was a pretty bad movie, but it became a moderate hit, so of course dollar signs lit up in the studio execs eyes when some bright spark suggested a sequel. Why not? Hey it worked with DEATH WISH. It's still working with FRIDAY THE 13th. But DEATH WISH and FRIDAY THE 13th have a slight advantage over THE SKULLS. Both those movies defied all expectations and did phenomenal business at the box office. DEATH WISH had Charles Bronson blowing away scum who kept murdering those dear to him, FRIDAY THE 13TH had a machete wielding nut in a hockey mask decapitating randy teens. THE SKULLS didn't have anything except the guy from DAWSON'S CREEK to get the girlies into the theater.

From the first few minutes I lost attention fast because of poor acting and a week script. They derived the whole movie around the first one. The main character seems a little unaware of how a skull is supposed to act and he wanders around trying to act JUST like Joshua Jackson. You will see very similar scenes and characters trying to repeat what has already been cast in the first one. I saw little difference overall between the two movies except for repeat performances and bad acting.

You get to play as a Grunt in the Vietnam War and later be recruited by the Special Operations. There are traps you must disable and more. The reason why I rated it 4 out of 5 stars is that right when the game was at its best it ended.There should be more missions or multiplayer to improve the game.Other than that ShellShock Nam '67 is a great game.<br /><br />"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Considering the heavy processing power needed for the PC version, the graphics are not very impressive. The gameplay is boring, the AI is horrible, the only good thing about the game is the sound. You certainly don't get the feeling that your fighting in a jungle, more like the back woods of N. Carolina or something. Save your money. If you're looking for a good shooter get Far Cry, it's awsome. If you absolutely must have this game, give it a few months and it'll be $9.99 before you know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shellshock Nam '67","review":"With so many obstacles in the game, wouldn't it make sense for your soldier to be able to jump over them? This is the only first person shooter I've played that doesn't allow the character to jump.

I'm returning mine today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappoinment","review":"I had great expectations for this game. Unfortunately it didn't live up to them. The artificial intelligence is ridiculous, and after you've gone through all levels that's pretty much it. It has limited replay value. On the other hand, if you like arcade style action with lots of gratuitous violence, this is your game. It does an especially good job of representing atrocities against prisoners of war and innocent civilians. If you feel like it, you can even slit peoples' throats. Be prepared for blood, gore, and miscellaneous body parts flying everywhere. All in all it's more than a little over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"By far the most disapointing games i have ever bought.

I can't even bother to make it through the first level I found it so stupid. Your character is limited to where they can go, you can't even walk up a slope to get behind the enemy. The first mounted machine gun I encountered, I could not turn the gun to shoot the enemy behind me. I stood right in front of the enemy (point blank range)and kept firing yet not one bullet was hitting him. You can't even kill your own troops; Vetnam and you can't kill your commandor!?

I recommend this book to anybody in high school--seriously what high school doesn't have drug issues? This book will change the way you look at prescription drugs.

The game has a number of side-quests that I could never finish. Only after getting this reference did I find that the quests were dependent on having certain party members in the group, and could never be initiated, let alone completed without them! It is very complete. Although I had played through the game, I found whole parts I had not seen or done because of this manual. It seems a little unorganized to me, hence the 4 stars, but it does have the information if you can find it.

I also saw a listing for Jerry's Famous Deli in the book, but the writer failed to mention that Andy Kaufman had worked there as a waiter at the height of his Taxi fame.

The small one fits only infants! The engineer who designed the 'earhook' must have very very tiny ears! I used super glue to stick it but it keeps breaking every other day. I am not able to find any one selling an extra large size or a spare one. So, I need to design something that works for me!Functionally, it's great and works fine and is very loud and clear.

Dunne the writer. The judge didn't let in evidence that the defendant was a serial abuser of women and as a result the defendant got off with a very light sentence of 2 1/2 years beyond time served. He was very pro defense during the trial until he learned of the very negative reaction of the public and then blamed the jury. The jury foreman said the judge's comments were a cheap shot and if they had known about the many other instances of abuse that had happened they would have put him away for life. If you read the account of the trial in Vanity Fair its easy to see how the judge was pro defense throughout the trial. So apparently he has gone from blaming the jury to blaming the system. With this knowledge its hard to like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking!","review":"I was browsing through this book when I realized why the name was so familiar.

I thought that the Lexan plastic was supposed to be be fairly indestructable, unless you abuse the mouthpiece (drop it, crush it, etc.). There's not a scratch or abrasion on it. I wouldn't have thought that normal playing would do this. I guess we'll see how good the warranty is, but the replacement cost is $10, which seems high for a manufacturer's defect. Don't know if I'll bother with it, or just go back to a traditional metal one.

It's a shame because I really like the overall fit (other than it digging into my arms), look and feel of this bra - but I can't wear it. I bought a second one in a size higher (even though I bought the original in my \\"normal\\" size) thinking they ran small; however, the underwire still dug into my arm (AND it didn't fit correctly) so I had to send it back.

In the book they could not kill IT because everyone else would die, in fact they don't even try. After saving Charles they leave and Camazotz stays forever doomed.

Nothing was like I imagined it.AND, the cover of this DVD doesn't even do justice to the movie. It looks plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wrinkle in Time","review":"My students read this book in class and were very eager to see the movie to compare it with the book. There are many differences between the book and the movie, but the students seemed to be content with the movie. I can't image how some of the images the author described would be created for the screen, anyway. The story was altered a bit. I would suggest reading the book before viewing the movie. The book is better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Again Disney Insults the Public","review":"While it has been ages since I read the wonderful book this film was based on (so I don't have as much awareness of the changes made to the story), there is one major issue I take with the DVD: it is released in fullscreen.While watching the behind the scenes material, it is clear that this was filmed widescreen. Heck, the deleted scenes in the extras are IN widescreen. But how does Disney release the movie itself? 1.33:1.That is an insult to the movie-buying public: to hack off over 1/3 of the visuals that were filmed prior to the public release. Directors and cinematographers have reasons for including, or not including, certain things in the film frame. To tamper with that by chopping the film up shows no respect whatsoever for the source material.If Disney doesn't respect the film or the viewer, I certainly will not be buying this DVD. Nor do I recommend others buy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME FOR KIDS AND GROWN-UPS","review":"I recently attended the (W)hole Point Institute in Raymond, NH, where I learned a lot about life and how to embrace it. A Wrinkle In Time was an excellent movie to watch with my son and help him also to appreciate and embrace life's challenges.

We view it after we read the novel. While the DVD definitely adds modern touches, it does remain true to the novel. The bonus interview with Madeleine L'Engle provides a profound look inside the writer's mind. She encourages young people through her comments to begin writing now and to write what pleases them. I would definitely recommend this DVD for school libraries and classrooms.D.

I actually fell asleep less than half way through (The sad thing is, I'm NOT KIDDING). The part that I saw was not like the book at all. If they gave this movie a different title, I would not think that it was an adaption of A Wrinkle In Time. I LOVED the book and did not think that it was boring. For this movie however, I felt like the script was written in a week and a half, casting was done in 2 hours, and filming was done in a week. Watch the Harry Potter movies instead.

All 3 key characters were poor substitutes to execute their character roles.What once was an ICON in CLASSIC Moive history - was reduced to a hugely unmemorable waste of film RE-making!No chemistry, No charisma, No Soul and delivered with No HEART - what a HUGE disappointment.This was film making at it's most BORING!In my opinion - the TOTAL CHEMISTRY between, Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason and Quinn Cummins WAS a combo TOO good to be replicated - and hey I don't say that about much.e.g. Sabrina - I luv AudreyH - BUT the Remake - SOOOOO much BETTER without a doubt in my mind!Stay faithful to the ORIGINAL on this one People!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Girl remake is an Awful Dud","review":"I liked Patricia Heaton's performance in Everybody Loves Raymond and Jeff Daniels in The Squid and the Whale but the two never seem to work well together in this movie. They are both gifted actors but there was no chemistry between them and the plot was predictable and weak. Usually, remakes don't live up to the original and this one was no exception. About the only scene where you truly felt for the characters involved was when Elliot Garfield (played by Daniels) was sitting in his dressing room crying after his dismal performance in the play Richard the Third and he was being consoled by Paula Mcfadden and her daughter Lucy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye, Girl","review":"Despite being a serious Jeff Daniels fan, I cannot for the life of me figure out why some idiot decided that this movie needed to be remade (sadly, it appears that the idiot in question was none other than Neil Simon, himself). The 1977 Richard Dreyfuss/Marsha Mason original far outshines this version in every respect. Maybe I've seen it too many times. Maybe I've got a 25-year long crush on Richard Dreyfuss. And maybe if I hadn't loved that movie so much and saw the remake first I'd feel differently -- but I really doubt it. Okay, it's watchable. Just. Thus a single star. But this will NOT be one for the ages. Do yourself a favour -- get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addio, Ragazza, Per Favore, ADDIO!!!","review":"This remake merely serves to highlight the talent of Mr. Richard Dreyfuss; he makes it look so effortless when essaying the role of Elliot Garfield. Jeff Daniels seems to be torn between mimicking Dreyfuss and giving up. I vote for Option 2, as he's lost at sea without a compass in this \\"performance.\\" Imagine a remake of The Godfather with Don Corleone portrayed by Ryan Seacrest and you're starting to get the flavor of this misbegotten misfire. Patricia Heaton was, I must admit (given her television work), surprisingly effective, equal to or better than Marsha Mason in the original. She earns this reviewer's single star awarded. Brava! In the end, all I want is the reason this \\"remake\\" was made in the first place, other than the expectation of it turning a profit, however meager."},{"rating":"1","title":"soda without any fizz","review":"Ironically I did not appreciate the original version when it came out; I was younger and did not pay enough attention. I got this newer version in a combo pack and thought I was getting the older version, but I wanted to be fair and give it a shake. Heaton and Daniels, while talented and funny people, just do not deliver the high-intensity punch of Mason and Dreyfuss, who play off each others' stress magnificently. Even the child actress is mixed in better in the older version. Even Alan Cumming was robbed of his luster, which makes me even more sad. The performances lack intensity, stress, neurosis and heat. What was the point in making a clumsy, oatmeal version of an intense movie with perfect performances and casting?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye to this bad Goodbye Girl","review":"Boy, is this remake a dud. Jeff Daniels is seriously miscast (he is too old for the part). But the worst thing is the rewriting of Simon's great script. By making it politically correct the rewriter has made many of the best jokes disappear or unrecognizable. Save your time and watch the Herbert Ross film again now that it is out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY ?????????","review":"Except for a very few changes the script for this re-make his identical to the 1978 one which leaves your wondering why make it at all.The actors do go through their lines at a much quicker pace than on the original, my guess is they did it to fit a 110 minute movie into 90 minutes. I am more of a fan of Heaton/Daniels than Mason/Dreyfuss but the fact is the latter ones were much, much better. Unlike Mason's character which evolved so much in the original, Heaton's character remains exactly the same throught this new version which makes it hard to root for her. Personally I identify her so much with ELR's Deborah that when she started kissing Daniels it felt like she was being unfaithful to Raymond.My suggestion would have been for them to film Heaton and Daniels while they seat on a couch and watch the original Goodbye Girl, it sure would have been more entertaining than what they came up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the original movie instead","review":"I saw this in TV, it ia a pale imitation of the original.

The saddle would wear out an elephant's posterior. It's easy enough to turn it over when going backwards but don't even think of going forwards across your kitchen unless you love hitting the floor.

It is extremely unstable while trying to turn left or right. You have to be able to grab the seat at the front between your legs and help the stool spin.

Sometimes, if you just shift your weight, the stool will tip when you are sitting on it in one place. Someone could get hurt on this. The concept has potential, but the execution is very poor.

The instructions were confusing, the methods very complicated, and the end result looked nothing like the pictures.I'm no origami expert, but I've always been able to get my projects to look very similar to the model in the book...this one was more of a practice session with frustration and disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ethnography of the Yali","review":"This book is a fascinating account of the culture of the Yali (as the \\"Jale\\" are called today) people before it was altered by Christianity.It is very readable and highly recommended to anyone interested in the culture of this group, who remain perhaps the most traditional of the West Papuan highlanders even today.I wish I had had this book before my visit to the Angguruk Yali in 1998!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather short, weak entries","review":"This book is not bad on amount of entries but lacks any sort of depth, most definitions and descriptions are short and barely informative. It seems that this author decided not to do any substantial research or make the effort required, has a cut and paste feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is not as good as his others","review":"In a Dark Time by Larry Watson does not measure up to two of his other novels which I've read: White Crosses and Montana, 1948. In this novel, the narrative is that of a school teacher's daily journal, one in which he details his observations concerning the recent murders of three girls from his school along with his encounters with some of his fellow teachers. The feel and flow of the story is poor. Even Watson's attempts at bringing the reader into the psychological stance of his narrator are weak. Compared to White Crosses, this first novel of his falls sadly short. Clearly Watson is a writer who has gotten better with each successive book.I found myself struggling to get to the end, asking myself if indeed the payoff would be worth the labor of the read, and when I reached the end finally, found myself as bored as I had been while in the thick of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book and really gets the user to understand Quantums","review":"Great book, I'm almost done but just thought I would write this review now. The book is great, I wanted to learn a little more about the idea of quantum computing and never had luck in finding a good book to get. Came across the preview for this book and they said it was an excellent book for people with little knowledge of quantum computers. Thats exactly what this book is for, people with little or knowledge before hand of what quantum computer is all about. The writer drills and drills in your head of what it is, he includes several diagrams as well to help you understand. If your looking for something that is super in depth and is really technicle in nature, the book isn't for you. At least I don't think it is. But a great book for people who just want to get the fundamentals of understanding quantum computing then you this book is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book on quantum computing","review":"This book is written for someone who perhaps hasn't ever even seen a computer. If you've been living under a rock then this book might appeal to you. The book goes on page after page with literary fluff and very little substance. The author eloquently describes the amazing abilities of modern computers in detail like the options of tranquil background wall papers and the marvel of the trash bin. I struggled to maintain focus in this book since it rambled so far from the core idea of quantum computing. Yet even 50% through this dreaded ramble and they have barely even mentioned quantum computing. I highly advise you find another book if you are at all interested in quantum computing. This book will likely bore you and turn you off from the entire idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction","review":"This book is by George Johnson on quantum computing. It is a very interesting introductory book and not too long on the math if you are not big on that.I wanted to read something on an introductory level first, so I chose it. I think it was a good choice. I plan to look into some more detailed works on the same subject in the future.To give you a glimpse of what goes on, the book talks about the limits of conventional computers in such areas as cryptography and shows how a quantum computer would make short work of such problems. There is a good, basic introduction to quantum principles and weirdness, so don't panic.I look forward to learning more about this exciting new field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is actually more than I expected.The movies are great and the quality of the product is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for Business and Not for Profit Leaders","review":"The Serving Leader, by Jennings and Stahl-Wert, is a great read for business and not for profit leaders. While it characterizes the stories of amazing serving leaders throughout the country, it also spells out the steps to becoming a servant leader. Professionals who are searching for a deeper meaning to life and work will find this book extremely rewarding.

However organization is whack. The book is designed to be used from cover to cover - no skipping chapters. The index is horrible. In most texts, topics are arranged by chapter in the CONTENTS section and all topics are arranged by alpha order in the INDEX. In this book, it's inconvenient to lookup \\"model editing\\" for example. One has to look in each chapter to find which takes a lot more time than scanning an alphabetical listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saddle Club: Adventures at Pine Hollow.","review":"If you love horses, this movie is for you.

It is a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"i'm sorry.. but this movie was REALLY BAD!! the actors were good i suppose, but the storyline was bad and they were acting really chilsish, how old are they supposed to be? they look 11 or 12.i didn't like it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"Personally, I really really don't like this movie. It's basically taking bits and pieces of various episodes of the TV show, putting them together and selling it as a movie. It strays far from the books and their acting isn't very good, neither is the riding. It's nice to see a horse movie, and I suppose the special features are TOO terrible, but overall it is not my cup of tea. I suppose younger kids who have never seen the TV series would like it, but I'm not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddle Club game","review":"We had trouble loading this game to the computer.

Every question answered.","review":"As a newcomer to the realm of JEEP ownership, I had always been intrigued by the product. I set out to find out as much as I could about JEEP, its history, qualities, faults, and its specs.This book, called a buyers guide(which it is), is also a very informative piece about the history of the JEEP automobile from its very beginnings through 1999.To mistake this book for just , an antique or collectors guide is very much off base. Although the book gives tips for the JEEP collector, it also satisfies the needs of those considering purchasing any model of JEEP automobile. I found it absolutely fascinating from start to finish, and I purchased a 1994 Grand Cherokee Limited based on the recommendations of this book. I've owned my JEEP for about four months and 4000 miles, and I'm perfectly happy with my purchase....and this book sealed the deal.

The fairly dumbed-down tone and the exercises imply this is for junior high school students - tertiary students are likely to want something more substantial. As a first introductory text it is useful - especially the bibliographic notes, though they are often idiosyncratic."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNORIGINAL PIECE OF POO","review":"Why does this band exist?

Many of the songs sound as though they could be part of the oft-recommended Franco two-disc album20th Anniversaire. Many of Franco's recording from this era are diminished by poor recordings but the material here shines with great sound and excellent arrangements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and surprising","review":"My 3-year old son and daughter enjoy this book thoroughly as the pictures are delightful and the plot is simple and engaging.

It was most disappointing and I will probably not order from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grooming manual","review":"The graphics in this book are blatantly sexual; the beast's nose cannot be perceived to be anything other than the representation of a penis. The moral of the story is that if you make friend's with the beast you will get lots of cookies and icecream; if you tell anyone the whole world will find out and the police will be called and there'll be such pandemonium.....and everyone will see it was the children's own doing. Tut tut.How in the world can such a work pass for suitable children's literature, when the possibility of it being used as a grooming manual are so blatantly apparent....I have never recommended a book-burning, but I can see where it can come in useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding collection of sacred Filipino music","review":"This is an outstanding collection of liturgical songs in Filipino.

Get Name Dropping today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book - Not too Complex","review":"Jane Heller's books are all enjoyable, entertaining tales about a woman in love with possibly the wrong man and a mystery thrown in as a twist. In other words, they're fun, quick, easy reads. Name Dropping was great for me as I love to read while riding the bike at the gym and this was the perfect book to take my mind off the challenge of the work out and instead, focus on a fun story.In the book, the average Nancy Stern begins receiving letters and phone calls to her more sophistacted neightbor, Nancy Stern. Imagine living in the same building as Julia Roberts, sharing her name, and vicariously living her life - it's kind of like that. To complicate the situation, the other Nancy Stern is murdered and our the first Nancy, begins to wonder if her life is in danger.Name dropping is fun, easy-going and entertaining - a great beach (or bike) read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Jane Heller never ceases to amaze us","review":"I cannot even find the correct wording to explain this book.

No the book was not small..I was so intruiged that I could not put it down. I eventually put it down to sleep but the next morning I was up and my nose was in the book.Cheers to you Jennifer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup Of Tea","review":"Jane Heller's \\"Name Dropping\\" really missed the mark. I found the storyline new and different at first glance but, was really saddened about a third of the way in. I was bored and not interested in anything about the story. I thought it all a bit over-dramatic and made-up. Just not my idea of a good read. I found it greatly lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to differ","review":"No, I'm sorry--I like a romantic, funny read as much as the next person, but Name Dropping had me wanting to throw the book across the room in frustration. Teacher Nancy was so totally inept in her celebrity-interviewer pose that no sane guy would have asked her out a second time. Lots of unanswered questions about celebrity Nancy, and some ridiculous scenes including one where teacher Nancy tracks dog-doo across an apartment (she didn't notice the smell coming up on the elevator?) on a mission of subterfuge. A plot line fueled by ridiculous misunderstandings and dishonesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had Hoped for Better","review":"This book was billed as being a good read for people who like Susan Isaacas. Not even close. I found this book to be both slow and obvious, not intriguing in the least. I finished it to find out \\"whodunnit\\" and was exteremely disappointed in how that was revealed. Jane Heller took a fundamentally good idea for a story and wrote it very poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major waste of time","review":"If only I'd listened to Sharon and Martina, I wouldn't have wasted my beach time on this one.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"The Road to Hell was a critical success, but Auberge may be even better. Red Shoes, Sing a Song of Love To Me, and The Mention of Your Name are among his best. Chris Rea continues to redefine himself. As is the case with most artists, he misses occasionally, but overall he is someone who the American listening public is missing out on because of a lack of U.S. promotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good taste of Rea","review":"I highly anticipated this Chris Rea album after the radio success and personal enjoyment of Dancing with Strangers and The Road to Hell. Auberge took on a different style than its immediate predecessors, more low-key and probably less musically diverse, but it is still an enjoyable album.The title track is the strongest song and obvious single, even though its guitar riff is overused by Rea (listen to the closing riff on Just Wanna be With You from 'Road as well as Johnny Needs a Fast Car from Espresso Logic). Gone Fishing is typical laid-back Rea, but hardly deserved to be included on his \\"Best of\\" album.Other memorable songs are towards the end of the disc: Every Second Counts and Looking for the Summer (also on his \\"Best of\\" album). Overall, this album is worth investing in if you like Chris Rea's brand of blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"This may even top The Road To Hell!","review":"Try it, you'll like it! I am an absolute Rea fan! But, let me tell you, there is much to like here! Ignore the Critic's pompous and wordy review, and you will be rewarded with some of the most wonderful lyrics and vocals anywhere. The two best are For You My Love and Mentions Your Name. But, really this is a great collection of very thoughtful and enjoyable songs. I highly recommend this CD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most unromantic Tristan you hope never to see!","review":"I bot this disc because I liked the tenor at the Met Live in HD at the cinema. While the conducting and singing are pretty good, the production has zero sex appeal and completely counters Wagner's music. In short I hated it. The Isolde is also a little lightweight vocally, although she wisely seldom pushes her voice beyond what it can do. Same goes for Robert Dean Smith, the Tristan. I'm told he was underpowered at the Met, which of course did not reveal itself in the telecast where tHe voice had to be miked.The BD is fine technically, both for video and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome collectible","review":"Great stories and awesome edition.

Riter's plea is to return to a full view of the role of The holy Spirit in the life of God's church today,as two thousand years ago. He deals extensively with the 12 lies that various denominations teach errently about The Holy Spirit, and then teaches from Scripture, the truth.Riter uses a unique to him-method of introducing each chapter and evaluating the lie briefly and providing a synopsis of the truth. He has some good questions to ponder in the back of the book that can either be used for personal or preferably group study.As one who reads a book per week, and who has spent extensive time and resources researching The work and ministry of The Holy Spirit, this is a highly recommended book to read and to apply its truth to life.Ian T.

I believe most of us liked him because of his wonderful voice and his talent to sing and play jazzy tunes.

And not that a cross between jazz and pop couldn't be good music, but this one just really isn't. It seems that he is trying to transition between musical genres, and is falling flat on his face in the process. I have listened to it again and again trying to make myself like it, but it just isn't happening.

Jaime Cullum is not, and never has been a jazz musician. He was labelled as one simply to sell pop records, but that is an insult to pop music.

Obviously it was written for those who know little or nothing abt the case, but want to read a true crime book on the throne or on the subway. There was no new data and the descriptions of the crimes were like reading fiction, especially since the author obviously did not check the details, even though they are on the internet. At one point he says that after the first crimes, Rader went home to his wife and kids, when at that time he had no kids. There are countless others, but out of respect for those involved, I will not specify. Was not worth the wait or the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"BTK","review":"I lived in the area these murders took place and still have a home in Wichita.

How someone could do all the things he did, and nobody suspect ANYTHING, boggles the mind. This wasn't mentioned in the book, but at his sentencing, Nola Foulston made reference to other crimes he had committed whose prosecution wasn't being pursued because he was going to be locked up forever anyway. And yes, one of them was embezzling from his church.Much of the book is devoted to the Robert Beattie story (read my review of his book as well), which was instrumental in his getting caught. I wonder if it was Dennis Rader himself who vandalized the Beattie house on that spring day? I give the author kudos as well for not using the names of the Rader relatives. They have suffered the ultimate betrayal and deserve their privacy.One wonders how many other BTKs are out there and just haven't been caught yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow and ultimately boring","review":"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book.

There is no one to cheer for here.Last words: Too much work for too little reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Umberto Eco ...","review":"As mentioned by other reviewers, the style of this novel is very similar to Name of the Rose - which I loved. If you do not like plot shifts, twists and turns, and having to concentrate to keep things straight while reading, then this book is not for you! On the other hand, I could hardly put the book down while I sat in front of a fire with a snow storm raging outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book was so horrid that I can't recommend it to anyone, nor even in good conscience give it away. Not gothic, mysterious, or even interesting. It would have put me to sleep if I hadn't been so frustrated by it's lameness. I feel especially bad for the people who paid for the hard copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Nyquil","review":"I agree completely with the reviewer below. Antiseptic, lifeless, soggy. The mystery isn't as clever as the professional reviews would have you believe. The characters are far more dull than they would have you believe. Even more overrated than INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST, if that's possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a dreadful book","review":"A dreadful book by almost any measure. The characters are not terribly interesting, the plot meanders through a failed marriage, a school days friendship gone bad, an ancient murder, and contemporary murder and the ins and outs of academic life and intrigue. The problem is, however, throughout this tangled scenario, it was impossible to care much for any of the characters and the only reason I finished the thing was because I'm stubborn. And even at that, the book in not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and over-rated","review":"I'm surprised this book is compared by the publisher to sublime THE NAME OF THE ROSE and THE MONK. It's really quite thin gruel, packaged as something substantial.Despite the references to fog and dark corners and such, the Gothic atmosphere was barely present, and while the multi-layered plot is quite ingenious, the clues are so incredibly obvious in a few places (if you've read more than a handful of mysteries), I felt embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quincunx is as great as this book is bad","review":"I think that Palliser wrote one of the finest genre books of the latter 20th century in Quincunx. Every single page was a plot twist of sorts and will leave you breathless if you have yet to pick it up. But just as Palliser wrote such a complex book in Quincunx, 'The Unburried' is manifestly its very opposite. I really cant well describe this book because what the plot was about I really dont know. 'Unburried is so very slow and tedious the only way I could use this as a recommendation is as an insomnia remedy.I really don' t think that the two reviewers chosen to be 'Spotlight Reviewers' actually read the book. I perused these reviews and was shocked at how different their opinions were to mine. They must have read the dust jacket and pieced together a review off of that. They are wrong in that this book is very very dull. Read 'Quincunx' and enjoy it, but leave this one be."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"In all fairness, maybe I should not review this book, because I did not finish it. I only got half way through. From reading the cover of the book, I expected The Unburied to be suspensful and have me on the edge of my seat. I kept hoping it would get better, but every page became harder and harder to get through. The monolouges and naratives rambled on forever and did not go anywhere. I felt cheated of a good story and out of the money I paid for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Short Story Masquerading as a Novel","review":"If you're looking for a new take on the Victorian Christmas ghost story (as this novel claims to be), well, this may not be the book for you. Palliser takes his time setting up this tale, in which the ghosts are more figurative than anything else. The first 200 pages or so are filled with plot lines that seem to go nowhere and tales that have you moving from the 9th to the 17th to the 19th centuries. Quite confusing, and, frankly, rather dull. Had this been a short story, it would be quite good, but as a nearly 400 page novel it is simply tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sheer joy. Puts the \\"M\\" in mystery!","review":"The Unburied by Charles Palliser though a little tricky, was EXCELLENT and a real pleasure to read! The story, set in England; circa late 1800s, was extremely well written and researched. With forays into early English history, Church of England politics and hints of pre-Freudian analysis, this novel is packed with twists and turns at every page. Alan Collins' excellent and articulate review (here at Amazon) is quite accurate and to the point. If you like multi-layered period mysteries, read the excellent 5star book, \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" by Iain Pears. Also a very engaging and thought provoking work that should not be missed. I can't wait to read the Quincunx. Thank you Mr. Palliser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are a devoted fan, probably not worth the time.","review":"I actually loved the first section of the book, when there was the promise of something significant going on. Unfortunately, nothing is... not really. There are a ton of books in this genre that top this effort, though I will say that Palliser's word-craft is far above the norm of \\"pulp fiction\\". That aside, the plot has alot of promise, which makes its eventual and questionable resolution all the more painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Dissappointed","review":"As a major fan of the Quincunx I anxiously awaited this release. Unfortunately it had none of the appeal of the earlier book. The plot was convoluted, and frequently difficult to follow. This is particularly the case due to all the characters involved and the circular nature of the plot. While it is well written, and had times had great ambiance, it's hard to recommend this dissappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"wordy and tiresome","review":"i really wanted to enjoy this book...it was foggy outside, and i was curled up in bed. i typically enjoy gothic, chilling tales and was eagerly anticipating this read. i have to say, much to my chagrin, that this novel was a sore disappointment. while the storyline is complex and developed, it is tiresome and difficult to understand. many obscure references are often interjected which leaves the reader confused and off-track. there is simply TOO much going on in the plot, and there is not enough actually occurring to off-set all the wordy dialogue. in other words, it ends up reading like one longwinded tale in which very little happens. it verbose to a fault and does not employ any stategies of keeping a person entertained. it felt like work. sorry, palliser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disjointed for my taste...","review":"The plot of The Unburied intrigued me so much that I started reading this book as soon as I bought it. At first, I thought the writing was quite imaginative. Charles Palliser has a rather vivid and compelling imagination. But as I continued to read I noticed that this novel lacked plot and characterization. There are so many dead ends and unimportant pieces of information that I felt lost. I don't always have problems with miscellaneous information, but it appears that the clues and so-called twists were thrown in for no reason other that to lengthen the book. At the end, I ended up closing the book with the intention of never opening it again. The writing is too disjointed to be enjoyed. Disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric charmer","review":"This is an awesome book! Just finished reading this novel and have nothing but praise for it. It is a first rate mystery but literarily superior to most of that genre.

Trust me, if you've been in the business longer than a year, you've heard all of this before. In this case, the revolutionary idea is \\"having a small number of very affluent clients.\\" Wow! What a novel idea!!! The title of the book should be 'How to Make A Bunch of Money Off Poor Schmucks Trying to Make a Bunch of Money.'

It takes a long time to get to your mystery, like three chapters away. When you get to the third chapter there are now two mysteries and you couldn't define who was one character and who was the other one. I would rate this book a one star because it was a really confusing book. There were details in the book that didn't fit with the mystery. The book was boring because there weren't any details that stood out to me. It was a book that was really boring and not entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I read this book when I was in high school where I often felt alone and thrown away like Hatter Fox.

They enjoy it quite a bit--much to their collective suprise.I'm fascinated by the fact that other reviews have described this as a love story. One of the issues that always comes up in class is Summer's motivation for helping Hatter. Is he doing it for her or for himself? If he is doing it for himself, is he motivated by naivet��, altruism, or selfishness--does he want to \\"prove\\" how he alone can save Hatter and thereby confirm his prejudice that he is superior to Levering and Winton?I would recommend this book not as a love story, but as one that causes us to question our own motives for helping, and perhaps for loving, other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for any teen age girl","review":"I read this book many years ago while in junior high school and it mad a good impact on my life.

It has a terse 300 page reference that is occasionally useful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors! Poorly organized, poorly conceived!","review":"Open your eyes! Look past the hype, the advertising and the non-stop promotion schemes. Lemay has managed to turn a mediocre style and extremely thin technical knowlege into a career writing poor quality books that are consistently full of errors. I found more errors in this single book than I've ever found in any other book. When errors are in the code as well as the author's discussion, mere mortals like you and I have little chance of actually learning Java. As far as learning Java in 21 days, it simply cannot be done if you use this book. Beyond errors and other problems, the book fails to cover many key issues. The entire toolkit for graphical interfaces is glossed over and examined so briefly that you can't possibly learn how to create applets that really do something. Definitely look elsewhere for your Java needs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time of day!

However, by the time you are half way through, many of the programs, whether in the book, or on the CD-ROM, simply don't perform the way they are intended. Snippets of code, and example programs are no good if they don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The road to ruin is paved with 21 days of technical jargon..","review":"The author(s) start off simply enough. The first 14 days are pretty much the standard fare of all the other Java books I've tried. \\"Here's an applet, here's an application, here's the difference, arrays, variables, pointers, etc.\\". But once you hit day 14, look out. The easygoing methodology is gone and you get a freight train of programming jargon right in the face. By day 18, I was digging around for a C++ dictionary to see if maybe that would help. Day 19...I just stopped trying.Frequent errors exist in the coding syntax of thesamples, leading beginners down a road of complete frustration.If you're looking for something more useful, go online and find the \\"Brewing Java\\" homepage. Or, pick up \\"Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours\\".By the way, there's no way you'll complete some sections of \\"...Java in 21 days\\" in a day.

The authors should become certified before attempting to teach what they know to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair...but not Great","review":"I would like to meet Laura Lemay (the main author) to ask her three questions:1) Why are there so MANY typos and errors?2) Why did you name the book 'Learn Java 1.1 in 21 Days' when much of the book covers Java 1.02?3) Why are there so MANY typos and errors? (or did I already say that? hint hint)The reality is, the book is not bad, but it really suffers from bad editing, a preoccupation with Applets over Applications, and wastes FAR too much time covering the JDK 1.02 (considering the title says it is covering JDK 1.1). The first week or so was well written (again, not counting the typos and sloppy editing), but some chapters were far too long to reasonably cover in one day.My recommendation is that you look at the Core Java Series books (vols I & II) and at Just Java and Beyond (all three are VERY well written and are much more robust than 'Learn Java 1.1 in 21 Days')."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are the target audiences?","review":"Who are the target audiences?

Certainly the author has taken great efforts listing all minute points that beginers may overlook. This approach works well for the first week. But in the second week pace should have been more. You start developing the feeling that this book is too verbose. Also when it comes to explaining the real concept, the book just winds up the discission in 2/3 lines. Let me give one example - page 274 explains handleEvent() handler. There is mention of returning of true/false. The explanation for this return value should have been more concrete. Instead the author leaves the reader very confused about the role this return value plays. My advice will be NOT to go for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pages, very few examples","review":"This book is poorly organized and paced quite rapidly. I recommend a good background in C++ before attempting to wade through these exercises.The authors do not make use of many hands on examples, relying instead upon their verbose explanations to get their ideas across. The book spends the entire first week explaining the basics of Java (and some pretty heavy OOP theory) without letting you get your hands dirty on the code. While this might be fine for experienced programmers who have a grasp of OOP, beginners to Java could benefit from more interaction with the ideas presented. The examples that are given are not explained in much detail and many of the statements(in the examples) are not defined until later in the book. This makes it very difficult to grasp the overall concepts presented.

(And perhaps it was simply that I read the book without coding any of it. What I'm saying is: It's so well written, this PowerBuilder developer learned Java without sitting in front of a tube).The final chapter, \\"Under the Hood\\", lived up to its title and tied it all together well. I picked up and layed down several other Java books due to frustration over bad grammar, redundancy, editing mistakes or ludicrous example code. This doesn't suffer from those problems.

Carol Anshaw is a tough nut to crack. She writes effortlessly, but her words, characters, and dialogue pack a punch.

Everything is too easy in this book. The characters leap to conclusions with no real logical means of doing so. Things seem to simply be presented to them. The characters don't really have to work very hard to find the answers to their questions. Everything just falls in their laps. I was monumentally disappointed in this book. Piers Anthony has written some wonderful books in the past but this is not one of them. Perhaps he has spent too much time in Xanth where things are expected to come easy and he has forgotten how to write a grown up novel. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthony's most Erotic book!

Wow this toxic piece of drivelfuzed into my brain, searing the unwholesome grotesque images straight into my memory most robustly! I think I understand the sick magnetism sexual compulsives must feel when such material is hardwired into them. Just a jolt of this was enough to make me tear the thing up and throw it in the garbage. Is society tolerating this as some kind of Art?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Book.

I've read it five times!","review":"This superbly written novel deals with the truths of life, death, sex and love. I loved the depth of the characters and how they all fit into the puzzle, as well as the symbolism portrayed throughout. My life is strangely portrayed in this book, as I can relate to the main character. But, as many of these reviews note, this book is not for young audiences, as I myself felt certain scenes where unneccesarily sexual. So, if you love great writing and don't mind the sexual side, this is a great book by Piers Anthony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody definitely should confer with Freud","review":"Admittedly, Piers Anthony was one of my favorite authors until sometime in high school when I realized that he's just another dirty old man. Every book he's ever written has had some form of elicit sex or sex at the very least, and if it isn't elicit then it's presented as a purely animalistic function. This book is no different. In this book the widow gets to cure the impotent caretaker. And naturally the predator draws in his prey by, you guessed it, pheremones, and apparently if you get too close you can't stop orgasming (is that a real word?) Can you get any more adolescent? This guy is in his fifties or sixties and still enjoys writing about young girls and their menstrual cycles.But I digress. If you're looking for something completely unrealistic and sexy, go ahead and grab this book and a moist towel and enjoy yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"firefly","review":"If i could give this book a lower rating, I would. Never have i ever seen such blatant abuse of the exclamation point in all my years of reading. The dialogue is sophomoric and even the sex scenes are unfulfilling. (Did anyone ever finish the actual act without \\"spending their seed\\" before they could even make penetration?)He tries to justify Nymphs sexual tendencies by stating, \\"We have problems enough with world hunger and injustice, without making more by punishing people for deviant but perhaps harmless behavior\\" Sure he's speaking of homosexual, bisexual relationships (which i do not consider to be deviant in any since of the word) but to classify child sexual abuse in the same context is an abhorrence.All in all, i did not enjoy this book and since i believe in finishing what i start, upon completion of this travesty, i promptly tossed it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Execrable dialogue","review":"I probably hadn't read a Piers Anthony book for over 40 years before a co-worker loaned me this one, but have always thought of him as a big-name sci-fi writer. That's why I was so stunned by the amazingly stilted dialogue. Real people don't talk that way. I don't know which surprises me more, that the writing is so bad, or that a fair number of readers describe it as well-written. Compared to what?! The numerous stories come across as intrusive, the author continually interrupting the flow of the narrative so we can see what a story teller Oenone/Jade/Nympth, etc. is, but it finally just becomes boring. Nor was I conned by his author's note at the end, in which we are to understand that what looks like a paedophile friendly worldview is just his attempt to bring to light the problems of child and wife abuse. Yeah, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile","review":"This is the work of a man who has clearly given up on life.

As i finished i found that they were not indentations, they were burned/ melted carpet.

Good luck everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 7-year-old squeak is gone.","review":"What an ingenious tool! The hardest part of the job was to locate the floor joist. Once we found it, things went very quickly. Our white pile carpet shows no signs of disturbance, and the very annoying squeak is completely gone. We discovered that, if you do miss the joist, the screw can very easily be removed and relocated. We wish we had found this unique tool 7 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me.","review":"I watched this product work on \\"This Old House\\" and saw numerous 5-star ratings here on Amazon.com, but despite sinking approximately 20 screws into a 4' x 4' area of a squeaky bedroom floor per the directions, the squeaks were still there. I used a stud finder, their stud locating screw, and a tape measure, to ensure I was driving into floor joists, but the squeaks endured. I was disappointed, I truly expected this system to work. Returned it and lost $5.76 on return shipping fees. I'll pull up the carpet some weekend and use regular screws, with a head that can draw the sub-flooring down tightly against the joists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all","review":"I have laminate floors that look like hardwood. Found the joist and followed the instructions (1/8 drill bit first, SNM screws later). The adapter refused to cut the screw. It took me about 20 mins to be able to take it off the floor. At that point it was clear to me that the procedure was not as simple as advertised on the demonstration video. I tried using one more screw and the same thing happened. Either the screws are not scored well enough or the cheap piece of plastic adapter was the issue. Either way, the squeaking is still there. Apparently this kit is a roulette. Try your luck if you have the patience and want to waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far no good, we'll see","review":"I just started using this and have not gotten it to work. The problem is the screw not going deep enough, so when it snaps off it leaves about 1/8 to 1/4 inch above the carpet, which of course needs to be viced out. Maybe I'm doing it wrong since most other people seem to have no problem, but no matter where I screw in it doesn't happen. The joist finder isn't good, better to find the joists from the crawlspace and measure distances between them (usually 16''). Perhaps eventually it will work and I'll revise my review but for now this was a waste. Any suggestions are welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works but not on all squeaks","review":"Removed squeaks in one area completely (carpeted area). Not difficult to find floor joists, just takes a little time and patience. Did not remove all squeaks in two other areas but reduced them significantly. Well worth the effort. No damage to cut pile carpeting. Cannot see where screws were installed.I purchased 250 extra screws and went through most of them. Included tools worked fine, plastic centering tool/screw break works fine. Square bit driver works fine, I had a spare square drive bit incase it stripped out, but did not.I used a portable drill with adjustable clutch. Had to change from one tool to another during installation but worked fine by finding joist and installing a string from one end to the other. Screws every 4\\" along the string.Will take care of rest of minor squeaks when we replace the carpeting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Money!","review":"So I have a daughter that has a bedroom directly above our living room. Over the past year, a slight squeak developed and got progressively worse and drove me downright batty! I was thinking I was going to have to pull the carpet up to fix the issue....needless to say I was not excited about doing that. A friend of mine mentioned this product saying that he had used it before and that it worked miracles.At first I thought it was too much money for a set of screws that break off, but after thinking about having to restretch carpet, I decided to pull the trigger and order it. After watching the Youtube video of the owner of the company demonstrating how to use the product I gave it a whirl. One screw and the entire problem was solved!

First off, they obviously farmed out the writing of the instructions to a third-world country. Either that or their in-house writer is functionally illiterate.

The instructions also specifically stated that for hardwood floors I dId not need to screw into a joist. So I did just what it said. Six screws later and not one area squeaked any less than what I started with. Think about this. A product made specifically to stop squeaks, stopped nothing.In my decades of purchasing tools, etc., I have never bought one as useless as this.

I tried this product out, and it worked well for me. Squeek No More is pretty easy to use if you have hardwood flooring since you don't have to worry about finding the joits(studs). It consisted of walking around to find the exact spot that creates the loudest squeak, step on the sides to put weight on it, drill the scored screw into the spot and break it off with the supplied gripping tool, finally fill in the small hole with a wood stick (I used Varathan Fill Stick). It fixed my squeaks, and the small hole it made after repairing is barely noticeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me...","review":"I didn't have as many problems fining the joists as other reviewers. There is a good This Old House video online that shows how to use a string to help mark lines once screws are properly placed at the ends of the joists.However after placing approximately 120 screws (over a two-hour period) in an area that is 4' x 8', the squeaks haven't stopped or even been any quieter.

Also, it's meant to be used for floors with carpets, and I was cutting away an old carpet and so the device wasn't much help. If you need to snap the tops of the screws off, that can be done with some pliers.The best and least expensive way to do this is to use an electric drill with a 1/8th drill bit to drill the holes. Once that's done, use an electric screwdriver to put the screws into the holes; then snap off the heads with pliers or, better, just leave them in.

The kit seemed to work perfectly, but our floors are from an apartment building that was first built in the early seventies, so the squeaks are nigh impossible to get rid of without many more of the screws than what the kit included. I would recommend it for small problems in newer homes where the floors aren't so dilapidated. In our case, nothing short of ripping up the carpet would be able to solve the problem.

If you read the first line of every fourth paragraph, something occasionally happens.

Too bad -- Niven wrote great stuff once. See Protector!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubt if Niven and Pournelle wrote much of this.","review":"This continuance of the excellent story of The Legacy of Heorot is a huge disappointment, full of editing errors and downright sloppy writing. I was amazed that I considered not finishing a book with Niven's name on the cover, but after the zillionth dredging up of sexual mores among the colonists and useless paragraphs devoted to coffee (which contained glaring factual errors), I was almost fed up. I don't believe Niven nor Pournelle had much to do with this project and that their names appear solely to command $4 per word from the publisher. Their respective writing styles are absent except for some obvious cut and paste operations, and the book is a dismal failure. Barnes is written all over this book and it shows"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum!","review":"Books by the Pournelle/Niven team are generally among my favorites in the SciFi genre. Unfortunatly this is one of their few real \\"duds\\".Written as a sequel to Legacy of Heorot , the colonists planned investigation of the mainland from the island based colony started out as a great basis for a story. The \\"old Grendel\\" (obviously mutated) interaction with the exploring colonists borders on the absurd.

Of course \\"Legacy\\" is easily a \\"10\\", possibly my favorite book of all time. I have to admit that I truly looked forward to this book and that eager anticipation contributed to my disappointment after my first reading. It just wasn't as good and didn't fulfill my expectations. A couple of months later, I re-read both books. \\"Children\\" was much better this time. The mainland environment is vividly described. The plot and storyline are fairly straight forward although the ending is muddied somewhat when trying to figure out what happened between Aaron and the grendel . I'll go back to Avalon again.

I was extremely disappointed with the ending and it was even more disappointing not to find another sequel. If this is truly the end, don't bother. If there is ever a final book to finish a trilogy, this book may be worth reading to get to the end of the story, but as it is, it leaves you hanging with a lousy ending with more new questions than answers.It was so disappointing that it almost makes me sorry that I started the series. I really hope that the authors will come up with a fantastic book that really closes everything up, but since it may never come, I recommend anyone considering this book (plus Legacy) to wait to buy it until (if) a final sequel comes out - otherwise you will be as disappointed as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster","review":"This book is a major disappointment. The predecessor, \\"Legacy of Heorot\\", was a reasonably well-written, entertaining book. Not without flaws, but captivating in its own way. This one, however, is a boring knock-off that reads like it was written quickly (numerous consistency errors) to make some cash. No real plot, just endless noodling about the sexual mores and relationship angst of a group of uninteresting, one-dimensional characters. No structure, no tension, no drama, little creativity, just self-indulgence from authors who seem to be taking their audience for granted. Don't waste your time with this one. I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf's Children lacks the punch of Legacy of Heorot","review":"The sequel to Legacy of Heorot(LOH), takes you back to Avalon 25 years after the Grendel Wars. The community is split between the orginal settlers and the \\"Star Born\\". This rift is evident during the novel, and only gets larger. The colonists finally take a step to settle the mainland, in which they meet a deadly new \\"Avalon Surprise\\". Unfortunately, this book lacks the raw intensity and power of LOH. The book plays more on social structures and issues. On the positive side, the book does create an intersting new threat found on Avalon, and makes you wonder if there will be a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf's Children","review":"A very large disappointment both as a sequel to \\"Legacy\\" and being written by Niven and Pournelle. The description of inheritance of aquired traits among the colonists surprised me as you can generally count on Niven and Pournelle to keep the science at least not obviously wrong. The book describes raising children from frozen ova in a manner would have resulted in a collection of sociopaths making the book totally unbelivable. Weird for the sake of weird is no substitute for a plot. In \\"Destiny Road\\" Niven wrote about contact being lost with the Avalon colony. I took that as an apology for what he knew to be an appallingly bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S UP WIT' DAT?!!!","review":"This book was a real let down. After being completely impressed and blown away by \\"The Legacy of Heorot\\" I had expected great things from this sequel. Pffft...not even close. There are so many more directions that this story could have gone.

I will have to admit right away that the ingenios ecology of _legacy of Heorot_ is missing from this book, and true, the sex can get embarassingly gratuitous, but...jeez louise, this book is so freaking action-packed I will forgive it anything. People who are used to books that telegraph characters' eventual fates by page six will find their best predictions stymied by this one. I swear, they must have rolled dice to decide which characters would live and which die. Ignore all the carpers who can't take a little mindless fun: this book is every bit as good as _Legacy_, leaps and bounds better than Niven and Pournelle's last effort (_The Gripping Hand_), and, like all Niven/Pournelle collaborations, at least eight times as good as anything either author has ever written solo (better than the Niven/Barnes books, too, lest Barnes be forgotten)."},{"rating":"1","title":"1989 Mustang electric fan #67015","review":"With this fan hooked up my motor was on the edge of over heating and it was 70 degrees out.

I doubt it does much for thin hair, however. My mother-in-law has thin hair from Rxs she takes and this shampoo does nothing to alter that. It also probably should not be used by anyone with oily hair as volume can only be increased if oil is retained. The smell is very nice. Personally, if I am going to pay these big bucks for shampoos though, I prefer either the Aubrey Organics or the Avalon Organic shampoos, also reviewed by me here at Amazon.

In the beginning the police purstuits are rather basic, but gradually increase in intensity, involving road blocks, spike strips, even SUVs the smash into your car and blocking your way. There is a greater variety of races now including tollbooth and speedtrap.

However, in this novel, Berger uses the character of Ritchie to explore the nature of Evil more than he does with any other character. Ritchie's motivations are random and surreal and chaotic in contrast to the overly orderly and logical John Felton. It is as if Berger purposely makes Ritchie as illogical as possible while simultaneously showing John (and the reader)to be completely unprepared to deal with or understand him. Preparation requires logic, and logic is useless in dealing with chaos.

Suleiman lives with his business-traveling father and a mother with some serious emotional issues. As his neighbor and possibly his father get caught up in the revolution movement, Suleiman learns what it is like to live in a repressive society.I enjoyed this novel, and how the author explored the family dynamics of a Muslim family in Libya at this moment in time.

And when you are ready to shut it down and move it out of the way the whole thing zips up and is easy to carry elsewhere.If you are looking for a case that is machine washable and protects you from the crotch searing heat of today's laptops then take a chance on thie Belkin Sleeve Top."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Belkin Sleeve Top Case","review":"My laptop lives in this case.

I 3 bought this treadmill 3 years ago. And now its controller boad is broken. Guess what, the electronics part only has 3 year warrantee. And it will cost you more than $350. And worse yet, smoothfiness customer service has bad attitude. After 2 months of repair, it is still not repaired. The parts they sent me are all broken after 2-3 hours of running. The customer service department has no clue how to fix it. Now, after 2 months, the treadmill is still not fixed.So if you think you have the patience to deal with the bad quality product then go ahead and buy it.

The idea was to seal the cracks and hide the damage at the same time without having to sand, epoxy, fiberglass and gel-coat.It worked perfectly.The color is surprisingly white and matched the existing gel-coat well.The Fast Cure 5200 did indeed cure quickly. The boat was ready to roll (a pun since the boat is a kayak) within a short time and the leaks were stopped.Since the material is flexible, hull motions did not open the cracks as they might have if a caulk was used.Precautions to keep the sealant off of skin are recommended.Rumor is that it will cure in the tube if it is exposed to the air. Since the tube has not been opened since the first use this cannot be confirmed.

Moisture enhances the cure so that is great for marine applications. I have found with the regular 5200 that putting it in a ziplock and then into the freezer will keep it from curing in the tube. I can't say if this is effective with Fast Cure but plan to find out. Standard 5200 cures in 7 days, not 48 hours as someone said. Fast cure cures in 24 hours.This stuff is very sticky and difficult to work with so I like to use a syringe with a needle tip to keep it under control.

Your journey will include listening to the CDs, of course, and even reading what others have written about him and the other members of the band. There is an incredible number of books about Morrison and the Doors--more than almost every other rock artists, I would guess. But you will be seeing and hearing only part of the picture until you read the first widely published volume of Morrison's musings-- his own writings in his own words, unadulterated and unfiltered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragmented writings of a lost soul","review":"I'd been looking for this book forever, so when I found it at amazon.com, I ordered it right away. I admitt, I was a little annoyed with the in-your-face cover, but the poetry made up for it. One can only marvel at the perceptions with which Jim Morrison viewed the world. While fragmented, and a little spacey, the poetry still gave me a feeling for the era in the United States which sparked such fueled aggression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary of James' thoughts, notes, and poetry","review":"Read this book and free yourself from simple common thought and perception.

This is the best of all his published works."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Destroy Roofs, Walls, See In All The Rooms At Once\\"","review":"Jim Morrison is one of the unsung heroes of his generation in the literary scene. But, his poems are just as good, if not greater. Surprisingly, his poetic style is different from his lyric style. There is no rhyme scheme, and all his works are direct thoughts. All are perceptive of our society, and its imperfections. My only problem with this book is that the publisher granted an entire page to one poem, which may only be two lines long. Although, this may be good for the individual who is into taking notes, and hanging upon Morrison's every word. This does help, because his poems require intense meditation. I find that each phrase, and each verse can have as many as five different meanings. They can be taken literally, or as he would've meant, on the metaphorical level. In short, if you are a fan of his work with the Doors, or have an interest in Beat Literature, then this is the book for you. Prepare to be blown away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrison spoke to me....","review":"Jim\\"GOD\\"Morrison was the greatest ever. He picked up where Neil Diamond left off.

Whle well-grounded in facts and engineering, this is somewhat a social history, and emphasizes profiles of people from the petroleum industry to illuminate the issues. I can't verify her extensive footnotes, but her lack of advocacy of a particular world-view (e.g., global warming, or faith in market forces) is refreshing.

I love the game over all but decided to write a review b/c I there is a major problem with the game which is from time to time it freezes w/o a reason. Especially when you are playing milestone or bounty race. It happened at least 4 times so far and usually after near completion of the milestone the game would freeze.

For one, this is THE WORST handling racing game I've ever played. The cars swerve left and right as if the tires are blown out, and it's all I can do to just flick the thumbstick back and forth constantly just to try to keep the cars in a straight line. Secondly, the graphics are subpar for a PS2 game. The colors look washed out and unrealistic. Final complaint would be the fact that there is no replay! What?? How lazy is this programming team!

The Cop chases are really fun, the enviorment is huge and less restricted than in Underground 2 and the racing and car physics are just a little bit more arcadey. This is fine, as the physics in Underground 2 were really sim-like. The music was okay too.

It's hard to find poems written glowingly about India written by someone who is not Indian. It's obvious that Kim appreciates Indian culture and experiences. I love the way he captures scenes from India in ways that come alive on the pages of his book. Simply marvelous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile and prurient!","review":"In my opinion the animadversions from other reviewers, regarding this book, are justified. This was easily the worst poetry book I've ever read.When one starts to read this book, one rapidly gets the feeling of general ennui. I found the poems to be very predictable uninspiring and wearisome. The content was puerile and prurient laced with a hint of anti-Semitism. I for one cannot fathom what Mathew Jones is going on about, none of the poems were about India. I can only assume he reviewed the wrong book.One should certainly avoid wasting their money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I bought this poetry book from my local Borders, expecting a collection of stimulating and exciting poems. Much to my disappointment I found the most awful poetry imaginable intertwined with messages of hate and intolerance towards people of different faiths and races. The poetry lacked inspiration and did not read well i.e. it seemed to meander along in a monotone.I find it hard to fathom how such a poor collection of poems could be published. I can only assume that the poet is an amateur, who publishes his own work. The author would be well advised to embark upon a beginners poetry/writing course before producing any more books otherwise he will simply waste his own time and money.This book is certainly worth avoiding as it consists of very poor poetry with morally repugnant ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can one call this poetry?","review":"It is debatable whether the content of 'Transitions' can be classed as poetry. Having read this poetry collection, I agree with the other reviewers who found that it consisted of collection of rants about Jews, sex, women etc. The language used by Kim was anything but poetic; it was dull, uninspiring and slightly preachy. Some of the poems were very strange and gave the impression that the author is a very confused individual. Anti-Semitic and racist material was also present and this is likely to cause offence to Jews and people of colour. I would consider this poetry collection a waste of money therefore it should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird!","review":"I bought this poetry book from my local Borders expecting an exciting collection of poems from a relatively unknown author.I was very disappointed to be confronted with very poor poetry conveying weird and at times racist ideas. The content was really strange and seemed not to make any sense. I got the impression that the author is a very confused individual lacking in social skills and life experience. Some of the poems took on a sexual nature. The way in which these poems were written led me to the conclusion that Kim has never had a girlfriend because he seemed clueless when it came to analysing female behaviour and their relationships with men.A few of the poems presented racist and anti-Semitic ideas, which could cause offence to ethnic minorities and Jews. These poems were pretty awful in most aspects and should be avoided as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I was very disappointed with \`Transitions'; it was one of the worst poetry books I've ever had the misfortune to read.Kim's poetry is absolutely clueless; his use of English is so bad that many of the poems fail to make sense. There is no style or panache to the poetry, it simply rambles on in a series of monotonous phrases. The use of metaphors was so poor that the reader had difficulty imagining the situation the poet was trying to describe. After reading a few of these poems I became so bored that I decided to throw the book away.The content of these poems was at best puerile and at worst racist and offensive. It appears as though Kim has an obsession with Jews, Israel and Zionism since these topics are prevalent throughout his literature.This poetry was truly dreadful in every sense of the word, I advise prospective readers not to buy this book; otherwise they may end up wasting their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible poetry","review":"This is yet another example of Kim's amazingly bad poetry books. I found these poems enormously frustrating since they did not read well and were very rambly and wearisome. I found the content rather puerile and at times offensive. As usual, racist and anti-Semitic ideas are conveyed and it seems as though the author is merely using poetry to put forward his rather unpleasant political views.It is clear to me that no self-respecting publisher would ever publish these poems and therefore Kim must do so himself. A good friend of mine did some work for a publisher where he received a copy of one of Kim's books for publication. My friend tells me that he rejected the book without giving it a second look since it was so poorly written and edited. He was quoted as having said that it was the worst poetry book he had ever read.This collection of poems represents very poor value for money and should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Dim's poetic treatise on Jews, Women and the Death Penalty!","review":"'Transitions' is yet another of Christian Dim's gems. Kim describes how women flock to see him at every opportunity and listen with adoration whilst he preaches to them about Evangelical Christianity. Kim tackles the topic of the death penalty with relish, stating how he likes to 'push the button'. No Christian 'Dim' poetry book could ever be complete without a section on the Jews and he doesn't let us down. This book is a complete waste of time. The poetry is dire and the content is total drivel. Please avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, lewd and prurient!","review":"These poems are typical of the offensive drivel that Christian 'Dim' publishes himself. The content of these poems is simply disgusting e.g. one poem describes a weird form of sexual intercourse where a man pushes a button on the computer keyboard to represent his willy, whilst the computer acts as the female. The man continues to press the button even though the computer is \`saying' no a.k.a. rape. How much of this poem is based on fiction? One begins to wonder whether these poems display the disgusting sexual urges of the author. The above example is one of many lewd and prurient poems in this book. The poetry is awful and the content is disconcerting to say the very least, I would certainly advise all readers to steer well clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puzzle","review":"My 2 year old son just received this for his birthday.

A little older children, or children very familiar with puzzles, may be interested in the larger floor puzzles that have close to 100 pieces.

The full capacity of 1 qt is nearly at the top of the cup, so you have to be a bit careful moving and pouring when using the full capacity.

I whispered \\"yes\\" out of hearing of his siblings and parents. He won't \\"spill the beans\\" but his smile was a mile wide and worth every penny.

His early mistakes, and his myopic fascination with suspect Melvyn Foster are often credited with confounding the search for the real killer. Reichert, while obviously passionate about the case, seems to get caught up in his own political aspirations at the expense of his objectivity about the case. And for him to take so much credit for apprehending Ridgway -- 14 years after he'd gone off the case -- seems like a calculated attempt to curry favor with potential voters. I guess it worked -- he got elected -- but to me he comes off as overly ambitious and more than a little closed minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"not perfect but darn good","review":"Give Reichart a break, he's a detective, not a writer. I found this to be quite the page-turner even though the reader already knows who the Green River killer was and that he has been caught and imprisoned. I too was surprised at the number of people he named, but I thought it was a good account of how a crime affects an ever-widening circle of people, and how a detective himself as well as his family is affected by a case that continues for years. I salute Reichart for his dedication to duty and for this book. Authoring this book has likely helped him deal with issues regarding this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"works with first coat","review":"I like the others had my doubt.

If you loved Jedi Outcast, you will love this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Sucks like Blues Brothers 2000","review":"Let me start out saying Jedi Outcast was an awesome game. Great powers, Cameo voices by Billy Dee Williams(LANDO), and you went on a few missions w/ Luke Skywalker himself. The only returning characters from the trilogy that assist you through a level are Chewie and Kyle(your character from the last game). Bad Dialogue, stupid cut sceens, no graphic improvements. The only cool thing about Academy was you get to fight a little w/ Boba Fett, but of course, he doesn't die and he gets away so they can make another stupid game sometime. Bad ending, too many re-occuring enemies(like the same jedi assasin 100x ect)missions that are too easy, lots of glitching(you'll get stuck to the wall if you even touch it). Didn't get around to multiplayer, sold it to someone who wanted it. Stick w/ outcast or rent this game when it comes out on xbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"Jedi Academy is a fun, creative, and ultimately great game. The gameplays good, graphics great, and storylines o.k. I have few complaints for this game, because this game is a true heir to Jedi Outcast, and more! It gives players the chance to change the looks of their character (species, clothes, sabers, ect.), which is great, because now you girls don't have to play as guys!Pros:-Great levels-Good gameplay (if you like lightsabers)-Star Wars feelCons:-Only able to get double-bladed. dual lightsabers near the end.-Can only turn to the dark side near end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent graphics and gameplay","review":"I was amazed at how long the storyline was in single player and how different each area was.

(Build up your Grip power then use it to grab stormtroopers and drop them from cliffs, use them as shields, etc..)The bad:- A few boring, stupid missions, like picking up ship parts in the desert.- Force Sense power = only good for stupid puzzle-centric missions.This game is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of fun","review":"If you enjoyed Outcast, you'll like this. It's true that it was a bit short in comparison. Also, some of more powerful foes were not as tough as in Outcast -- I'm not saying that because I'm a great gamer, because I'm not. There was more fighting than puzzles in this one, which suits me fine. The dual and double-bladed lightsabers were awesome. I ended up with the latter and it served me well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I've got to say this right off the bat, I love this game!Even though it's a bit older than some of the newer SW games (Battlefront II, KOTOR I & II), I felt that the game was more expansive. Unlike KOTOR I and II, specifically, it is NOT a turn-based game, so there's no pause in the action during fights. And again, unlike both KOTORs, the world layouts don't have boundaries (basically you can go anywhere you can jump or fall to).The storyline is pretty interesting as well. You can decide whether you want to be a force for good, evil, or just remain neutral, and it's fun replaying the game to see how different choices affect the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jedi Outcast Revisited","review":"Don't get me wrong, If I had never played Jedi Outcast (to which jedi academy is its succesor) I would think Jedi Academy is a wicked cool game! BUT, it seems LucasArts has simply re-released Outcast with a SLIGHTLY different look, the same graphics engin, the same weapons, virtually the same force powers, the same characters...and only with a slightly different setting and different locations. Ok, yeah, you can choose which color your light-saber you use and what you look like etc.... wow - I've never had that in a game before (note the sarcasm). In my opinion, games in a series are meant to evolve and change over time - like Warcraft for example...the graphics and characters and story changed dramatically between the 3 games. An even better example would be the Ultima series -each game was different than the one before it (with some similarities inherant in being a part of the same game series.)In the end, Jedi Academy = Jedi Outcast - take your pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"BY STAR WARS THE KNITES OF THE OLD REPUBLICITS MUCH BETTER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is the third game in the Jedi Knight series.

There was almost no use for conventional weapons, the lightsabre wielding adversaries were easily defeated just by pushing as many buttons on the keyboard as you could and as fast as you could. In dark forces II it took a long time to develop as a character with enough time to have fun with the force. In Jedi outcast you didn't have enough time to have fun using advanced sabre techniques, and in jedi academy it was overkill. I just would like to have seen a game that had more difficult mazes and puzzles in the levels . . . or maybe I'm just getting smarter . . . It literally takes about 6 hours of solid playing time to get through this one . . . oh wait, I can play it again and try to find all the secret areas.

They're given almost no time, a half-baked script, whining, semi-talented overseers, and a editing room intent on twisting words and events to make the two young directors look like fools.Thankfully, Ben Affleck and Chris Moore didn't need PGL to make themselves look like fools.

Indeed, his working of Old Testament references into and through every thought and action of Jesus and the apostles is at times breathtaking. It's not a modern \\"psychological\\" or \\"theological\\" analysis of Jesus as the title might lead you to believe, but is instead a reverent and powerful retelling of Jesus' life and ministry, through his death and resurrection and into the days of the early church.

Nevertheless, Sharon gets even - and after a fight, the two get to know each other and decide to switch places.Mills plays both parts with equal goodness, showing young and old that it's never too late to watch a Disney classic like this. So if you can not decide between the new version (starring Lindsay Lohan as the two twins Hallie and Annie) and this one (starring a true Disney actress), I'd pick this one to watch... it is a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think this movie is great. Haley Mills is a very good actress. At first I thought it was 2 girls. The new one is good too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic!","review":"I saw this film when I was 4 years old & Im 13 now.& I still luv it!I've always luved it including it's remake!Well I absoulely luv how Haley Mills plays 2 characters!Its a great film.The remake is very good 2.The Parent Trap 2 which was made in the 80s is an ok movie & The Parent Trap 3 sux!!!!But I'd buy this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Parent Trap","review":"This is the original version of the parent trap. I did like the newer 1998 version slightly more. But, this movie has some good moments. The movie is from Erich Kastner's \\"Das doppelte Lottchen\\" (Lisa and Lotte-The English title.) In the book the girls are about nine years old. In the Hayley Mills version the girls are 13 years old.There is a lot of typical Disney slapstick. The best part is when the girls finally realize that they are sisters. That was a major \\"Hanky\\" moment. The movie features Hayley Mills as the twins (who the previous year won a special Oscar for \\"Pollyanna\\". \\"Parent Trap\\" made Hayley Mills a pop culture icon. It also featured Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara as the parents. Some of the slapstick is mean spirited, but in all it is fun. Most of the movie consists of the girls trying to get their parents together again. One of the best parts is the camping trip where the girls play a lot of mean tricks on Vicki."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Disney Classic","review":"Hayley Mills, Hayley Mills, Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara. Need I say more? This movie is pretty much flawless. I was so thrilled when Disney put this out on DVD. I have watched it numerous times since purchasing it from Amazon and I am never disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow am I Seeing Double Hayley's or not!!!!","review":"I rented this movie on dvd it was kind of scratched which kinda made me mad but that's not important right now what was interesting was how a girl got to be the double Hayley and never be seen that must of been fun to be a double of Hayley Mills I mean If I was a double of Hayley that would of been a blast I mean they were best friends on the set actually this whole dvd was intersting they had to use a split screen to do two Hayley's It's amazing now a days how they film movies with one actress playing two people like the 98' remake of Parent Trap. I loved this movie and I especially want you to see it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Trouble","review":"The Mary Kate and Ashley have nothing on Haley Mills as Sharon and Susan. There have been remakes and sequels to this Disney classic but none can hold a candle to the original. Yes, Haley Mills plays both parts but even though this classic is decades old you would swear it was played by twin sisters. The camera and special effects are just that good. This is a must own movie for any family that likes to get together to watch good clean fun movies. The Parent Trap is sure to be a winner in any household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This movie is okay. The storyline is cute, but I would reccommend the more recent version over this. In this the twins are older then in the other one. Their tricks on the soon to be bride of there father are not nerly as good as the ones played in the newer version. Lindsey Lohan played more believable twins then Hallie Mills did. I liked the way the parents acted towards eachother in the new one. They were calm and polite. In this one though they were slapping, cussing and throwing fits whenever they were in the same room together. It was also very long and some parts were rather boring, while in the new version everthing is interesting. One thing I will say for the old version is that I like how the song \\"Lets Get Together\\" is in the movie unlike the new one. But I would say if you could see the new one then just stay away from this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the new one!!!","review":"This is a good movie, until you see the newer version... then its bad.Its so boring!

See new one that is 10 times better than the old"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Movie of All Time","review":"Hayley Mills has outdone herself in this wonderful movie. The Parent Trap exhibits all aspects of a successful movie. It is entertaining, funny, and has good family values. Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith fulfilled their roles as parents to two mischievious twins. Through schemes and plots, the twins succeed in their desire to bring their divorced parents back together. This movie is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Parent Trap (Original)","review":"This was played through streaming devise. Loaded well but stopped a few times in the movie and had to reload.

What was I thinking?? This was boring. The film is terrible to look at, cheaply made, terrible actors, and not scary. I want my money back! Never trust a film that has only one review with five stars. Wait until you read more reviews from sane people about what they think of it. I would have given it one star, but it was well researched, so I'm giving it two stars. But skip it anyway. Believe me, I was born in Wisconsin, there ain't nothing going on up there worth making a DVD about. Except for Ed Gein, but even that was 40 years ago. This film did put me to sleep, so I'm grateful for that. Guaranteed to give you a good night's rest. Maybe I should have given it three stars for that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really thought this would be better","review":"Based on the music on All Songs Considered and the fact that so many of the snippets NPR plays are songs I love, I was fully prepared to adore this entire collection.

WRONG! Just last week the handle broke off--after less than one year of not-heavy use. Just broke! In examining it, it looks cheap, so I should not have been surprised. Then I saw the reason: MADE IN CHINA. I think that says it all. I make it a practice never to buy anything MADE IN CHINA, not just because U.S. Corporations who outsource there use sweatshop labor--in many cases older children--but also because the products are inferior 95% of the time.I will never buy another Rabbit Wine Opener as long as they continue to be made in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item, fair price","review":"This is a great item to open a wine bottle.

You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years.

Going on in the business world participating in a myriad of industries as well as the entertainment field, I was too busy to think about sitting down and devouring the poetry of Weldon Kees,Denise Levertov, Sylvia Plath and Alan Ginsberg. These were the somewhat over the top writers that I discovered as a young college student.

There is alot of music without a beat to it. It sounds like shes trying to give us a taste of what she really sounds like without all the technological improvements. Her lyrics also lack that a rhyme which most humans like. All of her songs start to mesh into one big sob story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing :(","review":"What happened here? I thought this album was going to be off of the hook. This Cd did not meet even my minimal expectations which is usually three good songs. Unforunately, it didn't make it that far.

I will give this album one star for Addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"From West To East","review":"With King Tutankhamen lips, she is truly an Egyptian, Nubian Queen; unfortunately her proper royal direction was not known until the un-controlling spirit struck during the final track recorded, \\"Addictive\\". It is truly a masterpiece and a new direction for her, Dre, and Quik.The CD is a good work, even though some European barbaric words are a direct antithesis to the Ethics of an Ethiopian Queen. However, I expect more from the next CD, now that she and Dre know that the true and proper direction is from the West to the East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truthfully Disappointed","review":"I loved the Addictive song and bought the Cd expecting that same quality, but I was disappointed.

Sweetie, you have too much in your favor, than to have stepped it down a couple of levels; your voice is nearly untouchable and your appearance is close to flawless. After listening to a few of your songs, I was sadden at the contrast in style between Addictive/For Your Precious Love (Ali Soundtrack) and other works that you've done; I know there is more to that mind than expletives! There has to be, being that you had an opportunity to attend the University of Chicago via Scholarship - that in itself speaks volumes.

I must admit, my first time hearing it, i was kinda feelin' it...to me, it's one of those albums where you have to listen to it again to actually get the full effect - I was doin homework and stuff when i first heard it, but I listened again when I wasn't doin anything - BLEW MY MIND! She's very talented, and I noticed that she's a unique writer - not every word has to rhyme all the time; I can tell she writes how she feels, and sings from the heart; she's off tha hook...my favorite songs are Next To Me, Jimmy, The Truth, Real, Addictive, and especially This Feeling - I play her cd at night and just fall asleep to it.

It's thoroughly goofy, and the Chicken Lips boys run with it. From the funk of \\"Hot Love\\" to the come-hither of \\"Lovin' Cup,\\" nothing is meant to be taken too seriously. Except, maybe the dancing. The call-and-response of the drums and the bassline at the start of \\"Twiggy\\" soon morphs into a gentle groove (though the lyrics don't get less ridiculous), while the dreamy disco of \\"White Dwarf\\" keeps getting juicier.

It also requires lots of going over the same spots to get all the hairs. Last week one of the screens tore...to get them out to replace them did damage to the head in general because of the way it opens (hinges to one side) and rendered the entire unit inoperable. It is comfortable in your hand, otherwise I think I'll go back to the Panasonic brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"remington shaver","review":"I bought this shaver hoping it would be like my old one but it isn't. I have to go over the same area several times before it cuts all the hairs. I think the mesh screen on the shaver needs to have larger openings or the blades need to be brought closer to the surphase. I'm not very happy with it but it will do for now. I think next times I'll go a little more expensive and see if it does a better job. When it does finally get all or most of the hair it is smooth. mixed emotions on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I ordered this because sometimes, I just don't have time to mess with a traditional razor and shave gel. Was a little skeptical, thinking there was no way I'd get a smooth shave and expected some stuble. However, I'm very impressed! I get a good shave, leaving my legs very smooth. There was light razor burn after the first time or two using it, but that went away quickly. I find that I do need to go over the area a couple of times in different directions, but its still faster than a traditional shave. It even did my bikini area pretty well. Its not so great with underarms though, requiring numerous passes, which tended to irritate.Overall, a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut My Legs!!!","review":"I have purchased several Remington ladies shavers over the years and have been pleased with them. After reading the positive reviews, I ordered the product. It arrived just before I was leaving to go on a two-week vacation so I didn't have an opportunity to try the shaver until it could not be returned.

It works okay on the rest of my legs but not as well as my other Remington shavers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The charger stops working 3 months after purchasing","review":"When I just got it, I think it's very good, though a bit noisy.

I have to go over the same exact spot at least 5 times in order to remove the hair and it still leaves stubble. I like to have a close shave and this defiantly does not give me that, I feel almost like I didn't shave when I use this product. The one nice thing was I never cut or nicked myself.

After reading the reviews, I purchased this one. The first time I tried it in the shower, it pulled and pinched a lot. I followed the directions and wasn't using much pressure at all. It really irritated my underarms and it lasted for several days. I tried it again with the same results. I do have very curly hair and that might have some impact on the the shaver's performance. Since this is my first experience with an underarm electric shaver, I don't know if this is normal--but I'll definitely be looking for another one.

I did the research and decided to get this one because of the affordable price and pretty good reviews.Before Remington I used razor, but cuts and after shave burns (and having to shave almost everyday) made me look for a better way to keep me clean shaved. I tried the product for about 3-4 days now and I totally in love with it! It doesn't give you that baby smooth clean shave like a razor does right away, you'll have to work the skin in a repeated motions a while but it is possible! So far didn't get any pinches or burns. It says that you might need 3-4 shaves to get use to it...I didn't even need that. From the first use my skin was feeling more comfortable than after razor.If you looking for other option than razor-this is your item.

The only reason I did not buy another 6000 after that one died after 3 years of use (it would no longer take a charge) was that I wanted to try something different and a little cheaper. I'm sorry I didn't get the 6000, for it was a closer shave than this 1600. Also, the 6000 has an indicator that the battery needs charging, which is a nice feature.On the positive side, the 1600 hasn't had any problems charging, and the charge lasts awhile.

I beat this game in 2 days. The graphics are not 21st century and it doesn't have anything the book does. The first task is lame and easy. The second was a little harder bit still lame and the third was just lame and easy. Dueling Voldemort was easy. I beat him in 3 tries. Everything that happens after Harry gets out of the maze doesn't happen in the game. You immediately skip to the closing ceremonies. The Yule ball is a joke in this game. The bottom line is that this game is too easy and the graphics are lame. My advice is that if your going to spend $20 to $30on a game, buy a game for Gamecube or Xbox or PS2.

I have to say this was tons worse than the first potter game for gameboy color.

He combines isolated places on railroad sidings in the American west with the by-gone era of the Railroad to create a unique setting. The problems surrounding a young boy growing through the emotional upheavals associated with sibling rivalry, family secrets, school days flirtations and even death are familiar themes explored in the book. In Mr. Welch's story a young boy wonders if an older sister who died before he was born is as lonesome in her grave as he is in the process of growing up. The reader might wonder if the children of today experience these age-old human emotions the same as children experienced them two generations ago. It's a tender story. The unusual setting gives it a twist worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlinking the links!","review":"Ever tried to unlink a chain?

When you're ready to close it, place the link in the space in the middle of the pliers and squeeze again. One closed link!

It's a pleasure to read someone as gifted as Connolly in creating characters, describing place, and portraying genuine conversations. But when the story requires belief in ghosts I lose interest.Others have described the gore in the book, and that can be a turnoff for squimish readers.

I was aware that this was a horror story, but was really pleased at how the author plotted the story to mix tangible and supernatural evil and bring it to a logically explosive conclusion ... and the supernatural was arguably not \\"evil.\\" I was definitely rooting for the gray people. The horror wasn't in the ghosts seeking revenge, but in the bad men; you couldn't expect ANYBODY to survive if they crossed paths with these people and that stressed me.

Missing are Charlie Parker and his cronies, although the Parker character appears briefly a couple of times in the story. Also, as in the previous novels, the plot is fast, violent and intriguing. The bad guys are really bad and a lot of people end up dead. There is a bit of a supernatural undercurrent to the story that is a bit ambiguous at times, but it adds to the mysteriousness of the plot. There really is no central \\"good guy\\" character here, just a group of people caught up in violent circumstances.

I don't think I bought it off Amazon but it was this stuff for sure.It actually works, it doesn't stink or really smell that bad at all and dries rather quickly.--Near constant stirring is important (the metal particles settle to bottom quickly)--don't expect the magnets to stick as well as on the fridge.--multiple coats are sooooo necessary (i used a mini foam roller, was easy and worked great :) )--I think the coverage area is somewhat exagerated as I used the whole can on an appx 5x6 foot area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I put on about 4 coats of the primer, and the magnets stuck OK, though they wouldn't work through a piece of paper.

My girlfriend and I are huge wine lovers so I thought this would be a great gift. Appears to be identical to the aluminum one in this picture but instead is composed of cheap plastic.

I would have given it a positive review for its sleek styling and ease of use until last night, when one of the arms snapped apart in my husband's hand as he was opening a bottle and punctured his palm. One trip to the Emergency Room and two stitches later, we're finished with the rabbit. We'll go back to a cheaper-- and safer-- model. Keep shopping... and if you have to buy it, be very careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"We received our black-finished \\"Rabbit\\" as a gift. Once I learned how to use it, it removed and ejected the cork as advertised. However, after about 7 months, the spiral screw bent as I was inserting it into a cork. I removed the damaged screw with some difficulty and installed the spare provided--then ordered several more. Two days ago, the rack gear slipped a cog as I was removing a cork and I could not figure out how to fix it. Last night, it slipped another cog--making the whole device unusable. To return it for repair will cost $10 (for \\"shipping and handling\\") plus the cost to send it back. Based on other reviews here, I opted to write off the \\"rabbit\\" and return to more robust openers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I recieved this item before its scheduled delivery date, which is always a bonus.

Skip this one unless you like smashed fingers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and false advertisement","review":"The information stated that the product was new and never used.

I figured it would take more time and money then it was worth. Very unhappy with the condition of product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something simple","review":"I got set as a gift. Before one buys it, they should try to remove a cork from the machine after it's removal from bottle. If it's a real cork, it should only take five minutes or so.

I no longer use it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Seller, Damaged Item","review":"This seller sent an item that was damaged, the case was scuffed, the box was dented and the shrinkwrap torn.

Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Opens Wine Bottle in 3 Seconds","review":"This tool is flawless in opening a bottle of wine. Removing the cork from the corkscrew is another matter - I find that the grip on the tool is not tight enough to hold the cork while you try to pull the corkscrew out of it. If they can fix that problem, this would be a perfect tool for anyone who enjoys drinking wine. The other tools that come in the kit functioned without issue. Overall quite pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's too cheap!","review":"I bought both this and the similar version from Brookstone this year. I was expecting a lot from the metrokane, but it turns out the Brookstone is much better. It's $60, but the Brookstone version will last you MUCH longer than the $45 metrokane.Among the differences: The metrokane is made of plastic, the Brookstone is metal. The Brookstone model comes with two bottle sealers, and it's case is made of very high quality leather-like material instead of cheap plastic. Finally, my metrokane is brand new, and I've already managed to scratch the finish, since it's so cheap.If you're looking to get a new wine opener, do yourself a favor and BUY ANOTHER BRAND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metrokane","review":"... I got the corkscrew as a present. It stopped working after just a few months of use. The manufacturer's literature says that the product has a 2 year warranty, yet for more than two (2!) months I have been leaving messages for their service/repair folks and nobody bothers to return phone calls! In fact, I have never been able to speak with anyone at that company (other phone options include sales, accounting, and a few more). What is going on with these people? Maybe this product is so bad that they are flooded with repair calls and they do not bother to call hoping that people will just say \\"forget it\\" and go away. Would have given them a negative rating if available!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"If you are looking for a well functioning opener, this is not it! Much better \\"rabbit\\" type openers are on the market. First is the fact that it is mostly plastic, not metal, so don't be fooled by the metallic appearance in the photo. When opening the first bottle, (with normal cork). I noticed it was much more difficult to use than the old one (other brand) I had. It required extensive pressure to insert the cork, to the point I thought the flimsy plastic handles would break. Then I opened a second bottle with a plastic cork. This almost broke the opener when using upward pressure to remove the cork from the bottle. And after finally getting the cork out of the bottle, (it took two people), the cork would not come off of the screw. I had to manually untwist the cork from the opener. Save your money, spend a little more and get a real opener. This one is nice to look at but not functional! Real Junk, and not cheap!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic immitation","review":"I purchased three of these as gifts this summer, and one for myself.It is made of plastic, and works correctly one of 4 times.

We used it so much (several times a week) that we actually snapped the handle off, though I don't believe it was due to poor product quality, but instead because we opened thousands of bottles with it and it was bound to give. We liked it so much that we bought the same exact one when it broke. I only gave 4 stars because, of course, it did break. But other than that, it is definitely a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbit wine opener","review":"We bought the Metrokane opener after going through a few other openers. After reading the reviews we bought the Metrokane. We were very pleased with the rabbit until today--less than a year of owning it the handle broke in two. We live in 'wine country \\" in CA and we open a bottle a day. I will definitely be looking for a different opener. Our rabbit handles are plastic but look like they are metal. From what I have heard the metal ones are great but you need to be aware of what you are ordering. Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gadget","review":"I was given one of these as a gift and I really like it. I find it is easy to use, and I like that it stores in its own case. Somethings to be aware of is that the parts are mostly plastic (don't let the silver look in the picture fool you). Also, the cork release doesn't always work, and when that happens you have to untwist the cork yourself form an akward angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Wine Tool Kit","review":"This is the best wine tool set ever.

I received one as a gift a couple of years ago and I loved it so much I purchased this one to give as a Christmas gift this year.

We have used ours for more than 3 years.Easy-to-use, pulls any cork easily.Foilcutter, drip-stop ring, bottle sealer, wax remover, and extra worm included made the set truly useful. The storage case and 10-year warranty made the set even more attactive.I will order again for an attractive, affordable, useful gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous design flaw","review":"The corkscrew is secured with a plastic screwtop cap that comes loose from time to time.

After three uses (yes I said three) the little plastic piece near the the cork screw broke off and it wouldn't work. The wine shop said to send it to the manufacturer. Instead of going through that kind of inconvenience I decided to write this review and never purchase one of their products again. I bought a similar opener from Ross for $12.00. Have been using it for the past year. I hate over-priced, brand-named crap like this...especially when it doesn't even last a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie Doll--Cute but useless","review":"I bought this because my ten-year-old, all-metal, rabbit-type wine-opener finally quit. Was looking forward to seeing how the engineering had advanced and discovered first that this opener weighed about half that of its predecessor; second, that the newer one exerted about half the strength; and third, that the cork-release action failed to work at all. This is a cheap, plastic version of the original at at least twice the price. Look elsewhere. The additional accessories seem efficient, but they're not why I bought the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great starter kit and basic tools","review":"I bought this kit when I first started to get into wines and was amazed at how easy it was to open up bottles! I had been doing the ghetto way and using those portable corkscrews. The wine opener requires almost no effort. The other accessories also proved to be invaluable as I started to enjoy my wine more and more.I think it is a nice basic kit, and serves great as a starter kit. I also give it a thumbs up because it is in a neat carrying case so you can take with you on trips, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"The website at that their rabbits are made out of sturdy metal. Not true, there are two different makes of the \\"Rabbit,\\" and this one has plastic arms with a metallic paint. Mine has been unreliable from the start, sometimes it pulls out the cork and other times it undrills the cork. If you consult the RMA policy it requires you to ship it to them and send ten dollars for return shipping. They are effectively charging you for a replacement. I have bought all metal knockoffs for friends for about ten bucks and they've been happier than I.

Looks nice in the pictures but scratched the plastic while opening the package. I was embarassed to give it as a Christmas Gift. It does open a bottle of wine but there are several cheaper alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for awhile","review":"I bought this three years ago and it worked fine for about 5 or 6 months. Then it became more and more difficult to extract and release the corks. Finally, after even my husband struggled to work it, I replaced the worm. But that only helped for a few months until super-human strength was once again required. It works fairly well if the wine cork is not in tight but it's not good on tight corked bottles. A word of caution: When you are releasing the cork, make sure your finger is not between the trigger and the handle when the trigger comes down to meet the handle. It requires so much downward force that I have bruised my hand several times when the lever came down hard on my knuckle. I hope by now they have made some engineering improvements on this wine opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I Open Wine Bottles before my First Rabbit?","review":"This is a great tool and the 2nd Rabbit I have purchased (the 1st one finally died as I was opening my gazillionth bottle).

Well, I should have kept on waiting. Sorry to say, it took my days upon days to get throught this book. The first hundred pages or so seemed to be slow dry reading.

The writing was good, but just one darned graphic love scene after another. After a while it gets very boring... they've been there/done that!

I have to say that it was a very hard struggle to finish this book and the only reason that I did is because I invested so much time into it.

The book could be awesome after the first eight chapters, but it would still only get one star. No book should take eight long chapters before it gets interesting. Thats just torture. I don't care about the poilitics that surround the book. The characters are boring. You know that the main character is in danger but those moments are to short and fleeting for you to get much out of them anyway. There are no emotions in the book. It's dull.

It has a couple weak spots, but plenty of good tracks.The pace is a steady gallop, rarely slowing down. However, these songs never quite approach the \\"rage\\" that other albums have (like \\"Black in Mind\\") nor the epic quality or finesse of others (like \\"End of All Days\\", my favorite album).By no means is this album a low point, however. It has some classic Rage songs, and quite possibly showcases Peavy's voice better than anything. In fact, I would say his vocals carry this album to the heights that it does reach. He gives meaning to the voice as an instrument, if anyone does.Great album for Rage fans, but by no means a place to judge a 20+ year-old band for new listeners.Other albums to check out: Reign of Fear, the two E.P.s, Secrets in a Weird World, Reflections of a Shadow, Black in Mind, and End of All Days.

The only thing I dont like is the baggy it comes with for storage, to me it looks a little frail and im afraid it will break sooner than later plus for some reason I find it hard to stuff all the blocks in it... Other than that they are absolutely perfect plus I got this toy for the blocks, not for the baggy so if it breaks I'll just use a a bucket or something to store them!I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft wood blocks","review":"Granted, our son is on the younger side and can be rough with toys, but the wood these blocks are made of is too soft. Any slight bang or throw and the blocks either chipped or dented. There were a couple times we found the wood splintered off and finally decided not to use these blocks again."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"my son loves the blocksi wish they were just alittle bigger but other than that im VERY happy with them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blocks to small","review":"I was expecting the standard 2\\" blocks. The blocks are a little more than an 1\\" square. I bought another set to give my grandson."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect amount","review":"I bought these to build a logo for my store's logo and it was the perfect amount to do what I needed. I thought they would be a little bit bigger since one of the pictures show a larger block with a smaller one, but I guess they are the smaller ones. The bag is \\"just\\" big enough to fit all the blocks in, but once I give them to my daughter, I probably won't have to worry about having them all together at once :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small!","review":"I didn't end up buying this toy online because I wanted to see them in person. I went to the toy store and found that they are so super small! My nearly 2 year old could probably fit it in her mouth if she wanted to. These blocks look very nice, but I can't see how a toddler could get much enjoyment trying to stack them. I'd recommend getting blocks that are at least 1 3/4\\" big instead of 1\\". Here is a link for such a product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E44QAW"},{"rating":"1","title":"smaller than imagined","review":"These blocks are VERY tiny when you actually see them in person. I'd say about 1/2\\" squares. We were also disappointed, we were using them to write the name of the baby for maternity photos, and the colors were not very varied. Over two thirds of the ltters in baby's name were the same color. I am disappointed in these blocks and would not recommend them to a friend"},{"rating":"1","title":"made in china get what you pay for","review":"We all get what we deserve when we want cheap!...made in china not the usa....they try to make it look like its home made in the states....very disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"used for a photography prop","review":"I purchased these blocks for my photography business, and they work wonderful the colors are very bright and well painted it looks great in my photos. They also do come with a little sack to store them in which is nice so you don't have blocks just laying every where.. I would most definitely recommend these to any photographer or parent me daughter some times messes with them and she loves them. Helps her learn letters and numbers also animals since there is also different shapes and animals on them too. Great buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage! Good brand name, awful product!","review":"I bought these for my twins when they were around 2. Right out of the package I noticed the cheap quality of them. The paint was chipped off in several spots, and the wood was slivered off in the corners on multiple blocks. I immediately put them back in the clear box they came in, and ended up throwing them away. I never even showed them to my kids because they were complete garbage! Don't waste your money on them. I thought Melissa and Doug was a great brand name, and that's why I ordered them. But I do not recommend them at all. Wood and paint are cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it for my purpose!","review":"I can't speak to the entertainment/educational value of this toy. Truth be told I purchased the blocks to spell out my child's name for a maternity photo shoot. I really love the blocks and the fact that you get 50 not just the standard 26. They are a little small so could potentially be a choking hazard for young children but with proper supervision I have no problem with my future child playing with these blocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Bought these for my Grandson, he loves playing with them.

I remember having blocks just like these as a kid 30+ years ago. These blocks are darn cute. They come with a canvas bag for easy storage which I thought was great. They are well made. However, I was a bit disappointed about a couple of things. The actual size of the block is much smaller than I expected. By no means are they a choking hazard, but my 10 month old niece, can almost put the entire thing in her mouth. I was also disappointed to see that they were made in China and not the U.S. After doing more research, I found a local, independent toy store that sold a similar item that was made here in the U.S. but the price was 4x what I paid for these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size of blocks","review":"The size of blocks are small enough to fit in a kids mouth I would consider size a safety issue.

These blocks get so much use!! My son is always playing with them! The only downfall is that they are a pain to put away since they really don't come in a great storage case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and Low Quality","review":"Nothing \\"Deluxe\\" here - these are low-quality, tiny poorly finished blocks made in China (like all of Melissa & Doug's products, apparently). The paint came off quickly, but it is really the tiny size that is most disappointing. I wondered why the price was so cheap; I guess I understand now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa & Doug toys made in China","review":"These blocks are colorful and have interesting pictures on the sides without letters. The corners are a little sharp when you or your little one steps on them, so keep them out from under your feet. I was surprised to find a big styrofoam filler in the bottom of the package, which I suppose is there to make an appearance of more blocks. I think using styrofoam for that purpose is pretty irresponsible, as it will now be in a landfill until the end of time, not to mention the dangerous chemicals required to make it in the first place. However, my main disappointment with Melissa & Doug toys is that they are made in China. I can't imagine why a company would outsource jobs to China to make simple wooden toys when we have plenty of hard working people and plenty of lumber here. I won't be buying holiday gifts from China this year, so I won't be buying any more Melissa & Doug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages","review":"I bought these blocks to use in a maternity picture, as I am now 9 months pregnant. I had them at my house and my 3 year old niece saw them and played with them for an hour. Then my 5 year old nephew joined in on the fun and was building and knocking them down as boys do. I was happy they liked them because I know my little one will enjoy them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"Price is low, but quality is not.

They're blocks.","review":"They are smaller than the usual block you might imagine. For whatever reason, our two-year-old decided that chewing on a block would be a good idea and the paint comes off pretty easily. He does like stacking them and the pictures are cute though. The storage bag is nice. It closes with a velcro strap that wraps around the top of the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Thing","review":"This was a present for my 2 year old great grandson. His mom said that it was one of his favorites of the many toys that he received. This item was difficult to find locally but I was pleasantly pleased to find it at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp edges -- Ouch!","review":"These are small chunks of wood with sharp corners. I'm surprised they couldn't have been sanded down even a little, as they are, they hurt little feet and if she sits on them she obviously is uncomfortable. They just don't feel good in your hands at all, you don't want to close your hands around them as one might think you'd do with wood. The inked images on the sides are poorly done with some heavy, dark, and bleeding outside the lines and others very very lightly stamped. The carved sides aren't all painted evenly and some are off center giving them a really cheap look. Wanted my babe to have wooden blocks and I thought these were a no-brainer...turns out I was right.(If these were made in China I'd rather they kept them there and used them as an example of what NOT to manufacture. We won't be keeping. I'll buy from someone else.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"smaller than I was expecting","review":"I got this cheaper than anywhere (including shipping),cheaper than at Target near my home, so I decided to order.But the cubes were way smaller than I was expecting andI did not like the chemical smell.

That being said, these blocks are ridiculously small (about an inch square). My 7 month old twins instantly began putting them in their mouths. One baby was almost able to wedge one of the block in his mouth, so I took them away and packed them in the closet. That being said, I think the blocks will be too small for their larger hands once they turn 2 years of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small","review":"Despite being a Melissa & Doug product, these are some of the most disappointing alphabet blocks I've encountered. They are really tiny, probably about 20 millimeters square, meaning each block is no bigger than a U.S. quarter. There seems to be more choking hazard to this toy that actual fun or building block system components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint, wood can be chewed off","review":"Length:: 0:54 MinsBeautiful blocks, but not for chewers.

She licked them and the colors came off. I think they should develop a saliva-proof coloring for their blocks.

I'll buy more tomorrow. Good bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh so-so","review":"These are not the blocks you grew up with as a kid.

I bought them on the internet and wasn't really sure what I was getting. I wasn't able to find blocks at the stores I went to, and was taking a chance. In my opinion they are not great for little ones who are just starting out with building things. They are way too small and require too much hand control to build anything. On the plus side they have held up through my daughter and now my son is using them.

The top three matches were Mysterio vs. Malenko, which was an action-packed, high energy affair with innovative moves and great submissions from Malenko. Next is DDP vs. Eddie Guerrero, which was an entertaining match, even though the finish was quite anti-climatic. The third best match of the night Syxx vs. Jericho, which was watchable, but you can tell that they are still somewhat inexperinced, and they later put on much better matches. The rest of the event was pretty poor, and I was disappointed because on the back of the box it advertises a Liger vs. Ultimo Dragon match, which is nowhere to be found.

His characters are mostly uninteresting and undeveloped, and the plot and story line are flimsy at best.

Excellent quality - like new. Fascinating book of historical fiction. Buckley was an amazing writer and thinker, and it came through in this book. Angleton was a fascinating character, almost like the J. Edgar Hoover of the CIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy Character study","review":"James Jesus Angleton, former head of counterintelligence with the CIA, was quite an enigma. I recall two interviews with two former heads of the CIA. One said that Angleton was so paranoid that he was useless. The other basically said that, of course he was paranoid: He was paid to be paranoid. Buckley's experiences with the OSS during WorldWar II show, along with his good sense (and I say this despite not being a Conservative, as Buckley is). Buckley does theorize about how Angleton got the way he was, but I'll leave that up to the reader to discover. This is an absolutely fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and horrifying","review":"Of my three comments, only one really needs expressed: every time I get to racy 'blue' passage in the book, the jacket-picture of Buckley pops into my mind, and I involuntarily gag. \\"pressed her malleable vulva\\" ! grossssssssssss imagine him saying that line while on his old PBS political talk show.yuck.The other two comments? The plot is an unexeceptional spy-thriller-style and he lays in some bizarrely-constructed sentences that literally make you pause and say, \\"huh? Why did he do that?\\"pass on this; especially at hardcover prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Search of the Infamous Fifth Man","review":"SPYTIME is a fictional story which covers such historical events as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassination of Mussolini and the capture of Che Guevara in Bolivia. Many of the book's characters are real. In spite of its title the novel is not a spy story in the traditional sense but is actually written more in the style of an expose of the inner workings of the CIA.Jim Angleton remains in the background throughout much of the story while the bulk of the spy action is handled by his young protege, Tony Crespi, who is stationed in Beirut. Angleton's main obsession as Director of Counterintelligence is the search for the infamous Fifth Man who collaborated with Burgess, Maclean, Blunt and Philby.SPYTIME is an intriguing book for anyone who is interested in the Cold War and the CIA. Buckley writes with some authority about these subjects. The novel's greatest weakness is its lack of suspense and the ending is also a bit of a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buckley Can Do Better","review":"I am looking forward to reading the Mangold biography. As fiction Buckley's work is below par. I had expected more from him, the scholar that he is. This book pretends to clear Angleton,when it doesn't present enough factual detail to do this. Then it ends on a surprise note, accusing his superior without presenting any facts. Fiction can do more than simply tell or dramatize a story. I believe Harlot's Ghost by Norman Mailer, though not complete, does a better job covering some of this same information. Admittedly the latter requires a sequel to finish the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"Not much to say other than this cable did the trick and that is it well made.

A man was murdered and somehow it was all about her. Sara didn't \\"investigate\\" because she was horrified at the death of the victim, rather she was upset that it interfered with the even tenor of her life.She reacted with distaste at the way George, a security guard treated a homeless woman with a child, yet she was not above the same kind of judgemental actions, albeit higher brow.I certainly would not count someone like her among my friends and I most likely will not read the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funeral Music (Sara Selkirk Mysteries)","review":"Boring!

After making a small scale return to playing at a charity event, Sara discovers a dead body...the body of a man she never met.The central plot of FUNERAL MUSIC revolves around Sara's emotional recovery...the circumstances of her breakdown are reveealed late, although many readers will probably figure it out early on. Meanwhile, Sara's involvement in the murder case is tangiental, driven by the fact that people tell her things almost constantly.....especially the hunky police offer whose marriage is on the rocks and loves the cello.There almost no suspense in FUNERAL MUSIC, and much of the book is taken up with descriptions of interior design or food preparation......I'm not quite sure where this series can go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not great","review":"Puchased for my grandoughter who is 5 years old.

There is way to much useless dialog that distracts from the missing plot of the movie. Also, the comic relief I found to be just stupid. Especially the part when they go to purchace chickens and get accused of having sex with them.The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater were 2 characters that were exceptionally casted.

They're staring at a police barricade a hundred yards away and (though no one was behind them) they drive right into the barricade with guns blazing... after just fighting desperately to save themselves in the previous scene, and they all got shot.

The acting was good and believable.Rating: Children should not see this film (nudity, drugs, violence galore, sex, & murder).If you like watching violence with no motive, a crazy murderous family on kiling sprees and how they live, then watch it. The characters were definitely interesting and unusual and that kept me interested enough to watch the film.

This release like Tarantino aims for a 70's flavor and delivers it without flaw. A much different feeling film than the House of 1000 corpses, but it stands on its own as a new offering. I was also impressed by the careful selection of music which helped deliver the piece. A violent film? yes.... but many of the early 70's releases especially the exploitation films were heavy in violence.

In TCM the family was crazy this family only acts crazy. Can a writer please come up with something OG.

There was no point to this movie. The plot was extremely weak. It's just another example of morons with too much money to waste.

It belongs in the porn section or those scary underground places where people buy snuff films. It's truly sick and demented that anyone could call this a good movie.

I loved House of 1,000 Corpses and figured this movie would be similar, and it is not. It has a more late 70's cult feel to it rather than a horror film like the first one. This movie does in fact stand alone though, and it is worth checking out if you liked the first one, or if you like Rob Zombie. People are quick to judge him by his music, but really give this film a chance and forget who is directing it, and you may enjoy it.

Sheri Lee Moon is one hot chick, even if she has one or two (or twenty) screw's lose.

It was entertaining and visually stunning (even if he did \\"pay hommage\\" a little too much). But this new one is horrible. His attempt at trying to make a movie that is public friendly, has left him with more of an arnold-stallone-action-shoot-em-up than an actual horror movie.

The make-up looked absolutely fake.It's so boring that I rejected it from the player after finishing two-third of it.There are much better horror movies which made me shudder.

This is basically how the film felt: 90% disgusting porn and dirty talk and 10% blood and gore action. The gore is fantastic along with the Lynyrd Skynyrd tracks, but the whole movie is about disgusting topics that I don't even don't want to go in to(It makes Hostel look like a Disney movie).

The power in which that song was used must be seen.[at the end] The moment Spalding woke with Baby on his arm, their fate realized, Rob's direction to have them smile and move on was pure genius.

Notwithstanding that a few scenes were actually a little humorous, this was one of the most improbable and sadistic pieces of crap that I've ever watched. I kept waiting for something worthwhile, and it never happened. At the end, I felt like taking a shower to wash off the stink. If this is your idea of engrossing entertainment or social allegory, you must be kidding.

It also included such great camerawork and surrealistic colors and humor.This film was just a straight killer flick. Nothing fun or original from the 1st film was included.Karen Black? Gone.

Although Buck's tune in \\"House of a 1000 Corpses\\" is better. Terry Reid is a great addition to the score as well. The final scene is unreal.

Is the music good? Yes. But you already have it all if you've bought their previous Christmas CDs. The front cover should have plainly stated that this is a compilation from previous releases. Only when I pulled out the enclosed booklet did I find that admission. I suppose I should have drawn the connection from the title listing on the back, but I simply assumed this would be a new set of arrangements. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This album is mostly re-releases of material on previous Steamroller Christmas albums.

Basically, it's environmentally friendly, and by that I mean recycled melodies and arrangements from previous CDs! I found I prefer instrumental to vocal when listening to Chip & his crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Rehash","review":"Although I love Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas albums, this one makes me wonder it they are running out of ideas. Except for a couple of new songs, this is essentially a greatest hits album.

So when is Mannheim going to come out with something that is really \\"new\\"??Although we already have close to 100 Christmas CD's, we still look to add new ones from our favorite artists, including Mannheim Steamroller, TransSiberian Orchestra and the Cambridge Singers. At least the other groups put out some new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same.","review":"I agree with David.

Thinking this was like the \\"Live\\" CD...a money maker with no new material,I was dead wrong. The selections included on this CD are well thought out and the addition of lyrics and lovely vocals to Mr. Davis's own composition \\"Traditions of Christmas\\" added more depth and sincerity to the piece and the CD on the whole. It's a great Seasonal CD with all the favorites which means one doesn't have to hunt through all the CD's for individual favorites...especially while driving. It was no. 1 on the indie billboard charts, and it deserved to be. When expectations are not met, disappointment can occur.

In some places the example code in the book wraps to the next line.

There's not much going on here, and it all sounds pretty thin. It's not a complete waste, I guess. It is The Allman Brothers Band, after all, and Gregg Allman is singing.

If you are looking for a book to reinforce environmentalist beliefs, then this is your book.

The authors are so excited about CSS that they give HTML short shrift... not good for a book on HTML. I also encountered a lot of fluff on usability that could have been left out, but I suppose bibles are supposed to be thick to justify the price. The chapter on tables totally omits any reference to page layout with tables, something I find really unbelievable. I guess the authors think that CSS makes layout with tables a thing of the past.

I had to call in help because I could not understand even the diagram and then we had to supply some of our own parts because the pieces did not fit together very well. Once it was together, it is very cute and the sound effects are realistic. This is also a toy that cannot be left outside because it takes batteries and the rain/humidity would destroy it quickly. My grandson loved it and uses it everytime Daddy cooks out. The accessories are cute and appropriate but do not hang on the grill if there is any movement at all.

However the argument could be made that starting from the premise of scholarly consensus is not a safe way to do genuine historical research.

That wave distortion everyone talks about is there, but it's not that bad and if I have the visor down and not angled it's almost imperceptable. I have a slender sun visor in my car so the clips on this glare screen slide on just fine. It cuts down the glare and that's what I wanted.

The first time I used my Sun Zapper I pulled it down into position to block the late afternoon sun only to see a sort of wavy, slightly distorted, slightly soft image of the road ahead. It reminded me of a very cheap pair of sunglasses or some very cheap window tint plastic material. All of these optical defects are amplified by the strong backlight of the sun on the amber shield.This could have been a great product if they had a higher price point and used a near optically clear grade of amber colored plastic.

First Contact was okay, but I wished they had made this into a movie instead (First Contact takes some elements from this book).Advice: Make sure to check out the original series episode called the \\"Metamorphosis,\\" which had the crew meeting Zefram Cochrane, the father of warp speed (on earth anyway), on a deserted planetoid with the \\"Companion.\\" This book will go into detail on how Cochrane got to the planetoid and what happens afterwards. If you see the episode first, it'll be more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Written","review":"This book grasps you and never lets go until the end. The Zephrem Cochrane character in this book has diametrically opposed characteristics as the one in First Contact, in a good way. The only disappointment I have is that Kirk and Picard never met face-to-face, as I expected. But the novel is brilliantly written with vivid descriptions and surprises from the Old Series. Don't miss the great quote on the very first page"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The best way to describe this book would be to compare it to the Star Trek Movie Generations. It brings the series together like the Movie does and is done very well. If I'm not mistaken, I do believe I read the book many years ago and enjoyed reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storyline that will involve the reader","review":"If Star Trek: Generations wasn't enough to satisfy you thirst for an intermingling of the two historic crews, Star Trek: Federation should do the trick. The book also describes the formation of the Federation along with an explanation of Warp Theory- well as much as one can describe it in layman's terms. The plot was intriguing but I think the authors could have tweaked it a little to make it more believable- they were just trying too hard to get both Enterprise crews involved equally. However, I think most Star Trek and sci-fi fans will enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story combining both ST crews and Star Trek history!","review":"This is definetely one of the best Star Trek novels I've read. The best elements of the novel were the use of 3 different timelines combining into one pretty good story, as well as the history provided on the life and accomplishments of Cochrane. The \\"meeting\\" of the two crews was one of the weaker parts of book, I felt.All in all, however, it's a must read for star trek fans. Particularily if you want more insight into star trek history and if you enjoy books with different plot streams that culminate into one conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"yadda, yadda","review":"Generations and First Contact are five times better than this book. I have to say, the authors make Zephram Cochrane sound like a selfless, noble, perfect hero instead of just a normal, ordinary guy. I am getting tired of hearing every hero is noble, selfless, brave man who always risks his life to give a good contribution to the civilization.I love the movie because it truly defines Zefram Cochrane's charaxcter. He's not only a non-perfect guy but he's greedy and selfish.Yes, I admit this is a beautifully written book and I enjoyed reading it but you can't argue with the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Ever Read!!!","review":"This is by far the worst Star Trek novel I ever read. The shifting from one generation to the next was rough and made the story very boring. The two crews never worked with each other to the point that you, as a reader, feel good. The movie Generations was by far a better effort to bring the different crews together. This was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetitive--most disappointing!","review":"I have enjoyed Ms .Cameron's contemporary romances so much, I finally decided to try one of her historicals. Although I like historicals, this one was a great disappointment. The characters had no depth, the same sex (not love) scene was recycled over and over, and so was the dialog! Very little seemed true to the period; servants were the intimates of the \\"gentry,\\" the heroine was sexually curious and liberated; in fact, there seemed very little sense of period at all. If the author hadn't identified the date, I doubt I could have placed this in any particular pre-industrial revolution era with any accuracy. I highly recommend True Bliss, Sheer Pleasures and Pure Delights--skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it.","review":"The dialog was more than I could handle. The interchange between the characters was so esoteric it was like reading another language at times. Stella Cameron is so talented, but there are a few of her books that go beyond imagination. I was looking forward to this one, especially after French Quarter. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the story implausible. The sexual intimacy reached much too early in the book to be believable -- especially for the time period. The dialog was repetitious and vague. This seemed to be deliberate to add mystery to the plot, but instead it seemed boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"OCR all messed up & the story was kinda rapey.","review":"There was a mistake with the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on every page of this book. I read it via Kindle, you would think there would be a way to report mistakes. I kept having to reread sections. A letter was out of place on one word and so by the end of the sentence didn't make a darn bit of sense. Punctuation was also a chore.The interactions between the characters was really weird. The way it was written made the story seem kinda rapey and I didn't read his advances as welcome in the least. The entire story seemed forced up until the very end. The last 15% of the story was good. Every word before it was either uninteresting or uncomfortable.The dialog between the characters made it difficult to follow. I assumed one person was speaking and a few passages later it would be another person.Overall, don't waste your time. There are far better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it","review":"Wow - this book was so boring, the heroine so childish and the hero, well, what was he doing with her?? I could not finish this book!! I tried so hard but this whole mess of a book, outside of some of the renters, was bland and silly. Don't waste your time with this wreck. Perhaps the book would have gotten better but really, who cared anyway? If the h/h do not grab your attention early on, than it does not matter if one finishes or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near her best...","review":"I have loved all of Ms. Cameron's Mayfair Square books and highly recommend the series as a whole, but I had to work to finish this one. In her other stories she creates passion that is also romantic, but this time the sex scenes ( I cannot call them love scenes, as that emotion is notably absent) felt forced on the reader, and the characters hardly more than lustful strangers. And after wading through all the foreplay, she glosses right over the true consumation. Badly done, Stella!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back In (Almost) Top Form","review":"After her last few mediocre books I was ready to give up on Ms Cameron for good. However, \\"More And More\\" is definitely almost vintage Cameron. Nobody does quirky romances like Stella Cameron, really. The names of the characters in this book is alone worth a chuckle or two. A cranky ghost makes the book even more enjoyable. Maybe I'll stay on the Cameron bandwagon for a little longer.If you want to read Stella at her top form, try \\"Bride\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment!","review":"I think the author really lost my attention with the rambling of conversation between the charaters. I found it hard to follow the story line and at points felt like putting the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this very boring and very hard to even finish.","review":"The female was so boring with stilted dialogue. The hero is not memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious and fun","review":"This was my first Stella Cameron historical. Now I'm going to find all the rest. The love story is interesting because there isn't silly fighting. Although the hero and heroine aren't a natural pair, they want each other so much. Very sexy. I loved all the characters, including mean old Spivey, and the mystery grabbed me without interfering with what was happening between Ross and Finch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to finish","review":"I've read many good things about Stella Cameron, really I have! I was really surprised when I picked up More and More and thought of it as Less and Less. I hated this book. Absolutely hated it! I'm sorry to say.In 1820 Finch More begins an affair with a viscount, an absolutely stupid childish affair. Okay, so I'm being hard. I guess I just couldn't get over the stupid dialog and the childish way they acted together. One of Finch's first sexual experiences is childish and immature. It got worse from there. The bad thing about reviewing a book is that I actually have to finish it.Sorry everybody, but this book is not recommended. That is not to say that I won't give Ms. Cameron another try. I've heard she's very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Repackaging","review":"This Sony Music Special Products release is simply titled \\"The Archies.\\" This could cause some confusion with their first album released in 1968 with the same name. This is NOT their first album in CD form, but is in fact a repackaging of their \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, minus two tracks. Most of the better known hits are here; including \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" and \\"Jingle Jangle\\". As per usual though, there is nothing here from their last album \\"This Is Love,\\" which had a number of good tracks on it. Overall, the quality of this CD is very good, except for the very poor artwork on the cover. The last time I checked, Archie had red hair, not black! Still, this recording will do fine until somehow, someday, the original albums are finally released on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rockwool exp","review":"I did not have good results with this product. I do not recommend buying it as it falls into pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable series","review":"I grew up in an apartment near a similar suburb in Westchester - home of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor who was murdered by the Headmistress of a girls school. Even though our apartment had a Scarsdale Post Office address, we might as well have been from another state. We never got an inside look at some of the mansions that were so near and yet so far. I could totally relate to this behind the scenes look at an upscale town with women who, although they are fictional characters, remind me of a lot of people I know.I enjoyed the nice (Francesca) and the not-so-nice (Lizbet)characters in this book and followed most of them into the next book in the series. I'm hoping there's a third that will follow the relationship between Lizbet and her daughter, Whitney. I think a wedding would be really interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"My book club read this one based on some of the positive reviews. We all thought it was a bit too easy of a read. It lacks a plot. The characters are so overly-exaggerated and easy to dislike that it's impossible to relate - or to even WANT to relate to any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak attempt at satire, I think","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I can't believe that we all read the same book. It was a lightweight attempt at satire, at best. But mostly it was flimsy name and brand dropping set against the backdrop of one-dimensional caricatures of \\"high society\\" women. You didn't find yourself caring about them or really caring what happened, which, in the end is okay because nothing does. Not to mention, while we were looking for a quick summer read for our book club, this was ridiculous as every chapter ends with at least two pages of white space before the next one begins. Skip it and, if you want a book about a book club, read Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons, or if you want a satirical commentary on high society, pick one of any of the more well known titles out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good descriptions, but no depth","review":"Like previous reviews, I agree this short easy to read really had no point and had an uneventful ending. Descriptions of the women, their children and their gorgeous houses was good. Bit too many exclusive brand dropping. Okay, I get it. They're rich! Most of the book introduced us to the characters, with a chapter dedicated to the meeting.After a while, I lost track of who was who. They all blended into a mass group of pretty privileged women. I think I would have enjoyed it more if there were half the number of characters, going deeper into their lives and a slightly longer book. I didn't see any lesson learned or growth of characters. I appreciated the irony of the book they \\"read\\", and the quotes at the beginning of each chapter but it wasn't enough to redeem it in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe all the good reviews. . .","review":"because this book is terrible. Yes, it is amusing and engaging but it is so cliche and trite. It makes John Grisham seem like Faulkner. The characters are so expected and their some of their names are just ridiculous. What 40 year old woman is named Madison? Giselle is a former model - puhleese. I grew up in Bronxville and I know the kinds of women who appear in this book. Yes, they are silly and caught up in their childrens' lives but somehow I always felt they had more going on then just that. The women in this book are more superficial than anyone I know from Bronxville. And thank goodness for that! Lastly, this book is filled with spelling and grammatical mistakes. Where was the editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting characters, no plot","review":"Just as you start to get interested in the characters of this book, the book is over. The book is about a book club that takes place in the a well to do suburb in Westchester, NY. However, absolutely nothing happens in the book. There is no plot, no climax, nothing. Moreover, the characters are so shallow, conceited, and spoiled that it is hard to really like any of them. I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, amusing read, but not much more...","review":"This book offers many laughs and accurate insights into Bronxville's society gals and the many who aspire to become them. Unfortunately the character development is very limited and the writing is just average and really can't even be evaluated in any literary way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much Fun In One Book!","review":"A total escape into the world of Westchester society. We have all met these character over and over in our lives; it read like a mystery seeing every background converge on one day. Highly recommended for anyone with a community of friends. A terrific look into the past for me as a native of Bronxville, but we all know ALL these women. Great persepective with a wonderful retro-twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only in Bronxville!","review":"This book is great fun! If you are a member of a \\"book club\\" and have a sense of humor, it is a \\"must read\\". You don't have to live in Bronxville to relate to this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bronxville Book Club","review":"The Bronxville Book Club was a quick read that got off to a good start. It grabbed my attention by introducing, and somewhat developing, the characters who I assumed were going to be the main characters in the story. While their shallow, self-centered lives are not my reality, I was becoming interested in their lives, nevertheless, and began to favor a couple of the less \\"snobish\\" characters. As I read on, I realized the book was coming to an end and there were too many unresolved issues. When I completed the reading, I couldn't help but wonder if the character who was being snubbed was actually the person who wrote the book and wanted to \\"get back\\" at her \\"friends.\\" Overall, I thought the book was pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club favorite","review":"Our book club is made up of busy women, some of whom don't always have the time to finish the monthly book selection. This book is perfect for book clubs. It's fast moving, fun and you'll laugh out loud. If you like \\"I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother\\", you'll love this book. Also great if you like books like \\"Nanny Diaries.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPERFICIAL AT BEST","review":"I can't believe this is the same book that other reviewers on this website are raving about. Perhaps they are friends of the author? I picked up this book because of the reference to \\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" - what a mistake. I had to get through too many chapters describing one-dimensional characters (none of whom a reader would want to know, with the exception of Francesca) before I got to the actual book club meeting. Not much of a meeting! It was over before it even started.I was bored to tears with this book. If you're a fan of good literature, don't bother picking it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEERING IN ON ANOTHER WORLD","review":"I was so impressed with this book. The writing is top notch and the author creates such vivid pictures of her characters and their lives. We are given such trememdous insight into the lives of the rich (but not famous) group that live in a small town not that far from where I live. I found myself wondering if these people who are so well off are any happier than the rest of us working class folk. Wouldn't we all like to try things in their shoes and then see how we'd fare with all that wealth. The book keeps your interest in them and the small community in which they live.

Finally, released in DVD. If you appreciate acting for what it is, you will love this movie. Duvall and Harris hit the ball out of the court. MacLaine and Bullock do great supporting jobs as well. Two retired men become friends of sorts. One is a retired seaman, the other a Cuban barber. One is a salty curmudgeon, the other a rather proper gentleman. The story starts when the two meet each other in a park. From this point on, a developing friendship starts to unfold. The performances given by these two veteran actors are second to none. Although the overall theme of the story is rather melancholy, it is an overall depiction of a facet in some people's lives. The movie is a hidden gem that for some reason, was never well publicized. In my humble opinion that was a big mistake and deprived appreciative moviegoers of a unique experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it - can't play it","review":"This item cannot be played on a DVR!

Our 3 year old may be getting the \`wetness signal' but it's not 'loud' enough for him to react to. No rushing to the potty for him, though occasionally he will go get a new diaper so he can be changed.For my part, I am also less than thrilled with the Feel 'n Learn product because Pampers has reduced the overall amount of absorbency as compared to their other diapers. This reduction in absorption means that we need two different types of diapers around for daytime use; these (until they are all gone) and the regular Pampers which have much better absorbency; good enough to last through a shopping trip.Two Stars.

At first he doesn't like being responsible for the little cetacean, but soon finds himself upset when its pod is found and the youngster's going to leave.This is a gentle lesson with a beloved cast of characters, though I'd say it's the weakest of the three Theodore books we have read.

These \\"inconsistencies\\" turned out to be errors...some publication and some writer error. By the time we were finished I had 7 type-written pages of mistakes (my instructor sent them to the editor). I was disappointed that as a first year student I was able to find critical errors that editors should have caught. And to add injury to insult, the quality of the book was so poor that the binding broke and I have pages falling out. The book is literally split in two.

One can barely read a few pages without coming across one of Kim's anti-Semitic outbursts. Once again, I feel that Kim is hoping to inspire the Christian community to rise up and destroy Judaism and Israel. Throughout this book, one finds national and racial stereotypes that would not look out of place in a BNP election pamphlet.If the extreme political views aren't enough to put readers off, then the inane ramblings and lack of a good plot will do so. I find it amazing that anyone can publish literature of such a low standard. The stories are very poorly written, boring and predictable.Do not buy this collection of racist and anti-Semitic stories as to do so would promote such morally repugnant ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring and unpleasant!","review":"This collection of short stories was very disappointing. The stories were dull and the plots uninspiring.After reading a few of the stories, one becomes rather nauseated at the extreme political views and the lack of excitement. They seemed to be based upon the strong anti-Semitic feelings of the author. Racist and religious stereotypes were reinforced throughout the book. Kim seemed to run out of ideas towards the end of the book as each story became more and more repetitive and predictable.I was amazed at the poor standard of English in this book. I found sentences beginning with 'And', numerous typographical errors and words used out of context. I can only assume that English is not the native language of the author or the book was very poorly edited.Most readers will find the stories in this book very irritating and in some cases offensive (readers of Jewish faith)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful!","review":"I found this to be one of the worst books I've ever read. The content was badly edited, assuming that it was edited and conveyed extremist political views. The author, Kim, used a lot of racial stereotypes and produced arguments that condoned or even supported anti-Semitic ideas. It seems to me that the author is one of the 'hardcore extremists' in the Evangelical Christian movement, who preaches that Jews must be fought at every opportunity.The stories were very boring and predictable. They were also very slow moving i.e. it took ages for anything exciting to develop. I think most readers will find this book both offensive and very dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Literary Work on Identity","review":"Before reading this book, I did not even know that there were Indian Jews.

I did not know that there were Indians who were Jewish. I thought they were all Hindus. This book helped me to see diversity within the Jewish community. I had bad experience with super-Zionists distorting history about Israel and trying to cover up genocides against Arabic people that the State of Israel perpetrated. But this book helped me realize that not all Jews were evil or racist Zionists. There are Indians who are Jews who struggle with racism by Jews directed at people of color who happen to subscribe to Jewish religion or identity. Eye-openning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist drivel!","review":"I was shocked by the amount of racist and anti-Semitic views presented by the characters in these stories. Racial and religious stereotypes were reinforced throughout each chapter. I find it amazing that a fellow man of color would write such racist drivel. Kim appears to have a complex about Jews and Zionism and this is reflected in a lot of his literary works. Whilst I, as a Muslim, wouldn't claim to be a fan of the Jews, I do think that Kim goes overboard with his anti-Semitism.Apart from the racism, the worst aspect of this book was the lack of excitement and inspiration. Most of the stories just rumbled along without really reaching a definite conclusion, which I find very irritating.

I have done Winsor Pilates, The Tracy Anderson Mat Method, Jackie's Extreme Training, etc. They are all good, but after time I tend to get bored or the DVD is too long and I just cannot maintain doing the workout in my busy schedule. But \\"do more pilates\\" is officially my new favorite. It is the perfect length of time, extremely challenging but not overwhelming, and it holds my attention through every single second of the work out. It has the perfect blend of pilates and the Tracy Anderson method. It truly is the best of both worlds. Kudos to Bea and Niece. They developed a fresh and challenging workout in a very saturated market. I cannot wait for their mat DVD to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I feel bad about this, because it gets great reviews, but I wanted to offer a different perspective. When I read reviews, I check the good as well as the bad, and hopefully in this case I might help someone avoid purchasing something that might not be right for them. For me, this DVD was just okay. I'm not sure I'll do it again, which makes me sad because I hate to waste money, but there it is. I am pretty fit and when I purchase a DVD, I want it to either provide a really great challenge or, in the case of my other yoga and pilates, move my body and maybe not challenge me as much physically but also get the mind-body connection. This did neither. I was barely challenged, so it's not for someone who is very fit, and the set and music kind of grated on me.

No offense to any Liars fans, but this is really bad. There's nothing wrong with experimental music or trying new things. Maybe this is just a bad experiment.

Like the main character, I like to write, paint, and I moved to France to live, so I thought that I would love this book. Unfortunately, the author didn't capture any of the essence of living in Paris or France. It was so off, that I wondered if the author was even familiar with Paris.I'm not a professional, but the book seems very poorly written. It doesn't flow; it's a struggle to get through; the characters are not accessible; it's very \\"choppy\\"; it's cold; and unpleasant to read. Throughout the book, the author just tried too hard, and it's painfully obvious. I couldn't wait to stop reading it. How unfortunate, because the story idea was not half-bad.Just in case there is a reprint being planned, I think it should read \\"piqued\\" instead of \\"You've peaked my interest..\\" on page 89."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited","review":"This book starts off really good and exciting, but as you read on, you'll realize that it's incredibly boring and pointless. The writer over describes the characters that it becomes unrealistic and cartoonish. The heroine, Djuna, is a miserable little girl. YES, we do know that her childhood is not exactly perfect, but is making her a real bore incredibly necessary? I don't remember a bit in the entire book that she expressed happiness and laughed. Even when she married Jean-Auguste she still acted like a miserable grump. The book needs some editing as well. I don't understand the need of using too much metaphors. Just, GET TO THE POINT!

Ms. Robbins spends a tremendous amount of effort naming brands and places (although her grasp on the places is a little worrisome - people wander in Paris and see sights that are miles apart, as though they are across the street from one another), but her characters are weak, and the plot is weaker. The novel reads like a note passed in class by a 16 year old girl; it has everything except exclamation points and smiley faces. This one isn't worth the time spent to read it, and I wouldn't have finished but for the long plane flight with bad movie options.The book also would have benefitted from a careful reading by an editor before publication.

It is well documented with the history of the 30's. It is not a smut novel, but a piece of art in the literary world. Few novels today educate the reader and challenge the mind. I had to have my French and English dictionary next to me. Though I have read other reviews that said it was too longI dont feel that way. How can you put a length on something that documents so many parts of our history. The novel touched my heart. I have been to Paris and now want to go back.I want to see the places described in the book. Reading is about learing to me. It you want a book that is boring and just takes about sex all the time, this is not it. I would conclude that this is a literary artwork, a timeless beauty that will live forever in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation","review":"I am disappointed that people would compare Adreana Robbins to the late great Harold Robbins. I was a fan of his for many years and I find this work to be a very poor imitation - a wannabe. The descriptions are longwinded. The plot development circumnavigates the globe more than the actual characters. As for the characters, they lack depth and any perception of reality. There seems to be a preoccupation for name dropping geographical locations of the rich and famous (yawn) which we have read a thousand times before in other authors' books such as Harold Robbins. The book reads like a bad soap opera. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, but not his best","review":"I basically agree with mark21765. It's a great album with excellent playing from everyone, but it's not very adventurous. Indeed, it sounds a bit like Miles' quintet. It's Frisell's guitar playing that makes it a bit unique. I love Frisell. I somehow like Douglas' more daring and interesting projects. I love Uri Caine, too, but his own projects are much more fun and exciting. I can't say anything bad about this album, it's excellent, but I was expecting a little more creativity from Douglas."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet did 86 of these songs come from?","review":"Before you buy, take a few minutes to preview all of the songs in this set...maybe I was just asleep during the 80's, but I only recognized about 15 of these songs as \\"hits\\"...the rest were leftovers that never really got much airtime on the radio. If you're looking for a radio replay experience, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"This book presents the plot behind the PC games Quantum Gate and Vortex. I had played both games and enjoyed them very much. The story starts with new soldiers being prepared for battle in a planet so deadly that they have to use VR helmets during battle. They shoot at what they think are nasty alien bugs but one of them finally discovers what are they REALLY shooting at. Then he has to make some very tough choices and battle the people who want to keep all secrets buried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Retold for the zillionth time","review":"And it's as wacky as ever. Premise - poor planet Earth has gone to the dogs and instead of fixing the problems we set out on a trip to another world to create another Eden. (These other solutions are always so astronomically more expensive that just fixing the problem that I wonder why people even try.) Forget what happened the first time with little Eve and stupid Adam, this is going to be different.But you know and I know that it's not different with violence, double crossing, mistaken identiry and rambling on about whether or not they're on another planet or say, Sumatra. In the end it's Earth but it's another Earth (Go Figure). Besides the narrator is knocked out and doesn't know if he's going to live or die. How apropos.The writing is strictly in science fiction mode (and you know what that mode is), pedantic, and to tell the truth the various characters fail to remain after a few minutes. Needs some more work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"Another suburban white kid attempting to be street tough.

There's a power to Skip's lyrics that just grows on you the more you listen. Rarely do you find such a great combination of incredibly powerful messages supported so well with beautiful music. His voice carries clear to your soul. Whether you play \\"Naked\\" on a quiet Sunday morning, or crank it up when you're feeling like it - this album speaks to you where you're at. Well worth the money. Check him out live sometime - it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be The Last To Find Out About Skip Peri","review":"If you are the type of person who just hates to be a follower then make sure you buy this CD before everyone else does. Naked has the just the right mix of hook, melody, and variety to make it one of those albums you just have to listen to A LOT. Skip's growth and maturity as a songwiter have blossomed on this, his 2nd album. His arrangements are combinations of hip-hop, rock, soul, pop, blues, and country. You won't get tired of this album.

There was only one selection, and although I have been able to gleam some useful information between the anti-American diatribe every other paragraph, I wish I had not wasted my money and passed it by. And I wish the PX had a better selection of books on Iraq."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Photographs - Pity About the Text","review":"This guide to Iraq has some wonderful photographs, but the text is larded with anachronistic assertions and factual errors. For example, on page 11, Munier gives the dates for the Sumerian civilization as between 3500 to 2350 BCE, and then a few lines later says that the Sumerians had \\"agricultural knowledge that produced an improved, iron plow\\". That's pretty amazing, since the Iron Age and the smelting of iron in the region didn't begin for another 1100 years! It's the equivalent of saying that the MP3 player was introduced in the Middle Ages. Other absurdities abound, especially when Munier begins covering the more recent history of the country and his admiration for the former regime begins to show. If you want good photographs, it might be worth the money, but ignore the text: let's hope better guidebooks to Iraq are soon produced!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi-Style is not sending this item.

My wife's book club read it first, then she brought it home so I could read it. It was well worth the time. My heart really went out to Mrs. Todd. Crystal was her only child, her whole world, and to know that she was brutally murdered like this is a real shame. He should never be let out of prison and be forced to think about what he did to that poor child every day of his life. Had he been tried in my home state of Texas, he would be sitting on death row. I do recommend this book to anyone who is a true crime fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written Account of a Terrible Crime","review":"I found this book interesting from start to finish - probably because Ken Register hardly seemed the type to commit any sort of crime. The authors put all the facts together tho and made me understand that the young man was not all that he seemed. I would like to have seen a deeper probe into exactly why Register turned out the way he did, but I understand that would have been impossible for the authors to do. Their description of the frustration the law enforcers of that town faced was compelling enough to keep me turning pages. The cops worked hard and they got their man. Whatever in the world is bothering Ms. Spillane is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Standard tale of an adolescent boy carrying a lot of rage and an overweening sense of privilege and the girl who one night said no -- a newspaper article unnecessarily extended to book length. Nothing particularly fascinating in the story, investigation or the psychology of the boring, vicious little killer. Proof that murder stories can be as mundane as life in an American backwater town. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight for the British","review":"Hudson and Hill's well-written and easily read account of murder and mistrust in small-town America gives you an instant insight into what is effectively a foreign world to those of us on the other side of the pond! The style of writing draws you into the web of mistrust, deceit and horror that surrounded the horrific murder and mutilation of 17 year old Crystal Todd by the seemingly quiet and respectful Ken register. This murder rocked the small town of Conway, effectively pushing away the innocence it had clung to and successfully entering the town into the murder hall of fame. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to true crime readers anywhere for its readability and the way that Hudson and Hills recreate the atmosphere surrounding the whole case. Each character is clearly and painstakingly drawn, so well at times that I cried with Crystal's Mother when I read the description of her pain at the news of her daughter's murder. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average true crime book","review":"I'm really surprised by the high rating of this book. I think it was one of the least memorable of the true crime genre that I've ever read. Why? Because the victim and the killer were both so young and had not lived much of a life yet, that there was not much to say about either of them. I felt like I never got a good sense of them and that is important in this kind of book. The book also was very repetitive. Also, there really was no thrilling detective or legal work done here. The only realy evidence found was DNA evidence. And throwing the info in at the very end about Ken's other crimes was jarring. It may be good to surprise the jurors but don't surprise the readers with facts that should have been brought out earlier. Basically I had to force myself to finish this - it is nowhere in the same league as truly great true crime books like Helter Shelter, Fatal Vision, And the Sea Will Tell and The Stranger Beside Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ann Rule","review":"Wonderful true crime story about a young psychotic killer who brutally murdered his best friend and tried to hide his guilt from the family and community. He even carried her coffin to her grave. This book was better than any Ann Rule book I have ever read and I give it high marks. Even those who aren't true crime fans will like it. I just ordered Hudson-Hill's other book, AReason To Live, and hope it is equally good as An Hour To Kill.I hope they write a lot more true crime stories. High marks forauthors Hudson and Hills."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Hour To Kill; Worth Far More Time to Read","review":"An Hour To Kill is an interesting, informative and easy to read book. The authors have taken the information about this tragedy, spliced it together, formed an opinion and created a book that is difficult to put down. The descriptions of the community and setting in this small town gave you a clear understanding of what and how this murder affected the people in Conway, South Carolina. The division in the community over Ken Registers guilt is documented and the evidence used by these people to proclaim his innocence is presented. However, the authors wisely draw there own conclusions based on the evidence. A super book. Worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for true crime fans","review":"I was so caught up in this book, I skipped class to finish it. Let me just say I am a psych major and it takes a lot for me to miss my classes. As a true crime fan, I have read many books by countless authors, such as Jack Olsen, Jerry Bledsoe, Ann Rule, etc. These two guys are right up at there the top with these. An Hour To Kill was a convincing case study as related to young men who become addicted to sex. Ken Register was a good example of an otherwise \\"boy-next-door\\" type of guy who was introduced to pornography at an early age and became addicted to it. Although I don't think Register, had he not gotten caught, would have followed the path of serial killer Ted Bundy, but he would have probably killed again to satisfy his sadistic nature. I recommend this book for any budding psychology student or reader who enjoys a good true crime story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken, A Wolf In Sheep's Skin","review":"I got this book from a friend and read it in two days. What drew me to the story is the theme of the book that says people are not really what they seem to be. In this rural town, peace and quiet was lost when the Devil struck down one of their own by using an 'exemplary fine young boy.' I wouldn't consider the book a trademark, but the story it tells and how it was told makes for good reading. I don't regret picking this book up. It was a nice treat. Thanks Mr Hudson and Mr Hills for sharing this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal!!","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of the customer reviews. As an avid reader of true crime I found this book to be wonderfully written. I usually read Ann Rule because she is one of the few true crimer writers that write an interesting book. However, Dale Hudson and Billy Hills have just been added to my list. The book starts out great and you never, ever get bored. The story is a sad one and my heart goes out to Bonnie Faye Todd who lost her beloved daughter, to the man she considered her daughter's friend and protector. Read the book, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, super story.","review":"Although I usually end up trashing some true crime books after the first few chapters, An Hour To Kill was so interesting I read it in two nights. Johnnie Kenneth Register II was a realsociopath, and no doubt would have killed again had he been found innocent. With the role DNA has played in solving a lot of crimes today, it is hard to conceive there was a time when people would doubt its conclusions. From what I learned, withoutthe use of DNA, Register would have never been a suspect. I amjust glad to know he was convicted and will never do any harmagain. Hopefully, he will never see the light of day. GOOD BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"review of an hour to kill","review":"Great book!

I find some of the bigger rockers to be less inspired, but none of them are bad. Depending on your taste ymmv. \\"Bigtime\\", \\"Heading for a Breakdown\\", \\"Lone Summer Dream\\" and \\"Borderline\\" all also really stand out.

Mormon scripture says \\"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly\\" but what they mean is INSPIRED correctly.It further shows how the mormon teaching of many gods existing, and being created is against the bible's teaching of there always existing only one god.Im sure the book had more content but it escapes my memory at this point.This book was what lead me out of mormonism and back to the teachings of the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Other Side' and artwork make it worth the price...","review":"I would have easily given this single 5 out of 5, if it weren't for the fact that its version of 'Save You' is censored.

I absolutely fell in love with the male lead and the halfling vet (so cute!). The female lead was beautiful and had so much personality. Her character practically jumped right off the screen! The secondary characters (the aunt and director) were a bit over the top but fun.Family viewing? So far this is the cleanest Korean drama I have watched.

I used them to hang posters and maps I got with my video game strategy guides on the latex-painted dry walls in my home office, where I put my Xbox 360. The largest poster on my walls measures 24 X 36 inches. I hung it with eight strips - four in the corners and one between each corner. It is on the wall for close to 4 years. There is no sign of peeling or sagging. I removed a poster once, by peeling it very carefully off the strips, without any damage to the poster itself.

The pictures are very helpful.I put my poster strips on the back of my poster and stuck the poster to a painted wall. I then pulled back one corner of the poster in order to straighten it out. A huge piece of paint came off my wall. I ended up just putting the poster back on the wall since it wasn't too crooked and looked better than the blemish that I had just created.The poster strips do a good job sticking something to the wall.

While the 3M Command Poster Strips did hold my poster nicely on the wall for over a year, when I went to remove it, it tore huge strips of paint off the wall on all 4 corners. It was so bad I had to repaint the entire wall. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"handy to keep pictures straight, and hang lighter objects","review":"These are basically double-sided sticky foam pads. They do a good job hanging lighter things like a poster. I would not trust them to hang a framed picture. I have no proof that they would fail, but judging by how they tend to pull away and let go on things like wood and drywall (or anything that isn't 100% clean and smooth as glass), I wouldn't count on them to hold up a framed picture on their own.One great use for them is putting two of them behind the lower corners of a hung picture to keep it from wandering around or going crooked on its hanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"You might as well just tear the corners off your posters right now and save some money by not buying this product. Yes they may hang reasonably well, but when you remove the strips, they tear posters. The best solution for hanging posters is always thumbtacks. They are much more low impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if I could","review":"Yes, I did the prep correctly (rubbing alcohol and everything!) Yes, I waited the correct amount of time. No, I didn't overweight the hooks OR strips.I have now had 3 sets of the hooks and 1 set of the strips completely fail on me, to the tune of 3 drywall patches, a very banged-up print mounted on foamcore, a couple of dinged frames, one completely destroyed frame, and a huge chunk of 100+ year wooden baseboard. It's happened on drywall and plaster, on interior and exterior walls, in winter and now in summer. I'm so frustrated I could spit.THESE STUPID STRIPS ARE NOTHING BUT A RECIPE FOR MISERY. Some fail overnight. Some wait weeks or months to fail. It's not worth it. It's far easier to spackel and fix a nailhole than it is 1-2 3/4-1\\" drywall paper chunks out of my walls.I'm so ticked off.

I had previously used obscene amounts of masking tape, but it always fell off within a day, and I did not want to risk anything stronger on the old door. I placed one of these strips (12 come in a pack) on each corner, and voila! It held.One word of caution: for a clean removal, make sure to pull STRAIGHT DOWN on the tab.

Forget about nails or screws that leave holes and forget about traditional double-backed tape that leaves nasty tape gunk on the wall after you remove the poster.These 3M strips are easy to apply to the regular drywall, plaster or even brick and hold your posters or photos to the wall VERY securely. When it's time to remove the art from the wall you simply pull down on the pull tab and the adhesive comes right off without leaving anything behind.This is perfect for dorms or apartments where you'll only have artwork up for a little while and it's also perfect for home owners who don't have to mess up the walls in their house. Even better, these things are reasonably cheap. My wife and I purchased a bunch of these after we discovered how easy this makes it to hang stuff in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too expensive for what it does","review":"For a short term hanging of a poster these do well of not damaging dry wall, but if you leave them up for more than 3 months they will rip the paint off the dry wall when you take them down.

They were kind of expensive for just adhesive strips, but I figured it would be worth it not to have to deal with my posters falling down on me two days after they were put up. I'm sure that these strips would work well for some surfaces, especially smoother surfaces, but they definitely do not want to stick to the plaster on the walls of my dorm. I think the maximum length that anything I put on my walls using these was about 2 days. If you're thinking of using these, make sure to test one or two on the wall where you plan to use them before you buy more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as advertised","review":"These are small strips of double-sided sticky foam with a pull tab at one end. You use them to stick things to a wall, and when you want to remove the thing you pull the tab, which stretches the foam and releases the adhesive. They stick really well, and the adhesive releases without staining or damaging the surfaces involved. I discovered that it is awkward, if you've hung a picture or poster, to reach up underneath the object in order to grab the little tab. I ended up creasing the poster I tested this on, and I think it would be extremely difficult to use with something stiff like a matted print or a picture in a frame. I also had to pull the tab a lot harder and longer than I expected before it would release. It requires patience if you want to remove the adhesive without tearing anything. But _if_ you are patient and dextrous, this item will function as desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I'm highly disappointed in this product.

Joan Chen could not act these days, but she did have something going with Matt Dillon. Probably the fault of the whole film should lay on the hands of either the scriptwriters or Bruno Kirby who managed to ruin every film that he appeared in. Thankfully, he didn't for This Is Spinal Tap, or he might have gotten one from the band members. Golden Gate seemed to be more of a ripoff from Year of the Dragon but not too much from Chinatown. Pretty often, they will mention the word \\"Chinatown\\" as if it was an ominous word. But let's get real, it's just a square of a block or two filled with a lot of bad Chinese restaurants and overtly red decorations.

I mean I was really ready for a fight.This book gives you a historical glimpse at the mentality, culture, and idealism that would be required to mold a force like the one that stood, fought, and died at Thermopylae in 480 BC. I heartily recommend it to any student of history, honor, war, or adventure. If you have not already done so, I would also recommend reading Catch-22, All Quiet on the Western Front, and Johnny Got His Gun, for a less idealized perspective of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful tale of the classical world","review":"Steven Pressfield does something here that very few historians (and not many novelists, either) are able to accomplish: Create a compelling yet historically accurate tale of the Classical World. He brings exquisite life to the Spartans, eschewing the base stereotypes and embracing the noble stereotypes of these remarkable people. He also empowers the women of Sparta (oft overlooked) without coming off as a feminist (it is obvious he conveys their status for reasons of historical accuracy, not political correctness). The only minus is the digressionary voice that sometimes finds its way into the work; I feel a chronological tale would have revealed more of the development of the narrator's person. I also disliked the Persian voice in the book, but I understand its necessity as many readers are not familiar with the events of the aftermath of Thermopylae.

I usually have some nits about the writing, plotting, emphasis, pacing, accuracy, etc. But I have nothing negative to say about this fascinating, often lyrical, work.The narrative is a flashback from the only Greek survivor of the battle, Xeones, a refugee adopted (as a semi-slave) by the Spartans while still a boy. He relates the story of his time with the Spartans to Xerxes, the Persian King who defeated the 300 at Thermopylae and was intensely interested in what made the Spartans tick. You learn about Spartan culture, values, discipline, sense of honor, weapons and war strategy. Pressfield weaves all of that into absorbing character studies with sparkling dialogue and surprising plot twists. His descriptions of the battles are vivid and frightening.I was surprised I was so moved by Xeones and his fate. I think it's because he represents my idea of honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant historical fiction-","review":"Any fan of ancient history will soak this exciting novel up.Pressfield draws you in with intriguing well developed characters and a great blend of fiction woven into historical facts and events.Heartily recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story - Beatifully Told!","review":"Everybody dies. So did these 300 Greeks. But the world will never forget their choice of death.It is incorrect that the battle at Thermopylae changed the course of history. That was the battle at Marathon, some years before, when the Greek cities were unprepared and only the city of Athens was able to scrape a small army which, beautifully generaled by Miltiadis, defeated the first Persian campaign and, thus, averted the infusion of Asia into Europe.Thermopylae was only a moral victory. In every sense as well in the sense that it demoralized the Persian troops. Pressfield does a fair job in making his reader get a taste of the Spartan way of life. The loyalty to the city-state, the devotion to the ideals of freedom and the personal sacrifises offered to safeguard it.Not to be taken as a history lesson - yet, could be a great excuse to get interested in the period that shaped the western civilization.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was delivered damaged.

Mr Pressfield has taken one of the seminal moments in western history and trivialized it. Greek words appear as if he were testing his European \\"your word power\\", only to distract the reader.

One leaves this book with little or any empathy for the characters; which the story cries out for; nor the general protagonists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely popular, but only pretty good","review":"I give this book only 2 stars because it has been widely overhyped for years. As an account of the famous Battle of Thermopylae, it is a serviceable adventure, written with a fair degree of descriptive skill, but it ain't Proust. On the downside, it perpetuates a lot of heroic cliches about the Spartans. So noble are these fellows, so full of vim and valor, you can't imagine why the helots would resent them so. A good indication of how distorted it is is the fact that modern Greeks love it--Pressfield has been made an honorary citizen of Sparta.I recommend instead Nicholas Nicastro's excellent \\"Isle of Stone.\\" It is much more realistic about the true nature of Sparta, which was in fact the model for totalitarian systems throughout history. It is also written with more skill, with better rounded characters, and avoiding the stilted claptrap of Pressfield's dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Believe You Were With the 300 in 480AD!","review":"An Outstanding account of the Battle of Thermopylae!

I read it cover to cover in two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore","review":"While the various battle set pieces ring authentic and one really feels they are witnessing first hand the carnage of war, I found this book rather boring. There seems to be very little in terms of character development. Mr. Pressfield's characters seem to be mere stick figures pasted against the backdrop of historical events.The writing is also rather ponderous at times. There were several occasions where I needed to re-read a sentence to understand it's meaning - strange choices in word order, etc. The dialogue strikes me also as anachronistic.Overall, I just didn't care. My attention wandered. It's a shame because I've read such good things about this book. I found it neither compelling nor particularly exciting. But perhaps that's just me...For truly exciting and colorfully written historical fiction set in the ancient world (albeit centuries later than the events chronicled in this book), Colleen McCullogh's \\"First Man in Rome\\" series is about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction all the way","review":"The author uses fictionalized life experiences of a couple of characters to present the action of a great Grecian war. It doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda only a Spartan could love","review":"I think it's high time that somebody wrote the truth about Sparta. Thanks mostly to writers like Pressfield, we somehow get the idea that these guys were basically ancient versions of ideal American combat buddies. Actually, the Spartans were possibly the least understandable of all the Greeks. Their society was a tyranny. They enslaved other Greeks. They mercilessly crushed democracies wherever they developed. What exactly do modern, freedom-loving Americans have to like about these guys?I recommend everyone go out and read some reputable non-fiction about Spartan society, not a whitewash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring. Poorly written.","review":"I'm shocked at how many good reviews this book gets. The character development is dismal, the dialog is the worst I've ever read. If you want to read about the battle, read pages 224-279. Be prepared to skip over many dull chapters. This book could stand heavy editing with a knife, cutting out most chapters. I'm bitter at having wasted my money on this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comic book with picture words","review":"What a disppointment. The book may wallow in 5 star reviews but where is the beef? I felt I was in 5th Grade Ancient History class with Sister Emiliana droning on as I was peeking at the scantily clad people in the illustrations. There is no depth to this book which extols one of the most brutal societies the world has ever known (Sparta) which was, luckily, defeated later on in history. To all those good folks who raved about this valiant effort to write \\"history\\" I recommend any book by Mary Renault. It's interesting that none of the reviewers have made this (Greek) connection. This book is a sham disguised as \\"classy\\" -- sort of like that Cave of the Bear Clan book that did the secretary book-of-the-week run as a \\"classic.\\" Save your pennies. Get Mary Renault."},{"rating":"1","title":"The language!","review":"An adult book for sure! This book may be a great historical book but for parents buying this book for class reading ... beware! This book was on a list of books to chose from for group reading for my daughters Humanities class. The language (f bombs all over the place) and topics in this book are shocking for a school promoted book. Graphic discussions of rape, abortion & men having sex with trees is unacceptable 9th grade reading in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking, unforgettable, thrilling.","review":"Churchill could have been referring to the Spartans at Thermopylae when he spoke his immortal words about the RAF in the Battle of Britain. \\"Never have so many...\\" Steven Pressfield manages to elicit both awe and heartfelt gratitude for a handful of brutal warriors who sacrificed their lives on a remote battlefield 2500 years ago. It is both interesting and chilling to think what might have happened to Greece, to democracy and to our civilization if they had acted in a more \\"reasonable\\" way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to send shivers of admiration up your spine.","review":"Although I have read much involving ancient Greek history, I have never come across a work of historical fiction that did this subject justice. Until now. Pressfield takes you into the training camps and barracks of the Spartans, the greatest warriors who have ever lived. You feel what it must have been like to maintain yourself in absolutely peak fighting condition. The book explains how these men were taught to endure pain and keep fear under control. And Pressfield describes the battles the Spartans fought in a manner that brings home the horror and destruction that ensued when heavily armed phalanxes glittering with the sheen of burnished steel crashed together in mortal combat. His description of Spartan valor and discipline will send shivers of admiration up your spine. This is a man's book, and one you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful story telling of mans courage facing a known death","review":"This book literally transports you to the battlefield of Thermopylae where the reader camps with the 300 Spartans and their allies. The invading Persian Army will sweep across Greece unless valuable time is bought. The combat scenes are powerful, brutal and show the courage of men fighting for their homeland.The saga of brave men in conflict reminded me a great deal of the writings of Stephen Ambrose whose recent books about American soldiers in World War II showed us how men fighting for a cause they believe in can accomplish almost anything. This is a wonderful story that is well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual journey","review":"Steven Pressfield has brought souls to life here! I felt that Dienekes and Polynikes where looking over my shoulder as I read! This is done with NO sappy overindulgent characters. If you are looking for a technically excellent story which also will move you to tears and possibly enrich your faith, READ THIS BOOK. It helped me understand where the western world came from and why we are in real trouble today! \\"The opposite of fear is love\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood, Guts, Glory & Romance","review":"Gates of Fire is a book for all readers. Not just history, but about humanity. Non-stop action told in a suberb writing style. Even the ememies are likeable, or at least understandable. There isn't a way to improve upon the story, Steven Pressfield did it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets in historical fiction!","review":"I chanced on the authors latest work, Tides of War, a few weeks ago. Enjoying that novel, I decided to try the authors earlier work, Gates of Fire. What a find!The insights into Spartan mores, the deptiction of the characters, and in particular, the battle scenes, are among the most memorable I've come across. A long-time devotee of the \\"Sharpe's\\" series of novels, this was one of the few books whose narration and attention to detail equalled or exceeded those great tales.I've purchased this book as a gift, and recommended it to anyone I know who enjoys history, or simply a great rousing tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness at the gates","review":"I don't think I have to say much about this book, other than it has been one of the best reading experiences I've ever had. So much history, so much to learn from. There are so many pearls of wisdom in this book that are far deeper than face value, I can't mention just one in respect for them all. The Spartans were truly a noble bunch and I appreciate this fantastic novel for bringing them to light for me. Really should be common reading in all history classes. This book truly shows that situations don't change, but perhaps people do. We can learn a lot from the Spartans that might right our ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"There are plenty of reviews here which reveal the subject matter so I'll keep it short and sweet.This is a brilliant book and required reading by fans of historical fiction.End of story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.I have given numerous copies away as presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and Unsatisfying!","review":"I found the prose of this book extremely difficult to follow because of the--overuse of greek words, unfamiliar English words, extremely complex sentences, unabsorbing narrative, too much talking about and not enough showing what your talking about, excess of technical details beyond a layman's interest, sacrifice of genuine suspense for seemingly endless explanations of military subject matter, and much more. By page 65 I trashed the book, worn out by all of the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apalling","review":"What really, really scares me is that this piece of reactionary pseudo-history is highly rated among U.S. Army people. One would like to think that people who have the duty and privilege to defend democracy should be able to spot protofascims at its worst when it smacks them in the face. Not to mention the worst prose I've been exposed to in a long time. One of the worst books I've seen in my life if not the worst, and believe me, I've read some stinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the pooest written books I've read.","review":"I have been studing ancient warfare for five years and I find a history book more entertaining then this. This book remains entirely on the surface and never penetrating into any deeper meaning. The characters are too one dimensional and dry, the descriptions, except for the battle, are almost embarrassing to read. I'm sorry, but a star higher then one is just not suitable for this book, and I by no means care what other people say about how great it is; this book is poor.Where have all the great writers gone to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting culture, too much pro-war propaganda.","review":"I found the depiction of the Spartan culture to be interesting, though I can't say whether it was accurate or not. I did get really sick of the glorification of war throughout the novel. Any sympathy I might have had for the bravery of the defense of Thermopylae had long since evaporated after all the preceding rah-rah macho attitude about war. I wouldn't have minded if it were the *characters* who felt that killing was OK -- after all, this was a warrior culture -- but I felt that the author was really trying to proclaim that war is great, which really put me off.And, honestly, the story wasn't all that compelling. I didn't care much about the different characters, including the narrator, and I couldn't really keep them straight in my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not art.","review":"Someone bought this book for me because of my fascination with Spartan culture. I've always thought of the Spartans as little more than animals, personally, and think that out of all of Greece they seemed the furthest from being human in any real way. Pressfield practically worships these guys and it's obvious that your reading a book by someone who wants very badly to leave an impression on you, like a child telling you their favorite story. It's interesting in places, and the research is solid, but the story is forced and quite obviously not great art. I would only recomend this to either historical fiction buffs or people obsessed with this particular battle. If you want bad entertainment like this then go read 300 by Frank Miller, it's a comic version and not nearly this pretentious. If you want great art, look in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"The author is so committed to his rather weak trope -- that of a helot retelling the story -- that he fails to construct a compelling, or even competetant narrative. It IS a great story, but that doesn't save this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gates of FIre Review","review":"I am in the 9th grade and we had to read the book Gates of FIre. In this book there are 7 each individual tales about heroic warriors. Seven different books, seven different views. This book could be a really great book, but it isn't the kind of book I would read. I am not really into war books. This book I would mainly refer to guys from 9th grade and up. This book is graphic and goes isnto a lot of details. Bits and pieces of this book were pretty ok. I would recommend this book mainly for guys, although it would be pretty good for girls"},{"rating":"1","title":"No (n) sense","review":"As a novel this book might be interesting, however, anyone who writes a book about the battle of Thermopylae and allows a picture of a Roman soldier on it's cover does not know what he is writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, but too long, too many characters","review":"Have no doubt about it, Presser is a talented storyteller, but there are just so many characters that any reader can keep track of, and feel empathy with, in a single novel. I was trudging through at the end, sort of like a Spartan grinding my sheild against the pages before me, a reference you'll understand if you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book disappointed me. It is not written with the same quality as recent historical fiction like Cold Mountain, The Year of Jubilo, Gone for Soldiers, etc. Not to be recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome historical fiction","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. The point of view the story is told from gives you an interesting view of Spartan Society. The author makes you care about the characters, despite their numerous flaws and often harsh ways of thinking. This book makes one wonder what has happened to valor, discipline, and the love of one's country in our society today. I was sorry it ended-I tried not to read too much at once to make it last longer, but that didn't work. You can't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author authentically captures the bloody reality of war.","review":"The battle scenes come alive with gruesome detail as the author describes the battlefields and the men who die upon them. The story flows smoothly and despite the complexity of all the characters the author maintains direction and focus. You will not want to set this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spectacular","review":"This is the most extraordinary war novel I have ever read. The writing and dialouge are wonderful, and the visual nature of the novel is unparallelled. If you liked Killer Angels, if you liked Cold Mountain, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"A superb work of historical fiction. I consider myself fortunate to have read it, and put it down a better man than I was when I first picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read from start to finish!","review":"A fantastic book by Pressfield! The adventures, and misadventures, of the main character in this book go far beyond the Hellenic period and give valuable insight for the men and women of the Armed Forces or any of those that are ready to sacrifice for what we love. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"First person and so much more than just the battle!","review":"My husband recommended this book to me, and since he had never done that before I felt obligated to give it a shot. This is a book detailing so much more than just the battle scene. Following along with the narrator's life and struggles, listening in as the Spartan leaders discuss battle and politics, and being given glimpses into family life moves the story along. My favorite scene involves some of the narrator's hereos discussing what the opposite of fear is. The young mens' final conclusion is that women possess the opposite of fear when they fight against human nature and bravely see off their husbands and sons to battle, wishing for victory over their return. This is a great novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional action and moving human portraits","review":"This novel tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartan soldiers held off the entire Persian army until finally being destroyed. Told from the point of view of an imagined survivor, the story has the feel of real history infused with the immediacy of human feeling. We experience this historic clash in a more personal and particular way than one might imagine.A very exciting and moving book. A real pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"spartans","review":"I read this as a teenage girl, and i really liked it. I liked it because it was about people who overcame their odds. Even though they knew they were going to die, they went anyway. They were going to fight the prosperous Persians, who had a whole empire, and there were only 300 of them. The only thing i didnt like about it was that it had submissive female characters, and as a teenage girl i wanted to see stronger female characters, but it is by a man so i guess it's good for that. I also disliked that the main character wasnt really spartan himself, but a man from another place. But i eventually came to like him anyway, and i liked the fact that it was a story, instead of a HIstory, like some historical fiction i have read. It is like you are living back in that time, and there are real people with real hopes and dreams and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stark and memorable","review":"Writing in a spare, violent prose that reminds me of what I (almost) remember of the Attic Greek I once knew, Mr. Pressfield brings ancient Greece and, in particular, the Spartans and those tributary to them with shocking clarity.He has pulled off a technical tour de force, in making a period of history far removed from us seem once again fresh and in making us care as passionately as Xeo -- who wasn't even a Spartan born.This is a story of heroism. But it is also a story of discipline, of loyalty between fighting men and to a state. For a book as violent as this, it is also a story of profound caring, both among the characters of the story and the readers it draws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Puts life into the tale of the Spartans and their ways,at the most pivotal days of their civilization; being challenged by overwhelming force to submit their liberty to a foreign enemy. For those interested in this era for study; the view provided by the author will certainly give you a view of the times with excellent detail. Some comparisons I drew from contrasting our times with theirs are startling. You'll find your own I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Novel Of Battle of Thermopylae","review":"Riveting novel based on one of the critical moments in the history of Western Civilization. I am a Dentist in Denver Colorado, but it becomes apparent that Western Civilization would never have sprung from the cradle of Greece if the Persians had been sucessful during their campaign and invasion of southern Europe. Pressfield brilliantly captures many aspect of Spartan, Athenian, and Persian culture through the eyes of a servant. This is a difficult book to place down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gates of Fire","review":"The book was an excellent read. I enjoyed the writer's approach by telling the story from the perspective of a captured and wounded warrior. It was well done. Do not confuse this novel with a historically acccurate rendition of the event. Many details were clearly fabricated but remained entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"History, Geography, Vocabulary with a high body count.","review":"I got the title of this book from reading Lone Survivor. One of the Navy SEALS carried it with him. This is a similar story in that it is filled with bloody depictions of preparing for war and of fighting a losing cause. I read this book using an Atlas to find the places he was talking about. (Does anybody else do this?) You can learn a lot of geography that way. It brought back memories of a previous trip to Greece. The narrator is the lone survivor of the Battle of Thermoplae in 804 B.C. He is telling the tale to Xerxes, the king of Persia. Well-written and captivating reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Purchase!","review":"If you are interested in the Spartans and ancient Greece, buy this book. It's well worth the money. It will leave you wanting to know more about these amazing warriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story well told","review":"I'm not a fast reader, but I finished this one (400 pp. or so) the day after it arrived from Amazon. I've always had an interest in this battle, but when I saw the book was by Pressfield I had to have it. As soon as I finished \\"Gates\\" I re-read \\"The Legend of Bagger Vance\\" Pressfield's first novel, which deals with many of the same themes as \\"Gates.\\" You do not have to have a particular interest in Greek history, or in this battle, to enjoy the book. Pressfield just tells a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable insight into a uniquely martial people.","review":"Pressfield has done some fine research not only into the military and social history of the period and the peoples, but he provides an unusually perceptive insight into a uniquely martial people, the Spartans. In Gates of Fire, Pressfield has set a standard of hoplological understanding and excellence that few specialist non-fiction writers achieve, never mind novelists. We congratulate him on an excellent piece of work on the Greek warrior, the hoplite."},{"rating":"2","title":"An account of the creation of the warrior ethic","review":"Mr. Pressfield has rekindled in me the ideals that we in the military refer to as the \\"Warrior Ethic\\". He has captured what it truly means, and feels like to be a leader of men in battle. A moving account of the creation and destiny of a warrior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent if Simple at Times","review":"I agree with some reviewers that this is a great action novel. I'll also agree with those who say it has moments that are oddly man-focused, that go on and on about how physically fit soldier is or how stoic and wonderful he is. And indeed, as one mocking reviewer pointed out, there is a scene involving frat-boy humor in reference to a gigantic phallus.Still, this isn't the focus of the book by any means, instead, it's about stabbing and hacking and trampling the dead. Riveting battle scenes. I enjoyed it as a nail-biting adventure story, but not as a Homeric epic of east versus west or otherwise a grand literary triumph."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed....","review":"I was expecting a masterpiece....What did I miss? Every other review was great, I found the book so-so at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spiritual heir to Starship Troopers","review":"There's a pretty good novel in this book, swaddled in pages upon pages of simplistic political yammering about the greatness of the warrior ethic. The book raises some troubling questions about its rah-rah Spartan ethic - why, for example, should such a noble culture /need/ a squad of assassins to take care of internal dissidents - but doesn't bother to answer them. Instead, everything gets drenched in blood and rhetoric about how great it is to be a dead Spartan. When Pressfield abandons the demagoguery, the book is a pleasure to read. Unfortunately, that's only about a third of a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian","review":"Author has researched and imagined his topic well. I could have learned a lot. The situations are interesting, but characterization is regretfully superficial and the writing dull rather than vibrant or evocative. I gave up after a few chapters and donated the book to my local library. Young people might still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRYING TO COPY","review":"Presfiled tried here to copy David Gemmel's outstanding \\"LION OF MACEDON\\". But he didn't. Gemmel's book is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this one","review":"Two chapters in and that was that. Boring! It's still on the shelf with a bookmark for some desperate, rainy day without something better to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"I never read and have trouble finishing any book i try to start. This has changed the way i read! i will be buying everything this author produces!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most likely the best book I have ever read","review":"Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield is absolutely amazing. Though it is about a historical battle of which I already knew the outcome, it had a way of gripping me until the very end. I had once learned that the Spartans were cruel people of war, but after reading this book I see them with newly founded respect.Steven Pressfield gives the tale of the battle of Thermopylae humanity as he illustrates the hardships every Spartan went through to gain honor and protect his or her city. The characters he introduces are molded to absolute perfection, formed with incredible realism, almost forcing you to love each one.Magnificent and extremely moving, I recommend this book to even those who have never read ones based on war. More than anything, this book creates a historical, realistic image of how the Spartans lived as a people with profound benevolence and grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book nearly changed my life","review":"I had heard that this book was a great read especially for military types such as myself. I loved the history of it and he comradery that develops between the characters in the book. A must read for every soldier or history junkie."},{"rating":"2","title":"tonight we dine in hell!!!","review":"i was very impressed with the storytelling in this book. you are grabbed and held right from the beginning. some readers should be warned however, the detailed descriptions of battle may be too graphic. i am not a history buff, so i don't know the accuracy of the details but it makes for great reading!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"One of the best books I've read. Once you pick it up it's difficult to put down until finished. This is a book you have to read if interested in Greek military history. I've read it two or three times and each time is better than the first. Pressfield got it right with Gates of Fire, excellent work of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Read","review":"Considering there are 663 reviews and almost all of them are 4 or 5 there certainly isn't much I can add other than I just wanted to put another 5 out there. I read this book because I like \\"Killing Rommel\\" by Pressfield so much and the reviews were so good I thought I couldn't go wrong. I don't give out a lot of 5's but this deserved one. Pressfield is an amazing writer. I love historical novels and he is one of the best of that genre. The details are astounding. Thermopylae is undoubtably one of histories most famous battles. The Greek strategy was sound but even though they fought ferociously they eventually lost. It was certainly a strategic and tactical victory for the Persians. But the message here is more about what free men,fighting for their country and their freedom can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, great service !","review":"Was very satisfied with the value & fine service rendered.A pretty good book as well !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 300 made real","review":"This is an excellent book told by one of the squires of a Greek Knight. He must tell the tale to the Persian Xerxes before the squire dies of his wounds. A good fiction book that feels like it could have actually happened. A real joy to read, easy flow, and very much what it was like in those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to be a classic!","review":"Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\" is the best battlefield novel I have ever read, and is my all time favorite book. This is one of those novels that unfold like a movie. Except I doubt that you could ever capture this epic story on screen and do it justice. Pressfield's also gives his characters a chance to develop instead of being one dimensional like other adventure novels. That is what makes this story so much more tragic due to the emotional involvement you feel for these brave men.I also should mention Frank Miller's graphic novel \\"300\\" which is a brillant story about the battle for Thermopolye in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressfield at his best","review":"Steven Pressfield gives humanity to the real heroes who saved what we call Western Civilization as it stood at the brink of utter destruction on the eve of its birth. The Battle of Thermopylae is without doubt the most important battle in the history the West. Without their short but critical stand to the death, no other battle of European or American civilizations could have taken place. It is the cauldron in which many of our most basic and cherished notions of self and sacrifice are made manifest. Read it and understand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome book!","review":"I honestly belive that this is the best book I have ever read. Fiction that reads like fact. Characters that come alive, and move you through their actions. Of all the books I have read this is the only one I couldn't put down even for a second. Awsome!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work of Historical Fiction Ever","review":"\\"Gates of Fire\\" is a compelling, graphic look at the defense of Greece from the Persians by one of the greatest fighting forces of all time. Pressfield's fictionalizing some of the participants only makes the story that more powerful. Readers beware, you will invest a lot of emotional baggage into this. Be prepared to mourn these men, shed tears for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"How an undemoratic society fought to save freedom.","review":"The Spartan ideals of a society geared solely to produce warriors would seem to be at odds with modern views of freedom. Yet this society produced kings who fought beside their men and serfs who sacrificed themselves willingly on the battlefield of Thermopolaye. The battle scenes are grisly and fascinating. The author gives the Persians and their allies their due. They are brave men but they are slaves. Even as the Persians finish off the Spartans in this titanic battle you know they will lose later when they face the full might of the Spartan fighters."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gripping, literary tale of war and peace in ancient greece","review":"I loved this book and fully support the chorus of compliments that proceeded me. I would add couple of things: 1. it was interesting to learn about Spartan notions of Democracy and individual freedom; 2. readers who assume that the book, however literary, is basically a war story, or somesuch, are casting it too narrowly. Between its subtle characterizations (of both men and women), and meaty themes: love, freedom, redemption, family and society bonds, etc., it's a very rich reading experience. 3. that said, all the millions of people devoring Stephen Ambrose's books would love this one. Happy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparta outnobles Athens","review":"Fine research, a great story, and very able writing make this the best novels of ancient Greece since Mary Renault---and to my taste better. It is also one of the best tales of the warrior life. The blurb by Col. David Hackworth on the cover is earned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend brought to life","review":"As a young girl growing up in Greece, one of the most often told stories I heard was that of Leonidas and his 300 Spartans. I saw the grave marker and his enormous statue at Thermopylae for the first time when I was 5 years old. Since that day I have long for the impossible, to know the courageous men who layed down their lives against impossilbe odds for their country. Steven Pressfield's book brought them to life across millenia to once again fire my imagination and my great respect for their sense of honor and sacrifice to homeland."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this great story!!! Honor, Sacrifice, Humanity..","review":"I like historical fiction and political thrillers but this, by far, is my favorite book! I found myself actually getting wispy eyed when our brave heroes (Deinikes, Polynikes, Leonidas...) were hacked down in the name of honor, freedom, love of their fellow soldiers and the right to freely exist. Vividly told war stories and the thoughts and feelings of those great warriors who went through it all, up close and personal. I will be reading more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Xerxes, the Persians, the conscripts of conquered nations. Leonidas, the Spartans, the free Hellenes. The largest army ever created (up to that point) against free people who are students in being warriors and live to defend their land against those who dare take their freedom. The Greeks know they are on a suicide mission but see the bigger picture in their sacrifice that will make the Hellenic world their own, not as slaves of a despot. An titanic struggle that will determine the future of Europe, and in some cases, the world.I couldn't put this down. I loved the effect of using a double narrator and seeing how the war progressed while Xeo is telling his story to the Persians. The characters were very heroic, but also very real. They were people defending their homes in the way the Spartans knew how. The book showed the frailties of the heroes as well as their warrior spirit. And the narrative on the battle put me right in the middle of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great book","review":"I read a lot, and this book is one of my favorites that I have ever read. Even though we already know what happened at Thermopylae, Pressfield will keep you on the edge of your seat with his vivid descriptions and very human characters. These real life heroes, led by King Leonidas, jump off of the pages and you will feel like you are on the front lines fighting alongside them. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful. From the first page I was hooked by the captivating story. Gates of Fire was writen beautifully and wtih such detail I felt like I was right there. I loved how the characters were brought to life with pure emotion and heart. This was a terrific book and i would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting portrait of Spartan Life","review":"I was pleased with this book and the story it told of the battle of Thermopylae. What I found particularly interesting was how it brought the culture of Sparta to life. Pressfield affirms everything I had been told about the Spartans (namely, that the lived for nothing but war), but I came away respecting their way of life and seeing the humanity of their choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting at times, very interesting","review":"I am shocked at how so many reviewers are shocked at the good reviews this novel received. Who cares about historical accuracy. It is a novel after all. History is always always slanted. Does one actually expect a historical fiction author to relive the event? Throughout the novel I found myself amused, in awe at the training descriptions, captivated by such concrete battle scenes, and feeling for the characters. The chracters are all admirable in their own ways, each conveying the valor and vulnerabilities of human lives. All in all it was a rewarding read that sparked my interest in learning more of actual Spartan history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Inspiration","review":"Pressfield's novel is a joy to read. It contains all the elements needed to make a great book: detailed descriptions, believable characters, a vast array of emotions, and a story that sweeps the reader along. From the first page the reader is drawn into the everyday life and struggles of the Ancient Spartans. One can see their strengths, weaknesses, loves, disappointments, and determination. All in all an excellent work. Most importantly, however, the book inspires the reader (at least this one) to learn more. It instills in its audience a thirst for the history of the period, and it compels the reader to embark on his own quest to research what happened to these brave men and why. An excellent novel and a great inspiration to further reading and research. 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pressfield is he who knows of war and men","review":"Like Pressfield, I am also he who knows of war and men. I am a U.S. soldier who follows the code of the warrior, and I am also an ex-law enforcement officer and a mulitple black belt martial artist as well as a poet novelist. I am also a gay man who understands exactly how close the Greek warriors were to each other when they fought the foe.Pressfield has captured the closeness of the day and also nighttime face-to-face encounters of men who fight the wars that keep us free. This novel cannot be criticized for it is a greater work than the classics of yore. If you are a soldier or have other qualifications like I do then you will shiver and weep as you read this novel. After reading it you will stand at attention and give a perfect hand salute with tears in your eyes in honor of the Spartans who saved the western world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on Ancient Greece!","review":"I was really impressed by this novel! What I didn't realize when I was buying this was that the battle is just an anchor for the story. The book includes a very well-thought-out frame story about several intertwining lives in ancient Greece. It tells you not only about the individual warriors in the battle, but also how they came to be there, what motivated them to sacrifice themselves for the good of all their unappreciative Greek brethren. This book stirred up a lot of emotions, and was so well written I could empathize with many of the characters. It's definitely something you can use as a measuring stick with which to judge any other historical fiction you may read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good except when they weren't fighting","review":"Remarkable combat scenes. However, in between the fighting is some of the most awful dialogue and awkward artificial characters I've ever encountered in print. Ham-fisted attempts to show the development of bonds between characters, e.g., soldier-camp hilarity surrounding a massively well-endowed man. Lots of goo-goo-eyed admiration of male physique and heroism."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK ON THE COMMANDANT'S READING LIST","review":"I HAVE READ A COUPLE BOOKS FROM THE LIST THE MARINE CORPS PUTS OUT FOR KNOWLEDGE PURPOSES. THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD I WAS SURPRISED IT WAS ON THERE NO OFFENSE. IT WAS A VERY GOOD STORY AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY STRONG. I DO RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE AUTHOR THAT HE DID AN AWESOME JOB. I WOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THIS BOOK, THERE IS NOT ONE FLAW IN THE WAY THIS STORY IS WRITTEN, EVERYONE KNOWS HOW THE STORY ENDS B/C OF 300 BUT YOU WILL FEEL SO MUCH MORE CLOSURE WITH THIS BOOK THAN YOU DID AFTER WATCHING THAT MOVIE. AWESOME AWESOME STORY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"When I first picked up this book I thought it would be a simple gory book about the spartans (along with thousands of allied soldiers) driving back the massive Persian army at Thermopylae. The book simply put is so much more. The majority of the book is about Xeo, a squire of a spartan and his life and the lives of others through his eyes,weaving a fantastic, exhilarating and profound story about the people around him including famous spartan heros of Thermopylae down to lowly helots. Now matter you age, male or female I would absolutely suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing and Deeply Moving Book","review":"Maybe the best book I've read since Cold Mountain. It is a thoroughly engrossing story, based on the battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartan soldiers, along with other Greek allies, held off an overwhelming force of invading Persians for several days. The narrator of the book is Xeno, a battle squier who is the sole survivor of the Spartan force. Pressfield convincingly sheds light on the nature of friendship, bravery, fear, freedom, honor, the differences between the sexes, and above all, love- love of country (and one's city) and the brotherly/fatherly love between the Spartans. The first few pages, explaining how Xeno comes to be brough before the Persian king Xerxes, to whom he relates his story, may seem boring or more likely confusing to some, but persevere and you will be richly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said several hundred times already? Not much.Gates of Fire is one of my favorite books. The reader experiences life in the phalanx; tastes the dirt and the dust, hears the clang of shields and crunch of bone, smells the death. We're proud of the Spartans holding off the Persians who grossly outnumber them, and are particularly impressed at Leonidas who chose the narrow pass to make his stand using geography to offset his enemy's numerical superiority. We're horrified at the betrayal that costs The 300 their lives.Reading Gates of Fire is a gripping experience. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"A great read for warriors and those who wish to understand them. I highly recommend you add this to your reading library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, read it, and enjoy!","review":"Simply Excellent!! This book does for the Battle of Thermopylae what \\"Killer Angels\\" did for the Battle of Gettysburg. Pressman brings the Spartans to life and makes you feel what it was like to be in the line and to live the Spartan life. Buy it, read it, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate Depiction of Spartan Life and Warfare","review":"Steven Pressfield has written a historically accurate novel that captures the rigors of Spartan life, training, and ancient warfare. As a 30-year Army veteran with a combat tour in Vietnam followed by 13 years as a high school history teacher, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Gates of Fire.\\" My only criticism is that it was not entirely clear why only 300 Spartans went to Thermopylae. My understanding is that it was due to a religious festival which prevented deployment of the entire Spartan army and Leonidas was permitted to take only his personal bodyguard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid work","review":"Author did a great work conveying mindset of ancient worriers and heroes (both male and female) to the modern reader.This historically accurate work of fiction helped me to get a better understanding not only what happened at Thermopylae, but why and how Spartans did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel if you have the time to concentrate","review":"I wouldn't classify this as an easy read, however it's well worth the time if you have it.

It provides a biography of the most infamous pirates from an unusual perspective. Learn about Roman Pirates from the eyes of Julius Ceasear's slave. Read about Blackbeard from the man who killed him. Hear the story of crazy Captain Morgan from one of his first mates. Our kids (8, 6, and 4) loved the entertaining and informative tales. This was a great springboard into our homeschool pirate study. It left the kids curious and motivated to further research specific pirate biographies. The info in the margins added details about the pirate world. It is a fantastic biographical resource but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for an overview about pirate life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a 9 year old","review":"I bought this book for my son to practice his reading.

Joy is a fourteen year old entering high school. The freshman would like to find a boyfriend. She finds it difficult to focus on the school's Match Quiz because she has to give up her room to her great-uncle Max who has moved into her family's cramped New York City apartment with his old, super terrier after he had a stroke. Now Joy and her younger brother Nathan have to share his room along with his pet mice.This all adds to the tensions as one might imagine. Joy has a problem with her life long girlfriend, Maple, when she finds her love interest in Wade. Enter Max, Joy's age, who become close. As Uncle Max said, \\"A boy named Max couldn't be bad.\\"The story is a quick read. It is probably suited best for teens who can relate to the young characters in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oy, Joy!","review":"Oy, Joy! Reading this book, you will see just how a thirteen year old girl's life works. Joy, a normal girl who goes to a normal school in New York, has just the things any thirteen your old has...or wants---friends, talent, and a personal life. Joy lives in a world that seems to her complicated and detailed. With an annoying and obnoxious little brother, a best friend who is not allowed to do much because of her strict mother, an uncle who tries to go into other people's business, and many other interesting and unique people, life is like a roller coaster for her. Somehow, without losing friends or hope, she must find her way through a life full of challenges, danger, disappointment, and excitement. In my opinion, this book was good, having plenty of detail and a great plot. I'd recommend this book to anyone in between the age of ten years to teenagers, that is, if they're willing to drop everything and be sucked into the amazing story. Oy, Joy! I can't wait to read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"i couldnt even finish this book once i was half way through. i felt like i didnt identify or like the characters and i never sunk into the plot. it is one of the few books that i really did not enjoy at all.

With his two other books under my belt (Starter for 10 or A Question of Attraction in the US, his first novel, and One Day, his third novel), I found The Understudy a bit underwhelming in comparison. Make no mistake, it is still a good read, but some of characters in this novel are just not believable. A divorced actor making a deal with the superstar to cover his indiscretions and then falling in love with his wife are just too abstract to be reliable.Overall though i think the novel is still very entertaining but if you have to choose to read one of Nicholl's three novels, skip this one and go for One Day instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This is a fun read, although not deep and well short of One Day.

However, it only warms the towel where the towel touches a rail, and only on 1 side. If hanging more than 1 towel, the one on top does not warm.

The base was much wide than the warming rack, so it was not possible to screw these pieces together.It looked like I received two parts from different models, or from older and newer models.I think it reflects very poorly on the quality of this manufacturer that they wouldn't even bother to ensure that they were shipping a working product.Now, I've wasted time and have to re-pack this and drop it off at UPS. I hope Amazon reads these reviews and stops carrying products from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice","review":"Purchased the warmrails for my bathroom. I have oil rubbed bronze fixtures and have been looking for a towel warmer in that color for a couple of years. It looks really nice. It's not bulky and large so it doesn't take up a lot of space.

Even though this is a hefty outline, perhaps it would be better if they dedicated separate Schaum's outlines to each subject - statics and dynamics - and covered more ground in each subject rather than putting both subjects in the same book.

To my disappointment, I found that the original Conan has every feature to his character that I disliked magnified by a factor of 10!But, to be honest, what has turned me off with both books is both authors' use of language - it is as if they both sat with a thesaurus and looked for the macho words to substitute for the regular ones.

By hook and crook and bravery and some luck, he survives the English murderers who are trying to kill him and the treacherous Indians who are trying to kill him and enslave another tribe of Indians who have befriended him.Fast paced, a page turner, lots of makeshift ingenuity and a really appealing love story (but nothing explicit, so it's good for young adult readers, too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This excellent recording won Grand Prix Du Disc in 1953 and has no rivals till now as I think.Pirogov, Reizen, Ivanov, Lemeshev all are at top of their vocal and artistic form.

So I ordered this, like an idiot, without zooming in on the picture and reading the lable. Well guess what? This isn't dehydroepiandrosterone- or DHEA - as most of the world thinks of it. As far as I can tell it doesn't have ANY DHEA in it. Under the acronym it reads: Deep Hydrating Essential Aloe.

One states that Stalin wasn't really so bad, because he fought the Fascists; the other insists that Hitler wasn't really so bad, because he fought the Communists. Alan Bullock leaves both viewpoints in the dustheap of history, where they belong. Both Hitler and Stalin came as close to pure evil as human beings ever get; both stood for the utter repression of the human spirit and the annihilation of anyone who might possibly be suspected of standing in their way. Bullock demonstrates this in exhaustive, but never exhausting, detail. More people should read this book, if only to be cured forever of any temptation to support any form of totalitarianism, any time, anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"PARALLEL MONSTERS","review":"This is an excellent read for anyone interested in the lives of these 20th Century Monsters. I was particularly keen on learning about their worldviews and how they were shaped by historic events. For the most part Bullock does an excellent job here, jumping back between the two evil minds as they manuevered through European politics. The possibility that the two could have brushed shoulders in Vienna in 1913 is especially chilling.Sadly, though the book falls apart some during the crucial war years! Bullock abandons comparitive analyses here, and gives us a traditional WWII history, including little the history reader won't already know. He should have concentrated on the dictators themselves, and how they saw the conflict. Instead we get a textbook account of the European conflict. Still a fairly good job overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succeeds on both counts","review":"This is an excellent starting (or ending) point for anyone interested in either of these madmen, though the author seems willing to engage in a bit more speculation when it comes to Hitler. (Most likely because much more is known of Hitler.)I held back the last star because I felt the author fell in love with his own writing a bit, often substituting a less-known foreign phrase where a perfectly good English word would do just as well.This small criticism aside, this was excellent history."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of all: a terrific story","review":"The thing I wanted to add to these reviews is this is a really terrific story. It is written as the biography of two people but, in some sense, the two men are like opposite sides of the same coin. One was methodical, plodding, hard working and untouched by inspiration or intuition. The other was a dreamer, who avoided any sort of work, and who made decisions based largely on intuition. Yet both were outsiders, in a sense: homeless, and were mostly without intimate contact with other human beings. Finally, being outsiders and ... monsters, they spent their lives getting revenge on everyone else.Bullock tells the story of these to men. There are plenty of dates and stuff like that, but mostly, he develops the story of these two men. And it is a really interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"very big and detailed account, not needed for the general reader....do not buy that one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"Being a compilation, it has everything (well, almost) on it. And, as you might expect, a lot of it is not good. There are too many simple surf songs with motorcycle sounds to kick the song off or end it. And there are some awful vocals. Yes, the Endless Summer songs are there, but after that it gets thin. There is a lot of movie soundtrack music that is completely unmemorable. And after you hear them play \\"Cloudy\\" you'll never want to hear that song again (maybe you don't already!). I don't think its worth the price, even used, just to get the Endless Summer theme. Find it elsewhere if possible. The lead guitarist and main composer for this group, John Blakeley, is still recording and has a very nice album out,Tan Mantisthat is much more listenable than this album.

This was the one he wanted read to him every night after Christmas, to the exclusion of all his other books.

Lone dog goes out for an adventure, plays with other dogs, plays with cats and rabbits, then meets a lone boy, they buy meat together, cook meat together, then eat meat together. Then they go to sleep in the dog's house. A little odd, but my son liked it and asks for it a lot. My husband and I both were put off by it, though we tend to like quirky and meandering stories. But I guess if you really like meat, this is the perfect little book. If you're more into the idea of a lone dog going on adventures, look instead for Dominic by William Steig. It's a longer book, but really packs in the excitement. My son frequently asks for a new chapter of Dominic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mister dog smokes a pipe!!","review":"OK, so i give this book a bad review because on almost every single page, the dog smokes a pipe.

This book got lots of press attention when it was first published but it's simply not a serious work. Written in a supermarket tabloid style the author reaches many unfounded conclusions and \\"discovers\\" that General Sherman was right: \\"War is Hell\\". Along the way he seeks to prove that the war in the Pacific was a racial attack by the U.S. on the Japanese and that if the U.S. had been less evil we could have waged a much more kindly and gentle war. The authors careful selection of facts prearranged to support his far-fetched ideas fail to hold together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfactory","review":"Dower fails to prove that the war in the Pacific was a race war as he claims. He also fails to prove that the presence of racism caused men to fight harder in the pacific thus resulting in more casualties (and fails to prove that racism would cause one to fight harder). He fails tie his evidence together logicaly and tends to ramble. Some of his \\"evidence\\" of racism is pathetic, such as analogies comparing war to hunting. He seems to believe these analogies were confined to WWII in the Pacific but they were in fact present in WWI and in Europe during WWII (especially with air combat). War naturally lends itself quite well to hunting analogies on the tactical level and has nothing to do with racism. The presence of racism does not make WWII a race war. The worst part is Dower makes his bias rediculously obvious. He also understates Japanese atrocities and overstates Allied \\"atrocities\\". This book is a stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking - A Book to Be Considered","review":"As one can tell by the variety of opinions voiced in the other reviews, this is a thought provoking book. It is wonderfully researched and makes use of cultural history to tell a side of the story of the Pacific war that many would just as soon not think about. The fact that racial prejudices influenced what decisions were made by the commanders and the individuals who participated in this theater must be pondered by anyone who seriously wishes to understand the Pacific war and the aspects of human thought that were revealed by the war. This is an important work that must be considered, whether one agrees with the authors views or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-read for Asian-Americans (& others)","review":"After reading this book, it pains me to find it so seldom in bookstores, even on the West Coast.

Anyone who enjoyed \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" could appreciate this absorbing history book -- if only they knew it existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"War W/O Mercy is Lame","review":"This is about racial hatred between the Americans and Japanese in the Pacific in WWII. Racial hatred is Dowrer's default. Any thing that might be offensive to the Japanese, from propaganda to killing them, according to Dower, was racially motivated. There is even the suggestion that Americans didn't think bad enough of Germans. I have read a lot on WWII and found this thing pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"Even if the author's conclusions are valid (which as often as not, they are not), so what? Why do so many people insist on refracting everything through a prism of their own making? John Dower may be a pretty smart guy, but he has no credential for purporting to know more about the history of the Pacific war than the people who actually created that history. Their chronicles are ubiquitous, exhaustive, and remarkably consistent, and thoroughly at odds with most of Dower's contrived conclusions.Ride the zeitgeist ere it tramples you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unflinching Look At The Role of Racism in World War II","review":"Dower later wrote another great book, \\"Embracing Defeat,\\" about the US Occupation of Japan after WW II. This earlier work is a detailed and powerful examination of how racism on both sides had a major effect on the coming of war. Dower particularly points out institutional and legal racism in the United States, and in the League of Nations, that most Western histories of the Pacific War completely ignore. It is always easier to look at the other guy's sins and ignore our own. One way of doing this is by pretend that Pearl Harbor happened out of the blue, and that America and the European empires (that occupied almost all of Africa, and much of Asia at the time) did nothing to provoke an attack. Dower has the courage to look in the mirror, and asks other Americans to do the same. Otherwise, he says, the chances are good we will repeat past mistakes. The current tendency to demonize Moslems and Arabs is an obvious signal that he's right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!!!","review":"As the editor promised, reading this book is rather like listening to friends' travel tales over a big plate of sushi.

Brookstein's real genius here is that the book can bring a person from just a basic understanding of nanotechnology to posessing the knowledge necessary to make money in this often-confusing arena. The glossary of terms was an especially useful tool for the uninitiated, and is a good reference for anyone doing business in nanotech. But for me, the journey to a better understanding of how to make money in nanotech was rounded out by the business perspective. The book had the ability to show which kinds of nanotech companies will struggle to attract capital at the end of the day -- and more importantly -- which ones are true players that really have access to capital.

I honestly could not bring myself to use them in the tanning booth, because I have a hard time believing that they protect your eyes at all, compared to darker goggles that actually dim visible light.Maybe it is just paranoia, I don't know, but I think it's worth sacrificing a little goggle-cuteness in order to actually protect your eyes.

I suggest reading Dr. Aitken's \\"New Diet Revolution\\" and the \\"Paleolithic Prescription\\" by Eaton and Konner rather than Charles' book. Dr. Aitkens makes it very clear that sugar and refined carbohydrates have contributed to today's health ills, and accurately relates to the impact on insulin.

Unlike most diet and fitness books, it's a great read and Charles personal story is amazing.The program itself is the most user friendly I've ever seen, as well as increadably effective. It's simple to follow without any deprivation at all. I was so relieved to finally understand what foods our body actually evolved to eat, and because of that, that I could eat foods like steak, bacon and eggs without fear. In fact, eating those foods (and more), I lost 35 lbs. in 2 1/2 months, without counting or measuring anything and look better than I did in college! At 57, that's amazing.I was also pleased that it included over 200 tasty recipes keeping the diet interesting for me-- it was also like getting two books for the price of one.

Finally I can relax and not think about it anymore, and allow myself to enjoy a great variety of food. I'm even enjoying exercise more because I feel more in control. It's easier to stay in in control because I'm no longer depriving my self or eating the same things over and over.Something that was quite unexpected was that I became less bloated and started digesting food better. I didn't even know I was bloated or that my digestive system was out of wack!This is something that has giving me piece of mind because it's just a natural way of eating.

How can it be called their 'greatest hits' when it leaves out songs such as; 'Whistlin' Dixie', 'Way Down in Arkansas', 'Company of Cowards', and my favorite; 'This Ol' Riverboat'?

It has two major flaws in this regard. First, the bridge does not pass NETBIOS traffic, which means Windows file/print sharing won't work. You have to configure the bridge in \\"single client mode\\" for this to work. A single client does not qualify as a workgroup to my way of thinking. Second, clients connected to the bridge cannot get dynamic IP addresses from a DHCP server located on the other side of the wireless link. Static IP configuration must be used.On the positive side, the bridge does support WPA2-PSK security. Throughput seems to be very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter's rocking chair","review":"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter age 2.

Not a wow! show but always a few chuckles and a mild gratification. More than most shows can offer.

Essentially every book in the Famous Five series has a similar 'kids-crime' plot, but each has individual nuances, and the return to the island in this book makes it one of my more favourites.Enid Blyton has written some amazing stories, and I think that all kids should be treated to one or more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Wonderful, Delightful!","review":"This book is not really for kids but for the kid in all of us.

It is more of a children's book with lots of interactive pages. i was hoping it was an art book that would show pictures and photos of clothes made in a fairy like resemblance. it's more of a card making or paper crafting book put together with some model drawings to show you what it could look like on a person. the artistry isn't that advanced, just layers of dried flowers and leaves, laid flat, and cut to look like clothes. i flipped through it quickly and then gave it to my 4 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairie-Ality: The Fashion Collection","review":"The book has wonderful pictures, but other than sitting on a coffee table there isn't much use for it.

The thing is, the King records are album-based and very rarely do the songs have anywhere near their maximum impact in isolation. Furthermore, there are some wonderful albums not represented here, and King's worst album (Spider's Lullaby) has some tracks. This isn't really a King album, just a compilation put together by one of the labels that carried his stuff for a few years.Wanna rock out to some King? Start with Puppet Master--diehards don't always like it as much as the stuff from the 80s, but it's the most approachable King.

This loner with extraordinary skills is a one-man demolition crew and his character in this book is no exception. But the thing I admire the most about Mr. Pike is that he is a giant with a heart of gold. He always looks out for those in need. I love the character and love the books and cannot wait for the next one in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"This is the first novel from Robert Crais that I have read and I enjoyed reading it. Joe Pike is an interesting character, a bit strange and not exactly someone with an effervescent personality, but he was very different than your typical novel hero, and that's a good thing. The story itself is well done if a bit on the convoluted side. My guess is that the victim in the story is based on Paris Hilton, and I didn't find her to be very likeable. I also wasn't crazy about the possible love angle that the novel was brewing toward, but at least it never materialized. In all a good read.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing below average read","review":"The story is WEAK! It rest on us believing that the bad guys are trying to kill a traffic accident witness in order to protect a 'secret' relationship between a bad guy and a money launderer. It just is illogical that they'd go through all this just to discredit an eyewitness!! It's like killing a fly with a bazooka! To make matters worse the characters are flat and unappealing.

It just seemed to go in circles, the circles centered on a whifty Paris Hilton clone. Joe Pike's okay, but I'm a much bigger Elvis Cole fan. I really don't think Pike is strong enough as a character to merit a whole book. In any case, I found the plot uncompelling and the story just seemed to drift. Crais is an uneven writer: sometimes he's up, sometimes he's down. In this one, he's down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"This was my first Joe Pike and is likely to be my last. Not one likeable character, even Joe, to involve the reader.Joe keeps making really short sited decisions on what to do with the person he is protecting. Hey, how about flying with her to New York and living in a hotel for a few weeks? Too easy!The police are made out to be dumber than posts. Whenever things really jamb up, just bring on a new character with an easy solution.All together, a totally unrewarding experience. Try John Sandford for the right way to develop a macho character. Should have quit after the Kindle sample."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously disappointing","review":"After reading all of the Elvis Cole novels I thought a Joe Pike novel would be great fun. It isn't. Rather its about Joe babysitting a stupid society brat who is full of herself. She has to hide, has almost been killed a couple of times and she is still whining that she wants to go home. Joe makes her cut and dye her hair but lets her keep wearing her $500 jeans. Please give me a break. She runs off to dance half naked on a table in a bar showing the dolphin tattoo on her butt. Surely somebody has to recognize the halfwit. Joe however forgives her. This isn't the Joe Pike we have seen in earlier pages. Lastly Joe actually falls in love with this piece of trash. Perhaps Crais thought we wanted to see a kinder gentler dumber Joe. He was wrong. Oh finally the plot is garbage equal to the rest of this disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Pike is a supporting character","review":"Great supporting characters do not always make great lead characters. Joe Pike is a great supporting character, and one of the things that made him so is the sense of blank mystery he has in the earlier books by Robert Crais. Demystifying him, as happens to an extent here, makes him less impressive and less interesting.Elvis Cole, by contrast, is a better lead character than supporting character. The inner monologue that gives him so much life when he was the center of the book is here absent, and so we trade a lead character for a supporting one, and vice versa, and are worse off for both trades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality writing with a weak story","review":"The attraction to me of Crais' work is that he writes so well, and he carries that through at least in part, in The Watchman. However, this \\"Joe Pike\\" novel isn't told exclusively from Pike's point of view. There are several other characters who contribute to the story, filling-in what Joe Pike doesn't know at any given time. This is weak storytelling, and this comes through when Crais \\"tells\\", rather than \\"shows\\".The result is a weak read, far from the best (or even the usual) quality that Crais puts out. The story also lacks pace after the opening chapters, and this despite it being rather short. I won't spoil the read by revealing the plot, but suffice to say, the ultimate bad guy in the story is somewhat obvious early on and it is something of a cliche.It greives me to write this review, as I am a fan of Crais' work and have read most, if not all that he has done.I look forward to a return to form in future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one that thought this book was lame?","review":"I'm a huge fan of Detective, Spy, Ex-Military Hero type books, and really wanted to like this book because it was referred to me by a friend. However, it was one of the cheesiest books I've ever read. The characters are so transparent and artificial with one corny line after another. I couldn't help but think I was watching a tv show from the 80's that was cancelled after one uneventful season. The plot was pretty good, but again the description of the characters and the voice the author gave to each character was so completely lame and fake that it almost seemed as though the author was trying to write a spoof. I was really looking forward to starting another cool book series (like the Mitch Rapp - Vince Flynn; or Jon Smith - Covert One novels), but this will be the first and last Joe Pike book I ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This writer gets better and better","review":"Excellent book, right up there with the Jack Reacher novels.

I hope Mr. Crais writes more Joe Pike novels, I really thought it was a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Robert Crais and the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series. I preordered this and, when it arrived, I expected to stay up all night reading. Instead, I found myself falling asleep after just a few pages. After the adrenaline rush of the first gun battle, I was bored, bored, bored with this story. Having read all of the previous titles in the series, I can't say that I learned anything new about either Joe Pike or Elvis Cole. The psycho babble between Joe and Larkin seemed forced and completely unbelievable to me. I really regret paying for this in hardcover. If you are a diehard fan of the series and have to read the book, I strongly recommend borrowing it from the library. I rated the book two stars only because I have enjoyed Robert Crais' other work too much to slight him with just one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite elvis","review":"a good story with a great charecter but not as likeable as elvis the detective joe pike is better in supporting role than lead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I've read all of Mr. Crais's books, and for the most part have been quite happy with the characters and plots. This thing seems to be either the manifestation of writers block or a contractual obligation left too late. So all you Elvis and Joe fans, you have no problem with the fact the the female lead is a fictionalized Paris Hilton? Or what happens with her and the other characters (trying not to be a spoiler here). The whole point of these type of books is to get a couple of inetersting and familiar characters and have them have an adventure. in this one, you can't really believe their actions, and the plot seems to be thrown together around the bad premise. Whatever, the guy has written some really good ones like \\"Demolition Angel;\\" this seems completely throwaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you as it builds up","review":"Around page 100, I would have rated this just 3-4 stars. It ends up as a firm 5 by the end. There seem to me to be two distinct strands in thriller writing -- character builders and plot artists. Crais is more of a plotter than a character guy; I never quite get inside his two heroes, Pike and Cole -- they seem just a little artificial. But he is superb in plotting. What begins as a routine story line weaves, turns, double backs and grabs you to the last pages. He is a good stylist -- deft, brief and precise. He is also superb in his portrayals of violence and cruelty; you get a sense here of Pike's dissociation and his own detachment. The heroine -- Paris Hilton but without the intellect -- does not come alive for me; again, too artificial. The villains are shadows not realities. But, this is a minor point. The book works superbly. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, fast read","review":"I enjoy all the books written by Robert Crais and find the story lines to be engaging and a quick read.

Maybe less self-regard, and better writing next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big cliche","review":"As a longtime fan of Robert Crais who enjoys Joe Pike and Elvis Cole stories, I found this one disappointing in terms of writing, character development and plot. Any writer who can only come up with (as small as)\\"a postage stamp,\\" not once, but twice, is being lazy (and needs an editor). Similarly, as far as characters, our heroine's (would-be victim) development went about as far as a 15 second report on Entertainment Tonight. Gee, a sexy rich girl who's famous for being famous and whose father owns (among other things) hotels: Wonder who that could be? And, wow, the father has some nefarious business dealings himself!! Who'd have thought?

Primarily, for me, it was the plot. Too many characters that I found extremely hard to follow. The switching points of view didn't flow well either. Every character in this novel seemed to have a better understanding of what was going on with drug cartels and shaddy characters besides me and the girl which had nothing to do with understanding Joe.Do I have a better understanding of Joe? Sure.

You will learn just as much and get more recent product info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Overall the content of this book was lacking. It provided a very high level overview of the various products but information was not practical for actual shopping. A lot of it is due to the nature of consumer reports where they test just a few models - and there are so many models and they change so quickly in this industry that much of the information seemed dated. I later purchased the 'baby bargains' book and would HIGHLY recommend that over this one. Baby Bargains had manufacturer reviews that discussed things such as value for the money and customer service in addition to product reviews and consumer feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"we used for out first child and found it very useful. It is a good book and came in handy with a lot of the products we were looking at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"My wife and I bought the \\"pack\\" (both CR & Baby Bargins). We tried looking through CR first but, like the other comments, it's not like the mag. It gives you info like, \\"If your lifestyle is this, you should look for these characteristics in the product.\\" But it doesn't tell you what products. Baby Bargains is way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"I ordered this book after being overwhelmed at \\"Babies R Us\\" by all of the different items!!! My husband and I were searching for the best crib and had heard that this book could give us some answers. The book does a great job of giving tips for buying and where to find things. My only complaint is that some of the items are now outdated, as the book was published in 2004. We had no luck locating any of the recommended cribs and a different model (same brand) has replaced the top rated stroller. I wish that this book was updated yearly. Otherwise, it is a great resource for helping you understand what you should be looking for in a product. It has really helped my husband I find the perfect crib though we couldn't find the exact crib that was rated in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your money on an on-line subscription to Consumer Report","review":"Don't buy the book. Instead, get a membership to Consumer Reports web site for the latest info and reviews.I am a big fan of CR, but information changes, they re-evaluate products and recalls happen. It is easier to stay up-to-the minute with the CR web site. The book doesn't contain any info that is not on the web site and the latest info isn't in the book. Plus, with the online membership, you can access all their info, not just baby products.In terms of a book, get Baby Bargains by Denise & Alan Fields. Between CR and Baby Bargains - that is all you will need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"There are very few products actually reviewed in this book. In many cases, all the book does is list what's available without giving any ratings. The only really thorough chapters are on camera equipment; definitely not what I was looking for.Supposedly comes with \\"FREE\\" membership to Consumer Reports' website, but you have to enter a credit card number to get this \\"free\\" info!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY BABY BARGAINS INSTEAD!","review":"I ordered this book, glanced through it, and immediately returned it. I thought it would have ratings of specific brands, which it did -- but only of cameras & video cameras. On baby foods, it said, \\"ask your pediatrician.\\" It gave tips on what to look for on things like swings, car seats, and strollers, but didn't name good/better/best brands & models.I had already checked out Baby Bargains from the library, and had hoped that this book would be a nice supplement. Don't buy the Consumer Reports book! Baby Bargains has specific brand name recommendations, and was extremely helpful with everything. If you're looking for info. on what to buy for your baby, go with Baby Bargains. I can't say enough how uninformative I found this book. Save your money -- or better yet, buy Baby Bargains instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the reports","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. Very few of the items are actually reviewed, most don't have any listing of their features AND in the book they tell you the items that are reviewed CR didn't even evaluate themselves! A complete waste of $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book seems to promise a lot - who wants to pay for a subscription to all of Consumer Reports when all you want to know is what's the best product for your baby? That being said, the book promises a lot that it doesn't actually deliver on. There are ratings for items like strollers and car seats, but nothing on other essentials like high chairs, cribs and mattresses. The editors just tell you what they 'would' do IF they rated these items, and then go on to list several manufacturers and the prices. And they offer these gems of wisdom (paraphrased), 'Higher prices don't mean its necessarily better/safer, only that more expensive materials were used in the manufacturing.' It may be helpful to some people, but i found nothing that I couldn't glean from pregancy/child-care web sites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless - Get Baby Bargains Instead","review":"I purchased this book to augment Baby Bargains - what a waste.When the majority of the information is not in the handy ratings methodology their magazine uses - What's the point??It appears that they cobbled together a list of products and put in the manufacturers' descriptions in paragraph form along with the statement that they didn't review items in this category.I was deceived by the publisher - this was not a report by consumers or even their own people - this was just an advertisement for a bunch of baby products that was SOLD to me based on their \\"trusted\\" name.The truly disgusting part is that I paid them for this and they probably made money on the back-end from the manufacturers by charging them to be included in the book.Not only should you save your money, but you should question the impartiality of Consumer Reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this book along with Baby Bargains, and expected Consumer Reports to be the better book, as I'm a fan of their website and magazines. I assumed it would be packed with quantitative information and instead found short chapters mainly capped by a list of manufacturers, with product descriptions culled directly from the manufacturers. There is very little objective information on safety or any other factor. Try Baby Bargains instead - it's packed with great explanations of which features are important as well as ratings on EVERYTHING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big help in the baby superstore!","review":"I'm the father of four, so I've spent lots of time in the baby superstore and I can tell you from practical experience that Consumer Reports Best Baby Products is easy to read and provides tons of useful information on how to buy baby products. I much preferred it over Baby Bargains, which is a mess of information that's tough to decipher. And who knows what the authors' opinions are correct? What makes them experts? There's no comparison. Go with Consumer Reports baby buying guide. It's got a whole consumer products testing organization behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought","review":"i thought this book woudl give some color on the various baby products as well as provide some product info. it did neither. it was a lean description of outdated prodcuts and an incomplete list of products as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Having been a CR subscriber for years now, they were the first I turned to on recommendations for gear for our first baby. In the store, I never even bothered to open the book and look at it because I trusted that if it was written by CR, it had to be quality. When I got home and started leafing through it, I found that MANY sections had no recommendations at all. They simply listed different manufacturers of the products. This was not helpful information--I could've found this on any store's website. I highly recommend taking a look at Baby Bargains, by Denise & Alan Fields, instead. It is jam-packed with great information and is updated frequently to stay current. It has been infinitely more useful than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"As usual Consumer Reports has lots of useful information.

It's been three years now, and I've only moderatly stuck to the diet.

Pepper's and the Beach Boys' Pet Sound, the Raiders' Something Happening can be easily considered as one the masterpieces of the 60s. Wisely produced, composed and sung by leader Mark Linsay, the album shows an umparalled quality of songs hardly achieved in previous Raiders albums. Mark was by far the more talented Raider, and every song here is beautifully and carefully produced to give its best, from Too Much Talk, Happens Every Day, to the gems Burn Like a Candle, Observation From Flight 285, the hit Don't Take It So Hard or The Good Times, along with Yesterday one of the best 60s ballads.By 1968 it was clear the Raiders was not a garage band anymore. But this is by no means bad, it is great. From an experienced rock musician, take this advice: if you still do not have it, you do not know what you have been missing all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking the mold","review":"I was shocked when I read a negative review of this album where the reviewer said there weren't any hit singles from it. Well, the same goes for Sgt. Pepper, and like that, \\"Something Happening\\" is a fantastic album. This is where the Raiders made the transition from bubblegum pop to hard rock, and they deftly straddle both sides of that fence. Here, there's sappy stuff like \\"Happens Every Day\\" and \\"Observation from Flight 285\\" side by side with hard rockers like \\"Get out of my Mind\\" and \\"Communication.\\" In between, we've got perfect pop gems like \\"Too Much Talk,\\" \\"Burn Like a Candle\\" and the TV show themes. As much as I love the stuff with Fang, Drake & Smitty, this album is leaps and bounds ahead of \\"Spirit of '67.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful!!","review":"I AM a \\"Raiders Fan\\" but this album is NOT what you're looking for!

However, I find the music on the CD is more \\"Modern Classical\\" than I remember from the film. It could be rated on a par with John Williams or Karl Jenkins. Therefore all the more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Sound quality is a wee bit uneven as some tracks are quiet so turning up the sound for them, then makes it too loud for some of the other tacks. Its a CD that sits in a pile near my computer so that I can play it on my portable CD player when working on the computer and there's nothing of interest on the radio.

This album demonstrates Hisaishi's growth as a composer and truly ranks as his best. Meaning his best, being better than Mononoke with its quiet and longing tone and its simple melodies. They really work well with the exploits of little Chihiro and the strange ghost world where her adventures take place. I feel truly blessed that Hisaishi's work (along with Hayao Miyazaki's) is being showcased here in the States.

The movie and the soundtrack have become all time favourites in my book and I am positive you will do the same after seeing and hearing Spirited Away.

It has become a tradition, all of the kids sitting at the feet of our mother as she read the story, her voice flowing over the melody of the words. Often we wouldn't understand a phrase, but she would explain it how her mother had explained it and how the author himself had lovingly explained it to his daughter, my grandmother.

It was on his album \\"Dreamland,\\" but is available by the individual track, at least on iTunes, maybe on Amazon.

Two main problems: first, the protagonist is far too passive and mealy-mouthed, and an utterly unconvincing portrayal of a supposedly brilliant artist. And second, the alien civilization that he visits is very confusing, and facts about it are revelaed piecemeal and without enough context for the reader to be able to tell what really makes these creatures tick.

If the F/X are done by the 'Hellraiser' team, then they must have been having an off-day, not even F/X alone could save this 92 minutes. Is it horror, comedy, a B-movie??? It fails on all accounts.

The narrator is a teen who sounds like she is giving a high school report in front of her teacher.

The tape itself is only 23 minutes long. In between shots, they show teens on a stage blowing a kiss. Very bad, I would never expect to buy something of this horrible quality.

The commentary was horrific, she should definetly take some French lessons (the French people would be horrified) and throughout the whole video (only 22 minutes long)there was not ONE scene devoted to the eiffel tower, the most prominent landmark in the whole country!!

If you are not intending to swivel the tv to the left or right you could probably live with this.The tilt knob is the weakest link in this mount. Made of plastic, it's difficult to get it sufficiently tight to hold the tv at the desired angle while not overtightening (and breaking) the knob.My issues are not as a result of incorrect installation. It is easy to mount the bracket dead level with the aid of the inbuilt spirit level. If only the tv stayed that way once mounted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and use","review":"Like other people said, very easy to install. I originally bought a wall mount that didn't have space between the wall and the TV and couldn't use it because the wires wouldn't plug into the back.

In fact, a great number of concepts are clearer in Molecular Biology of the Cell... and vice-versa.

The chapters concerning the structure of the cell and of the organelles are amazing and include in-depth explanations.

I saw Mulgrew MIller playing with Woody Shaw and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in the early 80's. I said, this is one tall dude and he can really play (get it 'Wingspan'). I never bought any the albums where is he is leader until later. He is widely recorded as a sideman on so many good albums.But on this album he delivers tunes that stay in your mind. The band is cooking; Steve Wilson(sax) and Steve Nelson(vibes) have recorded with Mulgrew quite a bit. Mulgrew is clearly the leader, but the band members get to shine. I compare this album to 'Hand in Hand' which has similar instrumentation, but has more of a 'Hard Bop' feel. This album has plenty of authority, but the compositions and playing have a lighter more graceful touch. Overall, another outstanding album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulgrew....You Did It Again","review":"Since that fateful Carbondale, Illinois Autumn day in 1993, when I first heard Mulgrew Miller's \\"Hand in Hand\\" album, I have been in love with his music.Mulgrew Miller is an accomplished composer, arranger, performer and bandleader. The \\"Sequel\\" album is only the latest offering that displays Miller's complex style. I saw Miller play along side of Benny Golson at the 2001 Chicago Jazz Festival and I can tell you he is a treat to listen to.There is absolutely no filler on this album.

His radically revisionist examination of the combat record of the 1st Marine Division, a unit which lost no battles in either World War II or Korea, can only be termed baffling. More puzzling is his treatment of Marine training, which sustained almost half a million men through a series of savagely violent battles from Wake Island to Okinawa to Chosin Reservoir. Veterans like William Manchester and Eugene B. Sledge provide balanced, accurate analyses of USMC wartime training and its effect on the Marines in combat.

And for all I know is it is really not available in market/stores.3) The solar plates must be facing directly to sunlight. There are some instances that the AutoVent is not working because of the angle of sun rays.4) The strips are hardly to remove. If you set it up for the leftside of your car window, it should always be at the left side. if you choose to change the position to the right window, it is hard to remove the strips from the AutoVent to set it up for the right window.5) the AutoVent is not practical if you are installing it up if you are in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"It does not work unless you point it directly at the sun, and then not very well.

The only time I've actually seen the autovent work was when I took it out of the car and held the solar panel to the sun on a very bright day.This product is USELESS! If there is one measly cloud in the sky, or your car window is not 100% facing a very bright sun, the fan won't work and your car will be as hot as ever.

Weird.I'm glad they're marketing this as a 'ventilator' rather than something that cools the car. On sunny summer days, this is the best thing for airing out my car's interior. I never fuss with the window plastic; I just check the forecast for rain and plop only the fan part in the window. When I come back to my car, it smells like fresh air instead of a 6-year-old Mazda decorated in Taco Bell wrappers.How much of the freshness is based on the fact that my window is cracked open for the fan, I can't tell.

The plastic guards that are provided with the fan are meant to fill the \\"gap\\", but this renders the window unusable as the guards will fall out when you open it.PS - if you have a car with \\"auto close\\" power windows, this device will likely not work as the window has a pressure sensor to avoid trapping fingers and is triggered by the fan when trying to close the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"ineffective design","review":"The shipper and handling of the product was excellent, however, the product itself is not design to be effective.

This is not the case with \\"The Christopher Parkening Method Vol 1\\" Mr. Parkening\\" starts the beginning student with a solid base of technic and prepares the student for a well rounded course in concert guitar. This is a well paced and consistent method, teaching a well rounded technic. This method is not boring or overly academic. There is also a brief history of the classical guitar from its Spanish origans to international prominance. I highly recommand this method for the aspiring concert guitarist as well as for the teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the beginner's methods","review":"I think this is the best of the beginner's methods for classical guitar. Parkening starts out teaching how to hold the guitar and place your hands. Other primers miss many of these points that are so important for more advanced playing. He goes from there through the strings and first notes and then starts you out playing. If you stick with the book and practice diligently you move through incrementally more difficult pieces until you are playing real classical guitar. The version of The Catalonia Song included is still one of my favorite pieces. If you want to play classical guitar this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners and intermidiate guitar players","review":"The book has a fair amount of classical guitar music pieces.

I am re-learning classical guitar after a 25-year absence, and find this is a helpful book. Parkening takes you through the basics -- sitting position, notations and sight-reading in a clear and systematic manner, with a bit about music theory and scales. My primary book is the large Noad one, but I go into this one regularly for some pretty pieces by the usual suspects -- Carcassi, Giuliani, Beethoven -- pieces which are not in Noad.

I can now play a good little repertoire or songs without sending my wife running to get the ear plugs!

He said, \\"Dude, open that to any page. Read it out loud.\\" I got about two sentences out. Same thing on the next page, and the one after. Haven't laughed so hard since the \\"Shut Your %$# Face, Uncle @#$\\" song from the \\"South Park\\" movie. This book (and its partner, \\"Me Write Book\\") is that funny. Hell, the riff on Chewbacca is worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooooooookay","review":"Ummm, yeah, sure it was amusing in that sophomoric kinda way but you're not gonna die laughing or pee your pants. While it is worth going through once or twice, unfortunately you will forget all about this book within a week. The drawings are simplistic but fit perfectly into the style the author was going for. It is humorous but not over the top hilarious as some claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigfoot - Autobiography","review":"Sad very sad. The first page was funny but the rest of the book was just plain stupid. I find it difficult to believe any publisher would waste good paper on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"this bigfoot book is junk","review":"Welcome to the book with no point. This book is not clever, funny or consistent. The drawing style is ripped off from Ralph Steadman. If you are a fan of Bigfoot, do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my money","review":"I was so disappointed by this book, maybe I'm a prude but it's not necessary for their to be profanity in a book for it to be funny or entertaining. I bought this book for my 14 year old son for Christmas but after reading the book when it came in a decided not to give it to anyone. I don't even want people to know I have this trash in my house. I gave it one star because you have to give it something."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great","review":"If you are generally amused by the nonsensical and the odd, and enjoy brilliantly simple art, you'll probably love this book. Bigfoot narrates his life struggles and shares his wisdom in a caveman-like, though heartfelt manner complemented with Romieu's illustrations. Perfect for anyone who's in need of cheering up or wanting to have a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me Eat You Face","review":"THE funniest book ever. You could speak but me eat you face.

The other had me laughing out loud.I noticed that I did not crack even a smile on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but just OK.","review":"I actually thought this was a book-book when I bought it, but it took 5 minutes to read, at the most, and that's probably the most disappointing thing I have to report. I didn't realize this is essentially an adult's comic book.As far as its level of hilariousness, meh. I thought it was cute and I chortled a bit. It's not pants-peeing funny by any means. It's more like when you find a funny birthday card at Hallmark and you laugh and say \\"ha! that's cute.\\"Very disappointed that ten bucks has gone down the drain in such record time. I'll keep the book and put it out as decor in the guest room, but that's about the extent of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer end to a great career!","review":"Right off the bat, the 3 new tracks will blow you away. They have more of a death feel which is great. There's so much creative potential left in these guys its a shame they called it quits. But at least they went out on fire. I hadn't heard any of the material before Reborn, so this collection was a real treat for me. I found that as much as I love Fitzhugh's voice, DJ could definitely deliver. So now I'm gonna purchase the rest of LS' catalogue. Definite classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an American Band? Wow!","review":"Raleigh, NC Daylight Dies has surprised me to no end with this album. I thought dark, melodic, depressing and genuinely moving masterpieces come out only out of Sweden, Finland or England. Very heavy doom/death (?), never mind the labels, also very melodic, very original heartfelt melodies at that. This stuff is capable of seriously depressing the listener, but also has this beautiful, love/compassion/sadness mix of angelic quality to it, only opeth, katatonia, dark tranquillity or (also American) novembers doom invoke in me. Beautiful, beautiful, deeply moving stuff. But for all its beauty, it also offers a serious amount of aggressive metal. In a word: flawless cd not just for metal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"Why can't they just f'ing sing?!?!?!

While most music aficionadoes recognize \\"Please Come to Boston,\\" one of the most beautiful, haunting ballads of all times, they probably don't realize that the rest of the material from this album, which received next-to-no airplay, is gritty, garage style punk. I don't think that most people realize the debt that contemporary bands like Pavement and Hole owe to Dave Loggins, who was out criss-crossing the USA playing Indie Rock long before the term was coined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content good, writing quality poor","review":"I saw a UTube video with this missionary telling the story of his experiences. It was entertaining and delightful - in part due to his facial expressions and his particular brand of English. (He is Dutch) However, the book in an attempt to present the exact words of the missionary, fell far short of presenting the story in an engaging literary manner. It fell flat. The message is still there, but the grammar is poor and someone who did not understand the reason for this poor writing style might well wonder why they had paid any money at all for this book. Get the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz for Beginners (Me not Carla)","review":"If you, like me, don't know anything about jazz, but want to expand your music collection or give someone a gift, this album is a great place to start.

My husband thought we were having an earthquake and the dog was barking from alarm! It turned out that the leg/wheel of our bed had broken clean through one of the risers. Suddenly our bed was on a big tilt. Just to note, we are of average weight so it wasn't a factor in the break. Well, I can tell you that we won't buy another set of these!

The problem with this product is no structural support in the construction of the risers. After a few weeks, the riser cracks and the frame legs go right through the riser.

She is very sad because it takes her twice as long to do the work as the bigger fairies. The Queen fairy notices that Kasey is upset and gives her some advice. She tells her to ride Rhett, the dragonfly. He will help her work to go by much faster and easier. Since Kasey is much smaller than the other fairies she is the only one who is small enough to ride the dragonfly. The other fairies are very jealous of Kasey until they realize that they were kidnapped by an evil giant.Kasey winds up taking a stand and that she is her and Rhett's only hope. Kasey winds up realizing that she has more courage than she thought.This is a heartwarming story that has a good message and wonderful storyline.

This one, however, is sadly in need of a good editor who could have cut it down from around 600 pages to three.Everything is described in great detail, over two pages devoted to telling us how a minor character became a pimp, (as if we cared), pages of historical data printed in italics, and endless psychobabble of Parker's emotional problems with himself, his family and the world at large.The writing is good when it sticks to the action, but one part hard boiled detective (where it should have stayed),one part supernatural hokum, one part history and one part romance, equals a total mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going downhill!","review":"I have read nearly all of John Connolly's books and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. This book was utterly disappointing. I absolutely loved White Road and Every Dead Thing. They were books that I literally could not put down. However, Black Angel started out strong, but about one third of the way it fizzled and went flat! I had a hard time finishing it and by the end of the novel, I was so bored. Perhaps, Charlie Parker needs to be put out to the pasture. I didn't care about him or Rachel in this book. If John Connelly continues with the series, he needs to do Charlie justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Novel","review":"This is the first lead character Charlie Parker novel by Mr. Connolly that I have read. It won't be the last. This story works on several levels from the murder mystery plot to a more metaphysical tale. There are sections of this book as well written as anything I have ever read. The book is a page turner which also combines reflective content. I enjoyed both levels and expect to read more from Mr. Connolly. He combines writing talent with interesting research and thoughtful challenges to the conventional read. Well done, sir!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Angel","review":"John Connolly gets 5 stars from me for \\"The Black Angel\\".A real page turner, Mr.Connolly's style of writing and his characters kept me turning the page.This was not the first Charlie Parker mystery I have read but I think it is the best so far.

After use, agree with other reviews that this is superior to spring form pans as there are fewer parts to rust/break over time. A recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake was split between this pan and another 6*3 Parrish pan without the removable bottom (bottom of orher pan was covered with paper). Both the finished cakes were reasonably easy to remove despite the cakes being quite deep. Both pans are sturdy but light - I anticipate many years of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"It's hard to find a product like this in a smaller 6 inch size for the cost of this product and I am very happy with it.

This book portrays Judy as a horrible person who only lives to cause havoc in the lives of those she loves. Anyone who really knew Judy will tell you that nothing could be further from the truth.And what's with the story of Judy and Liza at the London Palladium? Judy did not try to sabotage or ridicule her daughter's efforts on stage. This is the problem with society, we take everything too literally. Liza merely said (with great humor and respect) that working with her mother was competition with enormous love and respect. Everyone present that night denied any friction between the two, and recall Judy's advice to pay their respects to Liza as well.Avoid this like the plague and make sure you don;t get it three times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old myths die hard.","review":"James Spada took an old myth and turned it into this shoddy book.

Immediately after placing the bag around my shoulder, and before I had a chance to clip the other strap, the main clip gave way sending my bag crashing to the concrete. The contents of the bag included my 15 inch iBook, and a notebook. Needless to say, I'm extremely dissatisfied with this product. As a result of the faulty clip mechanism, my laptop is now cracked on the left hand side. It's cracked in a place, and in a manner that I can plainly see will continue to worsen over time.

I was incredibly disappointed because it was so boring. I am an avid reader, and the truth is the ONLY way to read this is a page at a time, then set it down. I can't stand that. I want to keep reading, but there is not a general flow from page to page. THat having been said, if you are able to read a page and then sit back and contemplate, it's terrific, although I suggest having a general knowledge of what Taoism is before reading the ways in which it is applied. Why? Because it is applied to everything!

Why?First because this book changes the tone of the series and has zero joy anywhere inside it.Second because it's ending cheaply nullifies the journey of the heroine to pull the author out of the paradox he put himself into in the second (vastly superior) novel. Duncan is a masterful writer and after the first two novels he set expectations for this book very high.But mainly it is because the heroine is such a useless tool and you have to live with her for 300 pages! You have to try and evoke some sort of compassion for your main character, but in this book he failed miserably.His next book in this series, Paragon Lost, is due out in October 2002.

Well, I reread it a couple of weeks ago and I enjoyed it as much (possibly more) than I did the first time. I also enjoyed Lord of the Fire Lands (second in the series). Not as much as GC, though I was intrigued by the alternate ending. I think I missed Durendal (What a character!)....maybe I will like it better the second time around. I also was apprehensive about Sky of Swords due to some moderately bad press posted. However, Sky of Swords was excellent. Malinda evolved into a quite likable and courageous heroine and her Blades were almost on par with Wolfbiter and Quarrel (from The Gilded Chain). I enjoyed the time twists you used to make the story different than the usual fare. All the twists and turns were why I decided to read GC again. I'm currently reading The Reluctant Swordsman by Mr. Duncan and it is proving to be as good as I hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"Don't waste your money.

That said, I bought it anyway, to add it to my collection. There is a snowman alphabet sampler that is cute, but I'd really rather do the snowmen without the letters. There are the usual cutesy teddy bears, etc. Most of the designs would fall under the \\"cutesy\\" or \\"sweet\\" description. I hate to say it, but I've seen better designs.

There was a panel of several marriage counselors who themselves had been married a long time. The host was asking each to provide insights about keeping a relationship healthy. I was very impressed by Terrence Real's comments, and decided to read some of his work. I liked the book so much that I bought several copies to share with my adult children. I think his advice makes a lot of sense. Note: the book is for relationships that do not include violence or addictions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"The rules aren't as \\"new\\" as the title may suggest, though I am sure they will be new to many. There are many authors who, whether based on their own imagination or (as in Reals' case) clinical experience, have good answers to the question of how marriages can survive and flourish. What I particularly like about this book is that it does not condescend. Instead, Real points out that there are many assumptions we make in relationships, without realizing they are assumptions and without realizing they are not helpful assumptions. Something else useful about this book is that a couple does not need to be a couple whose marriage is on the brink of disaster, or a couple who is constantly fighting, for this book to be worthwhile. This is certainly a good read for anyone interested in either restoring or maintaining the health of their relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is so full of himself i could vomit","review":"It's hard to get past the shameless self-promotion- Real had one idea which proved popular (though for the life of me I don't know why anyone would find such confrontational manipulation healing) and he has parlayed it into a national business.

But the novel doesn't work as fiction. The characters are wooden and lack credibility; the dialogue is cliche-ridden and unconvincing. It reads exactly like a political tract masquerading as a novel. I never had the sense that the writer got INSIDE his characters and really felt them as individuals with unique desires and histories and quirks. I never got a sense of ANY of the characters really FEELING the horrifying and sad reality of what a runaway greenhouse effect would mean. Instead, it was as if they were all mouthpieces for the author.

More than halfway through the book, I found myself checking to see how many pages were left. I didn't care about these characters at all. The sympathy factor was at zero very early. They brought their circumstances upon themselves because they were selfish, illogical and horny. It was a stretch to find admirable qualities in these characters (Danielle was well-educated and did her job well... most of the time; Lisa was dedicated to her students; at least Sundi tried to make her stupid marriage work and I wished I could buy one of her baskets).

Get the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with this product","review":"I have had other Circulon products and have never had problem with them before. But this skillet set really dispointed me, so much that it prompted my very first product review ever.I used the skillet mostly for grilled cheese sandwitches. A couple of weeks after I started using the skillet, I noticed that the sides of the skillet started to accumulate sticky brown substance that's really hard to clean. I made extra effort to try to keep them clean, but I was losing the battle (and it shouldn't be this much work to keep non-stick cookwares clean). Two months later, the bottom of the skillet started to stick. I have never had any non-stick cookware that lasted such an short period of time.I do like the look and feel of this skillet - the deep sides makes the skillet more versatile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the performance","review":"I own many Circulon products, but most of which are under the Circulon 2 line. So when this 2 pack became available, I went ahead and purchased it. I have only used it to cook eggs on and I must say, I was sorely disappointed by the results. Not only did my eggs stick, but I used quite a bit of oil on the 2nd batch to make sure they wouldn't stick, but they still stuck. My Circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this non-stick version and doesn't stick!I'm not sure what I can use these skillets for now since my main intentions were for fish, eggs and items which have a tendency to stick to the pan. It also left a horrible look on the eggs like the kind on eggs cooked with a Teflon pan without oil even though I used quite a bit of oil.Highly disappointed and will not purchase the Circulon Elite line again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice!","review":"For the price, I thought these pans would be great because they were deep. But when I received them and opened the package, the FIRST thing i noticed, when I set the large pan on the cupboard if you slightly touch the handle (or knock it) it tips the handle toward the cupboard. The handle on the large pan is TOO heavy for the pan itself. I would not use the large pan with anything light weight being cooked in it (e.g., eggs). I consider this very UNSAFE and will be sending this item back no matter what the cost to return. I do not want an unsafe product. And, this is the worst of worst!

That person certainly was not in the lab (garage) where these pans were designed. Upon receiving the pans I immediately noted the weight and length of the handles...too long, too heavy. So I took the pans over to the cooktop and voila, the pans tipped. When I set them on the counter, the pans tipped. Good grief! So I packed them up and returned them. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"10-inch Pan WON\\"T BALANCE","review":"so I just got these pans, went to go cook, and the 10-inch one is not balanced and TIPS off the burner.

Very non stick, even heating and all I could look for in a 8\\" and 10\\" set.BUT THE 10\\" HAS A FATAL FLAW.The larger pan is terribly off balance with the handle being way too heavy for the pan causing it to OFTEN FLIP BACK AND FALL OFF THE STOVE.I have had this happen many times and have learned that there are few things scarier in the kitchen than a hot pan with hot oil falling off the stovetop. Thankfully, I'm usually able to catch and rebalance it - but not always.If it were for the fact that I fear for my feet and floor every time I cook, this would be a great pan.

I used them for two years and had no problems. They are non-sticky, well shaped and very scratch-resistant. But this Elite set is a disaster. It is VERY unstable and can overturn easily.

I will be eventually buying the bigger skillet and probably the 7 qt Dutch oven - as soon as I get enough gift cards!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Circulon non-stick skillet twin pack","review":"Overall these are nice sturdy deep pans with a better than average capacity due to the depth. The non-stick coating works well. My only complaint, as with others, is that the handle weighs more than the pan causing the pan, when empty, to tip in the direction of the handle. This may be a safety hazard for some. Once food has been added to the pan, it's not a problem, but if you are heating oil in the pan prior to sauteing, you should exercise caution to avoid spills or burns. It would also be nice if Circulon offered optional lids for these pans - in a pinch, a universal lid works."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN'T BE BEAT!!!","review":"These pans are GREAT!!!!Cook evenly and without any oils,butter or anything.Best I have ever cooked with.In time it is all I will own.EVERYONE should buy these.And you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbalances","review":"My new frypan falls off the hob.

Tell me, why did that need to be included in a children's encyclopedia?? Beyond my own dislike for it, my kids absolutely hated it. My 5 year old daughter, who LOVES all things \\"school\\", would cry and just be devastated when I pulled it out.

In the list of characters she writes that the Wolfe Tone the Irish revolutionary died in 1828 when in fact he slit his throat in 1798 after the failed uprising. Is this a mistake on her part or merely a typo? She also wrote that during the Boer War the Boers raised an army from among the native South Africans. If she meant whites born in South Africa this is true. If she meant blacks then this is completly false. The Boers would have fit in with the KKK and would never have fought alongside \\"kaffirs\\".

It won't be long before one of these parties comes to power and the Chinese/East Asian invasion of Europe and the U.S. will be halted. This book should be avoided.

With the right record company combined with Holland-Dozier-Holland, they would be right back at the TOP were they belong.The most dynamic group of the century.I also like The Temps, they still are great performers and have made many beautiful and soulful songs throughout the years and they have definitly earned their place in the music industry as well as in the hearts of the fans that love them.I've always looked at The Four Tops and The Temptations as being the two horses that pulled Motown! Both groups were here in Dayton,OH. in July of 1997 at The Phraze Pavillion and ENTERTAINED a packed sold out house. My wife and sons and neighbors really enjoyed ourselves. I still have the newspaper reveiw article from that great night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good teaser!!! Encore! Encore!","review":"Just not enough footage! But excellent just the same.

It is a scholarly overview of the process but for a do-able, step by step approach, I found it highly inferior to John Gross's \\"Fundamentals of Maintenance\\" - just because it is written in more difficult language does not make it a better book. Gross pointed out, and I agree, that people talk ABOUT preventative maintenance and the benefits for your company, but no one tells you how to actually set up a department or actual procedures. This is that type of a book - all research and very little actual, personal experience.

She talked about with great praise by other classic authors but her poetry is unknown to modern audiences. This book makes the point that the what exists of Sappho's poems/songs are really just fragments. In many cases only a few words exist with little or no context. The broken nature of these fragments is reinforced in the text by the use of blank space on the pages. The only problem is, I can't get over the feeling that I've paid for a full book and gotten a lot of blank pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best since..........","review":"Death Metal or Hate Campaign. This album is much better than Where Iron Crosses grow. Lot faster, more melody, Lyrics are dark and depressing as hell. Songs are structured better than WICG.

Phantoms of the Oath is an amazing Instrumental that has excellent melodies all the way through and what crazy is the best song is the very last one Where No Ghost Is Holy!!!!!! This song has their most catchy melody and riffs since Collection By Blood or Patrol 17. Its so fast and catchy. Its amazing these guys can keep coming up with these kinda riffs after all these years.Buy this NOW!!

If you are thinking about purchasing this book, do it! The author gives the reader a wonderful tour through some neighborhoods that the average guide might not touch (like my great old neighbourhood of Comely Bank). I'm sure reading the book before going to Edinburgh would still be wonderful - but for one who has walked her streets for years and misses her dearly, the book brings back the thoughts, sights and smells that make the city great."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD is too short!!!","review":"Ten songs -- barely 30 minutes on a compact disc that can hold nearly 80 minutes?? What a rip-off. No matter how great the material is (and it's all great here), music buyers should avoid this at all costs. A decent anthology would have AT LEAST 20 songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy!","review":"The songs on this album are all polished gems, and a good selection of the \\"best\\". This is perhaps the most cleanly listenable and universally appealing collection of their songs, and I have found even my non-celtic-music-listening friends enjoy these songs and feel the attraction of these great musicians and style of music on the very first listen. This is really a collection of some of their best-known (and here, best-sung) tunes. It is shorter than many of their other albums, but for the much smaller price, and for these fantastic songs, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good complation","review":"If you are new to the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem then I would suggest a complation like this to you. There are better ones out there, but this is an okay one to start with. If you are a true fan and are sick of all the complations, then DON'T get this one. Send a petition to Columbia Records demanding that they release the original LP's to CD!Two years later, I'm deciding to edit this review. Not only did Columbia issue this pointless complation, but they screwed with the original sound mix. When comparing this Cd to the original LP's, there is added reverb (echo). Nothing irritates me more then when a remastering engineer thinks they can improve on the original recordings in some way, such as by adding stereo reverb to mono recordings or ruining them with noise reduction. Columbia/Legacy, shame on you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A grand exposition of the Gospel","review":"If you need to hear God's unconditional yes, then this is the book for you. Paulson does an amazing job expositing Luther's main point in theology, Christ for sinners!

Paulson's crediential as a Systematics professor suggested he'd be able to explain Luther pretty well. I was disappointed.What did Luther mean by Sola Scriptura? Is James (an epistle of straw, said Luther) scripture, or not? Or is scripture only what Luther says it is? Or?If free will doesn't exist, why do people have to make choices? Or are those choices simply illusions - a camouflage for fate? Or a manifestation of our sins? Paulson doesn't say.After plowing through most of the book, most of which came off like a commercial for Lutheranism, or worse, a polemic, I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost useless","review":"Theology-wise it is way-way-way over the head of a lay person like me and I am sure it is way-way-way below respectable level for the professionals in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want something worthy of Luther's work look elsewhere","review":"Hands down the worst book on Luther...or theology for that matter...I have ever read. I am not one to submit critical comments but after reading 3/4 of this book I couldn't take it any longer. This book seems less a serious study of Luther - his life and teaching - and more of a forum for the author to ponticifate his own beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a door stop","review":"John Mortimer is a wonderful English author. My husband is a great fan of his work. I read of this book this summer in England and when I returned home I rushed to buy it.My husband hated it!

His mother should have taught him not to discuss politics in polite society.It is really a dreadful book. Only useful as a door stop on a windy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"For what it may be worth","review":"I read a little of this book and then found that I just didn't want to waste my time reading any more. And it sounded so interesting in the NYTimes review! I feel this book is pure garbage. He seems to be under the impression that every thought and memory which flits through his head is of great value. Just as power corrupts, fame insufflates the ego - unless you have the supreme wisdom to resist it. I read halfway thru another book called something like 'the delights of aging'. It was just as disappointing. And I'm aging. Are there any books which genuinely make you believe aging isn't as bad as it feels? Like that music isn't as bad as it sounds? Maybe self-delusion is the only way to joyfully tolerate the whips and scorns. Maybe that's Mortimer's real message here - message by example."},{"rating":"1","title":"70's Music revolution","review":"This is a great CD that contains songs from both Orchestra Lipua Lipua and Les Kamale featuring the great singer, Nyboma Muan'Dido.All the songs are fantastic.

I totally agree. Gordon Smith provides an unconventional, but highly Biblical approach to God's will and leading our lives. His emphasis on vocation rather than work or tasks, challenges many of the basic pillars of life people believe today. Yet he substantiates these differing views with solid evidence from the Bible. Especially helpful is the discussion on transitions through stages of life and the vital issues that must be addressed to make these transitions successful.This book is a must read and applies to people in all stages of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little science, lots of conjecture","review":"My biggest disappointment with this book is that it is represented as \\"a good walk through the science of golf\\". The author is very comfortable citing other works but gives no data to support his own conclusions. He statement that the hands should be substantially ahead at impact is not supported at all. Don't mind that he has an opinion but if he states it as fact he should be able to back it up.There are many other books for me to spend my money on, wish I had done so in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Watch out!

Alas, this was not worth the wait (sorry, Amazon editorial reviewer). It's essentially just another serial killer outing, setting notwithstanding, with all the cliches of that tired genre. When the character who will obviously be the next victim is introduced, I groaned. I hoped for a twist or two, but no. A serious disappointment and inferior to at least 100 of the 211 other books I've read this year, including those by William Lashner, John Lawton, Jacqueline Winspear (author of another post-WWI series), Daniel Silva, and the ever-wonderful Donna Leon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blood-dimmed Tide\\", Rennie Airth, Mystery","review":"What a read! An extraordinary writer - that I just recently discovered after reading his first book, \\"River of Darkness\\". Deeply compassionate with a disturbing sub-current that reminded me of the research work of 19th century psychiatrist Krafft Ebbing's, \\"Psychopathia Sexualis\\".However, it took over two weeks to arrive (perhaps because it was a used $4.00 book), in very good condition. As a matter-of-fact I had almost completely forgotten about it. So, ironically, I was happily surprised to see it show up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, long-awaited sequel","review":"As a huge fan of Airth's first novel, A River of Darkness, I was severely disappointed with this second John Madden mystery. The author hampers Madden's involvement by having him retire from Scotland Yard to manage a farm in Surrey with his family. His contribution to this mystery, which involves a brutal child killer, is thus marginal at best. He finds one of the first bodies and deals with the killer at the end, but other detectives, associated with Madden in the previous book, do most of the sleuthing. Airth creates a really nasty killer in this outing, and the unveiling of his true identity is a treat. Nevertheless, I wanted more John Madden, and any reader of this book would have to agree that his presence was surely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival - no fix date in sight","review":"Junk.

He details not only the history of Cambodia, the role of Buddhism, the influence of Cambodian culture and the impact of Marxism and anticommunism along with US and French imperialism in the rise and fall of Pol Pot, but also how useless it is to make all sorts of moral judgements about the man and his deeds (they were objectively terrible and criminal) without a great deal of knowledge about Cambodian society.Several things stand out: 1. Pol Pot and his followers had about as much to do with Marxism as Jesus had to do with the policies of Nero, 2. that both the US and China have dirty hands in all of this, 3. and that Pol Pot never thought he had ever done anything morally wrong.

If you're new to role playing games or are less then lever 30 and don't have to be spoon-fed information, buy the book.

Granted it stops giviing mission info past level 5, and doesn't really appeal to the higher level people, but does it really need to? The whole point of any Final Fantasy is exploring and finding things out on your own. This guide shines most with the craft skills such as cooking, goldsmithing, clothcraft and so on. If you want to know a food effect, this guide will tell you. It will also help you if you're just starting out. Most of the race/job recommendations make sense, and you'll have some help with your first few quests and missions. This wasn't meant to be a hand-holder through this game. Just a tool to help you out with some of the more confusing points, as well as getting new players started on the right foot.

He hasn't changed his basic hillbilly orientation in over 45 years in the upper ranks of the country music pantheon, and it looks like he never will. This simple, unpretentious collection of songs sounds just like his old stuff from the early '70s, calculated but heartfelt, corny but cool. As the title implies, the arrangements are pretty down to earth, but really not that much different than any of his classic work. Porter's getting on in years, but still has a great voice, not nearly as creaky or fragile as any number of his contemporaries. The guy's still got it, and this album ranks right up there with anything he's ever done. By the way, Willie Nelson guests on a couple of tunes, and these two veterans sound pretty simpatico.

Begin takes you into this underground world that reads with the excitment of a ficticious novel. Every reader will come away inspired by the charasmatic leader.

Begin was a modest, courageous leader dedicated to achieving freedom for the Jewish people in the land of Israel. Time and again he made decisions which overcame his own narrow interest and served the people of Israel. One was in his decision not to fight back after the attack on the Atalena. Years later in events outside the scope of this book Begin in opposition backed the government fully in decisions of great weight and moment, such as the taking of the Old City in 1967 or the operation in Entebbe in 1976 . Here he tells of a troubled time in Jewish history when a desperate people struggled to realize a two thousand year old dream of restoring Jewish sovereignty in the land of Israel.

Too many words were translated wrongly by man and important lessons have been lost in translation.For example, try to find \\"the apple\\" in Genesis that Eve supposedly ate. There is no apple mentioned because she did not eat one. She was \\"wholly seduced\\" by the serpent...

I thought it was good imagination, and most likely the weapon of future combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read while there","review":"I was in HOng KOng while I read this and that was great fun - reading about the places and sites that I was seeing. I've read a bunch of Jake Graftons and this was just a nice read. Not great but fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jake Grafton Makes Smooth Transition Ashore","review":"Stephen Coonts proves he is more than equal to the task of maintaining the Jake Grafton character as he ages and moves away from the cockpit and the flight deck. This story harkens back to the tone and the pace that Coonts set with Under Siege, another book that found Jake Grafton ashore. Coonts works in some old characters, an exotic locale and some pretty good observations on the looming political/cultural struggles in China. He also weaves in some good comparisons to present day Hong Kong and life the way it was under British rule. There is enough high-tech stuff here to satisfy the techno-thriller reader, but it is paralleled by some good character portraits and an expansion of the character of Jake's wife, Callie. All in all a very satisfiable addition to the Jake Grafton series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"See Storyline above.This, in my opinion,is one of those rare 5 star books. It packs a ton of action with an outstanding locale. You'll actually find yourself cheering for the good guys with enthusiasm. The two different plots in the book are weaved together with a fine touch. Jake Grafton must rescue his wife from a greedy criminal while at the same time rebels are trying to overrun the communists. This is one heck of a good read, and if action is on your list, don't miss this one.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coonts Weakest Novel - Exciting but Flawed","review":"This book drew my attention because it combined my interest in Asia (including China) with the excitement that I knew from other Stephen Coonts novels featuring Jake Crafton. The book is exciting but it lacks depth. Many have noticed the factual errors but it should certainly not be read as a realistic account of China. There are some truths in the book but over all it misses the actual situation. A revolution as presented in this book is no longer realistic, if it ever was. But taken as a fictional novel, it attempts to cross the border between the realistic and the fantastic. However, this is not Coonts type of novel and thus he is unable to leave his realistic style. Thus the book remains uneven and is not worth the money. Buy another book from Stephen Coonts instead! He knows how to make a story exciting without making you feel uneasy as in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Hong Kong Dollars","review":"Yuck. For a better story, better writing, better research, better everything about Hong Kong and espionage, read The Honourable Schoolboy by John LeCarre. Coonts should stick to writing about warfighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial violence","review":"Coons' tale of revolution in Hong Kong is slow to start and drags throughout. His robot-infested violence may be innovative but such violence does not substitute for conflict between characters that we care about. I forced myself to speed-read through the book and in the end wished that all characters were dead and that the robots ruled. Quite unengaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robots and mechanical flying bats???","review":"This was my first Grafton novel (and my first Coonts novel for that matter) so maybe I am not versed in this author style of storytelling. Everything was going great until I got to the part about the fighting robots and mechanical flying bats. It just seemed like the easy way out to give the upperhand to the rebels. Furthermore, the ending sucked.The reason I bought the book was because the premise intrigued me: a Chinese revolution started in Hong Kong by conspiring Americans and Chinese dissidents. This topic should be taken up by another author of this genre, but this time make it believable (i.e. leaving the robots out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robots are too much.","review":"This book started out fairly well, but then those darn York robots started showing up. I was looking for a novel that included some spying and flying - instead I got science fiction and an old admiral who handles himself like a 30 year old CIA-trained killer.I normally love this guy's books, but this one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It's a really nice LCD screen, don't have much to complain, the only negative thing about this TV is it's audio, the speakers taht comes with it isn't so great, but if you have a home surrounding theater system then it'd make this TV perfect. oh and the design of the remote controller looks really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome LCD for price (No HDMI)","review":"This LCD TV is very good for what you pay, you wont regret it if you purchase one. I've had mine for over 6months and have not had a single problem. I did not give it a 5 star because of the lack of HDMI connection. It does 1080i/720p/480.Cons - 1- No HDMI connection2- Speakers on TV don't go that loud(should not be a problem with a sourround sound system)3- Remote control is ok (looks cheap)Besides those cons, the TV is great and you should not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"I love the picture and the features of this television.

They lost something like 70 per cent of their seats. This must be partly due to the fact that British Christians are upset with their anti-Christian legislation. This book is helpful in understanding what kind of anti-Christian legislation Britian passed. I would assume that this book had a force in toppling British Labour in local elections. British politicians must realize that British Christians are fed up with anti-Christian legislation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for the People","review":"There are a few books out there which unashamedly champion the cause of the average Christian -- which I consider myself. It seems like liberal theologians are more interested in supporting Jewish causes than Christian ones. There seems to be a lack of courage among Christian leaders in the church -- both lay leaders and clergy -- to stand up to Jews who have done America so much wrong and forced anti-Christian legislation on us. I found this book helpful because it taught from the Bible the correct attitude toward Christian loyalty to Christ. This kind of teaching is missing from many churches today and that is why there are so many problems -- such as the homosexual clergy in the Epicopalian Church USA. Just yesterday, 3 gay priests ran to be a bishop! What is American Christianity coming to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Holy War?","review":"I bought this in a local Barnes and Noble bookstore and was astonished by it. I guess the astonishment is part shock and part amazement. I was impressed by the author's bravery in tackling the concept of Christian Holy War. I know it's a historic concept in the experience of Christians, but not many talk about it in today's political correct culture. And I was shocked by the way he bravely described real life scenarios and what Christians are supposed to do. I found it slight uncomfortable at first that he thought police and army should be released from their allegiance to local governments if they oppose Christ and the Body of Christ. But upon thinking about the issues a further and reading the Bible with the ideas of the book in mind, I came to realize, he is espousing the precise point that Jesus had when He preached about the Kingdom of Christ. I would recommend this book to all who think seriously about Christian commitments in today's confused world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jungle Journey for Parents and Kids","review":"This beautifully illustrated book by McIntyre and Henderson serves as a guidebook for parents and children alike who are struggling with the tauma of loss. Best read together, the book provides a trail map for parents and children who may be struggling to understanding the progression of feelings associated with loss of a friend or loved one. With map in hand, the journey can be far less troubling.

In the mix, Victorinox adds two features that are new and not extremely common. They have an LED light which is activated by squeezing the knife in the right place. This featurs is particularly picante when trying to find the slot for your ignition key in the car.The second feature of particular value is the inclusion of a pen. With this Swiss Army knife on your keychain, you never have to worry about not having a pen again. That is a big relief when you are in a tight spot for a pen.All knife users should have one in the glove compartment or on their keychain. It rates very high for usefully, and the utility per dollar ratio is one with very high results."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Indispensable","review":"I keep this on my keychain. It's a tool I can't live without. Being a dude, I didn't have a way to carry a pen all the time. The pen in this knife is awkward to write with with a full set of keys, but you get used to it. The little red light is surprisingly bright. I've never had the pen run out on me. One note: the casing breaks after a few years of use. It would be nice to see an all metal version or a carbon casing. Otherwise, this is a solid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware flimsy","review":"I have owned many Victorinox knives and ordered as a gift for my daughter assuming it would be a solid tool. It is an expensive little gimmick and seems flimsy compared to their other knives. I was surprised how small it is and should have read the product description more carefully. The slender little blade can hardly be called a knife. I suppose this would be fine as a key chain weight but don't be fooled into thinking it is a real tool. I will instead order the \\"Compact\\" or \\"Huntsman plus\\" model which have larger blades and larger pens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, introspective, brilliant, unique","review":"This album is truly a work of art.

His descriptions are that of an outsider looking in; the result is that his ethnic characters don't really seem to represent their cultures. For example, Hortense is not a typical Portuguese girl growing up in the Valley in the 1930's. In the '30's (and up into the 50's even) Portuguese girls were always chaperoned on their dates; they weren't prone to using the profanity Hortense uses and they were unlikely to go into town with an unsupervised group of friends. The characterization of the Italian and Japanese families rings equally false."},{"rating":"2","title":"resto","review":"Good info for general automotive interior work.

Be aware, buying in bulk is not always the least expensive choice!The reason I used the phrase \\"coerced... into buying this brand!\\" is that the pharmacist who was making an excellant product had to stop making it at a reasonable cost due to Mucinex's patent infringement threats.

The FDA pulled those products from the market. However, I took the generic versions for years and they also worked great. With the others out of the way Mucinex makers can charge what they want.

The captions here try to point out what type of uniform the soldiers are wearing, half the time, the photo is too distant to see what the author is talking about.The quality of the color photos are poor- very yellowish tint on about 1/3 of them.This is a book strictly for beginners for an intro into tank warfare from 1918-1999.

Set in a private clinic for tuberculosis, Limbo Tower describes three long days in the lives of the hospital patients and staff. The days (Wednesday through Friday) are meandering - long bouts of ham-fisted philosophy punctuated with the occasional burst of sputum-related death. The patients wrestle with their impending doom, the staff wrestle with one another (or, more accurately, wrestle with wanting to wrestle with one another) and the reader wrestles with the urge to set the book down and go take a nap instead.Gresham's quest to write a great book prevents him from writing a good one. Although the setting abounds with juicy pulp material (an unseen political boss, a once-seen mistress, a love triangle,...) the characters merely stagger from page to page, woefully describing their perpetual conflict with god/life/love/manhood and death. Especially death.Also, there is poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spying for America","review":"This book is a most excellent read.

It would be permissible to copy the historical fact, but when the old myths and conjecture of past researchers are repeated here as well, along with the fact, that is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelente","review":"Hello good evening, excellent product quality, comfortable, nice, good wreck 100% recommend them very beautiful, I gusta.soy of Venezuela v"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Useful Reference","review":"In the introduction, Luttwak states that 'The Dictionary of Modern War' is really more of an encyclopedia. This book is full of definitions and short discussions of thousands of military platforms and tactical/strategic concepts.For readers unfamiliar with the military this book will provide a wealth of information. A more knowledgeable reader will probably know the concepts and terms discussed(Airland Battle, Screening, etc.), but will still find this book useful for information about weapons platforms, which are discussed thoroughly, including many obscure/unusual weapons of war.This book is not without fault; its nomenclature is inconsistent, referring to weapons sometimes by number(M60, aka the Patton) and sometimes by name(Abrams, aka the M1). This book has a highly extensive section on nuclear weapons and terminology.Overall this is a good reference work, with valuable information for dilettantes and serious students of war alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Researched","review":"This book is a good refference for subjects pertaining to modern warfare, whether they be equipment, tactics, specifications, etc. Even though the book was written in 1990 the vast majority of the topics discussed play an active role around the world today. Very useful and descriptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera","review":"I listened to this on audiobook. It was great Spanish practice. As far a literary value however, it was disappointing. It felt like a soap opera, with an implausibly large amount of highly implausible events happening to the characters without any motivation. In the last third of the book especially I found my self muttering \\"Really?!??\\" every few minutes. The ending touch was the worst - it was built up throughout the book, and maybe intended as a tip of the hat to the South American magic realists, but it just felt ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starter book","review":"This is the first Blacksmith book that I have purchased, and I havne't been disapointed. In fact I am pleased that I bought the book every time I go back and open it up (which I do quite a bit). It's rich with detailed illustrations by the author, and full of historical information about the 19th century smith, some of which is presented in a story-like fashion.I have used this book for references, ideas for projects, and of course building a forge. The chapters on building a forge and a leather lung bellows is fantastic and better than most books on the subject.

This book was the text for her course. My wife and I took the course in the late 50's. Each session required reading several chapters (10?) of the bible and at the following session there would be a 4 question quiz on the material in those chapters. Her husband, I believe was Sim I McMillen who wrote \\"None of These Diseases.\\"The book offers a conservative understanding of the Bible.A Bible survey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, great regional flavor - one mistake in research","review":"This series tickles me almost as much as the PennDutch series. Different flavor, same nutritional values. I howled over the nightmare in the opening scene where our heroine is forced to drink diet pop instead of sweet tea and threatened with cornbread that has sugar in it. One mistake caught my eye. The Biltmore has not ever been and is not now a public property. It is owned by the grandson of the man who built it. It is run as a very much for profit business. They (the Cecil family, Bill's momma was Cornelia Vanderbilt)pride themselves that they have never received a penny of either state or federal funding to keep the old pile from falling down. Of course, some of the things they have done in the way of maintenance would make a curator cringe but that's their business. At any rate - Ms. Myer really should have verified that piece of information before going to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to its potential","review":"Although I normally find this an entertaining and fun series, this book was a disappointment. It was setting up to be a cozy \\"locked-door\\" mystery, when it suddenly took a turn in a different and inexplicable direction.

Author of the classic, \\"Once a Runner,\\" Parker promises marked improvement and PR's, backed up by enthusiastic testimonials. I eagerly followed his 12 week training plan to the letter, achieving 45-55 mile training weeks without injury or fatigue and increasing my cardiovascular fitness with a drop in resting heart rate to 45. Unfortunately, my 5K race pace slowed considerably as a result. All the easy running in the program made the hard training days feel much harder and converted me into a slower runner. This form of training just may not be suitable for every \\"compleat\\" idiot runner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes so much sense.","review":"This book is a very easy read (I read it in about 2 hours) with a common sense approach.

As I saw lots of 5 stars for the book I decided to buy it. In my opinion it asks too much of the runner. I reached a point where I dreaded to run on certain days because of the book. My rest heart rate was 51 and my maximum heart rate was 199. Even at novice level I had to run at 85% several times for 400 yards or 800 yards. I think it is a must to use a heart rate monitor but don't use the programs the author suggests.

Parker is totally different. This guide is hilarious and may end up being the most useful book on training that I've ever purchased. The schedules that Parker outlines range from novice athlete to those intended for the serious competitor.

They had fallen out of fashion because they had had a bubblegum hit 'mr sun, mr moon' obviously they weren't smart enough to realize that even the beatles had a few of those.

What lies within thought is not anything quite as catchy. Most tips are briefly touched upon without going into more in depth detail. The book seems to be written for single women and even goes as far as to give tips on obtaining and keeping men. Which is out of the subject title boundaries. If the tips were good, I might have been ok with that. The tips were poor, one example being don't have too neat of an apartment because men don't like that. Better advice - just be yourself rather that worrying whether your apartment is too neat. Most men, from my experience, really don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"If I could I would have given this book no stars. The title is the best thing about this book.

This stoller pushes easily, has a good sized storage basket and folds easily. It looks great too, and I get a lot of compliments on it. The infant seat snaps in, which is great when your baby is little. I also really like the boot. It is great in cold weather and makes the stroller look like a carriage. Another nice feature is the reversible handle. I do think that the stoller is a bit heavy, but it is a full size stroller so I didn't expect it to be light. I also think it is a bit hard to steer when the handle is reversed, but I still like that feature. This stoller has many features of really pricey stollers like the Bugaboo, but is more resonable. Overall, I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for casual play","review":"My boyfriend has been wanting to teach me how to play chess, but neither of us had a set, so I got him this one for his birthday.

A great selection for beginners and casual players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set, board has a design flaw","review":"I purchased this for my 4 year old son who likes to play chess. The pieces are a good weight, sit well on the board and are a nice size for a child. They have good detail as well. The board is a very good size and a very nice smooth finish. It has a flip locking mechanism to keep the board closed. However, the hinges keep the board from lying perfectly flat. It is raised up and the board seperates slightly. My kids don't seem to notice but it should be mentioned. Overall, I can recommend this set to anyone.

Not worth the money and quality not anything to rave about. Very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very light pieces, Board made of very thin wood","review":"A few reviews touch on this, but the weight of the pieces in this set is really an issue for me. I bought this set for my young daughter, and despite the other reviews, I thought \\"Well, how light could the pieces really be?\\" Turns out they are very light, and for young children this can be an issue as they are easily knocked over (the chess pieces, and probably the children too).The board itself is very light and thin as well. There are a few blemishes here and there. Collectively, even at this low price, I would not recommend purchasing this chess set.

I think the rating is more for the service.We can't return the item because the box was damaged. I can't contact the amazon or ace sports and outdoor just to ask them if they can replace the missing part.

Still the same awesome song.2) \\"Don't Call Home\\" - features some of the sickest guitar sound ever recorded.3) \\"Safari\\" - Great dynamics and arrangement compliment a top-notch song about ... well, as is often the case I have no idea what Kim is singing about, but it's all immensely catchy.4) \\"So Sad About Us\\" - a brilliant choice of an obscure Who song.

I also liked the way any hard words in each poem are listed below each poem with their definitions.There are also good illustrations for everyone of the poems.

While the pictures capture some of the parks' essence, they are very depressing. 90% are shots of forlorn fans that look like they are watching a last place team, when in fact this was a first place team.

Apparently that wasn't important information to impart.By midway through this FOUR HOUR epic, I was thinking 'why doesn't she just die allready?'. By the end I was hoping that I would die, something, just so long as it was over. Watching this film is, in and of itself, an act of masachism.

It has much better padding than the line 6, \\"cheap sponge\\" kind of cushioning, Gator uses dense foam. The most significant thing is, the Gator case has much much hardier strap joints.I am referring the the metal things that connect the shoulder strap to the case, like a sling. The Line 6 bag is so weak, any additional weight or rigorous usage, and it will bend and break. This is because Line 6 uses some kind of Mild-steel, which is soft.

It just feels cheap.\\" But as soon as I played a song AT 75% VOLUME, there was few, if not, no bass whatsoever. Sounded muggy and unclear. Oh, and another thing. The right ear had a buzzy noise to it. I think I got a used pair. I returned them right when I got it. IT was that bad. So I invested in a top of the line Audio Technica M50's.

While the static does go away after beating the thing up, it will come back and you have to beat it up some more. The cord is cheap and has to sit just right to avoid getting sound from just one side.After messing with the cord and beating the cup against your palm they do sound pretty decent. They are not too heavy for a normal persons head and your ears go inside of the cups so there is isolation without the ear pain that is common with those headsets that just sit on top of your earsAll in all, these headphones have turned me against buying any Behringer headsets in the future.

My Panasonic headphones that are 10 years old (29.99) blow these away. These headphones are heavy on the bass and its distored bass mind you. They have very little mid range capability. The highs are completely missing alltogether. Maybe if you turn your treble all the way up you can hear vocals but I doubt it. My advice buy the Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset for the occasional gamer/music listener. These Plantronics have a well balanced sound good enough for the occasional user.

I know they have good ratings elswhere, but you shouldn't get fooled by them. You also shouldn't get fooled by the fact that these headphones look big. They are big, however, the speaker itself is less than 2 inches across. The wires are also very thin. They are connected crudely and weakly, which led to the headphones' death, in my case.

Then after I decide to use them for an hour (using Ableton), the right side snaps apart/cracks. I had to return them. The irony is I got them as a 2nd pair to keep around in case my nice MDR-700dj's give out one night. Here I never used the HPS3000 and they fell apart. More like POS3000.

They appear to be fairly sturdy, but I've only used them for an hour, so don't put too much stock in that assessment. They are not the most comfortable things in the world, to be sure. I have a fairly large head, and from what I can tell, the portion of the headset that actually wraps over the top of the head is not adjustable. You can extend the length of the set around the ear portion, which helps some, but I wish I could adjust the width at the top. They seem fairly heavy, but I don't have a great reference point. I'm just looking to use them with use on my receiver for late night movies (can't wake the wife and child). Also, my ears feel like they're getting pretty dang hot. Maybe i just have hot ears. I dunno.Despite some of the drawbacks, I would buy them again at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad fit, so-so craftsmanship","review":"I've bought a fair number of headphones over the last couple years. Lately, I've had a run of headphones with poor quality. This headphone set seems to be of OK quality. The sound clarity is good. But, the size is terrible. These headphones are very narrow, and the band is very stiff. So, after wearing them for a little while, they feel like having a clamp applied to your head. Also, due to how heavy the headphones are, adjusting them to a larger size where the band doesn't touch your head does not work. The headphones are heavy enough that they will sink down and bend the tops of your ears down.It's a shame really. A few minor changes to their construction, and they'd be very good headphones. So close, yet so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely awful","review":"These headphones I would compare to the cheap $9 pair you might buy at a drug store. They are not meant to use for anything that requires being able to hear at any volume level. They may look like better headphones but they are flimsy and the audio quality is awful. If you are in a loud room forget trying to use them because the audio level can't get up loud enough to hear anything.

These are purely throw away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product. . .for a day.","review":"Headphones uncerimoniously quit working after one day of use at my PC.

The quality is acceptable and I have no complaints in the materials, construction, or sound quality. But as for studio...One would expect a set of studio headphones to isolate and cut out any outside sound or noise. NOT SO with these headphones. The little ring of black slots you see in the picture are just that; SLOTS.

As you would expect from \\"studio\\" monitors, These products have a marvelous frequency response. If you are looking for an even spread of your highs and lows, then this is a product for you. The only statement I feel obligated to bring up is that these headphones DO NOT have an emphasis on bass like \\"Beats by Dr. Dre\\" studio headphones. If you desire that the bass is more prevalent, you must make that adjustment from the output source itself. I have tried these headphones on my laptop, tablet, smartphone, and both of my zunes.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"One thing you can't beat Amazon on is selection. Finding a pair of headphones to keep the windows from rattling while I practice my bass was difficult in brick and mortar stores.

Unless you're on a really tight budget, if you plan to use headphones mostly to listen to music, you might want to try something like the Sony MDR-XD400 or the Audio-Technica ATH-M40fs, which are still very reasonably priced (well under $100). But the Behringers have a nice, balanced sound. They're fine for listening to TV and video games (and even music, if you're not too fussy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily competes with headphones 6 and 7 times the price","review":"These headphones are excellent. I have had sony 7506s, audio technicas and others and they easily hang with the $100 plus range. They have detailed mids and low mids, are not scooped and are not fatiguing. I am always surprised when I hear an old song I like on these and hear new detailes in the mix I haven't heard before on any other monitoring system - speakers or headphones. I do professional studio work and use these to check mixes, for tracking and for clients. They sound natural, not hyped anywhere and just well articulated. As a frame of reference, I have several pairs of studio monitors (Tannoy Precisions and Reveals, Hafler, KRK and have owned Events, Mackie, Behringer, and others). And obviously at this price, they are being given away. The only drawback is the spatial/stereo imaging which does not wow. Also, below 100Hz is a bit light.

One reason for this is the use of original compositions, not remakes of \\"guns of Navarone\\", etc. (The only exception to the rule is their sublime, beautiful updating of \\"Candle Light\\", a doo-wop tune from the 1940s.) Another reason is King Tubby, who added dubs of two tunes and dubbed the title track in monumental style. The result is an album that serves as a musical crossroads of Jamaica in the mid-70s: roots reggae performed with a jazz/ska lyricism and inflection.

Unfortunately, the entire top row of display elements have stopped working making it a little awkward for timing anything. I changed the batteries and it didn't help so I can only assume a hardware problem. Not a good sign for something that just sat around for a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great timer!","review":"I use my timer for nearly everything:reading time,kid's showers,time-out,baking,exercising etc......It is the most durable timer I have ever bought!Before this timer,I would replace timers an average of once a month!!!!My Polder traffic light timer has been working for over a year!Highly recommended-I own 5 of these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The digital display of my timer just stopped working after 6 months! Poor quality as mentioned in other reviews. I will have to move on to another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set, big numbers, good price","review":"I just got this item today and so far I like it. The good features are the large size of the digits, the fact that it's easy to set, and the price. I do think a couple things could be better: the feature for it to sit on a table-top at an angle is one of the reasons I purchased it, but it's not angled up enough to really see the digits without being on top of it. Still it's nice that you can set it on a table, or flip the piece down in the back and stick it to something with the magnet. The other thing that could be better are the lights that come on when there is a certain amount of time left on the timer- -while a nice feature, the only one you can see well is the green light that goes on when there is 1 minute left. The other two lights are harder to see. All-in-all a decent timer for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, low quality","review":"This is my SECOND of these timers for the kitchen.

So I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first, but did not last","review":"We purchased this timer just over four months ago, it worked great until this week when the display stopped working. Only part of the first number displays, making it useless once you set the timer for over 10 minutes. The timer has also begun to beep at random times when it is not even in use (this was first noticed in the middle of the night). The beeping has continued to occur in spite of replacing the batteries. I would not recommend purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty","review":"Easy to use. I use it to time presentations (make sure they stay within the time allotted). It's helpful that it keeps the original setting, so I don't have to enter the same time over and over.

They were never dropped, abused or misused; they simply stop working. It's too bad, because the design and functionality is quite good while it worked.We've since bought a LUX CU100Lux CU100 Digital Count Up/Down Timer, White, and have been very pleased with both its design and durability.

Its super easy to maneuver and fold, but what good does that do when your kid is sliding out of it because the seat is too angled and shallow? I adjusted my 2 year old by plopping her butt back in the seat as far as it would go, but with the seat cover, and any other bundle type cover the seat becomes a fabric slide. The between-the-legs section of the harness was digging so hard into her just to hold her in! I wish i would have noticed that the seat part was only as wide (deep) as my hand. Major disappointment, cause i thought i found the best stroller. The Twin Traveller doesn't seem to have this problem and it comes with the weather boots as well - go for that one instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the other reviews!!!

Please don't be discouraged after the other reviews!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful stroller","review":"Great stroller. My 3 year old fell in love with it in the store and insisted we push her around the store in it. My newborn fits safely in with the seat reclined and all 5 restraints. We took both girls to the aquarium on day 5 and 7 of the newborn's life and both loved the stroller. It manuevers easily and has great sun visors. Also, the stroller folds up easily and compactly and fits easily in our car. One thing we miss are the trays for snacks and drinks, but understand it wouldn't fold so easily with those and have opted for the snap-on ones instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"The mounts are easy to put up and hold nicely.

Mr Hatmann and colleagues have produced a superb document on how power is usurping justice and the common good in the age of corporative monopoly. Having heard the brilliant and articulate author on Australian radio speaking to issues raised in his \\"Unequal Protection\\", I had high expectations of this book. I wasn't disappointed. Complex issues are treated with intelligent simplicity,directness and respectful detail. Ingenious visuals capture the essence of the real issues facing a US gazing into the bottomless blue hole of pap television and syndicated media trivia while the noblest of America's traditions and commitments are carried off for re-wording or the junkyard. Reading this book is a pleasure and an education. For educators like me, it is a most valuable resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Eloquent and Amazing.","review":"I found this book at a small boutique, picked it up and stood there for 30 minutes reading it before I realized I was entranced. A lot of the concepts in this book were not new to me but the way they were organized and presented was new to me. It was clear and made sense. Very well done. I am on Amazon.com ordering 2 copies to send to friends. This is must have information.

For a mac person this is complicated to make it work on Windows --- in addition to reformatting this drive, special software needs to be installed to make it work with windows.It must use two ports in order to operate: a USB port to supply power and another port (USB, Firewire 400, Firewire 800) for data.To make a long story short, I bought the 3 additional portable drives that I needed from WesternDigital --- their Passport drives are smaller, use only one USB port and work on both macs and windows right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different drive","review":"The drive's performance via USB 2.0 for read and write is way below par for other drives in this price range.I've tested this drive on my Mac Book Pro and WIndows XP machines and on both platforms, the drive is much slower than my other external drives(G-Drive minis).It seems that the extra slow 5400 RPM hard drives in this enclosure causes a real performance hit.I have also experienced on multiple occassions, that the drive didn't actually successfuly copy files over.

It's even smaller than it looks and extremely light-weight. I use the FireWire 800 connection primarily with my PowerBook for photo editing and it is incredibly fast. I've always been impressed with LaCie's design, engineering and reliability.

The rubber bumper is removable/replaceable and actually feels good in your hand. I read reviews it was pretty cheap but to me it looks good, it keeps the hard drive from slipping on hard surfaces.Transfer speed is pretty good; actually, faster than using the USB in a Windows laptop. The only bad thing is that it will require two USBs on some computers, one for data transfer and one for power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I have had this drive for about one year. It works exactly as advertised, plug and play. No muss no fuss- plug in a SINGLE USB or FW cable (other reviews are wrong about multiple wires) and you have an extra 160 GB. I have dropped it and fallen off my bike with it in my messenger bag. I went to the doctor but it didn't. It is formatted for MAC. If you run windoz you will need to figure out how to reformat it. That should take about 10 min. There are probably faster drives around, BUT... it is easy to find in the dark and you won't drop it in the shower due to its slippery case!

Ya it's got rubber around it, so what, it's designed by a designer not a user. I would make it bomber not beautiful. Any way I bought a G-drive, works great and fast.

Before that, it was great. 160GB, highly reliable and very portable. However one morning I plugged it into my Macbook and it wasn't recognised. I tried a different Mac and different firewire cable but came up with nothing. Next step, I called Lacie. After 30mins of being kept on hold I spoke to an adviser who unhelpfully concluded that the hard drive needed repair after a long session of 'let's try this'. Lacie have agreed to repair the drive as it is still under warranty but I they cannot retrive any of the data on the drive itself. So if you are looking for a reliable portable external hard drive I recommend you look elsewhere as this one is not worth the money, for the drive to function less than 4 months of occasional use is not really acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!","review":"The rub with this product is that it contains quizes and a review test BUT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE THE ANSWERS!!!!!

A friend brought them to me since I live overseas. Unfortunately the first time I put them on my bed, the elastic band broke. As I mentioned, I live overseas so it is impossible for me to ship them back and get a full refund without spending a lot of money on the shipping.

Just the perfect thing on a great budget. Highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing original","review":"First, this book contains almost no original research in it at all. Some of it is so unoriginal as to be cliched, such as his essay on how Jesus would be covered by today's news media. Second, Underwood finds evidence of religion's influence anywhere and everywhere in the news media, which defies the facts, logic, and common sense. Third, it is usually difficult to tell when Underwood is stating his own opinion or interpretation versus summarizing one of his source's, and it also is often difficult to tell whether or not he agrees with the sources that he's quoting or paraphrasing. The book is mostly a waste of time unless you have never previously read anything on religion and U.S. news media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey and cliched.","review":"I bought this book to accompany me on a long trip, and wished I hadn't.

I loved this book. I wish I was adventurous, but that I wasn't didn't stop me reading out loud to my daugher of ten years, who I dream will grow without my fears. Thank you for beautiful stories.

With a full-time job and a toddler, I need a book I can pick up and read a little at a time. I found myself thinking about this book all day and pouring through it each night. I love to travel, but haven't been able too as much as I'd like in recent years. This book not only makes me feel as though I've been on an adventure - several! - but it has inspired me to make mental notes of where I will be off to on my next trip. The great thing about the stories is the feeling that with a little motivation, any reader could be the next to take a trip and write a story. A great pick-me-up, there's-so-much-out-there-to-experience, carpe-diem, kick-in-the-patooty book! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Women with Wonderlust","review":"I loved this book. I read the entire thing, cover to cover in two or three sittings, not just because it was entertaining, but also because it provides a rare insight into what it is really like OUT THERE (wherever that is) as a lone woman. I felt almost empowered, like I really could do it too! With practically every part of the world and every age woman represented in this book, I felt silly for thinking I couldn't travel alone. There isn't any sugar-coating or matronly advice...just enough experience to help make an informed decision or to calm the restlessness of a would-be traveler. Ms. Bond has put togehther an ideal balance of humor, truth, and insight to inspire me to get out the crumpled map and start thinking about going somewhere new.

It's gentle but effective - i really like this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your receipt","review":"As a young adult, I have acne-prone skin with some enlarged pores around around my nose. I bought this hoping it would help clear me up, when, in fact, it did quite the opposite. When I first squeezed some into my hand I noticed that it had a very chemically odor. After I used it and rinsed my face, as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them, so I rinsed, rinsed, rinsed some more until the burning stopped. My face felt clean, but smelled like chemicals, and in the morning I woke up with a few new zits. I wasn't sure the cleanser was causing the breakout, so I kept using it. I slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it. About a week after I did, I was back to normal. I gave this cleanser to my sister to try and she had very good results, but stopped using it because she was concerned about the chemical odor. I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Overall, I just did not like this cleanser. Here's why:1) When I use a facial cleanser, I expect my face to feel refreshed and to glow. With this cleanser, my face just felt the same and looked sort of blah.2) I don't care for the scent. It's somewhat soapy and sharp.3) I was disappointed in the exfoliating aspect - this feels more like a cream cleanser. The microbeads are indeed there, but they don't seem to do much. Maybe they do and I just can't see it.4) I haven't noticed a visible improvement in my skin. My pores are the same size and my skin does NOT look refined. Granted, I don't use it every day so maybe that's why. Or maybe it has to do with #3.I realize that successful results are partly dependent on daily use. But for me, a pleasant scent and positive, noticeable, immediate results help motivate me to use the product. This product, unfortunately, does not motivate me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare artist who will never be imitated","review":"What a far cry from the Lang Langs of today, who seem so shallow and narcissistic. Michelangeli had zero interest in pleasing his audience, but possessed a total commitment to the integrity of his vision. A perfectionist, fortunately he had the what with to reach sublime heights of pianistic performance. For anyone who loves the piano, this disc, as all Michelangeli's disks, is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would Lang Lang think?! *gasp*","review":"I'm only kidding about my review title. I'm sure he would love it. However, the camera work / performance demeanor - well, as other reviewers imply, it's not likely to catch the eye of your typical 21st century teenager (his face is probably planted in his iPhone anyway). Oh well! I'm actually glad that the camera isn't swerving around in lunatic fashion, with fancy fades here and nauseating twists there. This is more akin to a Gouldian production. We see what we need to see: arms! hands! And occasionally a face! :)This is a treat. Thoughtful, solid, emotional (inner) and oh-so-Germanic. There really is something so enigmatic, so private, so pensive about Michelangeli's playing. We would do well to study this more introspective approach to art.I highly recommend this performace. Despite Mr. Michelangeli's flagrant addition of a low B (left hand, last measure of Ballade no. 4). It sure sounded nice on that Steinway... ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of the other reviews and I was so disappointed. I found the subject matter very interesting but I thought that the author should have written a philosophical and spiritual book rather than try and put his ideas into a novel.

The chapters are not necessarily related, and the novel is easier to swallow in small doses. Though dada and surrealism have often overlapped, they are not mutually exclusive. For me, the novelty wears off quickly, and otherwise I am not exactly the biggest fan of Hugo Ball's 'art'. I greatly prefer Nadja by Andre Breton (another headfigure in dada and surrealism) and The Eater of Darkness by Robert M. Coates, which are much more interesting as far as dada-influenced works go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys are extremely difficult to remove.","review":"I was not able to use this lock, because each of the three keys which came with the lock are virtually impossible to remove once inserted.

If you've never heard of the style, Makossa is rhythmic pop/rock style that originated in Cameroon, West Africa. Much of Paul Simon's Graceland album uses a Makossa-style rhythm, because it is similar to accoridian jive. Many artists use nonsense words in Makossa, so if you don't understand all the words in Bana Ba Makosa, don't worry! You don't have to, and in fact you probably weren't expected to. This is a CD that you can leave playing for hours and never get tired of the dancing beat.

It got a lot of twists, and just when you think you know what's happening....you're WRONG!!!.

He smashed the logic of temporal sequences and pasted them together in a way that made his story, already inherently interesting, unfold like a wonderful puzzle. With Following we see that talent in development. Once again the temporality of the story is not linear. This makes the ending seem like dozens of secrets finally revealed. This film is also a well exectued bit of noire cinema, as our heor Bill runs into a dirty world of pretenders out to use him for their own good. The premise, that Bill shadows or follows people to learn about humanity and how that curioisty leads him into the heart of a noire masterpeice, is as interesting and dark as Memento.

The Veterinarians and animals that they care for were wonderful to read about. Even the sad bits (which are inevitable where animals are concerned) were not too bad to read about. McSparren's writing has a way of easing the pain. Honestly I cannot think of anything negative to say about this book. The human interest in this book also holds some interest for all ages. The reader gets involved with the lives of Maggie, her husband, children and friends. This book is unique and will be a tough act to follow. I savored every word, laughed and cried. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves all of God's creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This book is fabulous! I couldn't put it down. I laughed; I cried. My love of animals was fed by her clever, humorous and heart-rending tales. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Plain Wonderful!","review":"I bought this book based on what seemed a pleasant and interesting topic, but was swept away by the well-written, and unique glimpses into what I suspect is the reality of a small/large animal veterinarian. The chapters continue the longer-term themes while the vignettes of whatever the mini-narrative is for the chapter hold your attention easily. I found myself reading \\"just one more chapter\\" at night until I could no longer keep my eyes open. Best of all, I was sad when this book ended, which to me is a GREAT read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I didn't realize at first this was not an actual memoir, but I did find it very readable and enjoyable. I'm an animal person, grew up on a ranch with livestock and pets and do enjoy this kind of a read.My criteria for this specific type of book is, of course, the Herriot books, which are certainly difficult to compete with. I found this book very accurate and knowledgeable about the veterinary work. The specific stories were particularly entertaining for me and I would have liked more of them.I found the family life portion, the angst regarding the clash between family and career and particularly the turmoil following the husband's death, much less interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks with Herriot's books","review":"This is really a terrific book. If I had gotten it in physical form instead of for the Kindle, I'd place it on my shelves right beside my James Herriot books. It's well written and the stories that make up the whole range from humorous to lump in the throat. My only smallest of criticisms would be that it covers a vet's life from before vet school till retirement age and does seem a bit long, and typos appeared too often in the last half of the book. Maybe if I hadn't been so taken with it that I read it all in one swoop I wouldn't have felt that way about the length of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"well researched book","review":"I work in an animal hospital and when I started reading this book, I knew nothing of the author. I assumed that she was telling her own tale about becoming a vet. I was shocked to find out the author was in fact not a vet and based most of the information from people she knew in the vet industry. Her accuracy for detail and fact regarding the procedures, mishaps, and circumstances that go along with treating the animals and their clients. She gives real heart to all the characters involved. I must say she really captured the eccentric quirkiness of some of the clients in the book. Very well written and an absolute joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"There is a genre of humor that uses complaints as its basis. I don't really find it all that funny. The first couple chapters of this book fit solidly into this genre. I tried skipping a few chapters further on but it never really caught my attention. I bought the book because it's description compared it to the famous All Creatures Great and Small series but it didn't come up to that standard. I finished it but, to tell you the truth, I already don't really remember much of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rural vet tales","review":"As a convincing fictional memoir, this book succeeded (not that this was the intention of the author - but it was completely my experience). The stories of animal care were enjoyable, but even more so was the character development of Maggie and Eli, Morgan and all the other friends and family that populate this novel. Along the way Ms. McSparren explores the complicated relationships that mothers and daughters have. One of the most poignant parts of the novel for me was the conversation Maggie has with her son. She has a guilty feeling that she failed her family, even as she was succeeding as a well respected and accomplished veterinarian. Her son, Nathan, gives her a completely different view of their family life and his mother's role in their lives. It brought tears to my eyes to see the love and pride that Nathan had for his mother. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, enjoyable book","review":"I thought this book was enjoyable. It is really a collection of experinces of Maggie McClain rather than a book with a speficic plot. There really is no plot to speak of it is simply the story of Maggie and her family. Even so, it is still a good book that is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Narratives.","review":"As a fanatic of travel narratives, I loved this book, and would recommend it highly. For those who felt the same way - I urge you to read A Tent Life in Siberia: An Incredible Account of Siberian Adventure, Travel, and Survival by George Kennan, which follows an expedition through Siberia in the 1860s. A similar concept, but moved to the unforgiving land of Siberia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!! Love it!!!","review":"Absolutely love it!! This is possibly the best perfume to have come out recently (Well, Paul Smith's Story is possibly a close second)! Sephora sells it for 90$ and Amazon sells it for 46$!! Now, That's a sweet deal!! Anyways, the perfume lingers into the evening! It is somewhat earthy- don't get carried away with the initial citrus rush- it settles down into a more woody, earthy feel- U start experiencing the Vetiver and Grapefruit, a little patchouli! Somewhere within you will smell some cedar too! I think it is a great perfume; and if you want to buy it, don't waste your bucks at Fancy stores like Neiman Marcus or Sephora- it is cheap right here on Amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Elegance","review":"The Perfume is pure excellenceIt's not your ordinary citrus, \\"sport\\" or fresh perfume.It is a perfume on its own liege.the scent takes me back home, when the tropical rain absorbers the dirt of the earth.Just think of you standing somewhere in the rainforest, in the middle of a field/hill, you feel the fresh rain pore down on you into the earth. You can smell the dirt, rain, rocks and trees aromas surround you. that TERRE in french for Earth after all.a very Earthly Cologne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like compliments from other people?","review":"Then get this cologne! It has become my signature cologne. Everytime I wear it I have someone tell me I smell really nice and want to know what it is and where I got it. I am almost out and will definately purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells bad","review":"Cologne smelled very good on a coworker so he told me the brand and I ordered theeau de toilette because the cologne is so expensive.Maybe there is a difference between the cologne and the eau de toilette,but it probably has to do with the phenomenon of smellingdifferent on different people.Anyway, I thought it smelled nice on my coworker, but I rarely use it because now I think itsmells vile.In defence of the product, my girlfriend likes it on me, which is the only reason Itolerate it occasionally, (plus I don't want all that money I spent on it down the drain).I suspect this bottle will last for decades, since I dislike it so much.Do yourself a favor, and don't purchase fragrances online unless you already know you like it or have tested it out on yourself first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I haven't used a lot of perfumes in my life. The last one I used was Ferrari Black and I had to pour it on me to actually smell nice a little. But this one is great. Just a little and I smell awesome all day. My friends want to know what I am using but I am keeping it a secret for now. Oh no maybe I shoudnt be writing this review coz when they search my name, amazon reviews comes up in the first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the original Polo....","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews on this scent, I thought it would be one of the best scents on the market. I don't own this product but I did try it and I was terribly disappointed. So because this isn't a scent that's easily found in Macy's I thought I'd post my review of what I thought of it. To me it smelled almost exactly like the original Polo Ralph Lauren (green bottle), which I also don't care for. But it does have remarkable stay power--about two hours after spraying it on my arm I washed my arm and I can still smell the fragrance. If you're a fan of the original Polo and you're out then by all means give this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was expecting so much more from Terre DHermes given the reviews. It has a woody smell but it doesn't smell like an expensive cologne. I tend to like fresh smelling colognes like the Aqua Di Gio, Armani Black, Issey Miyake, Prada Infusion, Jean Paul Gaultier. Any of these is much better than this one. Its not long-lasting either. May be it works for others but not for me, this was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragrence !","review":"I have only worn this fragrence once since I received It. However, my wife and I like it very much. I am also waiting for someone else to give me their opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly worse than mediocre; smells of burnt wood and citrus rinds.","review":"I am a fan of many different types of fragrances. Right now I've been using YSL's L'homme quite a bit. Trying D'Hermes after wearing that felt like a major downgrade and disappointment.To me this was an obnoxious scent; burnt wood and shaved citrus rinds sums it up nicely. Not only that but it is a very overpowering burnt wood and citrus. With only two sprays and even after hours it was still up my nose, and I know everyone within a 20' radius in the grocery store could smell it as well. If you're into that then I highly recommend this EDT. It has good staying power and good sillage; unfortunately in the case of a scent this bad that is not something to brag about.I should mention I bought the EDT and not the parfum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terre is Heavenly...","review":"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, after chasing another gentleman down the street to ask what he was wearing. It smells absolutely wonderful. It is woodsy with traces of cedar. Can you say scrumptous? It received rave reviews from the recipient. It is now his favorite cologne :) Bravo Hermes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great!","review":"Given Jean-Claude Ellena's fame, and all the hype about Terre D'Hermes, this scent is not at all popular. The notes by themselves are great. It is only for very specific kind of people. Almost all of the young folks have seriously found the scent, unbearable. Do not wear it for a concert and/or singles night out! For the price, it is simply not justified. One suggestion to big perfume houses, keep the top notes simple and easy, base notes need to be convivial, you may experiment with the middle notes however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and sophisticated","review":"Tried this out in the Hermes store, 3.4oz was going for well over $~130. However the single test spray i had lasted the entire day. Maybe it was the perfume and not toilette because mine doesn't last as long. Either way, a great cologne to add to one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fragrance","review":"This is a very good men's day wear perfume. The smell is not too strong but is very long lasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Directly from Amazon","review":"The fragrance house itself is great, the product Amazon sent me was no good.The serial number was shaved off of the bottle and cut out from the bottom of the box, the bar code below the UPS on the box was cut out and replaced.The fragrance itself smells like a watered down version of the real thing and lasts maybe 30 minutes.I know Amazon would not sell poor product intentionally. Not sure if this is the same you would find with the 3rd party sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, aged citrus","review":"This is not a shout it loud cologne, but definitely speaks of sophistication when you stop to consider the notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terre D\\" Hermes","review":"My husband really like it. I would buy it again. It is deal, if you buy it in the store it does cost more. It was a really fast turn around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great Product, will buy again. I also own the Terre d'Herm��s Eau de parfum which is a much richer fragrance.The Eau de toilette isn't as powerful. But both are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Male Perspective about it","review":"Quite strong the 2 or 3 initial days of use, after that you feel fine and you will miss the smell. For those that appreciate the roustic life style appreciate Jack Daniels whisky, Muscle cars, Horses, Harley Davidson, leather jacket. Actors that looks similar: Clooney, Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery."},{"rating":"2","title":"First scent where I finish the bottle","review":"Typically I am not a scent person, and thus, most of my scents are so rarely used that I toss half full ones after a couple of years. However, Terre D'Hermes is the first scent that I actually finish within a year. (This order is my 4th in as many years.) I would describe the scent as rained-upon woods yet light, just the right amount of gravitas, with hint of citrus without being sweet. In my opinion (and climate), I feel that I can wear it year around and to any event: functions, office and leisure.Since the reviewed product is an \\"eau de toilette\\" and not a \\"perfume\\", I know that it will wear off in the afternoon, and needs reapplication for any evening function. I don't mind - it's the way \\"eau de toilettes\\" work - and I prefer it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, very unique","review":"Really elegant fragrance with warm spicy notes and undertones of citrus and something else--earthy and very masculine. The bottle and box make for a rich-looking presentation. This price was exceptionally good, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terre D'hermes","review":"The colognes has a warm, earthy, herbal quality about it. The scent is alluring not jolting. It's a wonderful evening scent. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this from Amazon!","review":"Like most people I don't like buying cologne online because there are so many fakes sold on the internet. However, when I saw that this item was shipped directly from Amazon I thought it must be legitimate. Well, since then my cologne has arrived and boy was I WRONG!The box comes wrapped in hard plastic like most new cologne, this made me believe it was new and un-opened, wrong again. They must have put it in this plastic themselves.On the bottom of the box, the serial numbers have been cut off, and this cut covered by a white sticker. Seeing this made me realize already something was up, why would Amazon do this?So I open the box, and the INSIDE of the box is ripped. This obviously means that someone has already previously opened this box. This was all the proof I needed.I can't tell you about the cologne itself as I didn't spray it so that I can return this. I can't believe amazon sent something like this to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this hoping to sweep leaves that come into our garage, but it is flimsy, lightweight and bent. It doesn't lie flat on the ground, so what is the point. The handle is heavier than the bin, so you need to hold it down. It says heavy gauge/heavy duty, but it is not. I would sent it back but shipping was more than it costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Clip Art Collection","review":"I ordered the GifArt CD-ROM a little while ago, and I have to say this CD-ROM is a must have for any webmaster or any one who likes to build his/her own web site.

Also very ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced","review":"The worst thing about this book is the characters, I have to admit it. One sided, one dimensional. I think the term i want to say is \\"cookie cutter\\"...The other thing though that I notices was the drab prose. Never even in the writing groups I've been to with complete novices have I read something so forced and pretentious. Every line that is churned out lacks spirit or creativity. There is no verve, no spark, just forced, forced, forced prose. It's like, \\"look what I can do\\"!! kind of writing.I've read this writer's fanfictions and this is just like them. There was never any spark of imagination to the story, and never any creativity to the prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliches","review":"Cliches exist for a reason. Because mostly they are true, which is how they got so widely known. But that is not en excuse to write an entire book of them.A cliche in a book, or a bunch of them, could work. But only if it is done by turning the cliche around or making a point of it. It needs to surprise you. If you can't do something interesting with something that is already a cliche, then it's pointless, because it's all been done before.That sums up this book. It is entirely cliche and flat, but it has no redeeming quality to it. The cliche stays cliche and doesn't surprise you. That's not very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring.","review":"I don't know, it does nothing for me. Teh tone gets really monotonous after the first fwe paragraphs. The vocabulary is pretty dull except for a few parts which have words in them that are obviously supposed to spice it up, but it just sounds like it's put on. In some cases the wrong word is used. The punctuation is pretty bad in some spots, I mean noticably.The characters are shallow. This book is for easy to please kids who don't like to think much."},{"rating":"1","title":"sugared honey gone bad","review":"Flamewars out of the way for a second, here's my honest review. This book was exactly like this: take a pint of honey, add a few tablespoons of sugar, and then let it sit in the hot summer sun for about a month and then drink it all down at once.The tone, the author's voice, the various cliche phrases are all so saccharine that it makes you sick to your stomach. It tries real hard to be gritty in some places, but those places are just lifted from every other story and then watered down. Even fantasy stories should have something to relate to real life, real human emotions. This doesn't at all. It just kind of plods along, saccharine cliche after saccharine cliche.And, sorry, but I have to add like everyone else that the characterization was totally flat.And, yes, ripped off of Legend of Zelda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as a fanfic","review":"It was better as a fanfic. In Legend Of Zelda fandom where she first wrote this story (with Falen being Link) it stood out as an OK story. Now it's just sort of boring. I didn't like it. She did not even bother to correct little mistakes in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull......","review":"Sorry, I tried really hard but couldn't get pat the first two chapters even. This book isn't even edited. Most of all it wasn't compelling in any way, none of the characters were interesting. I guess it's good for young kids who don't want to be too challenged, whom it doesn't take much to get them into a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I disagree","review":"I actually disagree with those who are giving this book 3 stars or less. I enjoyed it! I didn't know what to expect when I had bought it, I had seen her artwork on Deviantart for years and bought this book back in 2007/2008 and I have to say, she did a great job developing her characters and I'm really surprised that so many people are giving such low ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry.......","review":"This was awful. Novel writing is not a popularity contest, it's about telling a story and having richly written characters. The story has been told a billion times and this particular story doesn't add anything fresh to it. And the characters are just ridiculous. I can't even say in regards to the whole Legend of Zelda fanfic thing if they are \\"in character\\" or \\"OOC\\" because there is NO character to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snark Rule","review":"From a writer's workshop summary:\\"Snark rule: \\"I tell you once, I tell you twice, what I tell you three times is true.\\" Lewis Carroll, The Hunting of the Snark. When three or more critics concur on an element in a story, it is highly likely to be true.\\"This is sadly the case with this book. The writing is flat, the characters one dimensional, the entire book so plot driven that it rings false. Nothing to connect to the human experience, nothing to catch the reader's interest. Just a retelling of the wanky \\"special\\" boy who starts out as a reject, and spunky princess routine.Pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, dull, predictable","review":"It looks like most people have felt the same way, that this book was dull adn predictable. But a bigger problem I think is just the overall style. The language is forced and dull. It sounds like a kid wrote it. I'm not talking about grammar, but just how it sounds. Singsongy and immature. Childish instead of childlike. It has no depth, no sparkle of life. The language and phrasing was just so flat and boring, like it was just lifted from a bunch of other books, dulled down and slapped on.Also, like most people seem to think, the characters were just awful and boring.Too bad because the art wasn't bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I'm afraid I have to agree that this isn't a good book. It shouldn't even be out on the market. I heard about it at different web sites that are panning it and I said How bad could it be? I was curious. It is as bad as people say it is. It is true that the characters are cardboard cut outs. That's the biggest problem with it. There were obvious mistakes in the printing, but I can overlook things like that if it has a good story and characters I can get into. But unfortunately the characters are so cliche that it was insulting. I don't want to read something that insults me and I don't like to be spoon fed the story like a stupid child. I felt like the author had hit me over the head with cliche characters rather than like I had actually read a book.Sorry, that's just how I feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I purchased this book after viewing the fantastic art on the author's website. She is a very talented artist and her work is a real treat to behold.When the book arrived, I was excited to give it a read and to view the promised art. Boy, was I disappointed! The writing is terrible, un-edited, and generic. The characters have no soul, and by the third chapter, I was bored with them. It felt like bad fanfiction, complete with poor grammar and trite story line.I'm sorry, Adele. You should stick to drawing and forget writing, or at least forget writing for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"This is a book that wants to appeal to adults, but adults don't like it because it's cheesy, so instead it appeals to kids, but it doesn't seem like that was the desired effect. One reviewer said that it was better as a Legend Of Zelda fanfic where Falen was Link. I have to regrettably agree with that. In the old stories (\\"Zelda\\" and \\"Requiem\\" where a lot of this book comes from,) you already knew Link (now Falen) and so you already liked him. The good parts of those stories were all because we knew the character. The original characters in those stories were boring, but you could skip through them and get your fan fic fix that way. But now all there are are Adele's characters, and they don't hold the interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This would not even get an A in high school English class.About the book itself, one thing I noticed was how one dimensional the characters were. [...] I hate to just repeat what everyone else said, but these characters were just little snippets and sound bites of movies with no real feeling to them.I won't give away the end, but I have to say that it wasn't suprising. Not only that, but I actually didn't care what happened to Falen, if he lived or died (again I won't spoil the ending, not that I could, because anyone with a brain who has seen a movie or two will know the entire story anyway.) It was hard to either like him or hate him, he was just super boring. No personality. That goes for the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully bad","review":"It's like an emotional ten year old wrote this.

The most beautiful aspect of the organizer is that all of the lids come off in 4 strips (pieces), allowing easy access to ALL the compartments at the same time. This way, you can open them all up, place your pills in the correct places, the place the lids back on and just make sure they snap into place. When it's time for that period's medication, you just pop open the appropriate compartment and turn it upside down into your hand, or scoop out the pills.

Throughout the book, Collum tells us what each of her characters think (you are in the minds of no less than 6 characters), tells us why they do what they do, and tells us what we should think of her characters. The characters remain static and undynamic--what you read it what you get. Ultimately, the writing is stilted and pedantic.The plot is a good one. In fact, I think it is excellent. The main characters advocating for their chosen heiresses. Unfortunately, there is an inherent plot hole in this book that you could drive a truck through: why doesn't the inheritance get split between the 3 candidates? It seems so obvious to me, but it took the author 200 pages before she considered it.The one redeeming factor of this book is the dialogue. If you can, read the dialogue and skip the rest. In 30 minutes, you will have read what was worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent Actually","review":"I'm a big Ratt fan and I love all of Stephen Pearcy's work. I heard that he had, a few years ago, branched out and did an industrial metal album which seems very odd to me. When I saw this CD in a music store, it was only 4 bucks so I bought it. I was suprised at how decent the music actually was. The opening track Follow is incredible, very catchy. Synthetic Flesh is another good song. If you are interested in any kind of metal you will probably enjoy this CD. And hey, for 1 cent on amazon, you really can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated 1 Star for Price","review":"I don't see why this is priced from $199 to $299 new and $141 used.

But it's a real disappointment. It's very small in size, the photos are tiny for the most part and the text and captions are difficult to read. I'm surprised that Clarkson Potter would produce a book like this. I grew up in Philly going to Horn and Hardarts and I was hoping the book would also deal more with the Philly automats, but it is centered more on New York automats and very boring celebrity quotes. Who really cares what Tony Curtis says about eating there. I feel I gottaken...BTW I didnt buy it from Amazon but used from another online book vendor. My advice is save your money. It's not a fun read -- if you can even read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!","review":"I was so thankful to find this book for my friend, whose mom kept the family off the depression era food lines with the leftovers she brought home from work at The Automat.

The original recipe used a large, straight macaroni, while the book's recipe calls for \\"elbow macaroni\\". Oops. The original had bits of tomato, the book's recipe omits the tomato. Oops again. I didn't care to try what is clearly misrepresented as \\"authentic\\".Having said that, the nostalgia and history aspect of the book is quite good. But having purchased the book for the recipes, this was very disappointing. If you enjoy reading the history of the automat, this book is for you. If you're considering buying the book for the \\"authentic\\" recipes, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"memories","review":"For a kid who grew up in Philadelphia, this is a rich account of the times and meals I had at Kensington & Allegheny with my parents in the 50s.

This is def a bait and switch though. You could tell Anti-Flag was thrown on there to gain street cred with the punk crowd. But anyone that actually listens to punk would shut this off before even getting to that far in the album. Jack's Mannequin is punk?I think they should have done two cd's. Emo Goes Acoustic and Punk Goes Acoustic. Put the stuff on the right CD so people don't grab it expecting something totally not what they are promoting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavor of the Week","review":"This is a fair to decent CD for what it is, and it's nice to see a \\"Punk Goes\\" disc that isn't full of cover songs for once. With that being said, Punk Goes Acoustic 2 is still nothing more than a cash in by Fearless Records, a \\"Now 20�� or whatever for alternative music fans. The majority of this disc is filled with the latest pop rock/emo flavors of the week, Anti-Flag and Set Your Goals are merely thrown in for street cred (as attested to by their track numbers).I'm not bashing this CD because it's not \\"punk\\", most of the band's put on a good performance, but it's hard not to laugh at a record that features Daphne Loves Derbe and the Spill Canvas next to a band like Anti-Flag. I think Jello Biafra would have a thing to say about this.Buy this if you can't get over your 7th grade girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story different title","review":"Ghost Valley was a series of flashbacks from previous books. The story line was almost the same as the last book with different names, even the dialog was the same.

Hopefully the next book will have a different plot and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dejavu","review":"This is a reprint of the previous book in the series - Same plot, same characters, same script and most of the text was lifted from the previous book.

I wish there was some way for Mr. Johnstone to give me my money back. About half the forty pages were flashbacks of previous books. I used to love his Mountain Man Series but I quit reading them because he would spent a big part of the book with pages of what happened in a previous book. Now I will quit reading the Last Gunfighter series. I guess you make as much money doing this and you don't have to think up as many new things to write, just repeat what you have already written. In my openion it is bad for an author with this ability to take advantage of people that do not know these thing until they buy the book. It should be noted on the cover of this and other books he has done: BEWARE--ABOUT HALF OF WHAT YOU READ IS IN A PREVIOUS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one...","review":"I love the Last Gunfighter series and the tales of Frank Morgan. However, I agree with the other reviews that this book was a copy of the book before it. My sources tell me that the author possibly wrote this book at the same time that he began chemotherapy, but still the editor should have done his job. My suggestion is to skip this book. Or spend 5 minutes breezing through it in a book store somewhere. Then buy the next book in the series and continue with this series. Don't give up on it cause the next book in the series is one of the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Photo album","review":"I am very impressed with the photo album.

Some critics claim that when Mann formed his Earth Band, he went in over his head, but that is mistaken, because, unlike his work with the Manfreds, his 70s/80s albums are actually the work of a mature artist fully realizing his talents. Mann's (and singer Chris Thompson's) belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes ANGEL STATION an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review from the Editor!","review":"In this work, I have attempted to provide a balanced treatment of this controversial subject in the church today. The book contains articles (written by a diverse group of informed individuals) which favor female ordination as well as articles which favor the ordination of qualified men only. Further, it contains informed responses to those articles, and occasionally even counter-responses from the authors of the original articles. Although I am a contributor to the work, and do hold a well considered position on this subject, I have made every effort to see that the work, as a whole, represents a very very balanced approach to this matter. I believe that end was accomplished. Thus, I recommend this work to anyone who would like to read a treatise regarding this issue which is both sincere and thorough, as well as being derived by means of diverse approaches. May God richly bless you as you study.Rev. Dr. Steve Woods"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"This has to be one of the most ridiculous books ever written. In one story, a woman blames a ghost for her missing sports bra and in another, Sharon Gill, one of the authors, misplaces two photography books and accuses a ghost of taking them! If ghosts were responsible for missing books, my house would be literally crawling with spirits!Also included is a tale about the ghost of a mutilated woman at Watch Hill Lighthouse in Westerly, Rhode Island. In the story, an \\"unnamed\\" individual sees the ghost, then goes to the local library and discovers the apparition is that of a woman named Edith Whiting who was murdered by her husband in 1885. Having a keen interest in haunted lighthouses, I contacted the Watch Hill Lighthouse Association requesting additional information and discovered the story was a total fabrication!In my opinion, the authors of this book are irresponsible people who pander to the gullible and care nothing for the accuracy of what they produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Fantasy Read!","review":"Continuing on from the epic Axis Trilogy, Sinner is a novel that continues to deliver an amazing story. Rich in description, Sinner invites the reader into a world bound by prophecy where the characters are a curious mix of glorious heroes, fey creatures, dazzling gods and malevolent demons, where triumph is often overshadowed by tradegy and where the entire land of Tencendor is on the brink of destruction due to the actions of one man...or is it? Sara Douglass is Australia's finest fantasy writer, and with Sinner, the first in the Wayfarer Redemption Trilogy, she has created a story that will stay with you long after you have put down the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read the first series by this author (starting with \\"Battleaxe\\") and I thought it was really good. I thought that the departure from Anglo-centric racial (and sexual) stereotypes in a fantasy novel was refreshing (cf. Eddings et al). I eagerly plunged into the new series, but I was disappointed to find it lacked a good plot and I was bored by about halfway through this novel. I persevered with the remaining two, but I found the characters and events became increasingly ludicrous the more I read. I got the feeling that the author was sick of writing about the characters during this series. The magic system was also a little shaky; the characters' abilities were undefined which allowed the author to let them to escape from seemingly impossible situations by conveniently inventing new abilities. It made the story seem unplanned and the world that Douglass has spent so many pages describing, unbelievable. I recommend the first series, but don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best So Far","review":"This book is the best in the series up this point. Both the storyline and the characters are much more mature in Sinner, and there is so much action that takes place that it feels like an entire trilogy was contained in just this one volume. I am continually impressed by Sara Douglass's breadth of vision and the huge, sweeping storylines that are intensely interesting and thought provoking. Sara Douglass's world is unlike anything anyone else has written, and more than that, it is one of the most interesting. If the rest of the series is as good as Sinner, it will be a phenomenal addition to the Fantasy literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinner is Great","review":"I started out by reading Sara Douglass's Hades Daughter, part one of her Troy Game series. I then started reading her otherbooks. I read and like the first three books of her WayfarerRedemption Series but I just feel Sinner is one of her better books. The story line is fascinating and I like the idea of thehero being consider evil by his family although by the middle of the book you should be able to figure out that Drago is thestarson not Caelum. I hard at time putting this book down although my reading time is limited. I love this book. I amlooking forward to reading both Pilgrim and Crusader to found out how this story ends. By the way, I feel sorry for what happen to Faraday in Starman and I hope now that she is human again she and Drago become close.If you are a Sara Douglass fan, you should love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read......","review":"Sara Douglass has not let us down in this part of the series as she cleverly interwtines her characters and their histories to blend so well in creating the plots within plots. I cannot wiat until the next part..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARK!!!","review":"I'm 3 quarters done with the book. This book really is a deviation from the original Wayfarer trilogy. She throws mud on all her characters and leaves you not knowing who to root for. For the first half of the book I was rooting for the 'bad' guys. She takes Axis and Ashure of the first trilogy and turns them into trite, half brain dead incompetents (The little they show up in the book). I'm hoping as I go into the 2nd and 3rd book she somehow redeems someone. She seems to have taken a very dark turn when she wrote the 'Hades Daughter' and hasn't come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alert for tender sensibilities. (slight spoiler alert)","review":"It has been a bit since I read this book. The main caveat that I would like to let people in on is that the brutality level jumps SIGNIFICANTLY with this book in the series. Some of it is fairly nauseating. I was mostly upset by this in that having read the first trilogy one would come to expect a certain \\"rating,\\" if you will, and having it jump from pg-13 (behind closed doors, commented on afterwards rape) to NC-17 (Forced aborting of a pregnancy by the mother, open rape of 2-3 characters) is disconcerting at the least. I think she has a lot of intreguing ideas, but that was the main shocker for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"4th in series","review":"This 4th book in the wayfarer redemption series starts with Tecendor 40 years later.

It took my son less than 2 minutes of play to pop of the Donkey's jaw and then his head.The jaw is not secured in place at all. It is meant to hinge open and closed to allow the donkey to \\"talk\\" during play. This is not very satisfying when the jaw immediately comes off. The head is meant to nod up and down and suffers from the same malady. The cheap plastic pegs holding it in place do not do their job.

As soon as I handed it to my son the jaw fell off. When he gave it to me to fix, the head fell off. Every time I put it back together it fell apart a minute later. We both became very frustrated. I am very happy that I was there when the jaw fell off and my 22 month old didn't pick it up and put it in his mouth. I returned the toy to Toysrus and informed them that it was a choking hazard. I also called Hasbro to let them know that it was very poorly made and dangerous for anyone with young children in the house.

Fudge does a good job I think, while Peterson uses his space to beat up on Fudge. Peterson uses \\"classroom\\" humor to ridicule Fudge and his position. I find that unprofessional. I would of liked to see Peterson stick to a presentation of the Traditional view in his opening statement so I could better judge it on its own merit apart from other views.I intend to read each author's dedicated volume on this subject: Fudge - \\"The Fire That Consumes,\\" and Peterson - \\"Hell on Trial.\\" I would like to see them rewrite the above book and stick strictly to the plan.
