Also outstanding is her latest, \\"Come Walk With Me.\\" A purchase without regret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice like few others","review":"But unfortunately not all of the songs or arrangements are up to the caliber of the clear, rangey, and powerful voice that is Oleta Adams. My personal favorite has to be You've Got to Give Me Room. The story of a woman crying out for the man she married to give her freedom to grow. Absolutely beautiful.Also of note is Everything must change. Great arrangements and as always Miss Adams perfect pitch and phrasing is masterful. And it goes without saying that Get Here is a classic. All that said there are enough mediocre cuts to pull down the overall rating.Still... a must have disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"still her best album","review":"Oleta Adams' 1990 debut remains the finest example of her rich, rich alto voice matched with a bunch of mostly very strong songs and warm arrangements that surround but don't smother her beautiful singing. Production by Tears for Fears' Roland Orzabal is mellifluous while never bland and in the album's highlight, You've Got To Give Me Room, he pulls everything out except for Oleta's keyboards and a flugel horn. The space for her voice and the touching lyric is perfect. Oleta is often grouped with Anita Baker and Brenda Russell, but more often than not the timbre and fullness of her voice remind me of Gladys Knight. Unfortunately on some of her later albums, the material gets weaker and the production blander but on Circle Of One it all works wonderfully to create a very satisfying album that has not dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and invaluable guide when sightseeing Flagstaff","review":"This book covers it all. Accessible text describes in a concise, but not condescending manner, the history of volcanoes in the northern Arizona and Flagstaff area. Excellent, even striking photography. Fine maps and drawings accent the text. This book is suitable reading material for professionals, college students and tourists alike. And an indispensable reference when traveling and sightseeing around Flagstaff, Arizona.Most people don't realize that Flagstaff is situated near these barely dormant volcanoes which last erupted less than 800 years ago!

It was one of Norton's few short stories, therefore, to be highly prized. Later it appeared in a DAW collection called the Many Worlds of Andre Norton (1974). Here (1976) it appears with a sequel that ties up the loose ends left at the end of Toys.The remaining stories appear here for the first time and are all worth reading. This isn't the best Norton has done, but even mediocre Norton is very good indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemlin has outdone herself.....and that's saying a mouthful!","review":"If you don't own all five of Jeanne Lemlin's cookbooks like I do, this is a magnificent place to start. Here, Lemlin offers an incredible array of vegetarian dishes that will please everyone from the died-in-the-wool vegan to the meat lover. The secret behind this wonderful collection of recipes is, like it's predecessors, Lemlin's staunch commitment to GREAT TASTING vegetarian cooking. And \\"Vegetarian Classics\\" goes even a step beyond her previous offerings by giving us everything we need in one comprehensive book. From her mouth-watering renditions of the classics to out-of-this-world soups, salads, pastas and much more...this book is, simply put, an instant classic. It is the best and most versatile cookbook I have ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This book is outstanding. It gets down to the real feel and the actual motions that you must perform to be successful. The part about the lighthouse turn and the shifting of weight is priceless. I've been trying to shift weight and rotate my hips for years with pretty awful shots alot of the time but M. Mcteigue actual tells you the real movements you must perform and what you must feel. It's all about the knees and how you move them. You will seriously be amazed at how you compress the ball once you get the hang of it. The main thing is just keep working on it and eventually you will figure it out. What actually happens in the golf swing is much different than what i thought it was for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree with the others","review":"The overwhelming positive reviews prompted me to purchase this, and I have to say that I agree with them. It was a fabulous book to learn and get a feel for the basic swing motion. The book is written in an easy-to-read format and his visualization examples really helped.After this, I have bought other instruction materials, and I've used those to further tweak my swing, which is still a work in progress.

I've now had to go and pay for lessons to \\"unlearn\\" what this book has said.

The information is very well explained and the author clearly worked hard to make it understandable for any golfer. I found the analogy of the lighthouse turn to help to stay centered over the ball and also the takaway-from the shoulders in an up and down motion-exceptional. I thank the author for his philopophy-I have taken many lessons-and finally I understand that turning my shoulder around myself will never be a consistent way to play this game.

Don't expect to just read through it and improve though. I would suggest holding off on the driving range while you dedicate yourself to doing the exercises he suggests over & over again until you know exactly what you should be \\"feeling\\" during the exercises (weight transfer, are your elbows where they are supposed to be etc....) This book suggests that you should not be trying to hit the ball but rather teaching your body to swing the club the exact same way every time which obviously builds consistency (something we could all use more of) It is a very quick read but don't read it too fast. Let the concepts sink in by reading important points several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"Compared to what's out there for golf instruction this book is superior.

The positive reviews are correct; this thin, direct, well-illustrated book has helped me build a solid, repeatable swing. . . one that is helping me lower my score week-by-week. By reading and studying it and practicing the simple steps McTeigue outlines has done it for me and I recommend it most highly. The accompanying video available on Amazon is a big help,too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"Very disappointing.

I could never develop a repeatable swing since I never experienced what a swing felt like. I pushed to the right and pulled or hooked to the left. Until I read Mike McTeague's \\"The Keys to the Effortless swing.The book and video build on a lighthouse movement staring with a basic arc building all the all the way to the full swing. Suddenly I realized I have to start the downswing with my feet and hips which pulls my upper body and arms through the ball creating a swing versus a hit action. I suddenly felt rhythm in my swing. The book and video are easy to follow and make you go through a set of simple exercises to give you a feel for the swing.I believe this swing is repeatable and I am anxious to drop my scores as I practice Mike's swing. I highly recommend his tutorials."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game doesn't have to be difficult","review":"I've read more books on golf instruction than I care to admit. To me, Mr. McTeigue's approach is the most straightforward and easily applied that I've come across.

After contemplating the many conflicting theories of grip, setup, mental pictures, and contrasting those theories with the widely varying mechanics of top tour stars, I think golf is a combination of reasonable fundamentals, lots of practice and focus, the makeup of your body, and just plain talent. I recommend the golf instruction books by George Knudson, John Redmon, and a difficult to find book by \\"Wild\\" Bill Melhorn (a tour player that Ben Hogan called the best ball striker he ever saw).

The Total Shiba is geared more toward breeders than toward prospective buyers and enthusiasts. The content is breeding-focused and it lacks color photographs.

I still remember that my original copy was printed in green ink - a detail that's stuck with me for more than 30 years, just like so many of the plot points. What a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Castles","review":"When I was a young girl, this was one of my favorite books.

Absolutely loved it. This was probably my first foray into the fantasy genre. The plot has twists and turns, there are wonderful characters that you can't help but fall in love with, and terrific evil villians.

My copy of this wonderful book is a beloved, taped-up copy that mysteriously appeared in the attic when I was a child. It's enough to make me check the doorknobs for goblin faces.Simply put, this book is a magical fairy tale. Like many readers I first read it as a child and loved it, but I still read it occasionally at the ripe old age of 25. Reminiscent of many great children's books, it is nonetheless unique. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age.

I know they will love it just as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book I Could Never Forget or Find","review":"Thirty years ago I read a wonderful paperback called Shadow Castle-over and over and over again. It was everything a good fairy tale was supposed to be: funny, suspenseful, fanciful, and with the forces of good and evil battling it out in true storybook fashion. I remember that the heroines were much more resourceful than in many of the old fairy tales I had read; none of that standing about and screaming for them when the dragon came. No, they often were the ones who came up with innovative solutions. I loved it! When I gave the book away in a fit of childish largesse, I almost instantly regretted it. But short of resorting to bully tactics, I wasn't getting it back. So, for thirty years, I have been looking for this treasure and am beyond excited to find it in hardback! It will go proudly next to all of my Harry Potter books, and I think it can hold its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still love the book","review":"I am a 44 year old Male and still consider this one of the best childrens books I have ever read!

I give this wonderful story credit for so much, that I cannot put it into words.

I started investigating natural things I could do to avoid the expense of medications and surgery. I discovered Cardio Strength and I can truly say it has saved her life. Her last X-ray of her heart showed that the heart had actually shrunk and the Vet told me to keep doing what I am doing. She is so alive and peppy and loves to play and run! I give her a little bit on a piece of cheese every morning and one capsule usually lasts me 2-3 days. She loves it and jumps up and down when she knows she is getting her cheese every morning.

Also some important parts were missing. It was entertaining though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought it","review":"This was good. I recommend people buying this.

We were so excited to see it but couldn't stand the wait between episodes, so I ordered this so we could watch it together but was really disapointed. This is basically the cliff notes version, a lot of scenes have been cut that the story is rushed and jumbled. It really takes away from the original passion and beauty of this Novela. I never really write reviews for the things I order but I was disapointed. I only rated 2 stars because the company was fast in shipping and delivery and it got her before the estimated date.

Then, about 4 months later, they started crackling. Yes, I took the time to clean them, and in a day (or even an hour in some cases) they would start crackling again. No matter how clean you get them, they continue to make that sound of a bug zapper or something. It is very frustrating. I have deep cleaned as well with no results beyond a day or two. Beyond that, I do notice a cleaner smell in the air when I have them on (which is rarely these days due to the noise). Also, when I do clean them, I do notice a sticky, black film on the blades, so I guess it is cleaning something out of the air... if only they would shut up!!!!

I called Iron Pro customer service and followed their instruction to deep clean again. The unit still did not function. Their customer service rep told me I had to pay $19.99 for them to ship the new unit to me, and I had to ship the defective unit back to them at my own S&H expense. I did not want to go thru all the hassles. I finally had the trash hauler haul it away. The Car Ionizers were also useless.

I was forced to call 4 times, the first two times they told me to call back the following day because their system was down. The 3rd time I was told someone would call me back because customer service was busy?!?! The final call I was told to fax my receipt to them then call them back within 48 hours to get a return address to ship the unit back to.

I read in a few places that it is \\"unlikely\\" that the low levels of ozone they emit could be harmful to people with conditions like asthma, but they don't really know with certainty. I also read that it may be best to run the purifiers when you are NOT home, and shut them off when you are there, again, something to do with the ozone.They may work great, and pose absolutely no health risk to anyone, who knows.

Also that 3rd party manufacturers like Ionic pro to name a few are built and filter the air a lot better the Ionic Breeze(brand name) models.The downside Unless you like the smell of air being electronic discharged like the smell of a lighting storm and headaches to go along with it then I would recommend to stay away from these regardless of the brand. If you don't mind it then go buy any nock off model just stay away from Ionic breeze which is made cheap and they also live up to marketing hype and advertisements to rely on business.

Andrew Berends captures the torment/anguish/ennui felt by a family of Shiite Iraqis living in Kadhamiya after one of their own is cut down by an American soldier as he was guarding a sacred mosque located within the district. It's difficult to discern whether or not the death of this young man was unprovoked. However the circumstances surrounding his death are moot and secondary to the primary motif running through the film: the reality of violence so pervasive that it is simply impossible to escape it. The cinematography is top-notch and combined with the superb editing gives the movie a narrative component that I've never quite seen in other documentaries. Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"works, now drop the price","review":"It does what it is intended to do. I just know it is over priced.

The descriptive language brings to mind an amazing story of environmentalism: \\"Though Joseph had rejected the world of men.....he could not be insensible to the beauty of the land.\\" The writer uses the most descriptive, colorful language throughout the book to describe the beautiful world we live on as well as taking us inside the hearts and minds of men who she surely believes will eventually destroy it.\\"The earth we abuse and the living things we kill will, in the end, take their revenge; for in exploiting their presence we are diminishing our future.\\" ~Marya Mannes, More in Anger, 1958"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing insight","review":"I first read this book aome 20 odd years ago, and just finished it again.

While it would be easy to draw parallels with the fictional Armagh family and the Kennedy dynasty, I prefer to think of the book as a testament to one Irish immigrant who found and then lost the American dream. The more disturbing aspect of the book (and one I always think of when a major news event takes place) is the presumption by the author that there are powerful men with money who control much of the destiny we call history. Do these men exist? Who can say? A riveting book and one worth more than one read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that great","review":"The movie is ok.

The four main characters seemed to have pretty good chemistry, although it was weird that the girl best friend was apparently attracted to two of her male best friends. That seemed to be overkill.The movie didn't seem as \\"low budget\\" as I expected. I like that it wasn't overly sexy (just one sex scene, not too much kissing). If it weren't for the the abrupt ending, I would have given this movie 5 stars. It ended suddenly and at an awkward time, without giving closure to the characters' love lives.

She espouses individuality and artistic freedoms over classical reproductions and socialism. The book is rich with metaphor, concepts and philosophy. Her characters are one-dimensional stereotypes that could be viewed as ideas, not as human beings. I found her depictions of anyone who needs a helping hand in society, as useless, less than human, unfit to take up space in the universe, to be extremely disturbing. Her glorification of rape, and her masochistic female characters saddened me. Ayn Rand was so fanatical in her beliefs that she neglected to present any problems with her point of view. She makes a powerful case for capitalism and individualism. Take what you like from it and forget the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand, The Fountain Head","review":"Very old book but true to the day on how mas media can make or break (shape) public opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I will read it again and maybe again. Ayn Rand had a mind like no other. Her characters are perfect and each fits into her story to last forever.

Above all, it is a love story and a story of great accomplishment against all odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissism at its finest.","review":"Narcissism at its finest. What a self-centered douche bag Roarke is. Were he alive today, he would obviously be an uber-hipster. Yes Keating is a prostitute willing to sell his soul and anything else to achieve his goals. But there is a balance between these two people. Rand makes out Roarke as this lofty human that is unwilling to sacrifice himself for anything or anyone. Were all people like him, this would truly be a cold and uncaring world.Rand may be a great writer. Read this if you want to explore other philosophies. Otherwise the story is bleak, dark, dreary and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"Yup, I still can't stand Ayn Rand. I thought that I had, perhaps, missed something when I read this as a teenager...not so. Her characters are one dimensional and all behave ( hero or villain) in superlative.

(And I speak as an Oxford MA Hons in English Lit, if that's worth anything, which I doubt.)However, Rand was a deeply mixed up gal. She worships rapists. (*All* the heroes in her novels are rapists - look carefully!)She'd have swooned at Saddam Hussain's feet. (He is, after all, by her definitions a man of integrity, naked strength and moral courage - true to himself. Just as a hyena is true to itself.)Rand's favourite characters are, as has been said elsewhere, psychopaths.Her female protagonists in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are, frankly, insane. Just as, I suspect, Rand was.Look more closely at her 'philosophy', expressed in her non-fiction works, and it disintegrates into a babble of circular logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"a naive and weak book","review":"Ayn Rand was so immersed in her heartless, simplistic ideology to take the time to create interesting, human characters. Instead, we have dummies inflated with rhetoric and ideas. I would hate to be in the room with one of these people for more than a few minutes -- some would bore me to tears, others would make me get violent. The plot of this novel is pretty weak, too.Rand's philosophy is very easy to understand, and as a consequence this \`\`philosophical novel'' is very easy to read. For readers ready for novels with human *and* philosophical content (and better philosophical content at that), I advise reading Iris Murdoch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fountainhead","review":"Various things are exaggerated in the book, but yet it manages to articulate those inarticulate views on e.g. individualism and collectivism that I've had for many years and was sometimes critized for.

Ridiculous, beats me as to why this is such a popular book.

Sure, it's preachy at times, but so was George Eliot or Dickens. Randians believe that the most effective way to help others is THROUGH enlightened self-interest. \\"Selfishness\\" as Rand discusses it, does not mean a lack of interest in one's fellow men & women. Rand understood that the attempt to CONTROL relations between people, through well-meaning restrictions on speech and behavior, always backfires. It ends up hobbling the one force that can create the new ideas that create a new reality: individual human energy. The tide has gone against Rand and her type of attitude, but that attitude is the only thing that can get us out of these dreary, sterile times. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inhuman","review":"Novels are about stories, right? Characters, emotions, real people, right?

It is rare that I can read anything with 700+ pages in less than a month and in this case, it happened. To the people who have said that this book is pure propoganda, sure it is, but what novel isn't? In most cases that author tends to throw in his/her own philosophies and this is no exception.

I found the book on CD for this at the library and listened to it on the way to work. Boy was I wrong. I loved this book, much more than Atlas Shrugged, and I still love Atlas. It's incredible, so I had to order it right away. Wonderful.

I found Fountainhead to be a better mix of philosophy and entertainment, although i reccomend Anthem also.As a college student, I am in the point in my life where I(and most of my peers I believe) seek the most direction. I believe that trying to find ones direction solely from outside sources can be destructive. I think many readers are apt to avoid the task of forming their own ideas by simply swallowing Ms. Rand's. Thus, many confused individuals are likely to commit the same mistake as Toohey's prodigies in the story.It is almost dissapointing that Rand has received the cult following she has, as it seems to me a contradiction of the philosophy put forth in the text.Nonetheless, I think this is a good book for everyone to read, just to gain another perspective on the world and living in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"oh god, it's worse than I thought\\", i thought holding a gun","review":"\\"oh god it's worse than I thought\\", I thought holding a gun to my own head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing and Life Saving","review":"I am a high school student. This is the most inspiring work I have ever read, and it has encouraged me to turn my life around.It is not meant to read like a novel. Rand means The Fountainhead to be a work of philosophy. The characters are unrealistic, but they are prototypes and help carry out her philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My life transformed","review":"As an archiecture student, I can feel the fire that drives Howard Roarke, and understand the cowardice of Peter Keating. In any art form, the artist must decide between the art for the soul, and the art for the masses. This book has inspired me to fight for the soul. My ideals on architecture, life, and love have been questioned by Ayn Rand, and now I know the answers. Individuality cannot be suppressed by family, friends, and the collectivism. That fire that is within all of us should burn without shame or fear. To live for one's art is noble, but to die for that art is far greater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberals beware...","review":"The story behind Ayn Rand's \\"objectivism\\" is wonderful.

Read it for the story and try to ignore the Limbaugh-style rantings and ravings that plague it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust your judgement.","review":"The Fountainhead speaks in a voice that always felt like my own but I just wasn't sure I was hearing it. Sometimes the inner voice could use a little confidence. The world of second handers, of people who would rather live unhappily ever after (and have society to blame because they did everything they were \\"supposed to do\\") than strke out on their own, is clearly spelled out in this book. The Fountainhead put into words a feeling I always had and has given me the confidence to atleast \\"attempt\\" to listen to my own wants and needs. Is Roark fiction? Of course. Is that life attainable? Probably not. Is it a goal? It is for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks","review":"This was the first novel about an architect's life I've found, so I'm giving it a rating of \\"1\\", hoping to find many more excellent books in the genre. I did enjoy The Fountainhead. It's a good book. The neat story line was easy to follow, and the 700 pages of simplified philosophy about life of human being as a creator gave me long-lasting relief from reality.

Neither. It will simply bore you. Your interest will not be held enough to be inspired or depressed. Others have said it best--the characters are unrealistic. Who could imagine such perfection and beauty? And oh, how boring to be intelligent, rational, self sufficient. You'd rather read books about characters that are less than you. You'd rather read about Todd's quivering loins, shake your head and tsk about Bridget's escapades. And who can blame you? If you got this review--congratulations. It was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief","review":"Good grief, this book is awful. Not only are the characters made out of cardboard, the plot itself is cardboard, not to mention the childish philosophy it promotes. It can appeal only to those who, despite being uneducated and without talent, have an exalted opinion of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"drawn out pablum","review":"Rand takes nearly 700 pages to reach her climax. To avoid spoiling such an excruciating experience, I'll say only that it involves Howard Roark pontificating for a good ten pages in a courtroom showdown. What's even worse is that Rand, who toots the horn of individual genius louder than anyone, can't write her way out of a paper bag. Her plot is a rickety construction to prop up her cartoonish characters (the rugged individualist hero, the women who love him, the men who envy him). Rand also shows a fondness for borrowed expressions (the French \\"par excellence\\" seems to be a particular favorite of hers; Roark is continually described as the the this or that par excellence), a considerable irony given her dogmatic attacks on the nebulous hordes of \\"second-handers\\" who have plagued studly heros like Howard since the invention of the wheel. Like any perversion, this book might be entertaining, but...[it]just isn't my idea of a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"You will love this book. It is a hard long read but worth it and never gets boring. The characters are great and really raises questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strawman Philosophy","review":"From the first fifty pages of the book, it becomes obvious both what Rand's politics (regardless what you may think about them) and how she will promote them. Specifically with obsurd liberal/leftist sterotypes that allow her to push over. From the professor at the books start who promotes the absolute perfection of the \\"classics\\", to a \\"liberal\\" populus who aparently accepts no deviation from the status quo, this book is an exercise in strawman politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really","review":"As much as Ayn Rand is praised for her insight, I found this, as well as Atlas Shrugged, to be predictable and pat. Rand's use of language is nothing special (even simplistic) and her philosophy seems dogmatic and out-of-date. In the cold war society in which this work was first published, it may have held some relevance, but, in the 21st century, it seems dated and glib."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED this book!","review":"I am a relatively tolerant person. I can read a book I disagree with and live. But this book was impossable. I threw it in the trash can halfway through. I don't have a problem with her characters, necissarily, but the way in which she portrayed the less perfect and heroic characters infuriated me. Those people are you and I, keep in mind. There is no Howard Roark; none of us can carry on a relationship with another person without speaking or contain the meaining of life in our art. It's jsut not possable. So if you want to read about how inferior and unaware you are, go right ahead and indulge yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Had to read this book in high school and enjoyed it then. Read it again just a few months ago for pleasure and had a much greater appreciation for it. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"The Fountainhead is one of those classics that ever reader needs to include in their library. Because the Fountainhead is sadly reliant solely on existential philosophy, the real gem in the story - the faithful expression of one's soul, is lost in a relativistic plot. Never the less, without much effort the reader can find a transcendent sense of self in the story's main character.Reviewed by, Dr. Jeffrey Wincel, author ofClimbing The Mountain of God, The Path to Mystical Discipleship,Surviving the Fall, America's Second Great DepressionandDefying the Trend: Business Ethics and Corporate Morality from a Faith Perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic work, although the publisher (A Plume Book) needs help","review":"Similarly to Atlas Shrugged, which is published by Dutton, the content being published is fantastic, as Ayn Rand intended. The general errors in printing, however, detract from the \\"Centennial Edition\\" printing. For instance, page 373 in 'The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition Hardcover)' the text is entirely bold. While Plume was better about the actual printing than Dutton (who publishes Atlas Shrugged Centennial Ed. HC Hardcover) it leaves something to be desired.It is unfortunate that one cannot rate the author, publisher, and the distributor separately.

I read the Fountainhead after trying to read her philosophical book on Objectivism. Finding that text much too dry in style and content, I thought a novel would be a better first Ayn Rand book. The Fountainhead is extremely dull and boring at points with only brief stretches of interesting writing or thought. Developing and presenting her ideas should be done in far fewer pages. Fewer pages would make the lack of character development, lack of rationality and lack of realism of thought much less noticeable. In summary, a high school level philosophy with equally unrealistic love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the blind love it's received.","review":"The first time I read this book I loved it. It fed all the soap-opera ideals I had about myself and the individual, and I romanticized the comments someone else had told me about it. I bought it again a few years later, and couldn't finish it. The philosophy is obvious and self-serving, and the \\"trial\\" of the last few chapters was a simple way for the author to make sure even the most idiotic readers got her point. Blech.At the same time, it's important that you read this book and formulate your own judgment of it. Just don't accept it without question, which is what everyone seems to do. There are some serious flaws to the philosophy that's represented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"Often, when an author has a thinly veiled political agenda--no matter what it is--the story suffers for it. While this book isn't as cringe-worthy as Atlas Shrugged, still, there were many parts of it that were downright strange, you could even say lurid. First of all, the author's contempt for the human race practically sizzles off each page. Secondly, Howard Roark is nothing less than a sociopath. Thirdly, that whole rape scene and its meaning was just nasty on many levels.

I highly recommend if you want to have an opinion on this controversial classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book about human strength.","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone. A statement of individual worth to be admired. A celebration of being human."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than art or architecture.","review":"This novel is not a commentary upon society and the community. Rather, it serves as a means of disection by which we slowly peel away each layer of that very same society and community. In a sense, with each page, we slowly disect ourselves. With the sharpest of blades, the novel slowly slices away each layer, until we reveal the tender regions of what we trust, beleive and rely upon. This is why one can both praise (as helthgiving), or hate (as painful), and why many miss the point or refuse to see it(as one does when a serious matter involving their health arises.) Ayn Rand's skill with the knife makes her cuts almost undetectable. And that is the same reason why her novel is so wonderful and so cruel. She simply choses to cloak the instrument in the finer aspects of humanity so as to lessen the pain. For Ayn Rand, Art and Architecture are the novicaine of our culture and thereby a means to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great read.","review":"This is onethat you can not miss.

Reading this novel may change your entire way of life, and how you perceive the world. Definitely an eye opener. Fore Warned is Fore Armed.PS There is a black and white movie adaptation of this story, but where movies typically fail to convey the true emotions of a novel, this movie superceeds failure. DONT SEE THE MOVIE UNLESS YOU READ THE NOVEL FIRST!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fountainhead serves those who \\"have problems with it\\"","review":"The book is alright but it would have been better if it dealt more with me instead of that selfish mean hermit Howard Roark.He keeps doing what HE wants instead of what others think he SHOULD do.He should not do that because it is anti-social. That is what I hate most about this book. All he cares about is what makes him happy instead of what makes me happy.I suspect that is why others rail against the book soooo much: Roark does not bow to them and they hate it. So do I, but I will give the novel some credit because for collectivists like me it gives us a villain to hate.Even if those low intellect people think he is a hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!!!!!","review":"I just got finished reading it. I had to write a paper on The Fountainhead for a scholarship and was not looking forward to the 694 pages that lay ahead of me. But about 15 pages into it, I realized that I really would enjoy it. Length is a factor that should never turn anyone away from a book. This novel was extra influential for me because I am only 16, and questioning how I should live my life and what I should think. I have learned to think for myself and become independent, just like Howard Roark. Now, I try to not care what others think of me, just be myself. That is what I hope others get out of this book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nature of competence and mediocrity","review":"The Fountainhead shows the clash of the two types of individual: the creator and the second-hander. Those who really run the world against those who get a ride in it without adding nothing of their own. If you want to understand why almost everything in the world does not work as well as it could, this book will enlighten you about the nature of competence and mediocrity and why the former tends to not be rewarded while the later is encouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Atlas","review":"Roarke is one of the best characters in all of literature.

I happen to believe this is correct. 95% of the population add little to the advance of humankind. In the workforce I have seen key people out perform ten coworkers.What I have not seen is a woman who prefers rape as Dominique does or a capitalist too good to compromise to make a profit (Roark). Rands' hate of the little people, \\"the second handers\\", and their miserable little lives and her avoidance of empathy, humor and even children makes her a misanthrope of the first order.The \\" Virtue of Selfishnes \\" by Rand is a much cleaner and shorter approach to understanding her core belief that when we act in our own self interest its better for the individual and society."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fountainhead Centennial Edition","review":"A timeless classic everyone should read; one of the few great pieces of literature written from a right wing point of view. This particular edition is very compact (appr 4X7 inches) which has its advantages but forces the use of very small type, too small for many people to comfortably read. My 4-star review is not 5-star solely because of the type size."},{"rating":"2","title":"No redemption","review":"I had been curious about this book in particular and Ms. Rand's philosophy in general.Every character in this book is reprehensible.Not one major character has the slightest in redeeming values or value.No major character is noble in any sense of the word.The book is interesting and worth the time but if you are looking here for answers keep looking.PSThe stilted 30's dialogue is laughable and ludicrous unless you keep in mind the context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, although long, novel","review":"This is one of the best novels I think I have ever read because of the presentation of a gripping story with an intellectual and philosophical undertone.... this is a wonderful book that strikes upon some of the most significant morals or belief systems in American and developed society - capitalism, altruism, cronyism, independent versus collective thought and action, and much more.

That is the way to live, the reason for creation and the only human morality. Ayn Rand in this book defines the true meaning of human ego and what it takes to be a true egotist. A good thing \\"ego\\", not a bad one.I for one is someone who has read the book and for the most part beleive in it's presentation, conclusion and application of the ideas presented in the book in real life.Whether or not you fully agree with the principles presented in the book, it is a must read if you fulfill one criteria.. you must be a human"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice introduction to Rand's views","review":"This is a nice introduction to Rand's views I think for those who don't have the will to finish the significantly larger work of hers... Atlas Shrugged. It seems long enough that people should be able to fairly easily gain an understanding of what she's about, although I really think that if possible people should probably go for Atlas Shrugged first.Both are certainly classics and should be read by anyone seeking a greater understanding of life, philosophy, and politics. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORTURE!","review":"This book was torture! (Or was that the idea of it!??!) Based on recommendations from friends and colleagues I decided to read this book. I knew by pg 65 it wasn't for me, but I continued to read it hoping there would be a miraculous plot twist that would suddenly turn the story around. That didn't happen. It was a predictable story about a group of pathetic self-centered individuals who were constantly back-stabbing each other.The only likeable character in the entire novel was Gail Wynand. And I don't know if he was actually likeable or I was desperate for something new by that point.Was the novel really 400 pages? It felt like 4,000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It said the condition was mint - good, but someone had written in the book","review":"I thought this would be a nice gift. It's weird when you give a gift that a previous owner has written a note in. Other then that the book was in good shape, but a note on the inside cover is not what I thought I was buying.

So far, The Fountainhead has been intellectually and philosophically unrewarding. The writing is not so bright either and I see no literary value in The Fountainhead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of solipsistic trash","review":"*The Fountainhead* is Scripture for Ayn Rand's cult of selfishness. Its proponents tend to be those overly frightened by and unaccepting of the prospect of an existence that is at best unpredictable and unknown--it gives false comfort in its upholding of universal \\"moral\\" priciples. This is the same kind of thinking that was behind the \\"White Man's Burden,\\" \\"Manifest Destiny,\\" and the eugenics movement of the 20s and 30s. \\"Fascist\\" is *not* an extreme epithet to tack to this piece of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Me","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged a long time ago and thought it awful. Just to be sure, I read The Fountainhead awhile after and sure enough it was awful too. It was inconceivable to me that anyone would mistake this woman for a writer or philosopher or even someone you would want to have any more to do with than an unexpected swallow of sour milk. So now, 40 years later I find she is on lists of \\"classic\\" authors, and even a US postage stamp. Oh God, spare me. I only hope that those who proclaim her magnificance have never read Faulkner, Hemingway, Cormac McCarthy, or even Steven King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Trash","review":"The Fountainhead is neither brilliant nor well-written. It is overly long (but not as disasterously as Atlas Shrugged) and the characters are stock-issue that exist to forcefully move along Rand's \\"point\\". The philosophy that emanates from Rand's work--Objectivism--is very shallow and extremely selfish. It resonates with cold-war hysteria that fails to take into account the base needs of others and the very concept of interpersonal relationships. She reduces women to vessels for reproduction, and spits on the very concept of love and giving. She is a vicious shrew, and this comes across quite clearly in this book and her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"ayn rand must be very impressed with herself","review":"ayn rand is dumb. objectivism is dumb. the fountainhead is dumb. i fail to understand, to empathize with the dimwitted people who fall for this crap. the lady obviously thinks she is moving a mountain with every worthless word that she writes. her characters are exaggerated, her dialogue is melodramatic. i couldn't find a plot. everything seemed to be leading to a point that she never really got to. this book can only appeal to weak spirits that are easily lead. shouldn't have even given her that one star.if anyone wants to challenge me on this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average - Philosophically Moot","review":"This book is unnecessarily long. It is only a little interesting. No one really claims that this is great literature, but the following are claims that generally praise the book:1. It is inspiring2. It is philosophically admireableClaim 1 is subjective and possibly true for some. But claim 2 is just plain mistaken. Rand's novels are at most some type of applied philosophy in fictional form. At worst they are repeated batterings of a wild worldview. Anyway I can't recommend spending money on this. Afterall, there are tons of legitimate philosophical works out there, and most self-help books are probably more effective than this for motivating. But don't take my word for it. If you're still compelled to read this then go for it. Maybe you'll like it for some unique reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand changed my life","review":"as you can see from this review page, people either hate this book or love it. I love it. to those who say that Ayn Rand is into communism or socialism or some other collectivist thing, let me say YOU STUPID FOOLS, READ THE BOOK AGAIN! there is no such reference in this book, in fact, there are many references against it. all of my friends told me not to read this book. if I had listened to them, I would have been deprived of the best expirience of my life. Ayn Rand says in this book that you cannot live your life for others. this is true. whether you believe her or not, you should read this book. it is a shame that they do not teach her in high school or college. we would have a better society if they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Defenitely one of the best books I've read. I agree 100% with most of Ms. Rand's ideas. Her defense of selfishness is very well based and she proves her case. The characters are amazing and make you realize what the \\"modern\\" ideas are really about. As revolutionary and important today as it was when first published, especially for people living in countries such as mine, where populist and colectivist propositions still fool the majority and where freedom is not praised by many; a country where individuals are left no good options when it comes to choosing authorities. A book for people who have principals and stick to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"This book is awful.

You can buy a paperback version on Amazon for under $10. Publisher is foregoing much revenue by pricing this book at this price.Don't buy this book at this price. Worth reading but you can get a cheap copy anywhere. Is it a ploy by the publisher to try to raise lagging white book sales?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Be Honest","review":"Ayn Rand is not a great writer.Somebody said that Faulkner's first works were \\"about as good as anyone would expect.\\" He had a point. You cannot expect someone with no writing experience to produce great work. They must learn to do so in reference to other great writers and thinkers. Ayn Rand did not do this. She created objectivism instead. Objectivism, beyond all the words, is merely a blanket that protects people from criticism--\\"I don't have to listen to him because I have my own voice.\\" As a result, The Fountainhead comes to life as the work of a novice so thoroughly convinced in its brilliance.If you really want to know Ayn Rand, read her philosophical works. They're still a trap for cultists, but the portrayal of humanity will be less embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand Ayn Rand","review":"Sorry to be the lone philistine. I believe there was a black hole at the center of Ayn Rands's soul and it eventually consumed her. Reading her fiction is more despair than hope, more heat than light.There are heroes and villains in good novels-there are plenty of good novels out there. Wading through this one was a joyless enterprise. Ayn \\"the Supreme Being\\" Rand died old and alone, still hating.

Very few people are interested and it kills the frog.Regardless of what you think of Ayn Rand's then breakthrough ideas of capitalism, selfishness, etc., you must pick up this indubitable powerhouse of a novel.The protagonist, Howard Roark, is quite conveniently a total orphan with no social moorings or responsibilities. This allows the author a great deal of liberty in weaving philosophical tropes around him.The presentation of the ideas though is simply delicious, couched in some riveting writing, and will keep your thought mills running for a good while. I underline my books and The Fountainhead is almost entirely colored.A must-read.

As far as I'm concerned, this book is seriously overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charity at it's Best","review":"I give this book five stars for many reasons. I developed deep respect for Howard Roark's profound intelligence and insights. Peter Keating keeps me on my toes throughout the book. I found myself leading a quest for his integrity. What I liked best about the book was the appreciation it gave me for the world concept of charity and gift giving. The world cannot afford for each individual to believe as Howard does. In the real world man requires more assistance from man than he acknowledges. Five stars for Ayn Rand's wisdom and insights. Perhaps the book is less about self and more about the importance of charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking and Interesting Novel","review":"The Fountainhead is a book meant for the intellectual.

The Objectivism theory certainly has its good points, though taken to the extreme it would make the world populated by insensitive, uncaring bastards like Roark.There doesn't have to be an absolute choice, altuism or selfishness: you can practice both and still be true to your soul. But woe to those who become second-handers - they are the mesmerized zombies of society.There is not a likable character in this book, but it's still oddly compelling to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly accurate social commentary","review":"I found the Fountainhead to be amazingly insightful.

The power of the inividual and the independent nature of him, she argues, is the base of all subsequent motions one will make in life.She argues very eloquently, through characters that entice you, disgust you, and enamour you, that reason is the only thing that man can rely on. Often, she says, men are just a shell containing the opinions of others.More to the point than \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this novel is the foundation for Rand's other theories and is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neofascist propaganda","review":"The problem with The Fountainhead is that it is intended to seduce its target audience (high school and college age kids) to embrace right wing politics. Kids who read The Fountainhead have seldom ever read or have a clear understanding of politics, philosophy, and sociology. After reading The Fountainhead kids will come away parroting Ayn Rand's polemics. Kids who read The Fountainhead remind me of kids who used to study the works of Karl Marx in the 60s and 70s: they put down the book thinking they now have all the answers to life. Most kids abandon objectivism (like kids in the 60s and 70s abandoned socialism) after they experience life. But, oh, how annoying they can be until then! The book still wields a cult-like trance with the young which is why The Fountainhead will always remain (after the Bible) the book most kids claim changed their lives.

By all means, read this book if you are interested in the development of right wing ideas, but understand that this is not the work of a woman who knew much about what she attemptedto describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd fascist Ubermensch philosophy, Atlas is terrifyingly devoid of clarity. That it has become a holy book of a cult movement for 40 years is a testimony to the unholy persuasive powers of the author and to the dreadful pathology of her followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a great start I felt I was being talked down at","review":"I was incredibly engaged in this book when I first started it. 70 pages in I was excited about where this story was going. Around 100 pages I got this horrible feeling that the world Rand was creating was so unbelievably black and white that the book seemed to be written by a 15 year old who could use adult's words.

Her crisp, concise style of writing reflects the personality of the novel's hero, Howard Roark, as well as her belief in Objectivism and an Absolute Truth. The Fountainhead entices a reader to become caught up in the drama of a fast-paced plotline, while also asking that person to answer questions about personal beliefs, the political and social state of the world, and the nature of existence in general. It is not very difficult to enter an Ayn Rand \\"phase\\" of life as Hillary Clinton and Alan Greenspan have admitted to doing.

I couldn't quite put to words how this book has moved me until I got to the chapter on Howard Roark. Within the first few pages when the young man is staring down at what Roark has created I felt as if I was there. Ayn Rand writes about Roark, \\"He did not know that he had given someone the courage to face a lifetime.\\" Aren't we all at some point in our lives searching for a reason to go on something to truly live for...? I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever struggled with trying to understand the good and evil of society.

Her ideas are startling and powerful. However, chances are many people go through their entire life without ever hearing her name. Strange, isn't it?The reason is because Ayn Rand has a philosophy of individualism. She believes people should think for themselves independently. Doesn't sound like anything scary, does it?Pre-Internet, you probably never even heard the name Ayn Rand. That's because the media establishment controlled everything - television, magazines, radio - you name it. Ideas were in the hands of a few. Do yourself a favor and read \\"The Fountainhead\\".

Amazon currently advertises the this book in paperback for $9.99 and yet want the Kindle readers to pay $20.99. It appears Penguin Publishing wants to do in the electronic book concept. Since we still are in a free market, I choose not to buy the Fountainhead at that outrageous price or any other book published by Penguin. Further, Amazon is without blame, they should not accept the publisher price of $20.99 but simply state the Fountainhead is not available in the Kindle format. Kindle is about to screw up a great concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a classic in the field of \\"doorstop literature\\"","review":"Note to recent readers: The bad taste in your mouth *will* go away. Five years ago I read as much of this book as I could endure. Today I'm happy to say I remember nothing but the barest outline of the plot and certain mental images associated with some of the events. I've done some stupid things in my life but I take glowing pride in the fact that never did I once consider becoming an Objectivist. In years to come I'm sure the world will come to realize that Ayn Rand's greatest legacy was that her books, her philosophy, even her conduct of life all lend themselves so readily to satire. And what is it with her and Kant? It's like reading Stalin's denunciations of \\"Trotskyites.\\" And kinda funny if you know anything at all about the real relationship between Kant, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone should read this book","review":"i don't even want to say why, but this book changed my life, and you shouldn't read people's reviews of it because anyone you know that recommends this book will let you figure it all out for yourself. not only is the book extremely well written but it applies to anyone anywhere and has taught even the people who wrote terrible reviews of it something about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written, Obvious Plot","review":"This is a typical Ayn Rand novel. If you are part of the school of Objectivism, take a second to read back through this book. I find it ironic that the woman who started an \\"intellectual\\" movement can write in such an obvious (and poor) manner. With no subtlety in style and little suprises to the plot, this novel truly reflects the shallow depths of American intellectualism. I'm baffled at it's long standing popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible of a Satanistic Cult!!!!!!","review":"Yes, that's true. Anton La Vey, the leader of the Church of Satan, used the ideas of Rand when he set up his religion. Also as every decent person can see, Rand really hated ordinary people. The only ones acceptable are psychopathic Ubermenshen. If this ideology comes to power anywhere in the world we will see the Holocaust once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly Symbolic book","review":"Yes, the characters are impossibly extreme, butthey are not there to be 'real'. If it were 'real'it wouldn't be fiction. She said she is a romantic,and that the characters are 'What we should be'.Just wanted to say that first.The symbols and ideas of the book however, arealmost impossibly real. Honesty (the best policy)takes on a different tone in this book, Self-honesty.The sex scenes are good, the speeches are long, theplot is easy to figure out 50 pages ahead of you, butyou don't know the end (unlike King/Koontz/ect)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious MUST READ","review":"Seriously this is one of my top 5 books I have ever read. This author not only learned english, but came up with her own philosophy. This book is the beginning of her philosophy, it's not completely ironed out here but in her book that followed this one \\"Atlas Strugged\\", that's where you fully see her completed philosophy (Objectivism). This is a heavy book but it makes you think. The characters are SO well developed that you think you personally knew these people! That's one of Ms. Rand's best qualities as a writer. She develops her characters so well. They have many demensions and layers, which you don't always find in books now adays. This should be a book everyone reads at least once, if not more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Toohey gets shot at, and tells the press that of course he's not pressing charges and that he wishes they'd just let the shooter go?

And if you love living an independent life read the rest of Ayn Rand's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMERICA AT ITS FINEST","review":"As an American, I find this book fantastic. However, this manifesto of reason, capitalism, and individualism, has created many foes. All that can be said is that this book illustrates accuratly and with grace the American culture, and particularly America's founding principles.

Although lengthy, this book was probably the best i have ever read. It really makes you think about society & philospy. Defintly worth a re-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Fascist and Homophobe","review":"This book, while being celebrated as a philosophy and a story, is nothing more than a lot of excess words on paper. Ayn Rand's so-called epic is a childish rant of sorts that calls to mind the selfishness of Holden Caulfield while not being nearly as compellingly written. I won't say much of the life she led and that it's odd that she is one whose ideas seem to all too frequently be adpoted.In reality, I must say that she writes a monolgue like no one else, but I cannot forgive the implications or content of a book so obviously self-involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This is certainly and most definitely the most boring book i have read in my whole life.There is a lot of hype created around this book and that is why i think a lot of them thinks that if the book is not liked by them then they are not literally normal..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Uninteresting and Rather Pedestrian","review":"Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead was a ridiculous farce that didn't spare the good sense of its readership. I found her use of similie quite boorish and plebian. The author is clearly of a mindset which dictates her outrageous behavoirs. She is a product of the sub-culture which nourished her desire for world domination. It is clear that this book is a cry for help to be removed the world in which she is forced to live by a domineering husband. Ayn Rand's style of prose is detestable at best. We're all less enlightened for having to read this unimaginative, unitelligable work. Tee-Hee, hee."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophmoric","review":"this is comic book Nietzsche. If you like this, do yourself a favor and read the source of this tributary. That it is writ by an ex-patriot Russian she male should give pause to her(?) politics, and such an hyperbolic ad hominem attack is justified due to the juvenal nature of her corpus.That this is still read should make any thinker pray for death or roused to kill. Gods! Stifle the bile climbing my throat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG this book threatens our very existence!","review":"We should totally organize a massive public bonfire and torch all of Ayn Rand's books. At the very least we should be censoring this type of literature so that impressionable teenagers don't read it and become MINIONS OF SATAN!I was one of the lucky ones who consulted a college professor before reading this. He told me that I shouldn't read it because I was especially vulnerable to its message, and that I might blindly follow it. Boy, am I glad I listened, or I might have found out the hard way.I think Rand is a total FASCIST for advocating smaller government and self-determination. I'm sure she would have felt right at home in Nazi Germany. SIEG RAND!"},{"rating":"1","title":"About as Brilliant as Black Chalk","review":"The ultimate kindergarden philosophy posing as something worthwhile.

This 600+ page book really surpassed the mental limit that I had placed on boredom. It reached the peak and cannon-balled straight into the clouds. OK, I must (sheepishly) confess that I read the entire book. In my defense, I thought I would give it a chance. Big mistake. Supposedly, the story-line deals with identity, morals, beauty, change, and everything else underneath the moon. Sure, any 600+ page book has to throw in some ideas (vague and uninteresting as they are presented). The most amazing thing is that Ayn Rand is a famous author and...there is an institute named after her! In one word: WHY?!? This is quasi-literature at its finest and I can't believe that this is a celebrated novel. (Incidentally, I am not bitter because this \\"novel\\" (using the term loosely)was typed in the smallest of pixels known to mankind. Well...that just made me even more disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this in High School!","review":"Back in the mid-1960's, I read this book for pleasure and may have written a Book Report on it.

Even though communism is thought to be dead, there are still many people who would like to get something of value only because they \\"need\\" it rather than earning it. We advance as a free people because of the worth of the individual, and his achievments.Now try this one: you decide to hire an architect for your dream home.

Triumph of the individual again.A great read and re-read, don't miss it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, anyone?","review":"The Fountainhead's enduring popularity remains a mystery to me. Really, this novel is a fairly standard romance with a lot of heavy-handed philosophy thrown in. Howard Roark's rugged individualist shtick isn't anything we haven't seen before in other novels. Sorry, folks, but this novel is absolutely not what it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howard Roarke Sex Offender","review":"How can no one be disturbed by the scene in which the paragon of virtue, Howard Roarke rapes the heroine?

But instead I have got a copy with white cover which is very small and has very small type which I hate.I am probably never going to buy books from Amazon again as this is my second experience.I have to get what I ask for. Sending things back is a hassel I want to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Book, but Don't Buy the Centennial Edition","review":"This is an amazing book that you will remember forever. I read the mass market paperback version in high school and I still have it. I decided to re-read it (something I rarely do) and wanted a nice copy to keep, so I bought the hard cover \\"Centennial Edition.\\" It's basically a mass market paperback with a stiff binding, cheap paper and tiny print. It's much smaller than a typical hard cover, no dust jacket, and overall very cheaply made.I've read several Ayn Rand books and The Fountainhead is one of my favorites of all time, but the purpose of these reviews is to rate the product that you get from Amazon. This product is poor. I definitely recommend the book, but get a different version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicker read for Ayn Rand","review":"I definitely prefer Atlas Shrugged to Fountainhead, but this is a quicker read and may be appreciated by those apprehensive about the length of Atlas Shrugged.

What starts out as an eloquent yet simple tale about Howard Roark the striving architect becomes a struggle to maintain man's individualism. The true hero of this novel is egotism, while selflessness, as surprising as it might seem, is the evil. This is easily one of the greatest, most profound, books I have ever read. By the end of this book you will be thinking really deeply about your personal ideals and societies. Sure, it is not short but it is definitely worth the length!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bloated Overrated Mess","review":"A mix of unbelievable soap opera and long-winded philosophical rants about the supremacy of the individual, this book's sole redeeming value is that the protagonist, Howard Roarke, is to some large degree modeled after Frank Lloyd Wright.

Beyond that, a bloated overrated mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"beause I cannot give it zero stars...","review":"It amazes me the amount of effort some reviewers have put into explaining the failings of this book.

And, oh, she doesn't know the first thing about architecture, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fountainhead","review":"This book was not in the shape it was represented to be in. It was very worn and it was written in. That is not how it was described. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that started it all.","review":"This is Rand's Great American Novel - it presents an inspiring view of individualism worth re-reading over the years. Roark is a self-actualized, self-motivated individual. Rand contrasts Roark's character with three fascinating male characters; Keating, who betrayed his dreams by conforming; Toohey, who deliberately seeks to destroy greatness; Wynand, who lives a tragic mistake. My one disappointment is the character of Dominique - Rand was not yet able to project the female equivalent of Dagny in Atlas Shrugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I first read this book as a junior in high school, almost five years have passed and I have read it 4 times already(practically once a year). This is an excellent story if you take it from a fictional point of view and it is also filled with great political and ideological viewpoints. I find this book very inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Howard Roark","review":"This was definitely a life changing book for me. I read it in high school and immediately fell in love with Howard Roark and all of his ideals. Rand did an amazing job putting together a novel that really expresses that intangible desire to be more -- particularly considering the fact that the book was written in English, which was her second language.The fact that most people who come to Rand as a writer move on to explore her philosophies, well, that's somewhat of a disappointment. I did, too. Ordered all sorts of pamphlets and immersed myself for a while in all of the Objectivist activities. But she was not a perfect woman; she was not a good role model or philosopher. But she WAS one hell of a story teller. And this is a story to hold close to your heart.It also is an ideal gift for anyone making a big change in their lives -- graduation, moving, job change."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not the idea thats the problem...or the story...its both","review":"rand has the guts to put out a piece of propaganda under the guise of literature but i would think most intelligent readers could see through that. art and politics can certainley mix -- id have to say though, it's nice when the politics help the majority of people (benthem) or the 'art' brings forth something from your mind and senses...i gave you a chance ayn. the most i got out of this was a few 'spurts' of reason and thought...she could have been a better writer but dropping \\"plot.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Rand","review":"It is very difficult to review Any Rand: many people despise her work and ideas, and others are bouncing off the walls and joining the Ayn Rand institute. I have a lot of questions for her but I still bounce off the walls. This is not of book of \\"real\\" characters and it isn't supposed to be--this is a dramatization, almost cartoon-like, but still full of deep, totally new and differing people. Reading this was a roadtrip for my mind and I appreciate the unapologetic, straight-foward and well thought-out logic that says that altruism retards society. On this note, I oftentimes don't agree with Rand or can't see how her ideas can implemented well in \\"real\\" life, but she makes some excellent ponts and raises interesting questions that serve as scrumptious brain-food. She sides on the extreme and lets the responsible reader look elsewhere for a differing point of view.I love it, just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent read that requires hard thought.","review":"Ayn Rand may get too philosophical at times throughout this novel but never strays from relaying her ideas through Howard Roark, Peter Keating, Dominique Francon and all the multi-layered characters. It was the contrast of these characters that kept me involved in this novel. Rand quite beautifully sets her characters up as opposites to one another and then through intense characterization explores how these opposites interact with one another. Setting these complex people up against the competative world of architecture shows just how confused and interesting these characters can be. Be prepared for some intense thinking when you get ready to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel that is a waste of time","review":"This is a good book with interesting ideas about objectivism. But, it is just too long and wordy, and the same ideas could have been expressed in half the number of pages.The storyline borders on the ridiculous and extra-ordinary coincedences throughout the book, and I had to wade through 400 pages of boring text and dialogue before the point was expressed in the end.2 stars because of the ideas in the book, but otherwise, if you have read the back page and the summary in Amazon.com, then you have gotten the idea. Skip this and spend your money on a pizza instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 725 page rant... on selfishism","review":"Rand's irrational philosophy is expressed (at length) in this poorly written book.

Since I've recently seen the movie Atlas Shrugged - Part 1, I though it would be a good idea to download The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged on my Kindle. Well, when I saw the cost to download either book to my Kindle, I decided, no, you really don't want to download those books, not at those outrageous costs. I would really like to have these books on my kindle but I will NOT pay those ridiculous dollar amounts for the books. Well, I guess I will just pull the books off my book shelf and read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Impressionable Young Minds Filled With Mush","review":"The average reader of The Fountainhead is a young male (usually Jewish or Christian) no older than 21, who suddenly finds all of the answers to life in this book. Filled with newfound wisdom and insight, he starts to read anything Ayn Rand has written, criticizes philosophers like Kant without ever having read them, sneers at the poor and disadvantaged, begins to parrot Ayn Rand's speech and writing style, winds up voting Republican or Libertarian, and becomes very annoying to have around.Rand is usually the first introduction many kids have to literature/philosophy/economics/politics. Thankfully, most outgrow her by the time they have lived life a little.I know. I was one of the kids who got lost in the Ayn Rand cult.Enjoy this hypnotic book at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes trite but always entertaining","review":"\\"TheFountainhead\\" was my first encounter with AynRand. I have read many works since. Yes, her characters here are blackand white, and wouldn't you know it - out of 7 million souls in New York City, a handful central to the theme are constantly rubbing elbows. And yes - it sometimes reads like a cheap tabloid, but despite the obvious ending and overbearing idealism, this is an entertaining piece of work and weel worht the long read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confirmation","review":"I had read this book as a young girl and decided to read it again on a recent vacation; stayed up 2 nights reading could not put it down. Even as a woman I so identified with the Howard Roark's character. The struggle between altruism and egotism is one that we are faced with on a daily basis. Maybe the best position to be in, is a balance between the ego and altuism; or is this a \\"cop out\\"? To be a true egotist is so difficult to achieve in today's society and perhaps can never be achieved; but we must try. Self love is the only true freedom; when you love self then everything around you becomes beautiful; you begin to operate from a position of non-judgement. Oh! if only we all could get there what peace we would have in our hearts and on earth. The individualist rules!!

For 700+ pages, it was a good and fast read. If I ever put the book down for a while, when I picked it back up, I felt as if I had not lost a beat.

I was so surprised when it set off the alarms and started running around trying to figure out the problem. Worse, this happened at about 8pm and I live in an apartment building. The alarms would NOT shut up. My crostada had only been in the oven a very short time, so 425 for a few minutes was enough to do it.

I popped it in the preheated 425F oven with some leftover pizza for 8 minutes. After about 2 minutes it started smoking and set off our smoke alarm. At first I thought this was due to some poor oven cleaning, but the smoke started pluming quite abundantly after another 2 minutes, clearly emanating in all directions from the baking sheet. Obviously I'm not the only one to have this problem, but it does seem I got a defective and that this is not par for the course. I just hope I don't get sick from inhaling whatever that stuff was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute JUNK - There's a Reason It's on 4 for 3 Promo","review":"I have one of the Silpat's which is more expensive and love it for baking. It saves messy cleanups and is more environmentally friendly than continually using parchment paper. When I saw the Matfer product was made by Silpat and was significantly less expensive, factoring in the 4 for 3 promotion, I bought two. The first two that came were absolutely filthy, having grease marks all over the edges. In addition, the white edging was peeling/flaking off both mats. Amazon's return service was a dream and I reordered replacements for the two defective mats. Well, guess what - the replacements' edges were also peeling/flaking off. I've returned these to Amazon and once I get my refund will purchase the more expensive Silpat product. Don't waste your money on these less expensive items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, where did I go wrong???","review":"I used the Matfer sheet for a pizza crust but didn't have it more than 5 minutes in the approx. 400 degree oven before a horrible smell filled the apartment and the smoke alarms began shrieking. This was a brand new sheet, so there was no residual grease on this matt, as one suggested to another experiencing this problem.A few others with the problem also seem to be in an apartment, so perhaps the smell is better tolerated or not as noticeable in a larger house? Or did a bunch of us get defective sheets? Until I'd find out, I couldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird smell, weird taste","review":"As some other reviewers have mentioned, the sheet leaves a chemically taste and smell in your baked products -- it's nothing awful, but noticeable, and, to me, bothersome. I thought it would fade, but after a few attempts I figured my \\"wear-in\\" efforts weren't worth all the cookies ending up in the trash. The surface of this baking sheet was easy to wipe clean. However, the grease from the food eventually started soaking into the sheet and leaving circles of grease which I just could not wash out. At the end of the day, I don't think this is any more convenient or better than using parchment. This product is overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switching back to parchment paper","review":"I thought I would save the hassle and money involved in using parchment paper to line my cookie sheets by using this Matfer Exopat nonstick baking sheet, but I am disappointed and am switching back.My cookies spread out too fast on this sheet and got too flat and brown, just like what they used to do on the cookie sheet without any parchment paper.My other problem with this item is getting it clean. I have washed it with soap and hot water multiple times, but I can still see the grease from where the cookies baked. I can't get it clean!I am disappointed in this item and am going back to parchment paper. I would recommend you save yourself the $10!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Taste","review":"The first several times I used my Exopat I was totally convinced I would never cook on parchment paper again. They were totally as described by so many reviewers, a nonstick wonder. The bottoms of cookies were perfect and uniform in color and browning. Over the two months since I have had them, a peculiar, nondistinct taste has been detected in the cookies I am baking on these sheets. It is very subtle, but nontheless, an undesired taste. I use the same cookie dough and did a nonscientific experiment and the cookies baked on parchment or plain baking sheet did not have the same peculiar flavor. Is the silicone stable??? I have decided not to bake any longer on these sheets. I will find other uses for them but they will not be used any longer for baking cookies on. I would love to know if anyone else has encountered similar problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Last winter, I just tested a bunch of cookies recipes and ran out parchment paper really fast.

So I made my cookies and very excitedly put them on the exopat sheet. 2minutes later my smoke alarm went off. There was a horrible smell and smoke and the alarm would not stop no matter what.

I use these sheets only for rolling out dough now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine is already pooping out-only used it about 8 times","review":"Maybe I have a faulty one, but I used it to bake cookies and make a few french fries and it is starting to peel at the edges. I do not believe it will last for 3000 uses.Pretty alarming since I read from another reviewer there is fiberglass in it. If it gets worse I will throw it in the trash and unfortunately add to a landfill.

I typically would use aluminum foil to bake, but figured I could save some money by using this re-usable non-stick mat. Well, turns out that it was just as sticky as aluminum foil.I baked cookies on it a few times, and the cookie smell actually got baked into the silicon. Even after washing and washing, you could see grease circles were the cookies baked.So, you are paying for a silicon mat that is a pain to wash, seems to stick more than non-stick surface, and soaks in grease. I went to IKEA and purchased a dupont non-stick cookie sheet for 4 dollars and never looked back.My EXOPAT MAT ended up in the trashcan after a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement for aluminum foil","review":"My brother has always struggled with getting his pizza off aluminum foil wraps when he bakes them in the oven and tore through so much foil.

They are space technology for your kitchen, and it works. The pros use them for the most delicate things like drying wafer-thin slices of fruit, and baking the most brittle and soft conconctions you can think of. Anything, absolutely anything will come off these sheets with no effort at all. Anybody who has every made pignoli cookies for example knows how difficult it is to: a not burn them on the bottom, get them evenly done, and then peel them off the parchment without tearing the soft cookie apart. No more woes like that using exopat! No greasing required, either. These mats are easy to clean and last a long time. Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"This mat is a must-have for candy making; it passed the ultimate test: caramel-nut clusters. Over the years I have tried parchment paper, wax paper, thick layers of butter, and the cheap red silicone mats, all to no avail. The clusters always stuck, and were either broken or had clinging bits of paper.Today, I made a perfect batch with this mat. There was not even a hint of sticking. The mat easily came clean with a dishcloth. I am ordering several more tonight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a copy that isn't as good","review":"I bought this product thinking it was as good as a Silpat. NOT!!

Cleans easily, stores easily and saves money because you don't have to waste all that parchment paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I really thought I'd have an easy-to-clean baking surface for cookies, bread, etc. This mat was useful two or three times and then food started sticking to it and now, after I've used it about 12 times, it is dirty, impossible to clean and heading for my trash bin. The main point is that stuff does stick to it, and it is really impossible to soak and wash off. There were no instructions for cleaning or treating the mat when I got it so if I've done something wrong (I used it and wiped it clean, that's what I did) I'd like to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing product!","review":"This product is amazing - no more sticky cookies!! It's priced to give you amazing value...no complaints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing sticks!","review":"I don't cook a lot, but saw a review of this in a magazine and bought one when I was browsing around Amazon.com. I have used it several times, and nothing sticks to this mat. You place it on a cookie sheet and anything that goes on top of it cooks evenly and then simply lifts off the mat. I made puff pastry hors doevres that positively slid off this mat when they were done. I didn't even need a spatula!! It's gadgets like this that make cooking fun even for someone like me who really hates to go in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moveover, Silpat!","review":"Don't spend $20 or more on Silpat! These are almost exactly the same and do just as good a job as any other product I've seen. Cookies slide off with ease - yes, I said SLIDE OFF. That's after they're cooked. Cleanup is a breeze with a soapy sponge. I caught them on sale here at Amazon.com before Christmas and couldn't resist.

No more messy oven! I broil fish on them and sweet peppers to remove the skins. I even make \\"chicken and rice\\" by mounding the pre-cooked rice in the middle of the cookie sheet with the soup and chicken on top. What a mess it usually is - no more. I wish only that exopats came in sizes to fit my 9x13 and 9x9 pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks down over time","review":"I have owned this for two years and stopped using it once the edge started flaking off.

Now I use parchment paper exclusively and there is no danger of getting chunks of it in my baked goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Everyone that I spoke with raved about this product but alas I cannot concur. I placed it under a pie that I was making to collect any spill-overs and ended up with a smoke-filled kitchen. The run off from the pie burned onto the mat and refused to come off. Also, the mat started to unravel on the edge. All of this from just one use! The mat was completely ruined and needless to say I was very disappointed with the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"These silicone baking mats are great. Cookies baked on these mats never get burned like ones cooked right on the sheet-pan. Also, unlike parchment paper, which is used once and thrown away, these mats can be used over and over again. Plus, they're a snap to clean due to their natural non-stick surface. Amazon has a good price on these mats considering Bed Bath & Beyond has a similar product for almost twice the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is so versatile, cookies, chocolate, grease catcher, etc... everything wipes clean. buy a few.

This hasn't caused any kind of problems at all, but I worry if they enlarge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for the price","review":"Works just as well as I would expect the more expensive versions to be. That said, it's larger than my current cookie sheet; not exactly a problem with the mat, and it doesn't cause any issues baking.

This is a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick!","review":"I know this is especially valuable for pastry cooks, so it's a little embarrassing to say that I've only used it (so far) for fish sticks, but, man, it's totally wonderful. I got a similar one for my sister (who IS a dessert cook) a couple of years ago and she raves about it. I do, from time to time, make things like scones, and have traditionally used parchment paper - I am eager to try this sheet for that. Also, I'd like to see what it does with roasted potatoes and other vegetables - the high heat it can take is truly amazing, and in combination with a sturdy non-stick baking sheet, there is virtually no clean-up to care about. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try this at home if you have kids","review":"I bought this based on all the glowing reviews. Yet like a few others posted here. I tried them out for cookies and triggered the smoke alarm and had this horrible smell in the apartment for the rest of the day and night. I tried emailing the company but never got a response.

The cookies had an interesting bottom texure from the exopat which was different from parchment or greased sheet. this texture did not affect flavor at all.The exopat really does handle burnt sugar and can be used to effectively make truffles and other chocolate confections.You might want to occasionally wash the thing but it is very little maintenance.if you are serious baker or even one who does not like to deal with mess than the exopat is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor buy this item","review":"This is the greatest thing for bakers.

The author is employed by Panavision and, at the time of writing, has no experience with other cameras.Particularly when post-production fx are required, one of the most important aspects of any electronic aquisition format is the compression ratio it employs. So I found it somewhat disturbing that this issue was entirely ignored except when critisizing the Viper for having to have a hard-disk recorder because it can't compress the image (and yet the F900 is 4:2:2 with high compression).However, the author did mention Star Wars II as an example of the quality of the Panavised camera, yet this production employed a hard-disk recorder because of the problems caused by HDCAM compression.I think the book shouldn't have such a general title when the contents are dominated by something so specific and reads like a sales brochure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really deep","review":"This book is just a commercial for the HDW F900 camera and an \\"ode\\" to Panavision (the employer of the author).

Nothing about compression ratios, sub-sampling, and subtilities of HD formats. And nothing about post-production.It's all about sony and Panavision and the ability of the hdcam format to equal the specifications of 35mm film (laughs). Nothing about other vendors and formats; not even a word about DVCproHD.

The novel, in three parts, allows each character a chance to relate his and her take on this life-long three-way love affair. As in most of McMurtry's fiction, it's the woman who comes across as the one best in knowing exactly what she wants and in control of the situation. McMurtry is funny, poignant, and above all, interesting and entertaining in these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to read.","review":"It took quite a while for me to get into this book. I just finished reading Texasville prior to starting Leaving Cheyenne. I was expecting more after reading Texasville. The book was written in the manner that an uneducated early Texas settler might speak, thus making it hard at times to understand. The story is told in three intervals with each character contributing his/her point of view. Too much emphasis was put on Gid (the main character) to leave so abruptly and shift to the thoughts of the other characters. And their parts were too short in comparison to Gid's. The characters have potential and the book worked off of a similar plot, I thought, to The Man Who Rode Midnight by Elmer Kelton. I suggest reading Elmer Kelton's book before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowboy Days of Our Lives","review":"If you want to enter into the world of three of the most boring characters ever, by all means read this book. This is a world where cowboys drop by to see lonely women and (wonder of wonders)HAVE SEX WITH THEM! Yes, the cowboys desire adventure and they even go off once to sell some cattle. But in a bizzare plot twist, one turns around after a few weeks and believe it or not, returns home and has some more sex with the lonely lady. The fact that none of the characters has much more to say than \\"I sure missed Gid,\\" or \\"I really loved Molly,\\" really keeps you flipping those pages. I am a great fan of this writer and I'm open minded to seeing all sides of his creative world, but as I read this book I kept getting the idea that he was trying to corner the Jackie Collins crowd. Read Lonesome Dove again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I love several of Larry McMurtry's early novels, such as Horseman, Pass By and The Last Picture Show. This novel is reminiscent of these great novels (all are set in Thalia, Texas), but falls short. As usual, McMurtry depicts quite flawlessly the atmosphere of growing up in Texas. The main character of Gideon is multi-dimensional and intriguing, but Molly and Johnny remain enigmas. That situation makes for a long read, especially once the main point of view shifts away from Gideon in the later half of the book. At this early point in his career, McMurtry also did not seem to understand women - seeming to view them as existing primarily to tease and please men. The story gains momentum and the characters become richer as it prgresses, but by that point, I was just wanting to get through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instead of Leaving Cheyenne, I say Leave This Book Alone","review":"I don't know how a talented writer like Larry McMurtry managed it, but somehow this short novel reads like one of the longest books I've ever read. It seems to drag on and on, and at the end, I still couldn't figure out WHY Gid loved Molly and why he liked Johnny, because I disliked them both, but only in a lackluster way. Let me put it like this: I am currently undergoing physical therapy that, among other things, requires me to sit still for 30 minutes at a time, 2-3 times per day, and this book is so dull (yet annoying) that I found staring into space more satisfying than reading, and normally I'd rather read than eat.

It is real, down to earth, clean and very witty."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What?","review":"This is one of those movies that, when all is said and done, it makes you want to ask \\"So what?\\" and \\"Who cares?\\" None of the characters has any truly redeeming qualities, the movie seeks to convey no real central compelling message. Most of the tragedies that occur to the protagonist (although it is difficult to discern who is the real protagonist here) are her own stupid fault, so again, who cares?It does throw in a lot of gratuitous titillation, lots of skin and peeping tom stuff, perverty flashes and whatnot. I'm not sure why, but it does. Again, it left this viewer asking, So what? Who cares? What's so special, you gotta make a movie out of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, please....","review":"To call this stuff soap... well, I don't want to insult decent soap producers.

Of these different paths such as Raja Yoga (Yoga of mind), Bhakti Yoga (Yoga of devotion) and Karma Yoga (Yoga of rightous work); I could best relate to Jnana Yoga. I believe westerners would feel the same because Western Society has scientific bend of mind. This book is about the \\"Logic\\" of GOD. It uses deduction as a method to uncover secret upon secret. It contradicts the commonly held belief that there is some Superuser sitting up in the sky, running the whole Universe. It explains how that is false. It preaches nothing. It deduces.I would also like to mention that my profession is about Logic, the descipline of Computer Science. And I find this book no less rigorous than CS books I am used to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent description on this subject","review":"This book gives exceptional description on themerits of yoga.

Nevertheless, after 4 months, the unit started excessively leaking steam and water. I sent it in to Briel's service center in New Jersey in May - as of today (Sept. 21) I still don't have it back. I have called, been promised that it is shipping in a few days, more times than I can count. So, I've waited 4 months (and counting) for warranty repair of a unit that was only 4 months old. I've sent a letter to Briel's HQ in Portugal requesting that they send me a new unit, but have had no response. I am not going to purchased a Briel product again.Maybe even more discouraging is that Amazon has been completely unwilling to help in this manner.

We have only had it a week, but so far, are very pleased. We plan on using it several times a week. The unit is sharp looking and easy to work. I like using the pods since that takes the struggle out of determining the exact grind needed but I plan to work at that until the technique is mastered. My only small complaint is that the frothing attachment drips a little water when the pump is operating although it heats and froths the milk like a champion. At this point, I would recommend this espresso maker without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but overall disappointing and defective","review":"Given all of the rave reviews, the price, and the product description I thought that choosing the Briel Cadiz was an easy decision to make.After about a dozen brews the valve that regulates steam output no longer closes completely.

A few hours later, after bringing the skirts home to finish, I couldn't even see the marks with indoor lighting. I had to retrace all the pleating lines the next day. It didn't work on the other types of fabric I was working with either. Complete waste of money & an even bigger wast of time. I'd give this zero stars if I could. I ended up using the chalk tracing paper that came with my machine that had been sitting around for 7 years that had never been used & that, while a bit messy, still worked better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to swing!!","review":"Amazing sound quality. Great music. Includes informative 44-page booklet on Miller's history and informative liner notes on each song.So why only 4 stars and not 5?First, the running time is only a half hour, but seeing it was recorded in 1983 (when the average album's running time was 35-40 minutes), I can understand why. Also, although these recordings are stunning, they are not originals. But that would defeat the purpose of creating a superior sounding CD, which is why these songs were re-recorded with a digital mood!!

To say that the interpretive quality in this music is 'wrong' seems to be missing the point, for music is an expression of some single avenue or idea. This is why Glenn Miller wrote this music!

Those who did not want to go to war against Iraq had to decide what to do. One idea was to support Saddam Hussein in any misadventure he happened to choose. Another was to impose some sanctions on Iraq.In effect, Saddam Hussein decided to keep food from Iraqi children and blame any resulting problems on sanctions. That's a crime! But in this petition, Boyle allied himself with Saddam Hussein by blaming those who imposed the sanctions.That says something about Boyle.If Boyle had truly been opposed to a war with Saddam Hussein, I think it would have made more sense for him to argue in favor of sanctions. And if he had truly cared about the children of Iraq, it would have made more sense for him to argue in favor of removing Saddam Hussein from power, given that Saddam Hussein was the one responsible for many of their problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is less than stellar","review":"The volume is crisp, and nicely audible.

There is superfluous obsession with technical detail, such as the protagonist's cybernetic abilities.

I let it languish on the shelf for over two years and only picked it up with passing interest. I became enthralled with Michener's style of weaving historical and archeological tidbits into a fictionalized portrayal of the eons of geological forces and peoples that have shaped Alaska's culture and landscape. This is a fascinating look at a fascinating part of this Earth, and Michener is a formidable storyteller. While not the best writing I've encountered, it's good enough to turn what might otherwise have been a rather ho-hum narrative into a book that on several occasions I haven't wanted to put down to go to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages yellowed, took forever to arrive","review":"For starters, I ordered this at same time as other books from vendors whose delivery terms were the same; this one arrived a week later than the others; I could have used it for my trip to Alaska a week earlier! When it did arrive, while it was clean and complete, the pages were so yellowed it could hardly be read. Stated condition was USED - VERY GOOD. Not true. Also, the binding is so close to the printed text that print is obstructed unless you literally crack the spine. Some pages even then it's a real struggle to read text that was close to the binding. I understand that is a problem with the manufacturing of this book but I would expect the seller to mention such a serious problem with a 1000+ page book (or not sell it).

This might be excusable, considering the length of the novel, but the taping quality is very bad. There are many distracting gaps, often as if it was edited in mid-sentence.

I remembered that Michener had written a book about Alaska and wanted to read it. My trip was very much enhanced by the information provided in the book. I believe I enjoyed the trip a little more because of prior knowledge of what had taken place over the years. I am not daunted by a long book if it is able to hold my interest. This was, I felt, a great way to be introduced to the state. Great characters, settings, etc. I feel Michener really did his homework. I purchased this book for a fellow traveler who wanted to read it after the cruise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another thorough account by Michener","review":"This book indeed makes one want to go to Alaska. Or, like in my case, makes one want to go there even more, despite repeated descriptions of mosquito swarms just waiting for their prey. As usual, Michener gives us a very thorough history of a region, with accurate details and dramatic fictional events. The story starts with the shifting of rock plates, eventually forming Alaska, and ends with Alaska receiving statehood. The only problem I have with Michener's novels (hence four, not five, stars, despite the fact that the book is an excellent read) is that they all follow an identical scheme. Nothing imaginative here in terms of literary form. Great (and recommended) as a start to learn something about a place, though. One of my favorite Micheners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to go North","review":"I must first disclose that I am a James Michener fan. Well of course this is a great book! It naturally starts out like all of Micheners stories from the VERY begining. It is interesting to note that I read over one third of the book before it really mentions the United States. The descriptions of the freezing cold actually felt like it lowered the temperature. Being a part native American (Hawaiian) I could really feel sympathetic towards the natives of Alaska as they were used and abused. Micheners description of the Salmon is classic, it confirms the author's reputation. Once again Michener makes you feel like you were there, and the story is engrossing.

I have been looking for a entertaining story to read to my toddlers that instill some of the values that my husband and I want our children to grow up with. Magical Chango was given to me by my mother, who knew that in today's society values were not being taught to children. We are so involved with our fast-paced lives that we tend to forget to stop and teach our children the very basics of civility. (P) Magical Chango is my gift to our children. Through a wonderful magical tale, my children are able to envision our teachings to them. The great part is, they just think its fun. Chango gives my children, through their imagination, the enpowerment to respect themselves and eventually as they grow older all others around them. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to instill values, insight, and manners into our precious gift, the children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This documentary makes you want to go out and persue your dreams right then and there! It's a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Instinct and Human Psychology","review":"Although the word \\"math\\" appears in the title, this book is mainly about instinct and psychology. About half the book contains discussions on how animals instinctively do certain things that have some foundation in math. The other half of the book looks at how humans perceive and behave in math-related situations - from infancy to adulthood. The book is very well-written, very clear and easy to read. Those who are math phobic have nothing to fear here; in fact, they would likely find this book very interesting in the sense that they would learn something fascinating about themselves. Other than for those who are math phobic, this book has something for psychology buffs as well as animal lovers. But most importantly, it should grace the shelves of math educators as well as those who are interested in the reasons and possible cures for innumeracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, lacks substance","review":"Despite the intriguing title and nice printing paper, this book is very unsatisfying. It lacks substance. All it boils down to is the idea that animals can do math because they can do things that people would need math to figure out. Beyond that we just \\"learn\\" by repetition that that this is a result of evolution/natural selection. Some would say this is obvious, others \\"how do you know?\\", but either way it certainly is not insightful.

The acting was the kind that you would find on a soap opera, or in a film like THE OMEGA CODE. Plus, a movie like this should not have an open ended climax where the credits just pop out of nowhere, much like the equally awful LOST SOULS.

When I rented this film I expected something of a more supernatural tale (And a better written story!) The end of this film left me feeling that there needed to be a little more, and I don't mean that in the sense that I didn't want it to end. I mean to say that this film leaves you hanging and feeling that you spent your time watching a film without a complete conclusion, and not in a manner which would lend itself well to a sequel. In my opinion, a few tweaks of the plot would have made this movie all that more exciting and satisfying! Enough about the story...The acting perhaps was the finer point of this film, with Heath Ledger delivering a capable interpretation of a priest from a disappearing religious clan. The supporting actors and actresses also did a fine job portraying their characters.Overall, I give this film 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy","review":"\\"The Order\\" is one of the most boring movies ever made. I didn't think it could get any worse than \\"Cold Creek Manor,\\" but I was wrong. It's sad to say that the menu screen of the movie is the best part of the movie. That shows you that the rest of the movie stinks. The Sin Eater likes to put bread on a sinner's body and the bread relinquishes the soul of all iniquities. That's as interesting as the gum on my shoes. Heath Ledger looks gauche in a role that was meant for a fossil. Shannyn Sossamon is very misplaced as an exorcised patient of the hero. Everything else in this movie is blah! Never again will I watch this movie.

There were some plot points that were predicatable but I found that they did not detract from the movie in the slightest. I was pleased with the movie and found it quite refreshing that the movie was not preachy (it was neither pro church or anti church). I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies such as Underworld, Sixth Sense and Others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Order is a delightful sin eater.","review":"I like this movie alot. I was totally involved in the concept and it has a fine cast. I always saw more than good looks and a sexy voice in Heath Ledger and he hasn't steered me wrong. He's very versatile and I admire his choices. I love movies that invite the viewer to participate and also stir the pot sorta speak. Films that offer another perspective. I don't understand why critics dismissed this film ( especially since Brian Helgeland was doing something different ) but I'm sure glad I didn't.

This investigation leads the audience through a dark world of demons and cults and I enjoyed every minute of it, from the deep and sublime screenplay writing to the dark and spooky atmosphere. The performances are top-notch, also, especially from Heath Ledger, whom you'll remember from \\"The Patriot,\\" where he played Mel Gibson's cocky warrior son. If you're looking for a scary, and intelligent, horror film, give \\"The Order\\" a shot! When you're afraid to turn the lights off that night, you'll think of me.

Heath Ledger is a good actor but I hate to see that he agreed to make such a boring movie. He plays a priest who is sent to Rome to investigate the death of a highly revered priest. I suffered through this film only because I had spent the money to buy it... luckily previously viewed so it was pretty cheap in price. I couldn't wait until this movie was over with. I don't even consider this movie a thriller.

The ideas introduced within the movie were interesting. The follow through was non-existent.I was left with so many questions.

Rather than build on cheap gore and a cliche premise it relies on a heavy dark brooding atmosphere and a creeping suspenseful gothic plot. Think more Edgar Allen Poe and less George Romero.What makes the film interesting is it centers around the religious ritual of sin eating which was an actual practice in parts of Britain and Ireland where a beggar would be paid to ritually eat the sin of dieing person, thereby granting them access to heaven.The acting in here is superb and the plot though creative is far from confusing or hard to follow despite what others have said in their reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Vatican City has a Secret Rave Bar?","review":"There's a plausible premise for a horror film in this hodge podge of a movie - unfortunately, any discovery of it is three or four script rewrites beyond the version currently being served up. Even if you can wait till the third act, when the movie starts to pick up steam and supplies a little intrigue, you still have to sit through a number of ridiculously stultifying scenes and some of the most god-awful, dull dialogue imaginable for the first hour. The directorial and writing lapses are so shoddy and glaring they're near unforgivable - but don't take my word for this - just look at the actors' embarrassed faces as they mumble through this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship is evident","review":"One would expect better quality from a tool maker like Grizzly.

The production values are outstanding, as this is from the Classic Disney period. Thus the 4 star rating. However, the movie consists of several episodes which don't blend together very smoothly. And the characters Alice meets are nearly all really weird or nasty, which is not very appealing to a young child. (I don't see how a walrus tricking baby clams to leave their mother, only to be eaten, is good child entertainment). We have bought several other Disney classics which our daughter enjoys more. But she did like this one to a certain extent, as she sympathized with Alice.The songs in this movie were not as catchy as those in other Disney productions, such as Peter Pan and Cinderella.There is a strong irony to this movie, as Disney was all about creating magical fantasy worlds, and Alice in Wonderland is about how a fantasy world can be bizarre, sad, and ultimately dangerous.

I cannot imagine a child watching this movie and getting anything out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Disney film","review":"This is perhaps my least favorite of the classic Disney animation features... It's a cluttered muddle that simply does not capture the essence of the Lewis Carroll books, mainly because Carroll's subtle humor is buried under an avalanche of Disney kitsch, but also because Disney failed to capture the willful, prickly spirit of the Alice character... or indeed, to give her any personality at all.The real problem isn't that this adaptation dilutes or distorts the original story, it's that it just isn't a very good film -- the script is disjointed and confusing and the animation follows suit. Obviously, it being a Disney film, there are millions of people who love it, so take what I say with a grain of salt... just look at the hundreds of \\"five star\\" reviews that surround mine. But I honestly can't recommend this one. I think it's a dud.

For some unknown reason, \\"they\\" decided to make this a more contemporary version. It's too fast, jumps all over the place, too many animation details, redone characters don't fit the story, the original songs are revised, cut short, and hyped-up, to give just a few examples. I am at a complete loss to understand why this wonderful story had to be tinkered with. I sure hope they don't do this to Bambi, Pinoccio, or the original Pooh. The reason these originals are so valuable, (especially Pooh), is that the characters have personalities. They relate to one another and they take time to have a conversation and work on mutual problem solving or just having simple fun. They teach a moral that doesn't get lost in the quest of being \\"modern\\". My three grandchildren, age 3, age 3 1/2, and age 5, are inthralled with the originals.

She begins to pay more attention to her cat as she suddenly catches a glimpse of a dressed rabbit. The rabbit grabs her curiosity and she follows the rabbit into a hole. In the hole she trips and she falls into what seems to be an abyss that leads to a fantasy land where things are not as they appear, and they appear as she has never known before. Alice in Wonderland is based on Lewis Carroll's novel with the same name and his story brings the audience through a fantastic adventure where Alice's curiosity brings several philosophical ideas in regards to general curiosity. The film is an interesting adventure for both young and old, as it unveils adult contemporary themes as well as eye-catching phenomena for the young, which ends in a marvelous, yet odd, cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful To Watch As Usual","review":"Alice in Wonderland (Disney)Was looking for this on DVD and had no idea how much it could cost.

That \\"Painting the Roses Red\\" song is just stupid, especially when the painters' cards are dragged away, they are singing stupidly about being beheaded! And speaking of which, that Queen of Hearts is one of the dumbest Disney Villains I have ever seen!

Adapted from the brilliant story by Lewis Carroll, but with classic, colorful Disney animation and both fun and endearing songs, this version keeps to its literary roots and entertains. The Disney classics are worth getting, if for nothing but the beautiful animation and fantastic singing which they no longer have in abundance in many of their newer films.Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorites (still! - lol) in both the original book and Disney's animated adaptation and I'm thrilled to be able to share it with my toddler who will eventually be reading the book when she's older. Love it. Get it. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Disney!","review":"Alice in Wonderland is truly the magical dreams for children.

Many of there movies have done this well. They still continue to do this with recent jems like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet. Along the way Disney has made a few bad ones a few stinkers with horrible unmemerable characters and stupid stories. This was there first. Alice in Wonderland is not the worst Disney film ever but it is close. It involes a girl named Alice gets traped in a place called wonderland. Nothing makes sense she walks through it. Rather then befriending some of these weird characters and saving this world from some distaster she simply walks through meeting one annoying character after another accomplishing nothing, learning nothing, just getting annoyed in a world of jerks and idiots. I don't recomend this for children or adults. It is too rude for children and way too stupid for adults. Pass up this stinker and enjoy Disneys other classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancel this item","review":"Neither appropriate for kids nor for adults.

The rest of the story is very well known to everyone, but this DVD makes it very fresh and enjoyable. The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is well... the Oyster scene. It is a bit off topic and doesn't quite fit with the rest of the story.Also, the Ugly Duchess was not included in the film, which is one of my favorite characters from the book.They should have cut out the Oyster story instead!However, this dvd is a MUST HAVE for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I had never seen this film until I purchased the DVD. I had read quite a bit about it, and most of the stuff I had read was negative: critics didn't like it, it lost money when it was initially released, it didn't follow the original source works, ect... But to sit down and watch this thing is a real treat. The animation is beautiful and the art direction is stunning. I enjoy the Disney movies, but this one really stands out as far as I am concerned. I have never read the original works that the film was based on, but for my money, this picture feels cohesive and whole it's design and animation - which I feel plays a big part (subconsciously for most people) in the overall enjoyment of a film. Mary Blair's design influence is very strong and this film is a knockout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work","review":"Although I haven't seen a Disney picture since Aladdin, I've never had a complaint about the quality of their animated work.

I love that when they decided to put this movie on DVD that they made the color's even more vibrant then they previously were. It is to this day one of what I think is the best of Disney's Animated movies. I always think of the white rabbit, saying \\"I'm late, I'm late for a very important date.\\" and Alice looking around in intrigue at everything around her after she is down the rabbit hole. If you have not seen this movie then you are truly missing out on a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"no, really? do i need to review this? if you know it - its everything you know, if you dont - well its about time you watch it!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Film Adaptation to Date","review":"I loved the story of Alice from the first time I read it as a child. It is the 3rd most quoted literature in English after the Bible and Shakespeare. The surrealism does a better job of portraying the absurdity of our modern world than any other piece.I have yet to see a film that does justice to Alice, but Disney comes closest, and is therefore the best way to introduce children and uninitiated adults to Wonderland. Salvador Dali praised Disney as America's only real surrealist, and the surrealism is adeptly employed in this wonderful film.This may be my favorite of all the animated Disney films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Special Edition","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful film, and this edition is no different... providing extras and interesting commentary, new songs as well as singalongs, and more. Worth noting is that the extras are primarily adult-oriented, other than the singalongs and the Wonderland Party. The Disc 2 features, like 'An Hour in Wonderland' are more informational and historically based, something that I'm not sure that children would enjoy as much as long-time fans of the film might.Overall, it's a great DVD with interesting features, and of course, a wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice in Wonderland Special Edition","review":"I was a little hesitant about purchasing Alice in Wonderland Special Un-Anniversary Edition.

The songs are cute and Disney-esque, and Alice's adventures inspire all of the many imaginative people out in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Alice In Wonderland","review":"When you review the film remember this: IT WAS MADE FOR CHILDREN AND CHILDREN ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU THINK. The movie is a journey inside the brain of a young girl, Alice, and it is therefore a work of the imagination, an escape from reality, and a reminder that a child's imagination must be allowed to grow even as a chld must grow to accept the limitations of reality. A person without imagination is like a history book without pictures. For an adult version of \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" see \\"Being John Malkovich\\". There are many similarities between the two movies: the tunnel, the small door, the problem of being too big for one's environment, and the eccentric and strange characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"My daughter got this for Christmas and loves it.

In the film Alice is on trial for causing the Queen to lose her temper. And they leave out some important characters. The Duchess, the Frog Footman, Humpty Dumpty and the White Knight. They said that this film had no \\"heart\\" I saw a Warner Brothers version that had as much heart as this one had comedy. But the Childrens Company Theater version is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice in Wonderland 2004","review":"I bought this from the Family DVD Warehouse and it came fast!

Disney later admitted that he undertook his version before reading Alice, and discovered that he didn't like the main character!It shows.Disney's Alice is not the critical observer Carroll created at all. She is indistinguishable from all of that era's Disney heroines - helplessly feminine and mindless, but sweet. Thank goodness everyone has moved on.Unfortunately this is a film that (like Wuthering Heights) had yet to be made. But maybe that's not so bad.

The story is as disjointed as the book. Full of unsympathetic characters. A lot of things happen in the movie but not much substance. Has a dreamlike feel to the whole production. The better Disney features usually have a meaningful lesson or a strong story and they would do better in the future. I liked the Cheshire Cat, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I wonder what Lewis Carroll was taking when he wrote this book. Just look at Alice as she takes one pill to grow big, then one pill to grow small. This story that takes you through the dreamy mind of Alice. If you really look close you'll see some political satire from the time of Lewis Carroll. Example: The small king and the really fat queen running after the free thinker Alice, Alice being thrown out of the flower garden because she's not their social type. This story was really ahead of its time, I guess Lewis Carroll had to make it a childrens story; a great story for both children and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"I had seen this movie before when I was younger, but I recently took a greater interest in the story because I read Lewis Carroll's original version.

I've come to love pretty much everything that John Garcia has been a part of, including every Kyuss album (except for Wretch), Unida, and Hermano's first album. Although the first album is short, it is far superior to this sophomore effort. There just really aren't any songs that stand out. \\"My Boy\\" and \\"Life\\" are the only ones that I really can see myself listening to in the future, and neither of them hold a candle to Kyuss' best. Trust me, I really hate to write this and bag on one of my favorite musicians, but this album really doesn't do it for me. I'd say if you want to check out true material from Garcia, then definitely go out and grab some Kyuss as mentioned above, or Hermano's first album, \\"Only a Suggestion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lurtz, buy with caution","review":"I resently ordered this item.

We contacted Amazon and they told us that we could either (i) take a discount, (ii) buy another wheel on our own, or (iii) return the entire bike and they would replace it. We took option (iii) and dismantled the bike, packed it back in the shipping box and waited for the new bike to show up a few days later. We got all the parts the second time around. However, when my son started riding the bike up hills, the gears started to skip. We have contacted Mongoose customer service but have not heard anything back.

Since this was a birthday present it made it late, however I can't blame WSports for this since it seems like it was a shipping issue. In fact I would give kudos to WSports for their fast response time in this! Thanks WSports!Aside from the original damage the bike itself is pretty nice. But, like other reviews have stated, be ready to use your last reserves of patience when you adjust the brakes and gears. It is not a 5 minutes job. But once completed the bike is fantastic.

However, I DID NOT at all feel being \\"propelled through every foot\\", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them.

It's the heart-warming true story behind the 1988 Jamaican bobsled team. After jumping through numerous hoops such as racial discrimination, a coach with a shady past, and a rickety bobsled, they land themselves a bobsledding spot in the Winter Olympics, something Jamaica never had before.John Candy gives a stellar performance, unfortunately it was one of his last. At times he's comical, while others, more dramatic. He's a character easy to fall in love with. I miss him.Overall, Cool Runnings teaches the fundamentals of determination and never letting anything come between yourself and your dreams. Even when catastrophy ended the Jamaican's third bobsled run, they still got up and carried their sled across the finish line. Even if their time didn't earn a gold medal, their heart did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Family Movie","review":"This was our first experience with Amazon Instant Video and we would recommend it to anyone.

John Candy never picked his movies carefully, but he hit on a good one for him here. This is Rocky I without the blood and melodrama, a root for the underdog movie that doesn't leave you feeling cheated in the end or ashamed you actually sat through a movie with a preschool plot.The bobsled scenes are exciting and colorful.

A very nice way to expend no braincells for an hour and a half and laugh quite a bit in the process. The script is a little obvious at times as Malik Yoba (in his first role-- he's going places, trust me on this) falls into the hate-love role with one of his teammates and John Candy gives inspirational speeches, but this isn't the kind of film that you rent expecting a really good script.

Eventually, you get better and then figure out the solos for some of the harder levels.I only played Smoke on the Water, Iron Man, and I Love Rock and Roll, but every minute was totally worth it.Also, if you can, get another guitar. Going head to head is just too much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"Absolute blast...people of all ages enjoy it. Popular among my 20-something friends, and also our 50-something parents. I hope they keep making sequels with new songs...or, it would be cool if you could go online to \\"buy\\"/download more songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rory loved this one!","review":"I purchased guitar hero for my son. I wanted guitar hero one because after much research on the guitar hero series, I thought it best my son start out with one and work his way up to 2 and 3. My son is tough to buy for but this was a hit. Though he never asked for it, he loves it. I think this video game is such a great success because unlike learning to play a guitar in the traditional manner, kids today who want instant gratification find it with this video game. From the very start you are playing songs you know from begining to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music game yet, if not the best thing ever.","review":"Since getting Guitar Hero, I:Have gained an appreciation for heavy metal. By pretending to play it, which cannot be done without making heavy metal guitarist faces.Have started hearing pop music in a completely different, much more interesting way, noticing details of composition and structure that used to wash over me.Have taken up the actual, wood-not-plastic guitar.Have lived the dream of rock stardom, from novice to journeyman to legend, in full, in my living room. No, they really DO get this one right.So I thought this list was going to be longer. But any one of those things alone is worth the price of the game, and some are worth the game and the system, so the whole package is like a 75% savings. At least. This should be an inconsequential little novelty game, but somehow it really seems to matter.(A sequel is in the works. You will want both.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"In our 50's and love it!","review":"Great for hand-eye coordination in us older folk and we found we can still keep a beat to rock music! We are past the rock music era, but suprised to see several songs we grew up with that we still remembered. We did fair on the beginning level, but only played a few times. Had a great time interacting with our daughter and son-in-law and getting a bit \\"hip\\" once again. It was GREAT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, they put a lot of effort into making this game","review":"Coming from a Guitar Freaks fan, I rate this game higher than Guitar Freaks.Song Choices, Guitar Controller, Difficulty level, everything is just right! Very well worth the $70 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original songs and cheesy animation but it is great fun anyway.","review":"When I first realized that these were not the original songs and saw that when I played \\"Ace of Spades\\"- no Lemmy... \\"Iron Man\\"- no Ozzy- I was pissed. But before I knew it I was hooked and didn't care. I first saw this game at Best Buy in Cambridge, MA and there is literally someone on the guitar in that store all day playing this thing with people lined up waiting for them to leave. One person said \\"It's worth it to buy a PS2 just for this game.\\" And I play guitar and I have to say that you will enjoy this game if you play or not. And you don't need to know how to play guitar to play the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Hero- 18 year olds perspective","review":"Ok guys and gals...I grew up in the 90's but am a huge rock fan...this game kept me going for hours, and i don't even play the guitar! I can play great songs by Stevie Ray Vaughn, ZZ Top, and Motorhead. All things about this game make it the best PS2 game ever created... Halo 2 = XBOX as Guitar Hero = PS2...yeah its that great. Of course there is always room for improvement...i still want to play some AC/DC and Metallica...but i love this game and have a hard time putting it down...Expert is one tough cookie, but once you get it complete you feel awesome!BUY THIS GAME!!!

It's loads of fun and is very challenging for hours. If you already play guitar, like me, it's a lot easier to get through it. I breezed my way through easy, medium, and hard(except for Texas Flood by Stevie Ray Vaughn). I'm on expert now which is EXTREMELY difficult. I watched my brother play who has no experience on guitar, and it took him about 10 tries just to get 3 star performance from I Love Rock and Roll. So, if you already know how to lay th game will go a LOT quicker. But its still loads-o-fun! there's unlockable guitars, characters(including the GRIM RIPPER), songs, and \\"making of\\" videos. A fun game overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking Fun","review":"I have played the Japanese game Guitar Freaks, but I think Guitar Hero is much better. This game is definietly fun!!! You can quickly learn easy mode, but other modes will be a challenge. The guitar is very nice too. The only thing that bugged me was the notes you have to play scroll on the screen pretty fast and give little time for you to think and the background behind the notes sometimes made them hard to see. More practice with the game most likely overcomes this minor problem. I recommend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PS2 Guitar Hero I -- great game!","review":"This is a great game. My son and I played it in the store a month or so before Christmas and I was so happy that he put it on his wish list so that I would be able to play too! So he got it for Christmas and it was a hit with everyone. I think some of the songs are pretty difficult, but then I haven't played it very much. With 3 levels, there's a lot of room to improve your skills, and still be challenged. And then, there's Guitar Hero II! Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"DIVA CHICKS\\" Love Guitar Hero","review":"This was purchased for my daughter who has really enjoyed it.

I never buy direct as these kind of organizations are known to be slimy, and I recommend that you purchase from a third party as well.I love dance workouts as they are fun and educational and therefore I will actually do them. These are the best. You MUST start with the starter kit \\"kick start\\" disc to learn the moves. It's a workout in itself! Then you can progress to the extremely challenging dance workouts. The girls do go very fast and don't give you a lot of verbal cues, but you have more visual assist (in the camera views) than you could ever need.

They do mix it up with some dance moves, but many, many of the the moves are march-in-place- repetitive. DanceSport LLC customer service is TERRIBLE! It took them 3 tries to get my address corrected.

They act like they wrote the book on punk rock, and devote all their talk and their equally stupid scenester website, buddyhead, to ragging on just about EVERYTHING! The problem is, they don't have the music credentials to back it up. A piss poor imitation of the Stooges, Jesus Lizard and Drives like Jehu. They where mildly funny at first, but it has since gone downhill. Pathetic hipsters who love to talk trash.Just visit buddyhead, tons of other useless \\"too artsy and cool for you\\" self-righteous garage rock bands to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kanker Sores","review":"While Joe and the gang were busy trying so hard to buck the establishment and stay true to their punk roots (ha!), they accidentally sigined a major label record deal with BMI and put out this piece of garbage. The music is a luke warm mixture of bands that were breaking ground ten to fifteen years ago. You can tell they put a lot of work into it, but it just didn't turn out right. It's still gonna sell though, because they are on the same label as the White Stripes. I'm curious to see how these \\"true punks\\" deal with record execs. Joe probably read Johnny Rotten's autobiography so he'll show those record execs how punk he is. It's okay to like money. We all like money. I don't know whay this band can't admit it. They better start liking it soon though, or they will look very hypocritical. I can't wait until the next publicity stunt they pull, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is as close to garbage as actual garbage","review":"I saw this band a couple of years ago open for the yeah yeah yeah's and I don't think I have ever been privy to a bigger on stage disaster than what I saw there. This band reeks something awful. Maybe they have gotten it together since then, but I doubt it. Nothing constuctive could possibly come out of the ear explosion that is the Icarus Line. It just goes to show though, teenagers looking to rebel will find anything as there muse as long as other people hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"When a band makes a record cover as horrible as this one, you can tell they are trying way too hard to offend. The samples tell me all I need to know about these 14 year olds. When bands make music this bad, they have no choice but to make the cover \\"cool\\" and \\"shocking\\". Real bands in the past truly came up with all the original ideas. Its all been done before boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragments of Everything","review":"I have to diagree with the other two reviewers. Like them, I bought it because I liked the author's books on the 1918 Flu and the 1927 Flood. This book is a mess, conceived of a way to get random pieces of previously published essays into a book with a common theme. Barry fails badly. Portraits of generally obscure athletes, very brief usually, are intertwined with the horrible Gingrich's attempts to destroy Speaker of the House Jim Wright in the 1980's, (Gingrich later got what HE deserved.) But the book just doesn't jell, at least for me. An athlete trying to be the fastest man in the world for personal glory just doesn't align with a politician trying and failing to do the right thing for America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful singing!","review":"I enjoyed this group's previous CD very much, but \\"Hoping It Might Be So\\" is even better -- the selection of pieces is unusual and the performances are exquisite. \\"The Oxen\\" is my favorite at the moment, although I also love \\"Quem Pastores\\" by James Bassi (Why haven't I heard of this composer before? Where have I been?). The choir has a gorgeous sound, and the harp accompaniments are simply lovely. I listen to Christmas music year-round, and I think this CD is going to get a lot of play!

Charlie Sheen is okay. But most of the film just seemed to be lacking in many ways. The plot is not particuly clever but then not many action films are.

They have the timing and chemistry of the best on-screen buddies and the film uses every bit of technicolor it can, showering each situation with the kind of incandescent, subversive and ironic wit that Hollywood needs more of. While the plot is standard, credit should still be given to a hilarious screenplay that is surprising and winning in it's own kindhearted way, and perfectly captures the idiosyncratic cadences of girl-talk circa 80's and 90's.

I'm determined now to buy my own copy so I can watch it over and over. Oh, and the story is pure fun, and Lisa and Mira are cute, adorable and sexy. Janeane Garafalo was terrific in this.

This isn't the end all or be all of high school reunion flicks but a gentle lampooning on the genre. To take it as some profound statement about going home again would do the film a disservice. The soundtrack here is impeccable. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, two of the top comediennes of the previous decade, have chemistry to burn. To boot you have Alan Cumming, one of the great British funnymen, as the object of Kudrow's affection. Irresistable is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion","review":"Who doesn't want to go to their high school reunion, and show everyone they look better then they did then with success beyond anyone's dreams? This laugh out loud satire of course takes it to the extreme, but it is a fun movie.

I don't get it. I can't even say that it's Sorvino or Kudrow's fault- they're both engaging, and there are other pictures they've been in which attest to their comic abilities, but they have an uphill struggle against this script.Even with a mostly coherent story,**Romy and Michelle** feels like a series of tv show sketches strung together, because most of its humor depends on people being two-dimensional stereotypes and behaving according to the dictates of gag writers rather than being wholly realized(or even semi-realized) characters.I wonder if many people like this movie because they WANT to like it so hard, much like the fable of the emperor without clothes, which makes one of the many implausible gags kind of appropriate, come to think of it.I liked Parker Posey in **Party Girl**, like, ten thousand times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD","review":"I was really excited to get this DVD in the mail as it is one of my favorite movies of all time.

The quality of the DVD is horrible it looks like someone recorded an old VHS version themselves in zoom mode. Half of the time I couldnt see all of their faces no matter what setting I would switch my tv to. I dont know if it is just because I picked the $10 movie and maybe I should of payed up for the more expensive one?

The story is about these two stupin bimbos who have no live going to there highschool reunion. They borrow a nice car, get some nice cloths, and act like there very sucessful.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, flat, and predictable","review":"I recollect reading, when this movie came out, that it was based on a stand-up comedy skit about 9 minutes long. At that length, it probably worked. But expanded to 90 minutes or so, it simply doesn't. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be satire of sorts, but it's not funny. Both of the main characters are dense beyond belief, and all the people at their reunion are stereotypes. The movie is so desperate to fill time that it has R&M go through the reunion TWICE, and it's not funny either time! You do get to see Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino in their bras and panties, but that's not enough to make this turkey worth watching, let alone buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny \\"chick flick\\" for guys","review":"This is a \\"chick flick\\" that even guys can love. It's a slight and common story, but performed by two funny, attractive, engaging actresses.Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino play former high school nerds who want to show up everyone at their high school reunion, proving that they \\"made it big\\" in life (although they didn't).In one hilarious vignette, Romy and Michelle argue over which of them is the \\"Mary\\" and which is the \\"Rhoda.\\" \\"I'm the Mary, I'm the pretty one!\\" one finally says, quickly regretting it. Although they're going to their high school reunion, these ditzy women are still thinking with high school maturity. (Naturally, in the end, they learn to \\"accept themselves\\" and not listen to the cool crowd).Lisa Kudrow created the \\"Romy and Michelle\\" characters in her pre-Friends, comedy improv days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Kudrow is the woman!!!!!!!!","review":"She is Phoebe on \\"Friends\\". She was Billy Crystal's wife to be in \\"Analyze This\\". She is one of the most versatile actresses I have ever seen. Lisa Kudrow is the best. Her comedy is understated and hysterical. This movie was a sleeper that everyone raised in the '80's needs to go out and rent immediately. Mira Sorvino is great but Lisa Kudrow steals this show. Don't worry, Lisa, I know you were snubbed by the Academy for the \\"Opposite of Sex\\" but you are the Best Supporting Actress of that bunch, hands down. See this movie. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumbest movie around? ...well, DUH!","review":"This is one of those movies that preach it's OK to be yourself, no matter how nerdy or pea-brained you may be... ...provided you have great looks, a great body or lots of money! Bottom line? Meanness isn't cool, but overweight is worst (neither characters get a happy ending)! Very funny picture, though, only I think they overdid it in the last reel.

My favourite scene is when she is getting the greenhouse \\"ready\\". The only un-realistic thing in the movie is when Annabella Sciorra (aka Claire Bartel) takes her inhaler - she doesn't put it in her mouth to take it.

Rebecca DeMornay Is Excellent.","review":"Rebecca DeMornay, Annabella Sciorra, Ernie Hudson & Julianne Moore star in this intense drama. Rebecca DeMornay is simply superb. Annabella Sciorra, Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and the rest of the cast play their roles finely, but Ms. DeMornay stands out above the rest. Like Bette Davis, she commands every scene she is in, sometimes without saying a word. I highly recommend this tense thriller.

I have collected all of her movies and it seems that Rebecca plays all the movies that she is a \\"evil\\" inside her body just like this movie. I first heard about Rebecca was when I first watched this movie and I asked my parents \\"Who was this woman?\\" and they answered \\"Rebecca DeMornay\\" and I collected all of her movies she played in. I was about 12 years old when I first watched this movie with parents. I am now 27 years old and I still love her to death!! Rebecca was / is a GREAT actress!! 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"It's hard to believe the director of this faltering addition to Hollywood's yuppies-in-peril cycle of the early 1990s went on to make such outstanding films as \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and \\"Wonder Boys.\\" To be fair, the fault lies mainly with the screenplay - a textbook working of an elaborate revenge plot which tries to exploit a whole range of middle-class anxieties: molesting doctors, black burglars, lurking pedophiles, old friends who want to steal your husband and, of course, nannies who want to take over your life. The plot is predictable and the ending deplorably contrived. Ultimately, though, it's Rebecca De Mornay who makes this thing endurable. She's so chillingly good as the vengeful Peyton that you're cheering when Annabella Sciorra finally gets to punch her in the face. Other performances are merely adequate, with the notable exception of Julianne Moore: she steals the few scenes she's given and shows why she, like director Hanson, has gone on to much bigger and better things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hottest movie of the millennium!","review":"I saw this first time when I was 8 years old. I watched this with my sister and I loved this film. This came from TV when I was 10 and I taped it. I'm watching this almost everyday because I love this movie! It's thrilling, hot and I like Rebecca De Mornay.My favorite character is Peyton, of course. I like evil characters and she is one of the kind! Always when she did something bad I was excited. What if someone sees her?I love this movie and you have to watch it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss It!","review":"Crammed with suspense and fantastic performances (especially by that mildly handicapped gardener), this is a film worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but scary","review":"Yes, scary because it is scary to find out that the people whom you trust turn out to be someone you shouldn't. It's predictable because at the very start, we all know that Rebecca DeMornay is the wife of the doctor who sexually harrassed his patients & later on committed suicide upon losing face. We all know that she seeked employment in that particular household to aenge her husband's death, her loss & all other pain both real & imagined caused by her psychological breakdown. What keeps the viewers glued to the set is the exceptional performance of Rebecca -- what would she do next to the hapless unsuspecting victims. I got acquainted with her through this film & up to these days, I still remember her because of her excellent performance in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Thriller!","review":"In this very entertaining thriller, Rebecca De Mornay plays a woman who seeks revenge on Annabella Sciorra and her family. Why? Because Annabella filed sexual harassment on Rebecca's husband, who then killed himself; so as Rebecca says: \\"What goes around comes around!\\" This film works mainly because of Rebecca De Mornay. She really makes the audience nervous! Amazingly well-done flick is a must! Great on every level!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Major Goosebumps!","review":"This is, without question, one of the best thrillers of the 90s. I was about 12 years old when I first saw the film and I recall having goosebumps while watching the chilling De Mornay cast her spell (especially in the bathroom scene where she rips up the proposal!--my gosh, that would have made a heckuva Oscar clip for De Mornay, had she received a much deserved Oscar nomination). It's kind of slow moving in parts though, but I think that makes the tension build even better--leading up to the climax that is guaranteed to make you jump in certain places. Yeah, it's predictable, but so wasn't \\"Titanic\\". It's the story, suspense, and acting that make this film so great. And did I mention the music? Talk about creating a mood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Peyton's Been Great.\\"","review":".....\\"has she?\\" Well, Rebecca DeMornay shines in this intense flick from the early 90's. Yes, the perfect family hires what seems to be the perfect nanny, and a gullible, naive husband throughout the film makes the viewer want to punch the TV screen in frustration.........but whatever....this is Hollywood, right? Even after so many things start going wrong in the household, we hear, \\"Peyton's been great\\" when asked by a former girlfriend. Huh? No suspicions at all? Oh well....the story still works, thanks to DeMornay playing a vengeful widow of a doctor. She goes on a rampage of sorts, whether it's rigging a greenhouse accident or destroying important paperwork.......or even breastfeeding the couple's baby. This is one twisted woman who's on a mission. The music is well-done, too, and is powerful at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have enjoyed this movie for 10 years!","review":"I have watched this movie since it came out (I was only a little girl...what were my parents thinking?). Anyway, I think DeMornay does a fabulous job playing this character. The plot is simple. DeMornay is pregnant and married to a gynecologist. He kills himself due to several patients coming forward accusing him of molestation during physical exams. This causes DeMornay to lose her unborn baby. DeMornay gets herself hired as the nanny of a new baby her husband provided prenatal care for (the first woman to come forward). Her intentions are to take over Sciorra's (the mother of the new baby) children and husband. An excellent movie that I enjoy each time I watch. I always secretly wish that the movie had ended differently. Even though I am a mother now, I find myself sympathizing with DeMornay and her ordeal with losing her child in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle","review":"By far, this movie really proves if you can really trust somebody or not. Someone you know and trust may have a dark, deep secret that they are hiding from you. That is what makes this movie scary, shocking, and breath taking. The movie's plot is also very clever.Claire Bartell has the perfect life and family. Everything goes well until she accuses her doctor of sexually molesting her. The doctor then commits suicide. The doctor's wife, Mrs. Mott, loses a husband and a child. She then wants to seek revenge on Claire Bartell, the one who told on her husband. Mrs. Mott comes into Claire's family as a sweet and innocent nanny, but is she really as trustworthy as she seems? To find out what happens go out and get the movie \\"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.\\" Prepare for an edge of your seat thriller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved all my dog problems!","review":"You don't have to read the whole book to solve every problem you have with your dog--just pick the problem and read that section.

The best chapter is the one on what to do if your dog sniffs people's crotches! The author's writing is entertaining, clear and quite funny.

To her, each customer is simply a bag of money to be shaken loose of as much of its lucre as possible. The writing is funny and charming.

I've been reading Sarah-Katherine's livejournal for years, and to see this book come to fruition I felt strangely proud and so, so excited.It's all real and it's all there. It is thoroughly entertaining and unabashedly honest......there's no sugar coating and this isn't a romanticized account of the sex trade. Everything is vivid and coarse, beautiful and horrifying at the same time. This is truly a job, but she approaches it almost as an undercover reporter, making her almost the Donnie Brasco of stripping, peepshows, etc.The characters and places are all lovingly described, even the ones that the author doesn't love.

As a commentator on the lives of sex workers, she's open and incisive. *Indecent*'s final judgment of the sex industry isn't simple-minded or single-sided: Lewis presents the conflicted sentiments of a stripper towards the (empowering; degrading; freeing; narrow; challenging; mindless) job that pays her rent with honesty that's as fascinating as it is clear-eyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look inside an adult industry worker's mind","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit.

We also focus on how the character's perspectives change from beginning to end, and what internal and external conflicts the character has to deal with.My favorite story is \\"The White Circle\\" -- as it is the most shocking story for the students to deal with, and it is also short enough that we can read it and discuss it in one class period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty and disgusting!","review":"I got this as a joke gift for my cousin.

The Aztecs and all their rituals , including the Gods and calendar are explained in easy to read language. The text is not overburdensome with highly specialiazed jargon but is eloquent and to the point. This book is an easy read. The illustrations are worth the price of the book alone. They are by Miguel Covarrubias, one of Mexico's finest illustrators at the time, and he does a fantastic job depicting the colorful Aztec world.

Michael J. Fox lends his voice talents as Chance, the most recent pet addition to the family. Chance is also the narrator of the film, which adds to the overall good nature. The movie is humorous and an overall fun family film. However, the movie is about the struggle to maintain pet-owner love, so the movie is not all laughs and giggles. Good-natured yet emotionally endearing this movie will be liked by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie is better than the book","review":"I read the book a long time after I saw the movie.I have to say I liked the movie better than the book.Maybe it's because I liked the actors. Michael J. Fox was so funny as Chance,like when he and Shadow were running away from the mountain lion,he says \\"I'm such a wimp. I'm running from a cat!\\", Shadow- \\"I won't tell, if you won't!\\", \\"I mean this isn't your ordinary housecat, I mean this is like your Arnold Schwarz-a-kitty!\\" ,and a whole bunch of others.I love that the director made the animals talk.In the old movie all you saw was the animals just sitting there getting attacked by bears or something,sure the old one was okay, but I'm happy that the animals talked and had a sense of humor.

Obler and Clavin portray the \\"Soda Pop Slasher\\" as a sexually sadistic serial killer in N.Y. with more than a dozen kills to his name. Yet, no murders similar to those described in their book seem to have occured there or elsewhere. It is disturbing that Obler repeatedly states that he adheres to the highest ethical standards, yet he seems to be peddling fantasy as fact. Where are the ethics in this? This Book is as readable as a tabloid, but buyer beware. - Kelly G"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Stupidity","review":"I'm puzzled as to how this book can be described as non-fiction. The authors' note states that \\"names, events and locations\\" have been changed and \\"chronology has been altered.\\" That doesn't leave much does it? What more is there to a story beyond names, events, locations and chronology?The most infuriating aspect of the book was Dr Obler's obsession with remaining \\"objective\\". I was puzzled as to what exactly he meant by \\"objective\\" and eventually reached the conclusion that for Dr Obler it was synonymous with \\"very, very stupid\\". As the evidence began to mount that his client was a serial killer, Dr Obler valiantly and \\"objectively\\" pushed such thoughts from his mind. It was only when his patient started to threaten members of Dr Obler's own family that it slowly began to dawn on him that perhaps he should do a little bit more than have a weekly chat with this man. Very \\"objective\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable morals by Dr. Obler","review":"This book, while well-written and engrossing ultimately shows the reason why average citizens despise the field of psychiatry, psychology, etc. Dr. Obler's sacrifice of innocent victims is abhorrent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a JOKE???","review":"How could this be classified as nonfiction? I hope to hell it's just poorly-conceived fiction! If it's not, the purported psychiatrist who wrote it belongs in prison. And how about his family and the patients in group therapy, all of whom he endangers in the most obscene way? I'd love to see the author respond to the reviews here to explain just how the whole thing was to be taken. I'm sure he didn't mean to portray it as truth! Of course, that makes it an irresponsible publication, either way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I found this book to be unbelievable as nonfiction, at best. The doctor claims to be operating under a high code of ethics, but then he turns around and writes this book for everyone to see. If this had been a true story, and I doubt that it is, someone was sure to recognise the identity of the killer. As far as I know, there was no killer even remotely resembling the \\"soda pop slasher\\". Also, his repeated references to the female detectives \\"red hair\\" and \\"long legs\\" made this book read like a sub par fiction thriller. My advice to anyone interested in this book? Skip it and read John Grisham for real thrills or go to the NON-fiction section for some TRUE, true crime"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much fiction for a \\"true crime\\" story","review":"This book was filled with so much speculation and fantasy that I had a hard time believing it was a \\"true\\" story. Psychologists do have a fine line to walk when it comes to confidentiality, but there are laws that mandate when a therapist should take precautions to enusre the safety of the public as well as the patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable, infuriating","review":"As I read this book, I assumed that eventually Dr. Obler would resolve his inner conflict regarding patient confidentiality and turn his psychopath patient in to the police. I was horrified when I reached the end of the book and learned that he DID NOT! I find Dr. Obler's behavior despicable and his actions infuriating. The bottom line is this: Hiding behind the cloak of patient confidentiality privilege, this arrogant S.O.B. (I'm referring to the Doc) placed his career interests before that of protecting the public. While he \\"struggled\\" with his conscience, a half dozen people were murdered -- and all because he was afraid of losing a few patients. If I were seeing a therapist, and that therapist broke confidentiality with one of his/her patients becuase the patient was a SERIAL KILLER, I would commend the doctor, not \\"fire\\" him! I have a hard time believing this story is true. Dr. Obler should be in jail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Dr. Obler","review":"I gave this book two stars because of how dumb Dr. Obler was. Dr. Obler is a psychologist who is evaluating a new patient named Devon. During their sessions, killings start to happen. Dr. Obler expects Devon is the killer. Dubbed \\"The Soda Pop Slasher,\\" the killer used broken glass to cut up his victims. Dr. Obler had numerous chances to go to the police and tell them who \\"The Soda Pop Slasher\\" was. Instead, he chooses not to so he can keep his license as a psychologist. By doing this many more murders were committed by the slasher. In the end, in my own opinion, no one wins because this Devon person is still out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the shrink is crazier than the serial killer","review":"The only thing I could conclude after reading this book was that they say truth is stranger than fiction, but, in some cases, truth is more stupid than fiction! Did Dr. Obler ever hear of an anonymous tip to police? Did he ever consider that the \\"privilege\\" he had with the killer did not extend to his family and friends who were also being tormented? How naive and arrogant can Dr. Obler be to even think that he has \\"cured\\" a serial killer? Just ludicrous!Having worked with violent crime victims for years, I can only say that instead of being praised for his ethical behavior, Dr. Obler should be shunned for his utter disregard for humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the killer-lock up the doctor!","review":"Let me get this straight--Dr. Obler allowed his patient to threaten his children, stalk and break into his fiancee's apartment, exposed his other patients to a serial killer in group therapy and he wants to be the HERO of this tale? Please! Most ludicrous of all is that he expects readers to believe he somehow convinced a vicious psychopath to stop misbehaving and become a lawyer! How did this book get a non-fiction classification? If this book is even half true, than Dr. Obler needs, at the very least, to have his license revoked. At most, he needs to be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. He also owes an explanation to the families of all the victims that were murdered while he was protecting his professional reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"total non fiction","review":"I was attracted to this book for its alledged non-fiction psychological slant to serial murder. Instead I got a fictional hero who was neither the self proclaimed keeper of all professional ethics nor a brave hero. It was a semi thriller but not credible. This doc not only kept his therapy confidential, but allowed disturbing criminal behavior to occur before his eyes and to his most beloved people. Beyond believe.

Check the book out of the Library and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fiction","review":"I cannot imagine that this stuff really happened-- and if it's pure fiction, it is not very good.

His ultimate decision to sacrifice innocent victims rather than risk his career is morally reprehensible. Certainly it is more repugnant to allow a murderous psychopath to remain in sociey than to break doctor-patient confidentiality. My suggestion to Dr. Obler would be to research the Tarasoff case, where the Supreme Court ruled that if a therapist reasonably believes or should have reasonably believed that the patient is going to kill someone, he/she has a DUTY to report what the patient has discussed with him or her.My hope is that this story was just sensationalized for publication. If this is the standard moral caliber of forensic psychologists, who make decisions regarding whether a person is dangerous to society, I think I might consider pursuing another career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy Portable Lemon Flavor - Recommended!","review":"True Lemon Packets are a great way to add good tasting lemon flavor to your water and other drinks.

I do wish it was the methylcobalamin rather than the cyanocobalamin, but the dosage is quite high, so that may make up for the lesser absorption rate of the cyanocobalamin. I will make sure it is methyl next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good taste.","review":"I had bariatric surgery in January and I need to supplement this vitamin. The sublingual tablets had sort of rough edges and took too long to dissolve, so I looked into another form. I tried some stuff from a drugstore that was an orange liquid and you had to put a dropperful of it under your tongue. That one is barely tolerable and tastes like DayQuil. This spray, although I cannot tell you how it has worked on my lab results, is much less liquid than the dropperful and has an okay taste. It is sweet like stevia with a hint of grape.

Sister Act 2 is appalling in every way- the teenage characters are stereotypes, most of the jokes are bad cliches, and the storyline is like a fluffy, crappo version of Dangerous Minds. Worst of all, we don't get to see much of the characters we know and love from the first film- they are shunted to the background, and Whoopi Goldberg is expected to carry the whole feature- along with her idiotic, wooden, and unrealistic class of students of course. I also find Whoopi Goldberg's character's new preachiness unconvincing and hollow. In a nutshell? Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh a minute!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

This isn't for people looking for an Ingmar Bergman movie, but for people who love movies with great music. Yes, if you were under a rock when this film came out, this second Sister Act film has a killer soundtrack, which for me was better than that of the first film. The songs, especially Oh Happy Day and those songs with Lauryn Hill (her presence is electrifying) never fail to produce goosebumps. Unbelievably soulful.

Great acting by the entire cast, especially Adam Butcher as young Ralph Walker, who faces becoming an orphan. This film is not for everyone, and it does have some shortcomings, but, if you like feel good movies, then you'll like this one. In the end, it's a hopeful, redemptive tale that will resonate with anyone 18 or older -- and maybe even with those who are a few years younger. Worth watching more than once.

For example, there is a scene where Ralph peers into the womens shower and sees a women's behind.

An underestimated gem for all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saint Ralph","review":"Saint Ralph is a great teenage boy film. It contains just enough early sexual behavior, language and naughtiness to capture the attention of a classroom of boys. The spiritual content is a little slim, but there are great lessons about bullying, setting and reaching goals, faith in miracles, family love and victory for the down-trodden. All of the children in my class became engaged in the story and found themselves cheering for Ralph. It generated some great discussion about those topics on the minds of teenagers. Be prepared for some heart-wrenching drama and some belly laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saint Ralph is a Winner","review":"too bad this indie flick didn't catch on in the main stream. It's great.

The band were basically still teenagers at the time of the release and the album has that sense of urgency and earnestness that one feels at that age. This is the band's chance at the big time and they don't want to let it slip through their hands. \\"I Will Follow\\" is a powerful blast of rock and roll that percolates and pounds. \\"Into The Heart\\" is almost mystical in its delivery and \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" is a ripper. The album has an airy sound in places such as on \\"The Ocean\\", \\"Twilight\\" and \\"The Electric Co.\\" while songs like \\"Stories For Boys\\" and \\"Shadows & Tall Trees\\" have an endearing naivete to them. Boy is chock full of promise and potential and the band proved they were up to the task of reaching and fulfilling that promise and potential over the course of their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, by a once great band...","review":"Well, as the title suggests, my opinion of U2 today is pretty low. I think their newest album was complete...compared to their early stuff, I am also new to U2, they released 4 albums before I was even born...but their early stuff, as far as I have heard, is great, and is a big influence to what I have been listening to for years. Bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Cursive, Fugazi, Hot Water Music, At The Drive-In, Sparta, and MILLIONS of others defiently grew up listening to U2 and many bands of the time. The era of punk also has a big role in all their music. If you listen to any sort of underground rock today, buy this album...or download it... You will be pretty surprised at how good this record is, and how influencial it was. It changed music as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen closer","review":"Is this album Auctung Baby or Joshua Tree? Not at all.It lacks any major hits like every other U2 album exept october. It doesn't have any emotion that the other albums have, so why buy it? Because it is the funnest U2 album out their. This is their only album you can play that contains consistent up beat tunes. And the slower songs are briliant and eerie. I Will Follow is the most famous song, but by no means the best. Out Of Control, A Cat Dubh, Stories for boys, A Day Without me, and the best song on the album, The Electric Co. The rest are good, and contribute a lot to the album. The Edge is very loose on the guitar, and has many fun guitar parts.Yes, U2 has put out some of the best rock music ever, but buy this and don't compare it to other u2 stuff, but to your favorite rock band who isn't u2, and you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great, catchy album","review":"U2's first album is one of their best. Every cut exudes energy especially tracks like \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"Electric Co.\\" Bono's voice is raw and the Edge's guitar soars with his trademark galloping riffs. I have always liked U2 but it's their early stuff that I really enjoy. Buy either \\"Boy\\" or \\"War\\" and you won't go wrong.

Kinda like James Taylor on a bennie bender, like he's been jogging for hours in a chicken suit in the desert while sucking on sandpaper. Then there's that high-maintenance lead guitarist with the rockin' chops, a steely 'tude and quite the bone-chilling nickname. But wait, 'cuz I haven't forgotten the pair with the regular names. Just ordinary guys, folks. Of course that one guy, the bassist, he tries to hang with the big dogs, but he just comes off like a slightly-demented car mechanic.

There's also as much emotion within these songs as there is in anything else they've done. In a way this is the band at their most simple, which really may be the best way to hear them.

Lesser-known songs like \\"Twilight\\", \\"Stories for Boys\\", and \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" simply rock. \\"Electric Co.\\" and \\"Out of Control\\" are downright awesome. If you're starting a U2 collection, look no further than right here. Buy this now! You will not be disappointed. Personally my favorite of all U2 albums.

The remastering is warm and crisp, not shrill and harsh, so you actually feel as if you're in the room with the band. Basically, U2 marry the sound of 70s hard rock with the Edge's unusual guitar style and Bono's spiritual and political lyrics, which show the band's born-again Christianity to be a form where the members are hard on themselves and tolerant of others, which cannot be said of the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons of the world. U2 are clearly ready to take on the world on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse Into Greatness","review":"I have always been a fan of U2 but had little time to go through their discography.Between work and school I missed all the great tours they had previously, too.So, now that I am in my 30s, I am going back through all their albums, DVDs, compilations, etc.I cannot lie. I would have bought this for \\"I Will Follow\\" alone. I only recently found out this song was inspired by Bono's mother. Now I hear the nuances I missed after first hearing many years ago on the radio.You can tell already that The Edge was the genius guitarist everyone says he was. And now that I know so much about Irish/Celtic folk, classical, etc music I can hear the melodies in it so much more clearly.Also, Mr. Mullen's drumming shows his \\"zen\\" kind of style, even at this point....worth every penny..."},{"rating":"2","title":"mystical","review":"When I first heard this album, I was blown away. It was exactly what I had always been wanting to hear, but had never heard, in rock music. Subsequently, I was an exclusively loyal fan for about 5 years thereafter. With all it's reverb and echo, the music transported me to a different world - a world only 4 kids from Dublin, Ireland could take me. I always realized these people didn't know anything about music theory or how to play their instruments, but combined w/Bono's strong voice, they pulled it off, anyhow.

The sound of this album was essentially unanticipated; at a stroke, U2 had achieved a unique style that would remain theirs throughout their long career. This is largely due to the contribution of the Edge; he was and is one of rock's most inventive guitarists. Bono has yet to achieve maturity as a singer and songwriter, but he is certainly full of youthful enthusiasm. The individual songs here are not really what is important - what give this album its vitality was its spirit of discovery. Here was something truly new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool !!!","review":"I like U2's debut album much better than the largely more acclaimed War. Sure,War has Sunday Bloody Sunday,and New Year's Day,and 40...but Boy is more consistent in that all the songs on this record make sense,there's nothing to throw away,nothing useless at all.

Amazon is sending another out, so I am pleased with their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed only to promote author's agenda","review":"I kept thinking all the way through that this book would let up on trashing the conservative viewpoint. Maybe because I tend to be conservative, it bothered me more than it would the liberals. All the way through the author didn't seem to miss a chance to put another dig in. It pretty much ruined the story for me. I agree the bad guys were unbelievably bad. This is my first Kate Wilhelm book and will probably be my last. I don't know if she uses all her books as the vehicle for her personal viewpoint. Also I couldn't get into Barbara Holloway's personality and character enough to cheer for her during the trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to love and accept imperfections","review":"Loved this audiobook. So refreshing to see someone learn to love and accept certain imperfections they've struggled against for so long. Loved the story. Heartrending to see all the layers of deception, vanity and selfishness. Barbara and Frank team up and cut past all the barriers that have held them apart from each other and together take down a vicious group of criminals. Great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to Conservatives and Christians","review":"Having read and enjoyed the first Barbara Holloway book, I was looking forward to the continuing story....but now that I'm reading it, I am not sure I will be able to finish. Wilhelm takes many opportunities to make people with my viewpoint look like backward idiots intent on destroying others. When reading any book, I can overlook little blurbs that authors insert that are offensive to me, but this takes it to a new level, as there are long diatribes trashing Christians and conservatives. Fortunately, I checked this book out of the library so I haven't lost any money in the process of learning what I can expect from Ms. Wilhelm's books. It's a shame that such a talented author chose to insult a substantial segment of the population in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast paced drama, except for near trial end","review":"The book begins well, rich (or at least well off, but playing at being poor) female lawyer is asked to do the impossible, free a woman pre-judged to be a baby killer. Barbara (the lawyer) does a credible job and succeeds. The book bogs down near the end with a lot of shooting off in all directions apparently trying to explain herself. 'Bad guys' are unbelievably bad: making money on abortion formula while mouthing abortion foe rhetoric. A little too overdramatic...a C-minus for such a lack of sublety. The righteous are 'good-good', the other side is 'bad bad'. Author is no John Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Your Time And Money!","review":"Brian Haig (son of Alexander Haig) is a fresh new \\"voice\\" in popular fiction. His style of writing -- part witty, part sarcastic and always interesting -- makes Secret Sanction a book to put near the top of your \\"To Be Read\\" list. I think you'll be captivated by the story (which moves along at a very crisp pace), the characters ( which are believable and multi-dimensional), and Haig's knowledge of military honor, tradition and politics. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Haig's first effort. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll like Secret Sanction a lot and be looking forward to Haig's next book. The only reason I didn't rate the book a \\"5\\" is that I anticipated the ending a little too far in advance of where I would have liked, since the earlier reviews I read on Amazon led me to believe the ending was a major surprise. However, the actual rating level here is not really that relevant. What is relevant is that this is a book you'll be glad to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, but VERY poorly researched","review":"While Haig weaves an interesting tale, his writing demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about international law, military justice, criminal law, and the Army in general. As an Army Judge Advocate myself, I have to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but I do expect authors to do enough research that basic principles remain intact. For example, no Army officer would EVER say \\"OORAH\\" or \\"HOORAH\\" when referring to the 82d Airborne. \\"Proximate cause\\" doesn't get you a search authorization anywhere--PROBABLE cause does. Military suspects being interrogated by CID would know what crimes they are suspected of because of Article 31, UCMJ. And the list goes on (and on, and on). The predictable plot I can forgive; the rest I cannot. Please do not read this book thinking you are getting an accurate insight into the world of military law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I picked this up on the clearance rack at a local store, and therefore did not expect much from the story. Once I begain to read I could hardly put the book down. The story seems written as if Sean Drummand were telling it, and it lends a very easy readability and flow to the book. Read it if you have a chance"},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKING IN EVERY WAY","review":"None of the characters had any real character. They were all shallow. The main character Sean Drummond was obnoxious,arrogant, and stupid. The two attorneys (pick of the Army's litter) that were aiding him were way too weak and, dumb. Imelda was an out n out embarrassing caricature of a short, squat, bulling, ignorant, southern black woman that wasn't funny at all. The story was shallow and uninteresting. There was little investigating. Considering Haig's background ya think he could of written more in-depth.And then to top all this poor work off we get Haig's obvious republican bias and hate of Clinton. Calling Clinton a draft dodger,when GWBush did virtually the very same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot with a smartalec Army lawyer","review":"This is the first Haig book I've read but I'm hooked by his writing. The characters come alive and the dialog feels authentic (no surprise given Haig's military background).Major Drummond (who is the narrator in this first person novel) is a wisecracking soldier turned lawyer, who is very descriptive and creative in describing his experiences, in particular his scenes involving the paralegal Imelda. The story itself is about an A-Team that hasn't escaped to the Los Angeles underground, but instead are under arrest while Drummond figures out how the team was involved with a massacre in Kosovo. The story steadily unfolds and becomes more complicated, before reaching a great climax as the testimony and details of the massacre rapidly come to a succinct ending.I haven't done any other research, as I just finished the novel, but I hope to find the Major (and Imelda) in more stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Drummond's intro","review":"The first in the Sean Drummond series, has him off to a good start. Couldn't put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot, characters","review":"Many books having to do with the military are strongly plot driven but have one-dimensional characters. A fewer number have strong characters but plodding action. A very few, like Haig's Secret Sanction, have the whole package. A legal drama when reduced to its most basic element, this is a riveting book that points out vividly that in war the line between who the good guys and bad guys are is often hard to decipher. The twists are many and Haig does a good job of making the moral grayness of war apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really surprised with this one! Excellent book and well done!","review":"Very unique character and presentation. I was surprised how much I liked this book. Ordered it with a bunch of other books on a whim, as this came up on a recommended list. Will order more of this Author's books based on this work. A+++"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lawyer you can LIKE","review":"Brian Haig has created a great character in Sean Drummond, a maveric military attorney who combines the best of Clancy's military fiction with the best of Grisham's legal fiction. Personally I had given up on legal thrillers. But Haig has got me hooked again by a lawyer who is really hard not to like. The book is well-written and fast faced. Brian Haig's own personal miltiary experience is evident in his keen observations and interesting depiction of how military justice works. I really look forward to several literary installments with this great new character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Read","review":"Not exactly an \\"edge of your seat thriller\\" but an interesting read. Drummond is his sarcastic self in this episode of his career and it takes his unorthodox behaviour to crack the case. But the ending is not terribly satisfying - maybe because life really isn't \\"black & white\\" - and leaves room to wonder about ethics in our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not worth being too critical","review":"This book is like a summer thriller movie: you can pick apart the plot 9 ways to Sunday, but when it is all said and done, you realize that you've been entertained. Considering this is Haig's first book, I'm willing to give him a lot of latitude and only wish that I could put forth such a first effort. The book was enjoyable, the main character was likable, the plot was basically plausible and, frankly, I couldn't put it down the last 200 pages. I look forward to Mr. Haig's future offerings and I only hope he continues his main characters in the mold of Sean Drummond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Brian Haig's books are real page turners laced with humor. Lots of fun and his more recent ones are even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reading - poor moral message","review":"Enjoyable reading but very turned off by conclusion that it is ok for a soldier to commit atrocities under the guise of punishing the bad guys. I like Haig's books but am very disappointed in his moral message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Santions","review":"This \\"story\\" is about an investigation concerning a supposed atrocity in Bosnia. An Army JAG is heading the investigation assisted by two othr JAG's, they are challenged to find the truth in a convuluted coverup. However, I found it difficult to believe that Brian Haig a former Army officer could make so many mistakes about the military. Haig needs either a better memory or a better editor. Special Forces teams are made up of 12 men (not 9) the Specialist Seventh was impossible (and the Army has not had a rank above Specialis Four since 1985) there is no GS 17 rank and it goes on and on...Haig should be ashamed of himself to write such thrash. Yes, I am partial to the military. My husband is a retired Colonel, my daughter is an active duty JAG and my grandson is an active duty PFC....so I do have a working knowledge of the Army.....Save your money unless you are looking for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Haig has rather blatantly imitated Nelson DeMille's style, and has also ripped off plot elements from two DeMille books, \\"Word of Honor\\" and \\"The General's Daughter\\". The plot of \\"Secret Sanction\\" is completely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard cutouts. Don't waste your time with this pathetic imitation, go for the original--both of the two DeMille books named above are excellent.

A blast from the past had blown into her life turning what should have been a most joyous day into one that she will not forget. She called upon me to comfort her and I called upon a few passages from \\"The Value In the Valley\\" to help her see that only she defines her destiny. Needless but important to say, the next day my sister-friend called me to say that she was glad that I was there for her and that the words of encouragement helped her to look at her situation realistically so that she could move up and out of the situation. Until that day, I had forgotten that I had the book but spirit guides you to resources when you need them the most. Thank you for being there for me so that I could be there for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a cleansing, invigorating shower...","review":"Think of this book as the long way around the points given in \\"Faith In The Valley\\": on one hand, if some of those weren't expained enough for you, this book breaks them all down. On the other hand, if you're impatient or have a short attention span, save it for a rainy day or the line @ the DMV. It's chock full of empowering points and lovingly explained, taking nothing for granted and guiding you all the way. \\"Value\\" is a treasure, and can actually help you get out of those ruts and start on your individual issues.

Well, I finally dealt with my \\"stuff\\" and finished the book. The power of this book is in its matter of fact, sister to sister, presentation of the obvious.

It requires no adherence to obscure beliefs or magical thinking. It offers a penetrating diagnosis of the human condition and a proven set of techniques for overcoming the daily rigors of modern life. Guy Claxton's The Heart Of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom For An Agitated World explains what Buddhism is aptly appropriate for any personal, social or global situation today, and goes on to describe how we can each help ourselves individual, with a teacher, in a group, or on our own, through a Buddhist approach to understanding, meditation, discipline and communication. The Heart Of Buddhism is highly recommended reading for students of Buddhist philosophy and practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Guy Claxton on a really lazy day.","review":"I read several of Guy Claxton books. I typically love them. But, not this one. He is an original, insightful, contrarian, brilliant type of thinker on cognitive science. But, not here. I don't think he defines Buddhism well.

I've never been able to make heads or tails of a schematic. However, after about 2 evenings reading this book, I now have no problem reading the schematics for the beginners projects I've been working on. This book also explains WHY some of the symbols look the way they do, which goes a long way to help in reading schematics even if there is a symbol a little different than what's in the book. I would recommend this to anyone learning electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help at all","review":"This book was more about symbols and looking them up and not about actually explaining the flow of electricity through circuits. Anybody can look up symbols in a legend and find out what they are and surely we don't need a whole book about it. However getting use to reading the way electricity flows through various circuits and devices can get pretty confusing and this book did very little to help clear up that. That's what I call reading circuits. I thought this book would have various example circuits of increasing complexity and trace the path of current flow through each one and explain some of the anomalies we might encounter. Thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only helpful for complete beginners but may confuse some","review":"If you have absolutely no experience reading schematics this book will help you some. I got it because I have a basic understanding but wanted to brush up and improve my reading skills. The book was of no real help and I stopped reading it halfway through. They show you symbols but give no real explanation of how the acutal equipment functions in the circuit. The author also does a poor job of going trough the paths of more complicated circuits. There is also a full chapter explanation of \\"symbology\\" that tries to turn into some sort of sociology/linguistics lecture. Totally unhelpful except in the most basic way.

The biggest similarity is the music score, which could almost be considered a total ripoff of Danny Elfman's soundtrack. However, I think this movie is a lot better. The songs are cool 1930'sish numbers. I really loved all of the \\"madeup\\" gangsters in this movie when I was a kid. Some of them actually appear pretty grotesque, especially the guys who get shot playing cards at the first of the movie. Their makeup makes them look like they have acne scars.

The musical score was a perfect match, and Beatty was at his most charming, but Tess trueheart's character was very boring (how Tracy could have chosen her over Madonna's radient Breathless Mahoney is a true mystery to me. Mandy Patinkin was also good as Breathless's accomplice and piano player. This film is worth having just to view Madonna in all her splendor--and her acting isn't bad either (much better than seeing her in \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" She reminded me of La Monroe in \\"Niagra\\" as Rose Loomis.

For sippies, I go with Playtex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't like it","review":"After losing one of our Gerber Sip n smile cups (which we love), I bought one of these to replace it. Boy was that a mistake! The spout is way harder and although it is possible, it is extremely difficult to line up the spout and handles properly. My son won't even drink from it. Oh, and it can leak. Waste of money. Go for the sip n smile cups. They're awesome for young babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"The Valve falls out very easily and makes this cup easy to spill.

I would not recommend this cup to anyone for this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valve falls out","review":"This is a nice cup...good handles and a nice size for my son's eleven-month-old hands. However, it does have one MAJOR drawback. The valves do not fit snugly. When my son bangs the cup on the table or even his leg, the valve falls out and milk can splash and POUR out of the cup. It is definitely not leak/spill proof. I have several of these cups and they all do the same thing. This is very unfortunate since I prefer everthing else about this cup over the other styles I have purchased to replace it. From what I have seen, all the Gerber cups seem to have this valve, so I would imagine even other styles of Gerber cups may have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spill-proof???","review":"That's certainly a misnomer. This was the first sippy cup we purchased for my son. The little device that is supposed to make the cup spill-proof would always slip out, causing the cup to leak. The design of this cup looks cool, and Gerber is a reputable name in the baby-product industry, so I thought I was getting a quality product when I laid my money down for the 6oz Gerber \\"Spill-Proof\\" Cup. I was wrong.There are plenty of sippy cup options out there, and your kid is bound to go through quite a few of them during their sippy-cup days. Gerber makes plenty of other sippy cups with a sturdier design. Personally I prefer their sport cups...that one has held up the longest in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest, open invitation to fall in love with life","review":"Over 20 essays that bring into focus the grandeur in life's simplest experiences.

The picture does not do the piece justice, it is an absolutely gorgeous piece when completed. There is enough detail and variety in the picture to keep the work interesting, but not so much that you go crazy with thread color changes.

Most of the jokes in it are stolen right out of other, much better spoofs like Airplane and Hotshots and yet, they still can't manage to be funny. I laugh like mad every time I hear the \\" A hospital, what is it?\\" joke in Airplane and I didn't even smirk when the used THE EXACT SAME JOKE in this movie! To make things worse, the original jokes in this film are just as bad, if not worse. Spy Hard's spoofs are pointless. In the middel of the movie, for no apparant reason, they do the Pulp Fiction dance. Why? Spoofing other movies is only funny when its somehow tied into the plot. This film should be avoided at all costs. It just isnt funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Spy Hard is a waste of time","review":"I love Leslie Nielsen, but this movie is not funny. His better movies are Wrongfully Accused and the Naked Gun movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spy Hard","review":"Well, you win some and you lose some. I was very disappointed that the Leslie Nielsen film was a total flop, because I really had high hopes for it, and now I'm broke because I was stupid enough to buy it instead of rent it. Agent WD40 Dick Steele must stop an old enemy from destroying his (deceased) girlfriends' daughter. With the help of his basically useless assistants, Nielsen bumbles his way and manages to save her. Funny parts and crude jokes are rare, and Neilsen isn't as stupid as usual. I don't really recommend this movie, even to diehard Leslie Neilsen fans. I am one myself, and I didn't like it. I recommend The Naked Gun series instead, some of Neilsen's better work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy movie on DVD","review":"The opening credits as well as other scenes in the movie are absolutely helarious. Weird Al's head exploding as well as spoofing Pulp Fiction, Speed, Ghost, and others.Reading the reviews it seems to me that people just don't have a sense of humor anymore and just can't appreacheate a cute movie when they see it. Things don't have to have a plot to be funny but people have lost that. I am 24 and have gorwn up with some of th e best spoof movies. Hot Shots, Spaceballs, Loaded Weapon 1 and others. Spy Hard is a cute movie if you have a sence of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leslie Neilsen Better Spy Harder","review":"In Spy Hard the Bond spoof half of the movie isn't really spoofing James Bond. They spoof Pulp Fiction poorly, the True Lies spoof is lame, and the Home Alone spoof is so bad. They just found some cheesy look alike of Macally Caulkin. I found it funny when they had the beginning part of the film where Weird Al Yankovic sang the theme song. He head really didn't have to blow up. Spy Hard is a poor film and just like the slapstick of other Neilsen films."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was so funny, soda gushed out of my nose.","review":"A funny movie with a great cast.

If only...the movie could have kept up with the high standard set by Weird Al's opening. If only...the script had been at all worthy of Leslie Nielsen's signature deadpan. The simple fact is that the film had ample opportunity to be funny, even hilarious, but the jokes are not even recycled, they directly lifted from other great movies. The simple thing is that Weird Al's parody represents the full extent of the creative humor in the film...buy it when it only costs as much as a music video. That's all you'll want to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the opening titles, then leave.","review":"The opening titles are wonderful, a perfect parody of one of the cheesier Roger Moore era Bond movies. Weird Al's music and the accompanying visuals are a masterful pastiche.The rest of the movie is total excrement. I'm ashamed to say I sat through the whole thing, waiting desperately for something amusing to happen. After a while I started thinking I'd lost my mind--Leslie Nielsen was on the screen, why wasn't anything funny?But no, the people who must have really lost their minds were the ones who bothered to release this piece of garbage in the first place. I'd like 81 minutes of my life back, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly funny.","review":"This movie was the first spoof that I've seen, and I couldn't stop laughing. The theme that Weird Al sang was pretty catchy, and the way that it made fun of so many movies was just incredible.However, as funny as this movie is, the jokes do get very old if seen too often. This is one of those movies that you should see possibly only once every couple of months if you're feeling down. But if jokes get old very slow for you, I do recommend buying this film, it's really funny. But some may be really disappointed with this film, so I recommend that you rent it first, to see how you like it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Naked Gun","review":"This was a very poor movie.You would think with leslie neilsen in it,it would be like The Naked Gun movies, but don't be fooled.the only good part of the movie is the beggining theme with \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic.I would not recomend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"very, very bad","review":"Sigh...the previous reviewer should have watched the movie before reviewing it. You think \\"ah! A farce with Leslie Nielson! It must be funny!\\" based on The Naked Gun. Don't be fooled, though: this isn't an Abraham, Zucker & Zucker production, and it's not at all funny. Some tips for the writer: sexual innuendo in itself is not funny. It's only funny if there's something CLEVER about it. The same with movie references: you can't just ape an older film; you have to actually do something FUNNY with it. Nielson IS a naturally funny guy, I think, but even he cannot redeem this waste of celluloid. The only redeeming quality of Spy Hard is Weird Al Yankovic singing the opening theme, but it's just not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST comedy I have seen to date, and I've seen a LOT of em.","review":"This movie was EXTREMELY bad. The physical comedy and ingenious parodies that made movies like Naked Gun, Airplane, and Dracula: Dead and Loving It were ill-concieved, mostly recycled, and sometimes out-and-out bad. I cannot believe that Leslie Nielsen even DID this movie. Without his comedic talents, this movie could have actually been one of the worst EVER for ANY movie, rivaling Plan Nine from Outer Space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this movie, get Wrongfully Accused","review":"Leslie Nielsen tried to do a spoof on James Bond, put it just didn't have the ingredients.

Trust me, DONT BUY THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're not missing much","review":"I wouldn't say this movie is horrible as much as it just was not funny. Sure, the back cover says it's hilarious, but I can't say I was busting a gut over any moment in the entire film. The variety of other films parodied was interesting, and I thought Weird Al singing the intro music was pretty cool (and his subsequent cranial explosion). I giggled at a couple things here and there, but I wouldn't watch this movie again. I think the plot and the silliness would have been better as an animated cartoon film.Meanwhile, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery made its debut the following year and showed the right way to make a funny spy movie. Spy Hard is kind of like the special needs, watered-down, family-friendly, bubble-wrapped love child of Austin Powers and Looney Tunes. If that's what you like in a film, then this movie may well be visionary to you, but I personally didn't think it was funny at all, let alone as funny as the box claimed it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAK","review":"I like the excitement of trying to get through each level.

There aren't that many. Nestor Torres is a Puerto Rican native who relocated to Miami 25 years ago after studying in New York and Boston. He's one of those guys I'd like to like, but his music just doesn't do much for me. It's not lack of technique-he has plenty. His clean tone is straight out of the classical tradition, similar to fellow conservatory-trained jazzman Hubert Laws. While I prefer a grittier sound, I can enjoy such purity if the setting is right. But Torres' material leaves me flat; the pre-programmed arrangements he surrounds himself with are mechanical and boring. It's too bad. Torres says this album was inspired by 9/11 and by a lecture given by the Dalai Lama in Florida.

One man must decide to follow a path forced upon him or look for the truth of a past and a future that might not exist. Lustbader is great at developing a dark forbidding world were nothing is as it seems. The characters are complex and mysterious with overtones of a society were duty is place above all else.

As a reader of a number of James Lucas books, I find that they actually have presented a quite objective view in regards to the typical establishment slander and tripe judgements of history that they have passed down for the last fifty years. After sifting through such garbage as Alan Clark's 'Barbarossa,' Soviet volumes of the \\"The Patriotic War\\"(Patriotic with a gun to the back of your head.) and other establishment dogma, a book that may take a perspective outside the mainstream is quite welcome. Sergio, you want to interpret history through blinders and your review only affirms that history will always be distorted and twisted by those who have the ability to command it.

Saxton McKensie, one of the lead characters, is a charismatic, sucessful dreamboat, torn between Mallory - the good girl - and Deena, the super bad girl, with whom he's engaged. Though Deena is a media celebrity, she also has a very nasty little secret in the form of an equally bad girl, Nikki! Why Sleeping Dogs Lie is a romantic story that is also quite titaliting.

He talks about there being evidence of Christ's trial, but never provides any sort of citation for it. Unfortunately, no such evidence exists.

Unfortunately this seat is very disappointing. The canopy is just awful, I could not believe what a terrible design this is. The canopy has no form, just a piece of material that slides around. When you push it back it falls down to cover the release handle for the seat. The straps are hard to adjust and the seat doesn't fit well in my car on the base. This is our first car seat purchase, and I just assumed it would be similar in function to the other brands like Graco that I have carried my nephew and niece in, but boy was I wrong. Has anyone tried another carrier that will work with the vector stroller safely???"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE CARSEAT!!!","review":"This carseat is the worst I've ever had for my children. We bought it without being able to look at it out of the box.First and foremost, it's EXTREMELY heavy and bulky. Second, it does come with a base, but it is difficult to get the carseat in and out of the base. Third, the canopy only covers the back half of the seat (I had a Graco that would move to cover either the front half OR the back half). My Graco also rocked when sitting on the floor, and the Eddie Bauer does not rock well; it rocks to the front, but not to the back. The last thing that my husband and I don't like is the fact that the whole buckle is plastic!! The best thing about this carseat is the fact that it's attractive--but that's all it's worth!! I've never been so disappointed in such an expensive item."},{"rating":"1","title":"to hot to travel","review":"the new material that companies are using causes the baby to sweat terribly. it isnt easy to install the seat into the base in the car and also not easy to attach it to a snap n go....the only positive thing i found was that the seat is roomier..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"This was a big mistake. I carefully compared and researched infant seats and settled on this becuase it had more padding than the Graco, seemed sturdy and was attractive. I have found it to be a complete pain in the ... to use. The buckle is very difficult to latch. It takes several tries and major coordination. The canopy always falls down and drags under the seat. The fabric is rougher than it appears and chafes the back of the baby's head. It is longer from front to back than most seats. As a result when my 6 foot husband moves the seat back far enough to drive comfortably, the drivers seat bumps into the infant seat. This changes the angle of the recline (compromising the safety)as well as marring the leather on the front seat. It's a Volvo wagon which is not a small car. It is hard to adjust the straps and uncomfortable to carry.Eliminate this one from your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky and very uncomfortable","review":"This car seat is very uncomfortable to hold and it is very clunky and is even too big for my Dodge Durango.

When I stopped the car I had no one to help me put the seat back together, or hold my newborn so I could get home. I have no idea how it happened because it was completely secure when I left the house. I should have known when it took us 40 minutes to leave the hospital because we could not easily adjust the straps. In addition to the safety issue the seat is very heavy, the top bar snaps so loud that the baby wakes up every time I snap it, it does not rock at all and the buckle is very hard to press in.

Now that he's older, it's time to put the car seat forward-facing; it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to put the seat in the cradle once it's fastened to the seat facing forward.4.

If my husband had to pick her up it was still easy for him to strap the seat in his car using seatbelts (his car doesn't have LATCH) without the base. The weight of the seat never bothered me, but I haven't had much comparison to other seats. The seat has been very durable - enduring lots of daily use - especially when she was only a couple months old and that's where she slept best. We also have the matching stroller and it's worked out great. The only thing is she's now 7 months old and too tall for the seat (it goes up to 29 inches and 22 pounds), so we've had to buy a convertable seat for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe, Unsafe, Unsafe","review":"I would give this a zero if I could.

This was baby number 5 and I felt I knew what I was doing. This car seat is dangerous with the canopy attached. I have found on a number of occasions the canopy has fallen back and landed under the lock to lock it into the base. I always double check the seat is locked by yanking on it and discover the canopy has caught and the lock will not release easily with the material caught under it. I have almost tripped while carrying my son when the canopy slipped down and hung right below my ankles and I caught myself. I have contacted the manufacturer on numerous occasions and they have not had the coutesy to even reply to my e-mails. I have never had this problem with any other brand. This carseat is a accident waiting to happen and should be yanked until the problem can be solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this car seat. It has a nice look, but very difficult to carry and get it into and out of my car. Getting the baby buckled in the seat is a nightmare. It's very difficult to latch the baby in. Also, the canopy shade is awful. There is nothing attaching the back part of it to the carseat, so on a breezy day, the back flies up and exposes the baby. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time around...","review":"I just had my first baby in January. I love this car seat. The only thing I had a problem with was that I was having a hard time snapping it in to the stroller and car base.

They were very helpful and let me exchange it out for a new one. Ever since then it has been great.It is so easy to take in and out of the car and I drive a two door civic.

The weight and bulk of this seat is outrageous. Also, the sunshade never stays in place and often trips me while walking. When carrying it, this seat bounces off your knees and does a number on your shoulders. Its size and weight makes it awkward to carry.

I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but I wouldn't purchase again","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this is a very heavy and bulky carseat.

I would not recomend this to anyone!!! It is extremely heavy and awkward to carry. The straps are very difficult to adjust.

We returned it and purchased the graco snugride. WOW! what a difference! The last thing you need when you have a child is for anything to make your life more difficult. This carseat I believe should be recalled. Its just not safe. The straps came undone more than once without anyone adjusting them. I would go with the graco! It saved us alot of aggrvation and its alot less! Good luck to all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy with a tough buckle","review":"What got our attention for this car seat was the looks of this seat. But when we left the hospital and tried to put our 6 lb. 14 oz. daughter in the seat, we found it difficult. The biggest problem was trying to keep the buckle closed while trying to snap it without hurting her legs. Also, safety requirements say you can only leave room for one finger between the baby and the strap and we weren't able to do this due to the strap. We thought maybe we would eventually get used to some of these items, but our baby is now 7 weeks old and it is just as difficult and very frustrating. Even though our baby was very light, it was still hard to carry around the baby. My wife even threw her neck out getting the car seat in and out of the car and carrying it around. We learned our lesson about checking into products and reading reviews before we purchase an item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great infant carrier","review":"We bought this carrier to attach to our Eddie Bauer stroller, because other brands would not attach to the stroller. The bottom buckle is very difficult to click in to the two buckles from the upper straps. The straps are not very long, I doubt it will last my son until he reaches 20 pounds. The carrier does not lock on to the top of a grocery cart like other brands, so you have to put it in the cart. Then there is no place to put your groceries. Very poor design.

It really helped. Get a bigger size, you can always adjust it. The hospital gave me one to take right away so I got lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for the money","review":"I got this for postpartum wear and was extremely satisfied with it. It's nice and wide and provides good soft, comfortable support for my back and gentle compression for my abdomen, and I think it really made a big difference in comfort during the first day or two after birth. I have no idea what the special name-brand \\"postpartum girdles\\" do that justifies costing twice as much, but I was very happy with this belt and would happily buy it again.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the soft cloth panel in the front that provides the \\"loop\\" side of the velcro is a double layer of fabric that is not stitched together at all except at the edges, so the two layers are free to slide around a bit relative to one another. This lets the belt slide out of position more than I think it would otherwise.

It flattened my stomach but just pushed the excess fat (in the front and back) up above the girdle. Not the look I was going for! This girdle was not for me.

It helped with supporting the incision site and reduced the pain drastically the moment I put it on.

Eventually, as my stomach began to shrink on its own- without wearing the wrap, I was able to fit it around me. Problem is, it never stayed in place and bunched EVERYWHERE so that it looked extremely bulky under clothes.Don't waste your money on this product.

The plot is good, the scenes are vivid and realistic, and while the writing is a bit lacking, the acting is actually very good.

To everyone familiar with Cocteau's book, this is all so predictable and banal, in addition acting is poor and eroticism is primitive. There is lots of pretension, quoting Proust among other things, and all the references to TRUE masterpieces are the best parts, but this resulting cocktail is of a bad taste, in all respects. Weakness and impotence of thought are prevailing, and it is unbelievable that it came from the same director as Last Tango in Paris, which is full of dark passions. Here one sees some cheap sentimentality mixed with graphic scenes representing erotic dreams of an adolescent, but the overall impression is boredom and flaccidity. What a degradation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn disguised as Art","review":"What i find sad is Amazon decided that i was an ideal candiate for this movie the day after i saw it.I saw it uncensored at the Cinema in Singapore yesterday as a single seated in the double love seat row. This made it hard to get past the knotted bodies. If i'd been on the end of the row i would have snuck out to the bathroom and never come back. Eating garbage out of a dustbin and smearing semen on people and pictures does not set you free or show you to be a great creative thinker.

The incestuous relationship between two of them is absurb given their very ordinary lives and the film never explains the roots of the sibling's desire. The psychological movie games they played were as harmless and dull as children playing dress-up and seemed an excuse for a more exotic fantasy. This film about an American youth hooking up with sibling students in France during the Vietnam era is not an homage to movies or art or the French cinema, it is an attempt at sexual tension but the result is limp."},{"rating":"1","title":"no worth the 30 cents to make the disk","review":"This movie was very dry unless you enjoy philosophy and people sitting around naked all day wasting their time talking about nothing. The movie focuses in on an idiotic American who obviously was weaned off his mother's tits too late because he is super socially awkward, then he gets thrown into a life of alcohol sex and doing whatever he wants, which amounted to about nothing of value. The girl is a girl that has been messed up by a incestuous relationship with her brother that distorts her relationship with the idiot American and causes her to act very strangely.I give this movie 4 thumbs down"},{"rating":"1","title":"French-Style Insult on Cinematic Art","review":"Indeed a movie loaded with taboos; thus, neither is it educating nor entertaining; in fact, boring and bothersome.

I don't mind racy and unique, but I do mind a plot that is very underdeveloped. It seems quite obvious that Bertolucci attempts to plug all the holes with young smooth flesh, and in fact the acting is pretty good, but all and all there is no overcoming a monotonous storyline, littered with unexplored avenues that could have exploited.

To understand 1968 we are referred to La Chinoise.The world of La Chinoise is total confusion. The student protagonists are struggling to find a reason and a channel for their state of mind. What had started as rebellion became a cause not clearly determined. La Chinoise is about that search.What The Dreamers is about is not so clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The Dreamers gets 21/2 stars for cluttering the ending.

Our hero says no violence and walks away, the twins are provoking the police with molotov cocktails, so we get a deus ex machina and a moral lesson in the last 7 minutes of the movie.

I read a good review of The Dreamers and thought I would check it out. The tagline is 'Cinema, Sex, Politics.' The cinema is mostly sixties French, not my cup of tea, so that leaves the politics and sex. This film probably has a nostalgic appeal to those who were inspired by Paris '68, but I was in nappies, so onto the sex. The actress is hot, but in these mutlimedia days a naked woman is not the thrill it was when I was 15. I like films for their stories, and this one doesn't really work. The climax is very artificial, involving the return of parents who are estranged emotionally from their children, but the effect it has on the daughter is absurdly extreme. The acting is shabby, and all in all it comes off as an aging director using his clout to get sexual kicks on set. Still, it has a ton of reviews here on Amazon, so that's my title and bottom line - sex sells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Boring","review":"I really don't understand how people could like this movie. It's boring, too long (for a movie where nothing exciting happens), cliche, not funny, not sexy and the characters I couldn't relate to or care about. Also, the sister/brother relationship is downright creepy and frankly quite gross.

By this point in his film career, unfortunately, Bertolucci had lost the plot, could barely direct and certainly had problems casting this film. Some of the worst performances I've seen in a film by a 'major' director. Only Eva Green shows potential, which this film most likely killed because, as her agent feared, she became another Maria Schneider.The story is good, and in more capable hands, could have made an excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"This movie is weird to say the least. The story line is very poorly developed and it the movie is only driven by the sexual tension between the main characters. I imagine that this movie has been popularized by the success of Eva Green in Casino Royale, and if your goal is to see her nude then you will have plenty of it here.

I bought this thinking 100% that I would not like it but love it...and I was quite disappointed, because I didn't even like it. Don't get me wrong, the acting on all parts was fine. Michael Pitt did an excellent job as well. It is just the movie itself that I had a problem with. I've never had a problem with nudity in any film, but I thought the majority of every nude shot in this film was completely pointless and tasteless.

The basic story premise is sound but the talent of the actors is wasted and the sexual tension between the characters is never fully developed. I expected more physical interaction between the three, instead, the action seem stifled and unfinished. I feel that the actors were are not allowed to fully utilize their obvious talents.

(The ones he likes, at least.) But so what? Many of the films referenced I have seen, some I have not. Nevertheless, it all plays like an erotic Trivial Pursuit game. The sex is graphic, but ultimately boring. Roger Ebert in his review talks about the sex existing within a successfully created context. I disagree, and have to wonder seriously about reviews from cinema wonks. There is a corresponding irony in the film that perhaps Ebert should take to heart when serving up such questionable verdicts: Theo masturbating on a poster of Marlene Dietrich. I think a better erotic/art film example could be found in \\"Henry & June.\\" Not perfect by any means, but at least Miller and Nin were creators . \\"The Dreamers\\" only offers spoiled posers.

It follows two siblings, Theo and Isabelle, and an American foreign exchange student Matthew. The Parisian setting is the last bit of the social strife brought up in the movie until the end. The bulk of the movie is spent with the main characters exploring their sexuality. There are some watchable parts to the movie, but for the most part it was good only if you like gratuitous nudity. I know that it is labeled as an artsy movie and that is what Bertolucci is known for but it seems to be less of a thinking movie and more of an excuse for Eva Green to get naked.

When I did see it in its totality I was dumbfounded by its pointlessness, though, it captured the revolutionary excitement and free-spirited dynamic of Paris in that era. The sickening relationship that develops among three characters-- one American student and two incestuously close Parisian siblings-- did not make for an interesting character study. None of their motivations and reactions even made sense, particularly the psychotic sister who seemed to be suffering a deeper, untouchable madness that ultimately prevented her from being a part of the 'real world'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dreamers","review":"Eva Green was wonderful with a body made for sculpture.

It just names names without any justification. I recently thought that we had gotten past this kind of name-calling and these kind of accusations. But no, it is now coming back to haunt us again present day (2012).The problem here is that the right-wingers who supported this book 50 years ago and the same right-wingers today don't want to be reminded of the First Amendment to the Constitution and it's phrase \\"freedom of speech\\".

It deftly (and inadvertently) makes a case for exactly why NOT to oversimplify arguements into good vs. evil.

It was a sick anti-American tirade then and it has not gotten any better with age. Historians will find this book fascinating for documenting the depths to which America can fall.

According to the author, the tiny American Communist Party (thoroughly infiltrated by the FBI, I might add) and its leader Gus Hall have secretly controlled the United States for decades now. The author provides no documentation for this allegation, no verification at all, he just reads Gus Halls self important public statements, then tries to show how this proves that Gus Hall controlled some policy of the government.

I have seen it far too many times and this is just one from the bunch.You'll see nothing that wasn't carbon copied from other movies of this type. For example, the high school kids who begin to suspect that their teachers really are from distant places team up to try and stop them.

Its a similar alien movie with teachers and students being abducted.Unlike most current teenager movies, this one is not predictable. It will keep you guessing to the end.

The entire movie is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is Dawsons Creek meets the X-files!","review":"I would have to describe this is as Dawsons Creek meets the X-files! A kind of sci-fi thriller for teens , older viewers may not appreciate the whole high school scene. This is not as good as 'From Dusk til Dawn' for those who saw that Robert Rodriguez directed this and thought it might be the same. It's not like the whole 'bodysnatchers' theme hasn't been done before but still this is quite watchable. Also Salma Hayek fans beware she's hardly in this movie!

And surprisingly from the director of FROM DUSK TIL DAWN and DESPERADO it's very tame stuff. There isn't much gore, the rebellion factor is shockingly low (this is important in a movie like this) and the story is never fully developed and isn't up to much. The only thing that is good about this movie is Josh Hartnett. I think he is a very good actor and he should have been given more screen time.All you get on this non-anamporphic DVD is a trailer, Dolby 5.1 and a letterboxed picture framed at 1.82:1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I liked The Faculty","review":"Ok, number one it was Elijah Wood in it. Admittidly this was the only reason I wanted to see it, but then when I did see it I liked it, and not just for Elijah.This film consists of a group of main characters who are all outsiders in some way at their school. Elijah plays Casey who is the geek, Jordana Brewer plays the object of fancy, Delilah and Josh Hartnett (Peaal Harbour) plays Zeke the dropout who's back etcAlthough classified as a horror, the main shock is right at the beginning of the film!! Little shocks throughout, but personally not many by my standards.The plot is that aliens have landed and are taking over the school, this group of outsiders are the last ones left and have to stop it before it gets out of control. Yet, the twist is that one of the group IS the alien, but who?

It coulden't be better because it had Kevin Williamson's midas touch. But unfortunately, my parents hated it. It could be that there was some drug use, well I guess there was a lot of drug use. But that doesen't matter, they said that they would've liked it if it didn't have the drugs. But maybe it's just because they grew up in the \\"Happy Days\\" generation that anything in the 90's has to be bad. I loved this movie and my parents don't effect my judgement at all.

The Faculty shows that good acting and horror films can actually happen on the same screen. I was glued to the set for this movie and although the idea of teachers that are aliens scared me away (by thinking it was a cheesy idea) the director managed to pull it off and in the end they came out with a fine piece of work.

I recommend it as a great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best at being typical!","review":"The Faculty, is a typical sci-fi/thriller, where you can normally work out what will happen at the end (if you've seen enough originals! ). As this picture was written by the same author as SCREAM, the style is quite similar. Elijah Wood plays an excellent role as the school nerd - well, what else can you say! As I said, the plot is typical, but, it is an excellent \\"typical\\" plot. I enjoyed this movie. Besides the fact the Protagonists (goodies! ) have to break the law to try and solve the mystery is not the best moral to show younger viewers - but most younger viewers probably won't pay much attention to it anyway!

Sure, \\"Scream\\" was a pretty good thrill ride, but anything this guy wrote after \\"Scream 2\\" is pretty much a remake of everything else that has already been done. \\"Cursed\\" is every other werewolf movie that's already been done, why not do another \\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\\"?

Mainly John Carpenters THE THING. Some of the scenes are actually lifted directly from that film. A glaring example is the scene where the teacher is beheaded out in the shool parking lot. Her walking head is the exact replica of the one in The Thing.Also the scene in the one of the teens homes where they snort coke to see who is not who they pretend to be. Another direct rip off of The Thing.One more, is where the queen morphs and reveals her true self is also somewhat reminescent of The Thing. My suggestion? Leave this on the rental counter and rent a far superior horror flick called The Thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful Cash-In","review":"Robert Rodriguez proved with \\"El Mariachi\\" and some of his other films that he is indeed a talented director, but what made him think that \\"The Faculty\\", this Body Snatchers rip-off for Generation Me, was going to work? The special effects are cheesy, the story is cliche-ridden, and the only real redeeming element is that the teenagers in this movie (who are mostly played by 20 year old actors, I might add) actually seem like realistic teenagers. Poor Rodriguez, I hope he fares better with his next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that scary..","review":"This was indeed a great movie that you should see but, I wouldn't classify it as horror. It had a lot of good action in it and it was pretty funny in some parts. If you are looking for a good horror, then don't get this... I would recommend \\"Scream\\". This is a very good movie, though and if you're in the mood for teachers that are from another planet then, Go rent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What could you want more than this ?","review":"This movie was too good. I watched it over and over until I knew each and every single shot. The Sci-Fi Movie hitting the stands and warming up the rent logs at Video Shops,is surely a set movie for some top-notch award. This movie is totally rad. I seek for more movies like this. The characters played by the artists were awesome. The Professors and coach are not to be missed. The Students, the serem, the plays and the moves are just out of this world. GET YOUR COPY NOW.

The cast is unbelievable, including Clea Duvall (HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER, THE KILLING ROOM), Josh Hartnett (HALLOWEEN H2O, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT), Framke Janssen (LORD OF ILLUSION), Elijah Wood (THE ICE STORM, LOTR, SIN CITY), Robert Patrick (TERMINATOR 2, EYE SEE YOU), Piper Laurie (RUBY, CARRIE), and Salma Hayek (FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) as the school nurse! This movie proves what we've always suspected, that our teachers are human hosts for alien parasites! This explains a lot! We also learn that illegal drugs are the salvation of mankind.

That may be good enough fo some but not for me. Now i admit the first time i saw this movie i liked it, but then i watched it again and i couldnt believe that such a high profile cast could do such an idiodic film. With fine special effects and fine acting, the fineness ends there and ridiculesness begins. A teen interpretation of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is an insult to such a classic horror film. Kevin Williamson tried to go a different direction with his writing, and he did-going down, anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Shocking Movie","review":"The Faculty was a great movie! It isn't like your slasher movie where kids are getting chopped up every where, however, it is a suspense kind of movie.

Well, if you're like me and want to see a movie that keeps you guessing, this is the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All And All, Quite Unoriginal","review":"The Faculty isn't completely bad really. The creature effects are pretty cool in places, but that's really the only good thing about this movie. This movie barely has a shred of originality within it. Even through all the action scenes, it still was quite dull. The acting was okay. The Faculty is quite odd and unoriginal, but it does have some nice effects, especially the creatures in the aquarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly well crafted","review":"Alright, when I first rented the film I was thinking 'gee how dumb will this be', but I still watched and to my amazement it was a lot better than I thought it would be. Many people will complain about the thieving from other films, but who cares, really? In fact, the characters pointed it out in the film, specifically Stokely, so what is the big deal? The students acting was decent, exceptionally good from Elijah Wood (probably a lot more talented than those so called \\"heartthrob\\" actors out there now). Most of the faculty's acting was pretty good, Piper Laurie had me going as her being the queen alien because we never witnessed or assumed how she was taken over. The fun part was guessing the queen alien, but it was easy to figure out who the hero would be. The only complaint is the story book ending it had which made me cut a star. My only regret is not going to see it at the movie theater.

Quincy Jones's daughter had all her footage removed and Usher got screwed as well. They just used him to get his fans to watch the movie and we were disappointed. He didn't do much of anything. All I want is a director's cut with all the deleted footage that was featured in the ads for the movie. Usher didn't get taken over until much later in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spot the Microphone game.","review":"This movie is a sad joke.

First of all, the acting is so terrible that you think that there was no director. Imagine all these teens who suddenly save the world from some strange alien that is invading their high school.

I prefer the slasher ones, but this will do. Kevin Williamson from \\"Scream\\" and Robert Rodriguez from \\"Desperado\\" and \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\" team up for this sci-fi/horror teen film about a bunch of high schoolers who find out that the faculty at their school have been overtaken from some outer space parasite. The one thing this film has going for it is the cast. We get a lot of great seasoned performers : Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Jenssen, and Christopher MacDonald. The kids are all good. Jordana Brewster is an instant eye catcher. Very beautiful girl. There is nothing new here, but the sharp direction and choreography, as well as the solid cast make it decent enough. Pretty average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where exactly is the horror/sci-fi genre headed to?","review":"Why is it year after year we have to have horror movies with teenage stars? When was the last time we saw an actual original film that mixed comedy with horror and science fiction as The Faculty tried to? I believe it was 14 years ago to a movie called Re-Animator. That same year, two other imaginitive horror films called Day of the Dead and The Return of the Living Dead were also released. Why is it we can't have horror films as good as those three? Instead, we get an imitation of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Puppetmasters with a cast of young stars. While the acting was better than usual, nothing else was. It just seemed highly improbable that an entire town that was infected could not find six teenagers that weren't. This movie had some mildly suspenseful scenes, but overall lacked imagination, and definitely laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterically Horrific","review":"This Film has to be the Funniest Horror film In years.

The point is, this movie is a fun way to spend a couple of hours. But, it can only be fun if you don't over analyse it. It does have a few story line flaws, but overal it is a really enjoyable experience. Kudos especially to Clea DuVall. She is probablly the only hot girl who you'd buy as a Trekkie. While some of the characters seemed a little too cliche (Jordana Brewsters character, for example) overall it was a bunch who you could safely get invested in.

It's Invaders From Mars, it's The Puppet Masters, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and so on. Take that concept and add in teen angst and a good cast directed by Robert Rodriguez and you get a decent but predictable movie. This is the kind of movie that could really benefit from more female nudity. I think Rodriguez has done better, I think most of the cast has done better, but I got this for $5.99 on Blu-Ray.

LouAnne's description of the classroom atmosphere and individual lives of students make this more than just a story of HER teaching years. This is real life, baby, and you'll get a healthy taste of the educational system that is still clunking along today. LouAnne is the genuine article, the real McCoy and the students sense her deep-level caring. Fortunately, by reading the book, you can glean a similar sense of the Love, openness, attention, and hope that LouAnne shared with these students. No wonder they were all considered \\"dangerous minds.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Erika","review":"Dangerous Minds by Louanne Johnson was an inspirational book about one teacher who changed the minds of several troubled teenage students. This book caught my attention for many different reasons. Each student had to deal with their own individual problems, and Ms. Johnson was always there to help them get by. She taught her students the true meaning of school, and they soon were appreciative of all the time she gave to them. This book went straight to my heart and I feel for all the characters. As I was reading the book I would be so involved with Ms. Johnson's school days that I wouldn't want to put the book down. I would recommend this book to both teachers and students.

I wish there were more teachers like LouAnne Johnson, who really care about their students. She teaches them what's really important for life, and exactly this IS the job of a teacher.

My point exactly. NOONE. Its not to get food, or to try to steal money to get out of the school, its to read poetry. That is by far the most retarded plot ever made. I admit, some parts where funny, but the plot is ridilusly stupid, and so far-fetched, that watching makes you think how stupid the characters are.

And That's About It.","review":"The acting in this movie was amazing. I could truly believe the characters--and not just Robin Williams, either. Unfortunately, that's about all there is to be said for this movie. It starts off rather promising, in a strict New England private school, but goes downhill from there. Robin Williams plays John Keating, an English Lit teacher who also teaches his students to \\"Carpe Diem--Seize the Day!\\" with disasterous results. Those \\"disasterous results\\" were the one high point in the movie. It seems like Weir, the director, tried to stretch about thirty minutes material into a two hour movie. In other words, it was really boring. Until the end, where all the \\"loose ends\\" in the movie climax into a disaster worthy of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, this disaster lasts about ten minutes, and suddenly you find yourself looking at credits scrolling across the screen.The bottom line: fast foward to the last ten minutes of the movie and you should be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, Sentimental, Self-Important Junk","review":"Robin Williams trots out his Column B (serious) performance. You know, the one he does to prove that he is More Than Just A Comedian, where he gets really quiet and serious and seems to be having a hard time keeping awake. His work in this film is supposed to come off as enlightened, but instead seems irredeemably smug and self-congratulatory. The holy glow that surrounds Williams in this film, as he does all kinds of endearingly unpredictable things, quickly became as oppressive as the very atmosphere he is supposed to be enlivening.Many fine actors do their very best to make the film work: Norman Lloyd, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Josh Charles. But the script's adoration of wealth and privilege and Williams' self-righteous posing make this film fit only for those who find Braveheart to be the height of intelligent filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickeningly awful.","review":"The only thing more nauseating than Robin William's overacting & pointless impressions and improvisations is the presentation of suicide as something noble and heroic. Having lost someone to suicide, this is the most disgusting, cowardly, and selfish act a human being can commit. I was hoping that \\"Heathers\\" finally killed off the ignorant sentiment of \\"self-sacrifice.\\" Sadly, I was wrong.

We saw in Dead Poets Society how the institution, the establishment, treated Robin Williams' character after he instilled spirit in the few boys sharp enough to appreciate him: they did not tolerate his methods, and they fired his derriere abruptly. My teacher friends are the same way as that school's administration, though they would never admit it. They demand that students in their classrooms toe the line, and denounce as \\"undisciplined\\" or \\"uncooperative\\" any behavior which exhibits individuality.This is an excellent, entertaining and -- in the end -- sadly realistic film. It shows institutional academia for what it truly can be: intolerant, discriminatory and hypocritical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of Individualism","review":"This masterful tale of how we are all truly different, and although perhaps the portayal of the school and teachers are a little harsh you must see that it is a symbolic reference to the world around us, the students are those who are force into conformity.

It has a good story with a good meaning. I'm sorry, but I must say that Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard are very cute in this movie. I am a big fan of poetry, and that is probably why my friends think I'm crazy. This movie is not as much about poetry, it is about being something. It is about being happy with your life. Also it demonstrated how different people tried to make their lives what they wanted them to be; one made a wrong choice, and the other took a risk and made his life better. This might seem confusing, but this movie is about life,its ups,and its downs. This is a movie that may seem sad, but life is sad. People must deal with their emotions,and what better way to do it than to write poetry.

Most of time when people talk about DPS, they speak of Keating's inspiration. I dare say that they inspired him too. \\"Carpe Diem\\" has become such a weary phrase in popular culture, but the message contained in the film is still resonant.Each time I see it, I get something new out of it. It is very moving. Oh, it is not perfect. The plot is a bit too melodramatic, particularly the last third. However, on the whole, this beautifully (hello DVD fans) shot film overcomes this.

Surrounded by dry, cold, rigid collegues, John Keating (played by Williams) offers students a glimmer of hope and inspires them like never before. It is nice that the movie won an Oscar for its screenplay, but the Academy laid an egg by passing Williams up for best actor. This film is wonderful, from the character development, cinematography, soundtrack, and costumes. Robin Williams is frequently accused of over-acting, but he nails this role.

For anyone who had a group that was like family at school, this is the movie for you to watch. This brotherhood was just amazing to behold. And Robin Williams?

When one student is faced with a difficult situation, Williams tries to advise and help this young man.

Not only was the location beautiful, the acting superb, but the plot was worth watching. I would say the only negative thing about this film, and I've seen that a few people agreed with me, was the fact that the John Keating [Williams] character was kind of lacking. It wasn't a problem of Robin Williams though, he managed to make the most of the character, as always. The story is about a prep school in Vermont, 1959. The new english teacher is John Keating [Williams], and he teaches the students not only about poetry, but about \\"seizing the day\\", and go for whatever makes you happy.

The reviewer who advised caution was correct-this is just the same version with a few \\"bonus\\" features. The \\"Deleted Scenes\\" or \\"Raw\\" footage contains only the couple of minutes of Keating meeting the boys at the cave after Neil's performance. The version shown on USA (I haven't seen the Laser Disk Director's Cut) containing the extra footage of Knox's dinner at Danbury's and meeting Ginny Danbury, the scene rehearsing near the lake, the boys being assigned their extracurricular activities are all missing. The original script called for Knox and Chris to kiss near the frozen waterfall after the Keating-led meeting. That's not here, either.

This film is about boys who start chnging little by little through Mr. Keating's unique classes in which he teaches his students how to \\"make their lefe extraordinary.\\" The boys start expressing themselves through many poems. The most interesting scene for us is the climactic scene of the movie. In that scene we could see how much the boys changed.

For example, he tells his students that \\"whether it's odd or unpopular, you have to trust that your beliefs are unique.\\" Now there's a useful quote right there! The movie itself is a real treat as well. The strong cast (Williams, Hawke, Sean Leonard, Smith, etc.) makes it even all better.

I particularly liked the last scene because I was moved what Todd said.

I could also relate personally because I have discovered the same love for acting that Neil has and I could understand his pain.

The students restarted the Dead Poets society, but it caused their progress and tragedy. Because of problems about his students that takes place form next to next, they were compelled to do something by Mr.Nolan,the headmaster of the school. The most intresting character for us was Knox. His mind is just like ours, passionate and brave. If we were him we would act similarly. We think the main massage is \\"Seize the day\\". These words tell us to be active,to make your own day,not to be a person who does nothing but obey others. To watch this film, we felt something like independence and adventure at the scene of cave.

Robin shows the kids to seize the day and that being yourself is the best way to be.Keating inspires a group of boys to relive a club called The Dead Poets Society.He shows one kid,Neil Perry, to tell his father the way he really feels.Though the results are devastating Keating told Neil the right thing to do. Keating also shows Todd Anderson, a shy boy, that speaking your own mind is okay and that even if it is a foolish thing to say, it is your mind speaking and no one elses. It truly is the best movie of it's time. The best movie yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Poets is realistic and heartbraking","review":"I fist viewed \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" in school about a year ago. This movie touched me in ways few other films have. Watching the movie, I could really feel the pain of the charactors as the struggled with different situations. Robin Williams gives a believable performance as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's terrific!","review":"I watchedgDead Poets Societyh. The setting is in 1959,in U.S. in the East Coast State. The main characters are Mr.Keating,Neil,and Todd. The story is about a preparatory school which is very conservative and values tradition. Mr.Keating comes to this school to encourage students to think freely and live everyday to the fullest. However,the teachers of of the schol dont like his way of teaching. I think this movie is great. It shows us that we have to live everyday to the fullest and think by ourselves. I particularly like and sympathize with Neil. He wants to be an actor,but his father doesn't allow him to act. Finally, something terrible happens to Neil. Mr.Keating is blamed for this misery,but I don't think it's not fair! It's Neil's parent's fault. They should have taken his dream into consideration. Anyway,I recommend this movie to everyone,especially to parents and teachers. They should reconsider their way to bring/teach their ways to to bring up their children/students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great movie!","review":"This wasn't a movie I'd normally pick but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

This movie reminds me of one of Richard Wagner's great music-dramas \\"Die Meistersinger\\", which is also about the struggle of the creative process. I do not feel the students had a clue about what it meant to be artists (poets) until they finally, at the end of the movie, stood on the top of their chairs in defiance while \\"captain, my captain\\" left the school. Anyone with children who have an interest in their kids becoming musicians, poets, painters, etc, should watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"teacher to father","review":"Interesting film. I saw this when I was young and I emphasised with the teacher who was bold, interesting full of life and passionate about what he believed was right.

This is a brilliant film and one of my favourites of all time.

While most other movies are all the same, boy meets girl boy gets girl etc, this one stands out. While there is a boy meets girl element in this film, the way the story goes for Neil is what adds the realism to this film, setting it apart from the rest. Todd's character is great. Starts off shy and doesn't really say much but by the end of the film he really comes through. Robin Williams is great as he usually is, playing the part of a teacher that inspires his students. I would so recommend this film to anybody!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpe Diem!!","review":"The film, \\"Dead Poets Society\\" is about the relationship between Mr. Keating, the Latin teacher and his students in a preparatory school in America. Mr. Keating influences his students and they gradually become creative. Neil, the main student wants to be an actor. However, he can't say waht he really wants to do to his parents, and there is a tragedy in the end. I particularly liked the last scene when Mr. Keating is kicked out of school. All the students stand up on their desks to show their apologizes to Mr. Keating, because they can't save him. I leaned not to give up and try my best from Mr. Keating. I liked this film not only the story but also the setting. The school is located in the countryside in America. It is filled with nature. It is really beautiful when it snows.

Before long,the students made a secret organization called \\"Dead Poets Society\\" which Keating was used to make when he was in this school.However,unbelievable tragedy happened to the boys who could gradually find what is themselves. The main theme I think is \\"freedom\\".This movie will show you how great the freedom is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story to think about","review":"I think this is a very good film because it's a story to think about. It's not like most of the others. After watching them you turn the TV off and forget about them. But \\"Dead Poets' Society\\" is different. You have to ask yourself if you seize the day and if you like the system you're in. And if you don't, then change something like Mr Keating does. But there are always people who don't like to change anything like the other teachers and the parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A full sound spectrum recording","review":"\\"A full sound spectrum recording of background music featured in Michael Todd's Academy Award Winning film.\\" \\"In Spectra-Sound.\\" Honest, that's what it says on the front of the album. But don't let that fool you into thinking this is some big joke. They were dead serious.When Michael Todd wet out to produce the most staggereing spectacle ever filmed, he choose the inimitable VICTOR YOUNG to compose music to match the scope of the movie. In a way, Young's music has weathered much better than the movie. And the techniques used back in 1956 to record those large cinema string sections seem to make the strings shimmer like bright sunlight or light rain, depending on the track. The melodies are ingenious, yet hummable.Recommended highly for fans of the genre. Pity it's so pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well","review":"I'll be blunt. I didn't care for this book. I bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the Gnostic Sophia. Instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions Her. I really think the title was misleading. As a sidenote, Lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that Lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of Gnosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer for Tourists","review":"As a tourist and frequent visitor to the Languedoc region of France, I found the book fascinating and instructive. It answered many questions about the history and attitudes of the people. Languedoc is still spoken and sung in the area. It is also quite relevant to the later protestant movements. The French Revolution also seems to have taken a leaf from its history with its viciousness, and digging up the bones of the Kings and church leaders at St Denis and burning them just as the church did with the heretics in the Middle Ages. Islam today seems to be going through the same evolution with its non-separation of theology and politics but with no burning. Perhaps they will evolve to allow a personal belief without chopping off heads or suicide bombers.The book does anglicize everything it can which makes for easy reading but sometimes leads to confusion.All in all a very easy must read for anyone interested in French history or the Languedoc region of France."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid introductory primer on the Cathars","review":"If you are going to visit Southern France and want a quick study on the subject of the Cathars, then this book will suffice.

It covers topics such as functional abstraction, data abstraction, OOP, program design, constraint programming and logic programming, always from a language design point of view. You will need a decent mathematical background to follow it.If it's such a great textbook, then why half of the reviewers hate it? Elementary: SICP is not just a textbook, it's also a Computer Science aptitude and vocational test. If you read it and like it, then Congratulations! You are a real programmer and computer scientist, with hair on your chest. If you don't like it, then you should be studying something else. Law, mortuary science, whatever, but not CS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best general book on computer science ever written","review":"This is not a book for mass consumption, as the negative reviews below (and eventually above) clearly indicate. This is a book about how to structure complexity so that it remains easily understandable and manageable. You may think this is obvious, yes? But do you know how to do it for immensely complex systems? That's what this book is about. It's the difference between being a mediocre programmer and a virtuoso. If you plan on writing code that will actually be looked at again, if you plan on designing anything anyone will ever care about, if you want your view of computational systems to change how you look at the world, this book is first on your reading list. If you want to write spaghetti code for a living, get \\"C++ for Dummies\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most amazing book about thinking and programming.","review":"Have read it, have studied it, am most inspired by it. If all programmers would read this there would be better code in the world. Knowing this book you can make the almost impossible happen, harness the true potential of the computing machines. If you grew up around great scientific and engineering minds that makes it easier to read this book in one sitting, but everyone who wants to become a creator of the digital future, everyone who truly wants to be in control of our fate should read this book. How do you become a great programmer? At some time read this book, even if it takes you many tries to get through it.

Especially for beginners, this book is very frustrating. The first few chapters often employ obscure mathematical tricks as examples of how the computing concepts can be applied. In the end, the reader doesn't see the forest for the trees and tries to figure out the math just to understand what the code samples are doing. Other parts of the book either mention in passing, or devote very little space to interesting ideas, and instead devote pages and pages to something fundamental, to the point that it gets very boring. Finally, I personally think this book is poorly organized. The first four chapters try to focus on maximum abstraction, and the last chapter presents a totally oposing view of computers--as register machines...which is a completely different paradigm. This confuses many people.I'd give this book zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"if looking for ideas, look elsewhere","review":"I would say only the idea of abstraction is \\"beatiful\\" but the rest of the book is drivel. It tries to present profound ideas, but fails miserably for lack of lively content or perhaps the incompetence of the authors as teachers. Although I haven't looked, I'm sure there are plenty of better books on the art of programming. This one is just a waste of time no matter what your interests are."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too bad, but completely useless","review":"This book is readable. I can't say it's fun or easy to understand, but a *few* concepts might seem interesting. However, the large majority of things introduced can't be applied. Streams, for example, are introduced to alleviate the bottlenecks created by Scheme in conjunction with poor code planning earlier in the book. They are completely irrelevant to languages like C/C++. The same with other things here. Mildly curious but nothing useful and certainly no profound theories, as some would have you believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scheme ruins everything","review":"If looked upon as a reference, this book isn't all that bad. There are some interesting concepts here. Few, thought--most of the stuff is self evident. Also, I really think them using Scheme was a big mistake. A book of this caliber should not concern itself with specific languages, true, and they could have done two things: use a syntactically simple language, or ignore any specific language all together and use pseudocode. They chose the former, and that's too bad. Scheme is totally inappropriate for these kinds of complicated things. My other gripe with the title is that it doesn't go in depth into any one topic. Just a bunch of concepts thrown at you and briefly explained. The book migh serve well as a reference, but it definitely isn't for beginners, as it claims to be, and it definitely won't teach you programming. Most of the material here is curious, but hardly relevant to you if you've never programmed before."},{"rating":"1","title":"cryptic and uninteresting","review":"This book is good to read when you have trouble falling asleep. Everyone I know, including the professor, were often confused. In the end, he abandoned the book and started teaching from his own notes, and learning Scheme and the concepts became a pleasure. The problem is the author, who thinks that because he's from MIT, he can just write drivel and it will sell. Everything in this text can be explained much more clearly and precisely if done by a good teacher. But the book makes no such effort, and as a result, it's boring and often difficult to understand. If you really want to learn the foundations of programming, buy a book by Knuth, for instance. SICP, though, is probably the worst, most arrogant and pompous text on programming, but it teaches nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"If you read books carefully and try to understand their meaning, you'll be frustrated by this text.If you read 'popular' books as a 'trophy' collection activity and don't think about content...this book is for you.

It was supposed to turn me into a deeply understanding computer scientist, and not just a code monkey. I found out those promises didn't come true. Two semesters later I was feeling lucky to have finally finished the course, and was angry to have wasted so much time. This book quite simply doesn't deliver what it promises. Instead, it tries to be as coprehensive as possible, covering so many topics that I was dizzy, but it does a very bad job of explaining anything in detail. The end result is that I learned nothing. Apparently the authors believe quantity is better than quality.

It starts out ok, but after the second half of section 2, the book gets to be incredibly thick and boring.

I was quite disappointed. One of three things usually happened when I read about a new topic in this text:1. I already knew some things this book talks about. They are, in fact, fairly obvious, like abstraction.2. The idea was fairly interesting, but it wasn't possible to implement it outside of Scheme. In other words, this idea became useless.3. Some things were just a pointless waste of time. Purely philosophical discussions.In short, this book told me nothing new. A huge disappointment. I don't understand what these people see in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly fun","review":"This book is a bad experience. The authors make no attempt to explain anything, but instead cram the book with many confusing concepts and without any teaching effort, try to make you see the \\"beauty of it all\\".

It'll only be a waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"People told me this book was B.S. , so I went throught the entire course without reading it and going to lecture, which worked splendidly. I got this book at another store at the very end, just as a curiousity, and promptly returned it when I saw just how bad it is.Confusing, pointless, dumb. This isn't about the value of fundamental knowledge of computer science anymore, the book is outright poor as a teacher. I'm sure there are other books on philosophy of computer science which will teach you a lot more. This one is just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly interesting","review":"I can't say this book is absolutely horrible, but it isn't good either. I read it on the advice of some guy who liked it, but I didn't. The breadth and wealth of topics discussed is staggering, but none of them are treated especially well, and some seemed hardly of any relevance. I still think the way they presented structures such trees and lists, with pairs, is a very braindead approach. C style pointers are much more intuitive and flexible. Aside from that, this text might be OK as a simple reference of what's out there, but there are definitely better books on just about any topic presented in this text. I only got through chapter 4 and got very bored along the way.Buy at your own risk. This book is way overrated and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't read unless you like to be bored","review":"This book is used as a filter in our computer science department. It subjects students to material so boring, and presented so poorly, that only those who can stand through it all ever stay on for more computer science classes. Complete waste of your time....it describes (in a confusing manner) concepts which can be better learned elsewhere. The authors apparently believe that quantity is better than quality, and try to cram a lot of material without explaining any of it in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so good about it?","review":"I don't understand what others see in this book. I realize that it is *supposed* to be about foundations of good programming style, and not about any language in particular, but being language specific is exactly what it does. Many things it teaches can only be done in Scheme. Also, I think the presentation of material is very poor, whatever the purpose. For example, they spend a disproportionate amount of time on simple concepts, and rush through complicated information, such as the implementation of a logic programming language. This book is thoroughly confusing, and chances are you won't learn anything new. Anyone who has read the book carefully will notice its poor style."},{"rating":"1","title":"solid waste .... of time","review":"I'm not sure who the target audience is (besides the poorMIT undergrads who are force to sift through this [junk]), buthaving taught (as an assistant to a professor) a lower-levelcomputer science class (one not dealing with Scheme, thankfully)I have asked many freshmen abou their thoughts on this book andthe class taught out of it.*ALL*hated it. Some PhD students, whose specialty was programminglanguages, tolerated it, while other PhD students also hated it.So there you have it. If you are into programming languages likeScheme, this text is for you to salivate over Hal Abelson'sself fornication (how else would you call the senseless drivelhe wrote?). Otherwise, stay away. Beginning CS students will comeaway frustrated, as virtually every conventional algorithm isNOT implementable in scheme, and those who aren't beginnersand have no inherent interest in Scheme will simply find thebook a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't for kiddies looking for an easy ride","review":"I first encountered SICP (1st edition) as a computer science student in the mid 80's. I would consider this book to be the single most significant influence on my development as a programmer, even though I never used it in a course. This is one of the few programming texts out there that attempts to go to the roots of computer science. Yes, the examples are difficult to work out, but they're worth it. If you are looking for any easy \\"A\\" in your CS class, then avoid this book. If you are interested in programming as an actual intellectual discipline, as opposed to something you just hack until it compiles, then check out SICP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Textbook","review":"I used this book to teach myself Scheme. It used to be offered at MIT as 6.001 but unfortunately they removed it in favor of 6.01 Python. Scheme is very much the \\"Latin\\" of programming languages: it's not extremely useful but it teaches you how to approach programming and how to think about it. Highly encouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"what Feynman is to physics","review":"This book is to Computer Science what the Feynman Lecture notes are to physics: an introductory text that could reshape the mind of the average PdD. It's not about Lisp, it's not about Scheme, it's about computing at the most fundamental levels. If you're an experienced programmer, it will change your way of thinking forever. If you're a novice, it will set you down the right path. Read it and work through every problem. Repeat every few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"unenthusiastic presentation of computer science","review":"After reading this book, I went away having learned absolutely nothing. I knew about good program design techniques, such as abstraction, but I haven't been taught anything more. The problem with the text is that it tries too hard to cram all there is to know about computer science into one book. I understood what was going on, but ideas seemed disconnected. I felt as if I was at a car dealership, with someone blabbering at my ear and I'm not able to examine anything in detail. A better idea would be to get a nice, thick book on any specific topic after you learn the basics of programming from a C text. This book tries to present compilers, query systems and hardware design, but it'll leave you confused at best and won't teach you, because the presentation is not thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't a fun read","review":"Besides the heavy and dull material (which may not be that bad at all) this book has an unfriendly style, as if the authors are trying to elevate themselves above the crowd, instead of teach something. I won't recommend this text even to my enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does a shoddy job of teaching","review":"I liked some of the ideas in this book, but I later realized they were not presented by the author, but where merely good features of Lisp. After reading this book, I haven't learned all that much, and whatever I did learn, was a long and boring process. Regardless of subject matter, books *can not* be this inconsiderate of the reader. The author should show some enthusiasm and present the topics clearly. Instead, I found a haphazardly organized book with rushed discussion. Some interesting ideas were mentioned in passing, and instead, the boring drivel was dwelled on, sometimes for 20 pages. I often fell asleep after reading this book for 5 minutes. Lisp is worth learning, it's an interesting langauage, but don't learn it from this book. Read the book by Dybvig and Dybbig, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre title","review":"While some of the information is pretty interesting, most of it isn't, and some is outright self evident, such as abstraction concepts. In the year since I've read this book, I haven't opened it again and never used a single concept from it. That should tell you something about how relevant it is.It is really supposed to be for beginners, but I don't think beginners would find this text very user friendly or easy to understand. I know I had trouble in some parts and I'm not a beginner. In fact, I was forced to take this course as a computer science major at MIT. I've had a fair number of discussions about the book with various students. Few, if any, liked it.In short, it's just your average book, and definitely not worth the price, or your time. It has no earthshattering things to teach you."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"The book promises to make a better programmer out of you, to teach you how to think about programs, but this promise is not kept. Those things which it presents that are relevant to overall philosophy of programming are already widely know as it is. The other things they present are completely useless. In short, you will not gain any valuable insight and won't see any revelations or any radical and vastly superior methods of thinking about programs. It's just mundane drivel here. To top it off, the book is very dry. I'm extremely interested in theoretical computer science and this book managed to bore even me. You'd need a lots and lots of patience to get through even a fraction of the material here. I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too bad...","review":"...but only if you skim it quickly, brainwash yourself into thinking you learned a lot, and glorify this book because of its prestigious MIT roots.If you are one of those who think deep about the things you read, you'll realize most of this book doesn't make any sense. I learned the material from my college professor. (who hates the book, btw.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: This book will cause you severe pain","review":"I'm all for learning about good programming style, and I'm sure plenty of things in this book could be applied to some good purpose (with a stretch of imagination) but there's just no excuse for a book to be written so poorly. It is boring, it is confusing, and you won't learn much by reading it. I only figured out the concepts being presented after I went and listened in lecture at my university. In other words, don't get this book if you hope to learn on your own. You won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore!","review":"A major timewaster. The book doesn't teach anything worthwhile at all. Trees, recursion, encapsulation....those things are taught in beginning C courses and in any case, this book doesn't present them very well. The other 95% of the text is useless drivel. The authors don't seem to have any desire to be lucid..they just want to have the book with the most topics stuffed into it, regradless of whether they can all be presented clearly or not. I agree with other reviewers who said this book makes major promises, but doesn't deliver on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book!","review":"Unless you are required to have this text for the course (and why else would you buy this terrible book?) don't get the text. If you have any doubts about computer science, this book will make you hate it. It tries to mold budding computer scientists by gathering the driest, most boring subjects into one monster collection. You'll probably fall asleep before finishing the first few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"important concepts presented poorly","review":"I think you'll need a good prof. to learn anything from this book. If you like to learn on your own, you'll need to find better texts that this one. It's fairly dry/uninspiring and there's a lot of fluff mixed in with a bit of interesting material here and there. I didn't enjoy reading it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"No question, this book is a must read","review":"My first exposure to this book was as a freshman at MIT in '86. Since then I've been exposed to an awful lot of computer science books. And I'm afraid the term \\"awful\\" has applied all too often. This book still stands out in my mind as one of the best comp. sci. texts I've ever read. It encompasses so many different areas of computer science that it has only been when I reread it years later that I really appreciated the full scope of the topics the book hits. Every footnote seems to branch off into another interesting facet of comp. sci. It is a bit challenging (it was geared to MIT students) but is definitely worth the read. If you get it make sure you track down MIT Scheme, the language used throughout the book, it'll help you get the most from the book, and is very interesting in its own right. In my opinion the approach the authors take is a much better one than that traditionally followed by \\"introductory\\" computer science texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best serious programming introduction","review":"Superb! I wish I had read this book in my first year of computer science. I read it 9 years late! [BTW, I am a professional computer engineer.] It is the difference between memorizing multiplication tables and knowing how to multiply!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I must say, it takes great talent to take relatively simple and curious ideas, and present them in a very boring and convoluted way. That's right, this book will make you feel pain at every paragraph. You won't learn anything either. If you are interested in theoretical side of computers, there are plenty of better books. Don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither a zen, nor a bible of programming","review":"This book, quite simply sucks. I opened it up looking for good advice. Instead, I find discussions that lead nowhere, or if they do, they are very boring. For example, is it really necessary to discuss modularity and abstraction? Isn't it a bit obvious to anyone who has programmed even a little that breaking programs into manageable pieces is a good philosophy? That was the only concept treated that has some relevance to programming. Other topics, such as streams, logic programming, evaluators are all either useless, or presented so poorly, you'll definitely be better off reading specialized books on those topics. This book isn't good for beginners either. It's just too complicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICP is the WORST","review":"This has got to be the worst, most boring computer book I've ever read. The authors managed to gather the dullest material possible and present it in a very lifeless way. I had to get this book for the course (also very boring) and threw it away afterwards because no one would buy it back from me. If you love this book...you'll probably make a great hypnotist...so would the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"Buying this book was a big mistake on my part. I read some positive reviews here and hoped maybe to give the title a try, see what the excitement is all about. Now I see there is absolutely nothing interesting here. Just a couple of bored MIT professors trying to teach extremely boring and pointless concepts. In fact, I'm willing to bet that some of the issues discussed are probably interesting problems in themselves, but you can't tell that from the book. It's just too dry and manages to put me to sleep after just 5 pages of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible..don't buy this book!","review":"I don't know what these few people see in this book. It's boring, it's cryptic and the material is pointless. Perhaps they had good teachers or are deluding themselves into thinking this book must be good since it's from MIT. For 99.9% of people who read it (and I've talked with a lot of people about this book) it was a very unpleasant experience. The lucky few got good teacher, but even those saw clearly that it was the teacher's merit and that the book is terrible. Get this only if you want to waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half cooked...poor explanations","review":"I'm extremely interested in theoretical computer scinece, but I found out that this book presented the subject very poorly...emphasizing the wrong concepts and overall not giving a coherent and lucid discussion.

This will be a good approximation to how you'll feel when readint this book.Nothing makes sense. It's not the material that's tough, it's the authors' dull and pedantic style, and total lack of consideration for the needs of the student."},{"rating":"1","title":"shabby book","review":"The material in this book may be fun for some and boring to most, but if looked at objectively, this title does a pretty bad job of explaining most of the concepts that they try to introduce. Some things are dwelled on for so long that the reading becomes tedious, and some are covered too quickly. The last chapter, on register machines, is completely out of place. It belongs in a book on assembly programming and is a complete turn in the opposite direction from the rest of the book. In short, this title hopes to be the programming bible, but it never actually gets there. Many empty words and pointless discussions that lead nowhere. Unless you are absolutely in love with philosophical discussions on programming, and thus can put up with a bad presentation, don't get the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the out of place humor doesn't help matters","review":"The only pro for this book is the wealth of information. The main con is that all of this wealth is presented in a haphazard way. I couldn't understand most of it. This text would be OK as an occasional reference, but nothing more. It is definitely overrated.Just as an example, data directed programming, the way it is presented in the book, is counterintuitive. Operator overloading in C++ makes much more sense, even if its syntax is a little tougher than Scheme's.And finally, what's with the jokes? When they mentioned Microshaft, I realized that the authors are just two immature jerks. Don't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, dry, and devoid of useful information","review":"The book never lives up to all the hype surrounding it. In fact, of the over 50 people I know who had the misfortune to study out of it, none liked it. I imagine only a few crazy souls who care about nothing but dry computer langague theory would even consider this worth reading.Recursion and information hiding via procedural/object code is nothing mysterious and is taught in all other CS classes, so the text adds nothing new. It merely retells the same old obvious programming techniques using a very poorly designed language (Scheme) and using completely uneducational examples. In short, this book is an overrated waste of time. If you are familiar with structured programming in a langauge like C++, you won't get anything new out of this. In fact, any topic presented here is better learned elsewhere, since the text is just one of those poorly written books that try to be encyclopedic at the expense of being interesting and thorough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bulb, but no apparent improvement","review":"I saw no difference in light intensity of this bulb over the standard 60/55 watt bulb (HLA-H83140101) that Hella manufactures.

It's been noted that if this movie were set to horror movie music fromThe Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen),it would work. Fred, the Evil Leprechaun, manages to ruin everything in Phoebe's life, from destroying the houseboat of Carrie Fisher (Star Wars Trilogy) to ending a date in chaos.

This masterpiece should be introduced to the CD generation as well as to those of us old enough to remember the release. But the record is impossible to track down. The way Chris Spedding (could only have been equalled by Jeff Beck) imitates the Duck using the guitar only is worth the price alone. Spedding isn't the only great musican appearing on this RSO recording. Gary Moore, Alvin Lee and John Goodsall on guitars, Brian Eno, Phil Collins, the sophisticated bass players Percy Jones, Dave Marquee and Andy Pyle, John Hiseman, Bill Bruford and Cozy Powell helping out Collins on drums. Manfred Mann, Gary Brooker... And it works! No show-offs, and suberbly directed by the eccentric Viv Stanshall as narrator.

She didn't like the handle of this one at all. She has small hands, so that may be a factor. I also bought the: J.A. Henckels International 3-Piece Paring Knife Set, which she raved about. Also, it didn't seem to her that this knife was very sharp right out of the package, while the J.A.Henckels knives were very sharp.

Clearly a \\"program for profit\\" at CC led to cheaper steel. Doesn't say so on the product, but probably Chinese manufacture. In a cutting device, this is not the way to go. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spoof that drags.","review":"I like Aykroyd and Hanks as actors and Aykroyd has typed some witty scripts like Ghostbusters, but Dragnet falls flatter than a lead balooon. The chemistry between these two actors never really ignites in this spoof of the original TV series - a classic in itself. What keeps it alive and stops one from yanking the disc before its over is the plot - there is a genuine urge to know how the various pieces fall together. A crime story needs a resolution and this script provides a crime story - pretty wacky one at that! The car chases, shoot outs, and stuff are all respectably done so there was nothing stinted in extras in this film. What more can I say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, funny, funny","review":"Anyone who doesn't like this movie is suffering from the mind-altering effects of the pseudohallogenic compound Cyanigin (inside joke: get it?). With Tom Hanks, Dan Aykroyd, Christopher Plummer, (don't forget Dabney Coleman!), this movie offers a fun-filled romp through a Playboyesque mansion, a \\"Milk. Fresh, wholesome milk.\\" factory, and a part of Los Angeles where it's best not to stand on the street corner at 10pm on a school night whistling.Seriously, though, this is a fun movie. While Aykroyd isn't up to par given his previous role as Dr. Raymond Stanz (late of Columbia University, currently proprieter of Ray's Occult Book Shop) in Ghostbusters (\\"Does this pole still work?\\"), he's much better than in some of his others: The Couch Trip, Sneakers, etc.Christopher Plummer is genius, as always.For all you law students, this movie offers a good lesson on the First Amendment, with the whole pornography/book burning thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragnet 1987","review":"This is a parody? I call it a mockery of the original tv series. Jack Webb would be spinning in his grave if he saw how his series, his trademark mocked as a comedy! The movie is funny at times, and it only features Harry Morgan reprising his role as Gannon, but the movie is nothing but a mockery to the classic crime series that Jack Webb made."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD - \\"A Little Romance\\"","review":"The product was delivered quickly and packaged well. The DVD played without any problems at all. While the jewel case did not seem very strong, there was no physical damage. I would purchase more products like this, based on this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull with flashes of humor","review":"There's a lot of potential in this film, as in many of Aykroyd's efforts, for deft satire; and as in so many of his films, only the most obvious gags are deployed along the way. Some jokes work, but when they don't, or in the long stretches in between, there's simply nothing to draw and hold the interest. In Webb's style, Aykroyd achieves the remarkable feat of overacting restraint. Hanks is at least personable, but not much more. Plummer is wonderfully nasty, and the film has a large budget to display. There's a lot of bloat here, however, and you can't help thinking that the main result of this film was a series of truly wild parties for all concerned in its production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't nothing like the real thing baby...","review":"Good performance by Aykroyd still doesn't save a weak plot that tends to drift, the big screen version just doesn't measure up to the TV series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crackup of a movie","review":"It's been several years since I've seen this movie, but I remember that it was non-stop laughs when I saw it.

This box-office flop is perhaps one of the best spoof flicks I've seen, and is full of laughs. You have to be in the mood for a silly adventure comedy, and willing to return to Tom Hanks' first taste of film-acting. He is still one of the funniest men in Hollywood, and this movie uses his comedic talents fully. Dan Aykroyd plays the part of Joe Friday excellently, letting you believe that he could actually be as clean and anal as his character portrays.

From 4 to 6 feet, there was an annoying hiss. From 6 to 12 feet I could still hear the music but the noise was awful -- totally unacceptable. Any greater distance than that and the noise was so loud it completely drowned out the music.Maybe the headphones I received were defective, but they were absolutely useless to me.

No way to adjust the levels, all you can do is max out the TV volume, but not enough to hear.2) a prominent electronic hum that never stops.3) a charging base that is cheap and poorly designed, so that it is hard to keep the headphones on the electrical contacts to get them charged.Really, save yourself frustration, just try another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"JVC wireless headset","review":"I would not recommend this product for several reasons.

The father comes from a privileged background and lives with his stunningly beautiful wife in a house dating back to medieval times, Milton Magna. The father is killed in the war, and as the novel opens, his wife and two children despair over how they will be able to keep the enormous property and building without a breadwinner. The story continues, primarily about small decisions, life altering chances, and the nuances of family, friendship, and love.Quote: \\"This was going to prove to be one of those momentous decisions made without the slightest realization of its momentousness.\\"This book was really slow to get moving. The first half was fine, but not particularly interesting or engaging.

If you are going to read one good fictional book this year, make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Effortless","review":"This book sets up a quiet sweet world, a set of light fun characters, and then moves them gracefully across each other. It takes good care of the reader, and while the people suffer trials, there is never a doubt that things will turn out well for them. And that's good news, because you'll come to care about the flawed but likable people you meet here. The neat bow on the end was a bit too contrived, even for me a reader who likes a happy ending. Still, if you are looking for a book for a plane flight, or even just a free day where you can curl up on a favorite cushion with a cup of tea, you wont be disappointed with The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic and Beautifully Written Story","review":"Certainly one of the best books I've read in a long time.I honestly found this book just perusing through the bookstore aisles one day. I always read the first page or so before buying, so there must have been something about it i liked. I love how all of the sub-plots are interwoven throughout. I'd never heard of Johnnie Ray, but shortly after finishing the book, I noticed that his music actually came on one of my Pandora radio stations!I can only imagine the time it took to research all the elements of this story.

Even though I don't live in the world of horses, there was much about the well-defined protagonist - Allyson - that I could identify with.This is a story about a young woman's journey through some very difficult times, resulting in her growth and ultimately, triumph. I won't go into what Allyson goes through that challenges her - not what you might expect - and not to give too much away, but the story does not have a predictable outcome. There is also some romance in the book, as well.The author is kind enough to include a glossary of technical terms, for those who are not in the know about horses, etc. All in all, it was an excellent read, and I am looking forward to Ms. Vander Wende-William's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I'm grateful for this book, that's both scholarly and easily read by the non-scholar.

I was looking forward to seeing some of these methods used with horses in the movie. It's too bad that this movie was titled \\"Horse Whisperer\\".

Redford and Thomas had absolutely no chemistry. The romance part of the movie was never believable. In the book there was not a great age difference and it was handled much better. Annie was never a really likeable character. Her only redeeming characteristic was her love for her child and that only came out after the accident. Robert was a much better parent and more likable person. I could see him taking Grace and Pilgrim to Tom Booker instead of Annie, however, we couldn't have had a love story with the horse whisperer.

And anyone who pukes at the idea of a woman in her 30's falling for a man in his 60's, is probably about 14 years old herself. (And I'm in my 30's, just so you don't think I'm a man in his 60's being defensive). Redford is as good a director as he is an actor.

It is not at all miserable and I don't think you should be making judgments of other people you have never met. I'm sorry America, this movie stunk. It was the most poorly made and directed movie of all time. I'm sorry that the American people could have such lousy taste when it comes to movies (and presidents).

We kept waiting for the story to come back to THE HORSE (judging by the title of the movie, we thought that was the main storyline), but it got so sidetracked by stuff that was just too unbelievable to swallow.

The horse was hardly the issue in it. All we see Redford and Thomas staring weirdly at each other. She is such a shallow character I had no idea why Redford's was at all intersted in her. I only saw the movie once and never plan on seeing it again. It's pretty bad when the best part of the movie is the beginning when Pilgrim and Grace get hit by the semi."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBISH","review":"I am embarrassed to say that I actually watched this movie in its entirety. I usually like a romantic movie just not when it involves adultury.A married woman finds new love on a ranch with a horse trainer but decides in the end to get back with her husband. There you go. Don't waist your time on this seemingly endless movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betty Buckley scenes not included","review":"I dont know how many people are aware of this but Betty Buckley played the girlfriend of Robert Redford's character. This was during her run on Broadway of Sunset Boulevard. Because of the length of the film, all her scenes were cut. I would love to see the deleted scenes of those on a DVD. Then maybe I would buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm...","review":"Redford is wonderful, but I think the movie strayed from the book enough to change the way you feel about the characters at the end. I've got to stop reading the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"The Horse Whisperer is one of my favorite movies. I have my own horses and can really get into this movie. You know how the young girl feels. And her feelings towards Pilgram after the accident. It is a very sad story. I loved the book, but I loved the movie even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No even half as good as reading the book !","review":"Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie but I have to say if you've read the book, the movie doesn't do justice. For a 2 hour and 45 minute movie, I feel it could have been more like the book. They focused on too many other details rather than showing more of the two falling in love. The movie almost made Annie seem indecent, where in the book it goes into greater detail of her feelings and you want what she wants. I was dissappointed after viewing the entire movie. When it reached the end I felt I wasted those three hours. My suggestion... BUY THE BOOK !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arriving when?","review":"I discovered during the holidays that my family had never seen this movie. I ordered this product on Christmas Eve with a promise that it would be delivered by that Friday. In fact, they did not arrive to my family's house until three weeks later! Fortunately, this is the only incident I have had with Amazon, and it was FedEx, not Amazon at fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is my favourite!","review":"This movie was really sad, touching, and a must see. I almost cried when Grace's best friend died!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown hocum","review":"This long, overblown drama is a dreary experience with the only redeeming quality being the beautiful scenery and cinematography. When a young girl and her horse are hit by a truck, her mother enlists a \\"horse whisperer\\" who can bring her daughter's horse back to health and he ends up healing the whole dysfunctional family. Why it takes almost 3 hours to tell this story is beyond me but by the end, about the only character I had any feeling for was the horse. Robert Redford is his usual cardboard self and Kirsten Scott Thomas is a distant unattached actress who brings little here. The excellent Diane Wiest is totally wasted and seems out of place in the whole mess. Be warned, this is a \\"Lifetime\\" movie in disguise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This gets better with time","review":"When I first saw this film, I didn't care for it, but my wife wanted to see it, so I bought it and I'm glad I added it to my library. I really don't know what was wrong with my thinking the first time through, but this time, I found the film to be engaging. Redford's performance was top-notch and he got the most from all the performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Redford does well","review":"I've always been a big Redford fan. But let's face it, he can be a little stiff. In this movie, he moves the movie along with the smallest effort. A look here, a small sentence there. And all the while, he's seeing right through the mother.This is a great movie if you have interest in children or animals and righting a wrong. Redford takes a mentally and physically damaged horse and is asked to magically cure it. But it's really the humans that need the help and Redford eventually works his magic on the daughter.I read the book first and it is very touching. The written description of the accident is chilling and Redford does a great job of recreating that scene in this movie. Watch this movie as it will eventually be known as a Redford classic of his real loves of the West and nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"\\"The Horse Whisperer\\" is for garage sale addicts who get rained out some weekend. Much of the character development, sub-themes, plot sequence and even dialogue is thinly disguised rehash of Redford's earlier movie \\"The Electric Horseman\\". \\"TEH\\" was good, or at least Fun, because it was fresh. But repackaging a lot of it to make \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" turned it into refried beans. \\"Whisperer\\" is even worse because quite a bit of the main plot simply defies all credibility. The supposed epiphaney of the unconvincing \\"family' is so hokey and disingenious it should have somehow been filmed in crayon, not Technicolor. It did as well as it did at the box office for only four reasons. It had a large promotional budget, it had Redford's name attached, it had the word \\"horse\\" in the title, and there are plenty of garage sale addicts here. Get \\"City Slickers\\" instead. The theme is about the same, the characters are more interesting and it has some funny parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What IS this","review":"i'm extremely happy we rented this instead of bought it ..This has to possibly be the worse movie out of every horse movie i've seen so far. The characters, i think, are pretty dim. Nice try on being a redneck, there. The only part that i actually got into was the beginning to where she gets injured .. then i thought it started going pretty downhill. they don't pay any attention to Pilgrim's markings there .. he'll have a huge star, a little star, not really even a star and no star. You could think they would've put more effort into the movie, but i guess not. The horse shows some emotions and some of the things are alright, but other parts .. are just .. unrealistic. I wouldn't rent the movie ever again, i grit my teeth at it, its my opinion that you move to a better movie before deciding to spend your money on this ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie!","review":"I just read The Divide by the author of the Horse Whisperer, and I wanted to share my opinion of the Horse Whisperer.I did not read the book; I saw the movie, a couple of years ago. I just remember it being very hoakie, one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public, but I did not share this enthusiasm. Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A down to earth, feast for the soul thru sight & sound.","review":"This beautiful film takes one away from the gloss of the city & back to simpler times. It touches everyone who is an animal lover & anyone who wants a bit of magic in their life. There are people like this who are capable of healing. Anyone who has ever been to Montana knows the beauty of the place & the people depicted . I was also thrilled to see the dance hall in the film. It still stands today where we used to go on vacation & played out of the rain. Our cousins were very much as the working family in this film. The place was called Springhill .I love it !! I think you will love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Heart Warming Story","review":"Very powerful heartwarming story. I give this movie a four star rating only because there were a couple of technical flaws in the movie dealing with modern ranches, but not so much so that one should get bogged down with those. Tom Booker, \\"The Horse Whisperer,\\" demonstrates his knowledge of human and animal nature when he heals the damaged spirits of two humans as well as that of, Pilgrim, the horse. Well worth nearly three hours of your time to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirate Kid toy doll","review":"Great for play. Also used as a cake decoration for an I Spy Treasure Hunt Party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the style of writing!","review":"Boy, I read this book last year and had a terrible time putting it down. Helen Fielding's writing style draws you, keeps you interested, and captivates your mind while also tickling your funny bone. British humor is one of my favorites...no wonder I love the Bridget Jones's Diary series so much!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"i enjoyed reading bridget jones, and thought i would like olivia joules. but the plot is predictable and the character a little over the top. helen spends much of this book reinforcing stereotypes, which i find annoying and close minded. just read bridget jones and don't bother with olivia joules."},{"rating":"2","title":"HYSTERICAL!","review":"I LOVED this book! I know that other reviews said the book was far-fetched, but what spy novel (or movie for that matter) isn't?There were parts where I laughed out loud because I could imagine having the same conversation with someone. Some of us have that one crazy person in our life who is always reading too much into everything and has an over-active imagination. If this describes you, then you will enjoy this book.I read it in a day because I was dying to see what was going to happen next. Parts of the book were, \\"Yeah right,\\" moments, but that happens in all spy novels/movies.I thought the character of Olivia Joules was intriguing, with the imagination of a great writer. The world that she imagines versus the world around her is, well... you'll have to read the book.But please be warned - when I finished reading this book I wanted to watch a cool-chick spy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"too absurd","review":"I thought this book would be funny, like Bridget Jones, but it wasn't. Since it's a spy novel, I hoped for some suspense, but this too was in short supply. Then there appeared to be some sort of romantic interest for the main character - too bad there wasn't any chemistry. What a yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really loved this book from beginning to end. The plot was crazy and fast paced. Olivia is a very entertaining character!! I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fetched, not enough details, and too many stereotypes","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before picking up this novel. It started off a bit strange. I found it hard to imagine the activity going on. In the end it relied too much on stereotypes, did not develop the characters or story enough, and was an overall disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. Not a single character was at all interesting. I found myself caring less and less about the situation as the book trudged on. Are we supposed to believe that every man that meets Olivia is instantly in love with her? Yuck. I'd give this book zero stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the Brits do a story in the US","review":"Why is it that ordinarily brilliant and insightful British writers, when they do a story that takes place in the US, produce a superficial name-dropper with a plot like somebody's fantasy about the person they wish they were? This happened in Salman Rushdie's \\"Fury\\", where every character is out of a show case and the hero unbelievably successful - and now agaín the US is the setting for cliché fantasy with Fielding's \\"Olivia Joules.\\" As writers they are excellent and readable, but this time around to enjoy them you must suffer stories that are unbearable self-satisfiers. Are they writing for comic strips? It would be the best medium for the scenarios and symbolic not-even-skin-deep characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but a lot of fun!","review":"I've read all Fielding's books and I love her style of writing, so I picked this one up months ago and finally got around to starting it. It was slow going at first, but there is plenty to keep interested. By the 100th page, I couldn't put it down and missed a lot of sleep as a result! In typical Fielding style, Olivia is flawed but lovable, insightful and hilarious! I don't want to give too much away, but her mysterious boyfriend is probably one of the funniest male characters I've read in a while (although he's supposed to be a scary terrorist!) The whole effect was wonderful. Like I said, it's not perfect but a fun read... so I really don't understand the bad reviews. Buy it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference","review":"I got this book because I would be out in my garden and I'd find a bug and wonder what it was and what its ife was all about.

And what performances he delivers! It is very easy, when listening to the Rachmaninov to compare it to Horowitz or Browning, and when listening to the Chopin, to Rachmaninov and Kapell, and to the Blue Danube (which he plays complete), though lacking some of what is in Lhevinne's, you'll hear a collosal performance you probably won't hear matched for many years to come.

But Daytrippers seemed to just do a basic setup for a road trip, then the roadtrip, then the confrontation/surprise at the end.Along the way we get to listen to some normal or eccentric family members arguing and talking (much like real life). But not much in the way of storyline or humor. A few smiles, no laughs, little plot. Some of the characters may remind you of people you know or relatives which could make it funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"My only complaint? I wanted more","review":"\\"The Daytrippers\\" concerns a young woman (Hope Davis) who suspects her husband is cheating on her. She decides to drive into Manhattan and confront him, and her mother, father, sister, and sister's boyfriend come along for moral support (hence the \\"day trip\\" of the title). This movie is funny and terrifically acted, and the characters are all great, so likeable, complicated, and real. The movie ends ambiguously, which I admired (no \\"Hollywood endings\\" here), but I really wanted to know how life was going to turn out for all of them. I guess a sequel is highly unlikely, but I for one would be first in line if it ever happened! I highly recommend this film for rental or outright purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Made a Movie About My Family?","review":"The set up isn't quite right for my family.

But then, I felt they were based on my own slightly dysfunctional family."},{"rating":"1","title":"New transfer badly needed","review":"The film is outstanding -- Mottola's best, in my opinion.However, this review is of the DVD itself. The transfer is soft with a lot of compression artifacts that distort the image. The most glaring flaw, though, is that (like its region 2 counterpart) the film is presented in a 1.33:1 ratio rather than the original widescreen. I've held off on owning this for quite a few years, waiting for it to be presented in its original aspect ratio. Not at least getting the option of seeing the film's original framing as it was composed for theaters is a rare situation in the DVD (and now Blu-Ray) era, and I don't want to encourage this blunder with a purchase.Superbad and Adventureland were both pretty popular, so why no new release of their outstanding predecessor, with a nice anamorphic transfer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Anyone Know Why This Film Is Out Of Print?","review":"Does anyone know why \\"The Daytrippers\\" is out of print, and whether it will again become available on DVD?Intelligent film fans who haven't yet seen this movie are being cheated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for a cold day","review":"This is a tasty, thick soup.

The production is a little bizarre: it sounds like an ensemble recorded some really deep, rich performances in a small room with lots of reverb added later, then Munir Bashir came in and laid an oud solo on top - and the engineer grabbed the faders on the board and yanked down the ensemble to make room for his subtle, textural playing, then cranked 'em back up when the solo was done. Very odd. Could have been much better with an improved approach to the recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frisbee","review":"The frisbee I ordered was not the one I received.

I've taken a long ride along the lakeshore, it's quite comfortable, also very pretty!! Especially good for ladies seeking for both comfort and style.I didn't rate it a 5 star only because it didn't come with the tools (like an allen wrench that always comes with furnitures), so you'll definitely need the following tools to assumble it:- a set of allen wrench- open ended wrenchAnd the instruction book was not very helpful.

I am a voracious reader and I've never felt compelled to write a review until I read this book. If you've read his original book then you don't have to bother with this one. This entire book is filled with stories about other people. There is no real substance here and definitely not anything new. Any decent information that can be gleaned from this book would amount to maybe 4 pages. The rest of this book is nothing but fluff and filler. This book is only good for those people who have zero emotional insight and have to be grabbed by the hand and slowly walked through each explanation and connection. Reading this book felt like I was stuck in a NYC traffic jam. I had to scour through endless stories in hopes of finding that one little opening where I could cut in and read something worthwhile; and even then it was nothing revelatory.

It was obvious that the book was written before the invention of lincoln rhyme, but there is something more magical in this book that becomes more logical in deaver's later novels. i especially enjoyed the character development of rune. living in nyc, i could definitely relate to her character and fantasy world. sometimes reality is not what you want and it was interesting to see how far someone might take their imaginary persona. also, in the true spirit of jeffrey deaver, this book is filled with twists and turns leaving you usure of the ending til you get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Manhattan is My Beat is the first book in Jeffrey Deaver's Rune series. The main character, Rune, is twenty and petite. She lives in a loft with a glass gazebo and her current employment is in a video store; she loves movies. Rune's elderly friend is murdered and she becomes convinced he has found the million-dollar proceeds of a bank robbery in the 1930s. Determined to pursue this, she tangles with the NYPD, copywriters, actresses, hit men for the Mafia, illegal immigrants, screenwriters with Alzheimer's and the US Marshals. Plenty of plot twists and quite a few laughs along the way. Rune seems to be a cross between Kinsey Milhone and Stephanie Plum. Refreshing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't remember why I bought this.","review":"Someone or something I read recommended this book to me over 10 years ago. I just now got around to reading it. I can't imagine why I thought it would be good. I reread the review here to see if it would jog my memory, but no luck. I can't recommend this book. The plot is very twisty, that's true. Other than that, the characters seem as multi-dimensional as comic book heroes and villains and the dialog is ridiculous. Yes, the book is set in downtown NYC in the late 80's, but I was a frequent visitor at that time and had friends there. No one acted or talked like the people in this book. It's more like the view of someone who was a middle-aged suburbanite at the time and read an article in the Times about the East Village scene - and did no further research. Nearly every line of dialog clanged against my ears completely out of tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaver's first is a fine read!","review":"This being the first book Jeffery Deaver ever had published, I went into it thinking I was going to get a simple novel. Boy was I wrong! This book is the first of 3 starring Rune, a 5' 2\\" female dynamo who is thrust into a situation and becomes an amateur detective, of sorts. Along the way we meet some colorful characters with witty dialogue. The plot involves a couple of Mafiaoso hits, one that goes wrong and a million dollars that may or may not be real as a treasure. Deaver throws in some twists at the end that are great. It's not like his last 7 books or so...more straight forward and slim. But still really good stuff and with the other 2 in the Rune series getting released soon, I look forward to any/all of Deaver's wonderful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"First effot by a stand out author","review":"Deavers wrote this book under the name of William Jefferies. He also wrote another series under this name featuring a film scout. This character is a young punkish girl named Rune who is trying to get through her 20's and survive NYC. She is currently working at a video store and when a regular dies under suspiciouscircumstances she becomes interested in the movie he rented numerous times. She becomes obsessed with plot of the movie as it is based loosely on a true crime. She thinks she can solve the case find the money and live happily ever after. This plot is hard to follow at times and sometimes I don't think the author is aware of what he wants the characters to do. I have read his later books and know he can write a good thriller. Too bad this book falls flat, I believe his publisher re-released to capitalize on his famous status. I will read more of the scout series and might try the next one in this series just because Rune is such a likable character."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL hardly does this album justice.","review":"I am one of the world's biggest Clapton fans. This album is NOT for Clapton fans. This album takes some of the best songs in the world and slaughters them.Ever heard \\"Layla\\" on a banjo? Trust me. You don't want to.

I have never been more horrified or offended by anything in my entire life.What's next? \\"Purple Haze\\" on the accordian? Avoid this album like the Plague.

Reading one is embarrassingly simplistic. Consider Botkin's book a whirlwind tour. Although I believe every American should be exposed to these narratives (above and beyond the historical representations from textbooks), the stories in Lay My Burden Down are so powerful, so full of intensity, I gave the book 4 stars because it is almost brutal in its power.

I've owned about three different models this one included. They all break or fall apart in very short order. The materials they use are garbage. You would expect this quality from the 99 Cent only store, but believe me you are more likely to find better quality there than this. That's how bad it is. The cost to replace parts like the ear wrap, which constantly breaks, cost over $15 for part, shipping and tax. The part that goes in your ear feels like the hard plastic cone the doctor sticks in your year when examining you. The technology might be good, but still why bother if it's going to break or fall apart in the first week or two?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, does not deliver","review":"This was the second boom purchase I made--hoping for the ultimate headset.

I have had this player for less than 6 months and already the CD player has stopped working. Sometimes it doesn't spin. Sometimes it just displays \\"error\\" when you turn the CD portion on. The company only has a 90 day warranty, so given that this has broken after that timeframe, it will cost me $25 + shipping to have them look at it. Almost the cost of a new one to send back their defective product. I have read numerous reviews indicating the same problem and can't believe nothing has been done to correct this issue. I already had a working unit similar to this but bought the Hello Kitty version because my daughter loves Hello Kitty. Apparently I should just attach stickers to my other one. I have other boom boxes that have lasted 10+ years. Less than 6 months shouldn't be acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will be disappointed","review":"We bought this for our six year old for Christmas.

It should come with time.Easy on the eyes (if you like pink) and easy to use this boom capsule fits nicely on top of our kids dresser and has adequate volume range and fidelity for bedtime music.Cassette buttons take more force than can be generated by a two year old and until they can read, we have to run it.

Whenever IT feels like it, I get a \\"Carrage Jam\\" and there is nothing to correct it, except to keep trying to print until it wants to work for you.

To all of the people who say that nothing happens on Mad Men, my answer is that so many things are happening that you need to watch carefully to see it all. If you are a person who appreciates superbly nuanced writing, great cinematography and acting, your attention will be rewarded. This is a thinking person's show, educating its audience not only about the sixties, but also about today.

I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds. No episode guide, just the season 3 slipcover. It looks like someone put this together out of their home.

I was excited to get this product since I have two full shelves of spices in my cabinets and my old rotating spice rack took up too much space and didnt match our decor. The lids fit well. the labels look nice. and they have extras you can write on in case they dont provide the label (for instance, I was surprised they did not have a label for Garlic Powder :) Anyway, overall, I think I will be satisfied with this spice rack.Con: The only con would be that the bottels are a little smaller than I would prefer. The quantity of spice that is in a standard bottle/jar purchased at the store will not fit into these jars so you end up having to store the original bottle you purchased anyway.In the end, it is very pleasing design and seems to be functional for it's intended purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good storage solution, with one reservation","review":"Well built, easily wall-mounted, convenient and thoughtfully designed. One caveat: you cannot get anything larger than a standard half teaspoon measuring spoon into the bottle (the teaspoon ALMOST fits, but not quite). Otherwise it is an ideal solution for me; I can keep all of my spices (I bought two sets of this rack) mounted on the wall right where I prepare meals. I think this is a better solution than the \\"on-the-countertop-carousel\\" type spice racks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"My search has ended! I really like this spice rack! I purchased 4 and have put all my spices in them.I love the fact that I choose what spices are in them and not getting the pre-filled with ones I wouldn't use. It is a well built unit, goes well with my other stainless steel. I did have to make some of my own labels that were off the beaten spice path. The bottles will hold a fair amount of spice. I did find that the holes in the shakers were larger in some cases than I wanted, but some of my shakers that came on my spice jars fit these so I switched. The spice racks came in perfect condition. Everyone that comes in my kitchen oohs and ahhs at them! I think I need to purchase more for my daughters so that mine don't walk off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.

It's well built, well priced, etc. My only complaint is that the containers a bit smaller than most standard size spices in the plastic containers you buy in stores, so I have to keep the original containers around for a few weeks and use up the remaining spices. If they were a little bigger, 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and attractive","review":"I bought this spice rack for my mom as a gift for her modern kitchen. The spice rack fits in perfectly with all of the other stainless steel in our kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of this rack; it looks larger than you might think, but the picture is otherwise accurate. The glass jars feel solid, as do the plastic tops. We have not mounted this, but leave it on the top of the counter; it is solid enough to stand alone without fear of toppling. Our only concern was with the stickers provided; many of hte spices that we keep were not among the options of the provided pre-printed stickers, and we didn't want to ruin consistency of the stickers by using some pre-printed and some with our (bad) handwriting. But, that's a minor problem.

Otherwise, it is wonderful, very clean and practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"This spice rack was just what we needed, it fits snug to the wall and was easy to install. The jars are slightly smaller than more grocery store spice containers so you have a little left over. Also the lids could fit better and the rack itself could be more solid, but like I said it's great for the price. Only real flaw is the stickers are peeling off some of the lids and I have to keep rubbing them back on but it's not working and there weren't enough pre-made ones so I had to write in a few, I'll be peeling them all off and writing with silver sharpie on all the lids for a uniform look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pycnogenol For Nocturnal Leg Cramps","review":"As a long standing type 1 diabetic, I would experience excruciating leg cramps three to four times a night (diabetic microangiopathy).

The recipes are equally impractical, since few people use suet in desserts these days.And all the stories in the voice of the mythical Mrs. Sharp just seemed stupid and contrived.

When Martin arrives he visits his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) who he stood up on the prom night, for this he has some explaining to do. On top of this he has a rival trying to do his job and another one trying to kill him. The script ( co-written by Cusack) is darkly witty and the performances by Minnie and Cusack are very well delivered (I reckon they were the best part of the movie).Really I would give it 4 1/2 stars because it was very enjoyable.It was a bit silly in one or two areas, which is a shme because I really enjoyd this film. I suggest you watch it when you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite movies...","review":"I'm not one of those people who quotes lines from my favorite movies, though if I were there are a couple in GPB that my friends would be tired of hearing. This movie had subtlety and nuance, pain and pleasure (yup, that would be me paraphrasing) though the hair and giant cell phones make it seem rather dated. That being said, the overall theme of going back to high school and having everyone peg you to be the exact same person that you were all those years ago, resonated for me.My favorite line? Minnie Driver's character seeing her 'long lost love' and trying to identify the emotions felt: \\"What is this that I'm feeling? Is it pain? Pleasure? Am I hungry?\\" decades later that indescribable gut wrenching feeling took her right back.God I love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer movie","review":"GPB is a wonderful escapist flick. John Cusack is a professional killer who goes back to Grosse Pointe to 1) attend his 10-year high school reunion, 2) re-unite with the girl (Minnie Driver) he stood up at the prom 10 years ago, and 3) kill somebody.It's a pretty ambitious program, made even more difficult by the fact that there's a second hitman (Dan Ackroyd) in town who's trying to horn in on Cusack's contract.The story's excellent, the acting is great. It's a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie, but don't trust the list of subtitles","review":"I bought this DVD because it is stated in the details section that the DVD has danish subtitles. The DVD that was sent to me had only dutch, portuguese and english subtitles. I can't blame the movie for that, so I have to give this intensely funny movie five stars anyway. But make sure you get a DVD with the proper subtitles if that is important to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly sharp-edged for a mainstream satire","review":"The dark satiric elements of this film are terrific - equating themoral emptiness of a hit man's career with the moral emptiness ofmodern America is spot on. And the guts to make a comedy full of wittybanter and harsh killing is worth admiring. There are also few momentswhere Cusack's killer's humanity comes through, and the movie becomesreally affecting.But there are also moments, and performances that feel arch and pushed,jokes that get told one too many times, motivations that are vague, andconvenient coincidences. The romance at the center with Minnie Driver,while having charming bits, never feels very grounded, and the endingfeels like a bit of an easy cop-out.The film is quite good, bravely odd and dark for a Hollywood film. andfun, but it sets you up expecting much more of a 'Dr. Strangelovian'impact than it ultimately has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture quality is Rubbish","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the majority of the reviews posted here...

Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend why he stood her up on prom night. He regrets doing that believe me. I don't wanna ruin the movie for you, so I'll keep this short and tell you to see this movie right now! It is great, it's ike Die Hard meets High Fidelity. 5 Stars is to low of a rating for this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorites","review":"Grosse Pointe Blank lived up to my expectations. It's very funny and witty, and it avoids running into cliches and slow points. John Cusak is great as a hit-man, Martin, going through sort of a \\"mid-life crisis\\" although he hasn't even hit his thirties yet. He ends up going back home to do his final job when he meets up with the girl (Minnie Driver) he stood up on prom night and ends up going to his ten-year high school reunion. During his visit, Martin is threatened by rivals and must watch his back to make it out of Grosse Pointe alive. Plot twists and turns come about and it's hard to predict what happens next. Dan Aykyrod delivers a nice performance as Martin's rival. If you enjoy sharp wit and somewhat dark humor, see this movie. Oh yeah, the soundtrack (The Clash, Violent Femmes, The English Beat, The Cure, David Bowie & Queen, etc.) is nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sunday movie movie!","review":"In my opinion this is an awesome movie!

Martin Blank is a professional hit man, who goes to his ten year high school reunion. There he discovers that old flames can be rekindled, old friendships can be found again, and that time changes everyone. The fact that he is being shadowed by several other hit men intent on killing him, just adds to the fun of the event. Seeing this you might discover that your high school reunion could never be as interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cusack in his most enjoyable role!","review":"This is one of the most fun roles John Cusack has ever had. He is fabulous as the charismatic hitman Martin Blank on a hit assignment in his hometown, just in time for his high school reunion.

Those who complain about the violence are missing the whole point, it's a dark comedy! Gun battles with hundreds of rounds coming from guns that hold 13 rounds is part of the intended humor. Perhaps these reviewers are somewhat wimpy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grosse Point Blank","review":"A good original for Cusack, he only got better. This is almost as good as The Godfather series but with a little more comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Soundtrack","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and (as far as I'm concerned) quintessential Cusack--mostly subtle between bursts of noise, melancholy yet ultimately upbeat. I love Cusack as a hit man--not because he seems like an obvious person to play a hitman, but because he seems like the last person in the world to play a hitman, and that's perfect for his apologetic-yet-defensive hitman character in the movie. I should also say that the soundtrack works PERFECTLY, and is worthwhile in its own right. I've never been a fan of Minnie Driver, but he's not horrible as the love interest in this movie, and Dan Akroyd (who I'm not normally a huge fan of, either) works as a hitman trying to get Cusack's character to join his hitman union (or else). A movie full of quirky, underplayed fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great actors, great soundtrack","review":"Grosse Pointe Blank is a really good, darkly funny movie, with a great soundtrack. You'll never again listen to \\"99 luftballons\\" the same as before! Kudos to Cusack who co-wrote the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just might stop to check you out","review":"Bizarre mixture of hired assassin action film and romantic comedy is well done and pretty entertaining. John Cusack is likeable, as always, as the hired assassin who heads home to Grosse Pointe after a long absence under the ruse of attending a class reunion, though he has been hired to make a hit. Minnie Driver plays the girl he admired in high school and who has no idea what he has been doing ever since. Toss in an 80's soundtrack and you've got yourself a film that should appeal to pretty much every thirtysomething. While the assassination subplots bring a fresh ingredient to the genre and is an integral part of the story, the emphasis is on the romance and comedy. As such, the assassin subplot serves as a distraction by the film's close; however, the script is so engaging one might not notice. The violence isn't very graphic, though adult language keeps this from being suitable for kids. The DVD is okay, though nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I have enjoyed this movie everytime that I watch it. Great subtle humor. John & Joan Cusack play off of one another as they do in other films (Say Anything) and that is really part of the fun. If you like off the wall/intelligent humor, this is a must see.Napa Scott"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual take on the dark comedy genre","review":"This is a great movie, Cusack plays a role darker than some of his other comedic outings. However, this movie is balanced by a lot of lighter comedy. Funny, funny, funny. Supporting cast does a great job as well. Interesting plot, though perhaps a tad predictable. Well worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on Target","review":"Buy this DVD if you are looking for an hilarious, unique dark comedy. A hitman, played by John Cusack returns to his hometown to attend his high school reunion and to do a job. He is followed by his arch-rival in professional murder played to perfection by Dan Ackroyd. Exciting, quirky and romantic, you will love this film. Minnie Driver is a perfect romantic match for Cusack. And, by the way, the quality of the DVD image is excellent. My TV has stereo surround sound and the musical soundtrack blew me away. P.S. If you love 80's music, get the 2 CD's that represent the soundtrack. The soundtrack was done by Joe Strummer of the Clash and it is brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I'm simply amazed at the reviews this film has received so far; nearly 5 stars??? You gotta be kidding!The movie, a black comedy, brings to the screen the story of a hit man who never got over his high school sweetheart and who returns home after many years to carry out... a hit. It is there that he bumps into his \\"ex\\" and the rest can be seen on screen.The acting is surprisingly (!) average, the dialogues below average, while the plot is just bearable.In short:John Cusack's character was really not the great.Minnie Driver was unexpectedly plain and bland.Dan Aykroyd was given terrible lines and a weak character to play.Joan Cusack's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.Though the potential for a decent movie was there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Am I the ONLY one who found this movie to be \\"Grosse\\"-ly overrated? And I am a huge, huge, HUGE Cusack fan.

Definitely not Cusack's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Dumb and Blank","review":"This is a typical Cusak movie. Everything in this movie is to draw attention to him and make him look good. The hip eighties music, the droll but hip sounding conversation, the idea that Mr. Cusak has the skill to kill someone with a... pen, the romance of a sensitive killer going back to reclaim his high school sweethart, and finding meaning in the innocence of a baby's face. Don't fall for this hopeless, romantic \\"bad-ass.\\" The premise for the movie simply doesn't work- the \\"cold-blooded killer has feelings too\\" theme. Only someone as pretentious and unfunny as Cusak could think like this. Somewhere along the line, the art of good movie making gets lost. That's what happens here and in all Cusak centered movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobble head buck broken","review":"Delivery was prompt.

She said because of similar problems to what I encountered, they weren't sure if they were going to order any more. She did offer a refund if I shipped it back.

There are many concepts discovered here, and it makes the reader ponder. Issues such as war, friendship, love, dreams, insanity and sanity.I especially got involved in Birdy's dream. I am a bit of a dreamer too. He goes onto explore the fact that maybe we living now, is a dream. And the dream that both you and I will have tonight, is actually our real life.

I'm convinced that \\"Birdy\\" will rank one day as a truly original American classic, right up there with Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" There's so much energy and passion in the story: it literally overwhelms. You live inside the character of Birdy as you listen, all ears, to a guy named Al speaking about his friend.

Some poems are no doubt elegant displays of her erudition and, for the most part, she has a good ear and a strong sense of the line. However, the content is shallow and ornamental, and it's impossible not to notice the egotism beneath the conceits. Not only does Ms. Kim position her conception and birth as the point of all creation, she casts herself as the voice of Korea (its history, its people, its American dislocation). She is the voice of all suffering and her forced tone of wisdom is rife with cheap cliches. What she ultimately achieves in this book is a fulfillment of almost every Asian stereotype. As hard it as she tries to stir the reader with descriptions so overwrought and violent that they might appear truthful or authentic, the most stirring--and shocking--aspect of this collection is how ruthlessly the poet exploits the Asian diaspora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"It's a mystery to me as to why this book is so lauded.

That it is maudlin in parts (a fact that can't be dismissed so easily as rhyming maudlin with shmaudlin), seems obvious to me. Kim sometimes tries too hard to eke out the last ounce of pity from a reader for her relatives (who have suffered things, we can assume as we read her privileged resume, that she has only heard about at the dinner table) but the poems are also heartfelt, careful and obviously more interested in communicating than dazzling with a bunch of worthless postmodern hocus-pocus.

Both the pieces and the performances are very good. From the animated Sabre Dance and Ruslan and Ludmilla Overture to pieces from Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina as orchestrated by Shostakovich this offers a good range of Russian moods both fast and slow. It has famous tuneful Tchaikovsky pieces like Marche Slav and the 1812 Overture. So I highly recommend it for the content. Less so for the performances and recording itself. The interpretations are straight down the middle, but that is what I expect. I don't like things exaggerated or fancy.

I'd stick with Altered Carbon and leave it with that if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks motivation","review":"I enjoyed Altered Carbon, but have been disappointed in the sequels, including this one.

This is the first audio-book I want my money back, and I have listen to a lot of bad productions, but always found some redeeming quality. The singlar good quality to this one is Richard K. Morgan's writing, but even that was not suffient to overcome the awful naration.

I really enjoyed the other two Kovacs books, but this one is just far too tedious for me. Does the story line EVER evolve? Very intricate detail spent on things which don't advance the story I feel....I've got it in audio format, and enjoyed the reader in the other two stores much better, so maybe that has something to do with it. I am some 3 hours into the story, and nothing much has happened. I read to be entertained and captured, and this one doesnt do it, so perhaps if you are listening to this in audio format, the abridged version may be the better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woken Furies","review":"Much less edgey than his previous works. Typical third or fourth sequels. Still action filled and Sam Spade like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altered Carbon fans stay away","review":"Altered Carbon is one of my favorite books from the last 10 years. The world created by Morgan was fascinating, full of potential. However, the second book Broken Angels, was a major let down, and now the third book Woken Furies is worse still. If you liked the first novel, and are looking for more of the same, DO NOT READ WOKEN FURIES. You will be horribly disappointed. The plot is a rambling mess. Kovacs is a mopey character that you can not feel any connection to. Basically, there is nothing engaging about this novel. My interest in these Tokeshi Kovacs novels had been fueled by my admiration for the first novel, but now that is over. No more Kovac novels for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story with entertaining illustrations","review":"One look at the cover of this book and I couldn't help but pick it up. \\"The Lizard Who Followed Me Home\\" is about a family who unknowingly picks up a stray lizard on their move to California. It is told from the point-of-view of the young girl who rescues the lizard from the dryer (after it escaped from the washer of course) and then can't seem to shake it lose. The illustrations are funny and eye-catching with lots of detail to absorb after the text is read. Keep an eye out for that sneaky reptile... he's good at hiding.The author also explores the emotions involved in moving away from a familier home and saying goodbye to family. She mixes these details in with the humor of the storyline fairly well, although I tend to feel that kids don't appreciate being tricked into reading a self-help book. This book is targeted for ages 9-12, but it seemed more appropriate for my four-year-old son (who thoroughly enjoyed it by the way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robe","review":"I bought this as a present for my stepmother.

A lot of questions and exercise problems are sophiscated and challenging. Secondly, the explanations of the text are not confusing at all to me. The figures are well explained, too. ( I don't know why so many reviewers here say \\"confusing\\" about the book.)It is overall a nice book. This book has a few calculation errors and typos but they shouldn't be a big problem for you to understand the concepts of chemistry.Of course, I have seen better general chemistry books but this book does not confuse you much as long as you know how to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only used because of kickbacks to Chemistry departments!","review":"This is the POOREST excuse for a general chemistry book I've ever seen!

Don't they proofread? If I'm going to pay any sort of money for my education, and if this ridiculous book is also going to overcharge me for it, then at least be less ignorant and more professional.

However i find this book to be very difficult in understanding. I find myself refering back to my old notes and books. There are surely more chemistry books out there that could explain chemistry itself in a more efficient manner. This book does not contain any clear cut directions on how to solve many problems, in addition to containing many problems in the exercises section which was also not explained the lecture part of the book. The practice problems also does not help in solving many of the problems because it is simple and straightforward as opposed to the exercises which is very misleading and unclear. I, as a science major, do not recommend this book unless of course you are required to purchase it by a professor who does not care for you to pass the class."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor excuse for a chemistry book!!!","review":"This book is required for my chemistry 1 course. I have taken 2 tests, and so far I have a \\"D\\" average in this class. The class is online, so I'm relying on this book to learn chemistry. As you can tell from my average, I have learned nothing from this book. I can't understand why colleges always require these VERY over-priced books that sucks. This book is the worst chemistry book that I have ever read - and I have read at least 7 chemistry books. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage. If it wasn't so expensive, I would use it as a door-stop. By the way, the solutions manual that you can buy as a companion to this book sucks too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is terrible.

I thought it was beautifully filmed, honest, well edited and convincingly well enough acted. 'Con Air', however, was another kettle of fish, to use the saying. The plot was just far far too implausible, even for a member of the dreaded action genre. The message was, well, I'm not really sure if there was one to be honest. Apart from good people stay good and bad people stay bad. Deep huh. The cinemanographic techniques (slow motion, etc) worked well in 'The Rock' but here, as in 'Face/Off' (which is also equally bad), they just don't cut it. They seem tacked on just to give the movie a more 'arthouse' feel (which would no doubt lost on the average action fan anyway). Scripting was ridiculous, dialogue was appalling and dialogue was even worse. Avoid this movie. Try 'A Simple Plan', 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse Now' if you really want to delve into good and bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok... It STINKS","review":"Con Air is missing something most movies need... ohh whats it called?? OH YEAH! A plot. The action sequences arent that great anyways.

In the real world, they'd all kill each other once the cops were out of the picture. It's a stereotype to say that all bad people stick together.

But the strong silent type man character portrayed here with an adoring wife and child seems to bring out their empathy. My wife and I both love this movie. I originally rented it but after one viewing it was obvious it was a had to own. We have watched it numerous times since. Nicholas Cage is outstanding, but the rest of the cast lends such a wide array of talent that it gives that over the top action and fun that makes it stand above many others of this genre. I love John Cusack and his performance here is great. He is the Yang to Cage's Ying. With Cage being the tough hard hitter, Cusack adds enough comic relief to make the movie very palatable. Add in some unforgettable performances by John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Colm Meaney and you have a powerhouse. I highly recommend this one.

Maybe this movie appeals to younger viewers who are more interested in seeing things \\"blown up real gud\\", but a relentless string of explosions and crashes do not, in and of themselves, make a film exciting. I just wanted it to be over. If you're looking for a film of this genre, The Rock isn't a real brain twister either, but it's quite a bit more satisfying than Con Air. Better yet, try The Professional which has gunplay, explosions AND a good story and good characters. Imagine that."},{"rating":"1","title":"STANDARD ACTION FARE","review":"Nicolas Cage is the good guy against a plane load of bad guys who are being taken to more maximum security facilities. Cage (as Cameron Poe) , if I recall correctly, was wrongly imprisoned and is going to be released. He has the misfortune of hitching a ride on this plane of very dangerous criminals who are hatching a plan to hijack the plane. John Malkovich is expertly diabolical here, and Steve Buscemi is always a welcome player. And Cage flexes his action hero muscles (who would ever have guessed he had them before The Rock?) Overall this is an entertaining and action-filled film full of memorable action-hero one-liners, a few surprises here and there, major explosions and a happy ending. You could not want more if this is your kind of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Con Air","review":"I love the movie and the cast. I had to have it for my collection. It arrived quickly and in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, ironic popcorn flick","review":"Definitely worth renting! Okay, so the beginning as well as the family scenes with Nicolas Cage and his cutesy blonde wife and his cutesy blonde daughter are so horribly pathetic they get you sick. But once the movie's unique dry humor breaks through, it's really enjoyable; it has some great laughs and excellent actors. The dialogues include a lot of pretty intelligent one-liners, and even without reading any interviews you can sense that the crew had quite a good time blowing up each single item on the set, which contributes to the popcorn movie atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, where's the extras?","review":"Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette.All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Welcome to Con Air\\"","review":"...John Malkovich's character (Cyrus the Virus) announces after taking over a state of the art prisoner transport plane. This and many other lines help make Cyrus one of the most charismatic and lovable convicts I've seen in a long time (he is the bad guy in the movie though, but I can't help but like him). There is tons of other great characters in this movie as well, many of them covicts. Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, Steve Buscemi, David Chapelle, and Ving Rhames are all solid as usual.Yes this is standard Jerry Bruckheimer action fare, but that's not a bad thing. It's a movie made to entertain and that's it. There is loads of comic relief and pleasantly cheesy dialogue that helps to make sure you don't take the film too seriously. As mentioned by others the Unrated Extended Edition DVD has absolutely no special features, which is a little disappointing, but the movie by itself is worth the price regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Con Air R2","review":"For all of us living in Europe and having thoughts about buying the region 2 encoding I just wanted to mention that Con Air region 2 is cut for what I think is the german audiences. (I am not talking about the Con Air english reg. 2 which may be uncut) The cuts are: 1. When \\"Pinball\\" burns the Indian. 2. When Cyrus burns the drugkingpin. 3. Cyrus falling through electrical lines. 4. Cyrus death scene. The Region 1DVD has no cuts and include both the Trailer and a Teaser Trailer (the region 2 doesn't)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE.

It has great stunts in it and a number of good special effects. Other than that, I can only say that Nic must have done this movie for the cash only. He is a brilliant actor but his talent was utterly wasted in this intelligence-insulting plot. He has shown to be as good as you can be at mostly just sitting and staring in anticipation :-). Very disappointing and anybody who says that this was one of Nic's \\"better performances\\" needs a psychiatric evaluation. It was most certainly one of his WORST right next to Trapped In Paradise, but let's grant him that every actor actor can only be as good as his script. Hey Nic, back to the independent movie for quality and away from mainstream Hollywood trash for BIG BUCK$. I think you can afford it again as you could with Leaving Las Vegas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Film","review":"I loved the movie!

It was just great, one of my favorite here in the last few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working-class Fugitive","review":"Con Air is a basic, high-explosion variation on \\"The Fugitive\\". The talented cast is a case of overkill: Con Air character roles call for nothing more sophisticated than caveman-like violence, a' la late night wrestling.TARGET CROWD: Con Air will probably appeal to people who like their action flicks loud, explosive, direct, all-American, and uncomplicated. The good guys win, the bad guys get massively punished in the end .... and hey, that's it.THIS FILM IS NOT FOR YOU IF: Avoid Con Air if you prefer thinking persons' action films, and if you're tired of formula Hollywood films. This is not a sophisticated movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Con Air","review":"OMG!!!! NO!!!!! It's in a different language or something that I cannot even play in my DVD player!!!!!!!!!

It has lots of actions, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"Regardless of the new extras and restored scenes, this dvd has a terrible video transfer. Horizontal edges have more edge enhancement than even the infamously bad SWEP1 Phantom Menace dvd. The overall picture is reduced to near vhs quality from the excessive ringing.Absolutely avoid this Z-grade transfer unless you have a 13\\" tv or don't care at all about video quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, but...","review":"My wife told me the whole story before watching it. It sounded interesting. But once I saw John Malkovich I groaned? This is supposed to be the bad guy? He's laughable. Who would be scared of that geek? Seriously, I was more entertained with my wife telling me the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good rental","review":"Some movies are good to see when you're stressed out at the job, lost your wallet, or otherwise want to park your brain. There were only two good actors here: Malkovich and Buscemi. Everyone else was passable, even Cage, Rhames and Cusack.Did anyone else notice that Mkeylti Williamson played essentially the same role that he did in Forest Gump? Wounded black man saved by a white man? The so-called black revolutionary lead on by a white man. Even after Cage pointed that out to him, the revolutionary still didn't get it. The only classic scene is when Buscemi explains to Cage what insanity really is. You almost get caught up in his explanation when it does take Cage to get us out.Otherwise it's a standard action movie that does have a lot of visual gags. Those of you who hated it, watch again this time but ignore the thin plot and watch the gags. That you will get a kick out of. It shows the film's producers having a little sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"What can I say about this except DON'T WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE WATCHING IT!

And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too.Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD. We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I personally am sick of it.Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet. No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library.No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.

Don't do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Nicolas Cage's acting hits an all-time low in this movie with one of the worst characters he's ever played. The film tries in numerous way to entertain, but it just didn't click with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never ending thrill ride","review":"Con Air is the reason they make big screen TVs. If you have or can find someone who has a projector, even better. The action in this flick is top-notch. Not only that, but it keeps giving you more... there's about 3 places it could stop before it does, but in the end you don't mind the extra time because it just means more action. Cage is excellent as the one who \\"couldn't leave a fallen man behind\\".The only point I take off is for Cage's annoying attempt at a southern accent. It's only really apparent at the beginning, though, you get used to it as the movie goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!!!","review":"I bought this book and expected the same old sci fi formula.

Eddie Murphy is the Johnny Appleseed of handguns is this film. He uses a clip, tosses the weapon, uses a clip, tosses the weapon over and over and over again. San Francisco PD could solve their armed street crime problem easily if they would just get Murphy off the streets. He litters the streets with enough guns to arm a small army. Too much gun play, not enough consideration for a quality script. Give this picture a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack film","review":"This is one of those \\"Flavor of the Month\\" flicks. It does good in the box-office and at the video store but there's nothing more to it. I found myself bored on the second viewing.

I'm using this book in a class I am taking and I would recommend it to anyone who is seriously thinking about wanting to understand soils in a more geomorphologic and geologic perspective.

The extensive references section will also help to lead you in other directions you may wish to take in order to find more on specific studies and research papers."},{"rating":"2","title":"soil from earth","review":"I read this book for one of my graduate courses. Totaly this is a good book for people who know about soil science, but the weakness of this book is using too much terms which are not explained in this book.

Parsons does it all; guitar, bass, drums, pedal steel, banjo, harmonica; Meridian Green joins in with vocals and guitar. She has a soothing voice that fits to a T with Parsons. Carla Olson, Gene Clark's duet partner had a tendency to get a little grating after a while, with her deep female singing. Especially love hearing Parsons on the harmonica, I hate to do the inevitable comparisons, but has tinges of country Byrds blended with a touch of Eagles; a very nice sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has taken a nose-dive","review":"I have used this brand of knife for 23 years.

Interjecting the fun is much easier to do when the students are children and this book is an existence proof that it can be done. The math games are simple, at the level of the first or second grader and they involve everything from manipulation, the interpretation of diagrams and simple graphs to reading a short passage and deriving the answer.The proper amount of silliness is included, for example having butterflies count French Fries uses a simple and silly rhyme to make the point of how counting is done. This is an excellent book that will entertain while educating."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Things I Like About This Movie","review":"1. The actors actually look like they belong in high school.2. The script doesn't make teenagers sound like \\"Clueless\\" clones and actually maintains some of Shakespeare's wit.3. The cast has strong chemistry which lends a pleasing, and surprising, naturalness to their performances.4. The movie doesn't feel like a commercial for Maybelline or Calvin Klein.5. The main characters aren't sugar-coated; there's something charming yet detestable about all of them.6. Julia Stiles can dance.7. Heath Ledger can sing.8. The movie tries less to simplify high school as a battle between good and evil and more as a struggle to gain independence and a sense of self.9. There's nothing overly preachy here (i.e., don't be mean to dorks, beauty is on the inside, etc.).10. Freddie Prinze, Jr. isn't in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEATH IS QUITE THE CUTIE!!","review":"This movie was so bad.

Julia Stiles' acting is stale --although as usual there's no denying her screen presence, the dialogue sounds like it was written between takes and the rest of the cast are cardboard cut outs of high school stereotypes. I'm not knocking teen films because I happen to like teen films even though I probably outgrew them long ago but this one is pretty bad.However, this movie has a few saving graces. First of all it's a modern version of Taming of the Shrew. And, it name-drops a few literary giants along the way (due to Kat's unquenchable thirst for literature!). Also, Allison Janney is priceless as a guidance counseler/wannabe romance writer. And, the rantings of Bianca and Kat's father about teen pregnancy are very funny. Finally, the firey Heath Ledger as high school bad boy makes the last half of the film bearable. I'd throw in an extra half star for these things alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larisa Oleynik is the hottest girl in the world","review":"10 things is the best movie ever seen espcailly Larisa she is awsome in this flick.

The movie is actually really believable.The characters are well-played and crafted, the performances are superb. The script is witty and inventive. The soundtrack has some great songs but most of all the experience of watching this movie stays with you. My favourite characters would have to be Katarina (Julia Stiles) and Chastity (Gabrielle Union). The movie draws you in and you will find yourself watching it many times.

Unfortunately, the writers--having taken \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" as the template for their story--run out of direct parallels to Shakespeare early on, and they can't replace them with anything except the usual, tiresome teen-movie cliches and leaden, disposable dialogue. Worst of all, Janney--whose presence really enlivens the early scenes--disappears before the movie is half-over.

Then their dad forces them to cooperate with each other, and when they actually do its scares the hell out of him. Meanwhile the loser jock/model sets up a guy for the outkast so he can date her sister and ends up teaching everyone a lesson in love. This movie introduced me to now one of my fav bands Letters to Cleo, and also has Save Ferris, Barenaked Ladies, and others that make the movie twice as exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Things Not A Stupid Teenage Movie","review":"10 Things I Hate About You proves that smooth dialogue and smart casting can make a stupid teenage movie into a funny film. The actors are chosen perfectly. Heath Ledger exactly hits the right notes as the social outcast Patrick Verona with a cute grin. I can't think of anyone else but Julia Stiles who could play the grungy feminist Kat Stratford. The rest are also perfect Joseph Gordon Levitt as Cameron, Larisa Oleyik as Bianca Stratford and the supporting cast rounds out the film. Actually, the music is also why I ranked this movie five stars. Letters to Cleo singer Kay Hanley sings most of the songs played throughout the film and they're right for certain settings in the movie. Overall, buy this if you want to prove that teenagers don't have to have their own genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential squandered","review":"So, after much hesitation, I finally saw this film. I get that this takes Taming of the Shrew and makes into a modern day coming-of-age story. That was a reasonable premise. However, you take this talented cast and fabulous director and waste them on just another mediocre coming-of-age tale where the characters are so under-developed that you really don't care whether they come of age on not. Add to that a forced over-sexed twist to try to be hip and the result is huge loss of opportunity. There are moments, but overall, a stark disappointment when contrasted with the potential from source material and the talent on this film. I might be kinder if the source material weren't so great or the talent so strong. Really could have been bright dialog and clever interaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just had to purchase.","review":"I love this movie. I've seen it a few times before purchasing it here through Amazon. I haven't seen it for a couple of years though on tv so I ordered it and watched it early that night.

Its a classic that's worth being in your movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was full of feeling.","review":"\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" was a freat movie!

I was pleasantly surprised about it--the caracters were really well rounded with fun quirks that remind us of the cruelity of the social dynamics of high school and the movie was well written with hilarious and witty lines that fit into the context of the story that fit the caracters and went a step beyond the conventional lines. It was a well done modernazation of Taiming Of The Shrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"P-E-R-F-E-C-T","review":"The movie was very romantic. The jokes were funny and it was great all around.

The movie is portrayed as a love story with Patrick making Kate fall in love with him with his charm. But this is no where near the attitude of Pertruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, where he treats Kate very poorly in order to \\"tame\\" her from the way she has always been. He makes her fast and not sleep for an extended period of time by \\"killing her with kindness\\". However, the movie had a nice incorporation of Shakespeare Line throughout the movie and it was any enjoyable movie for the ordinary high school love story romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie Ever!!!!!!!","review":"Omigosh this movie is so great!

The sexual content disgusted me, and the movie was not worth going through all of the gross stuff.

No one in this could act and the plot was just super weak dude"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down Shakespeare","review":"This adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, set in a Seattle High School, leaves Shakespeare's play almost entirely behind. Only one line from the play is cited in the entire video. Instead of a story about a rough man \\"taming\\" a woman in need of sex, we get in 10 Things a sappy story about a teen boy \\"saving\\" a \\"feminazi\\" young woman. If you are looking for a serious revision of Shakespeare's play, ignore this film.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"This film is just poor. The script was terrible, really terrible. It was so obvious that at the prom kat would find out about the money and walk out. But the scene where the aussie guy asks her to go with him as a boyfriend would, she suddenly starts questioning why he pushing the subject. Some of the gags, e.g. where the archery teacher gets shot in the butt, didn't fit in the film at all. It was more like spoof comedy and just made the film even more unbelievable. Luckily i only rented this and didn't waste my money buying it. The main characters are only just likeable, and coupled with a bad script, make this film an embrassment to the whole teen/romantic comedy genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"tHERE ARE MORE THAN 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE","review":"How original a poplular good looking guy is forced to hook up with an unpopular girl as a foavor or bet.

The acting is good. The dialogue is funny and also very clever. The way the actors deliver the great lines is what makes the cast very believable in each situation that they are in. The movie is entertaining and Julia Stiles has a spectacular performance. All teenagers have to like this movie because it is romantic and it deals with situations that teenagers face in their everyday life. It is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the average teen movie","review":"\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is one of maybe two or three films that rises to the top of the heap in that whole fad back in the late '90s of taking classic novels and plays and adapting them into teen movies.You know all the basics: based on \\"Taming of the Shrew\\", Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, yadda yadda yadda. What makes \\"10 Things\\" rise above its more drecky cousins (\\"Cruel Intentions\\", \\"Drive Me Crazy\\", and anything -- whether based on classic literature or not -- that had Freddie Prinze, Jr. within 50 yards of it) is the fact that this film came with a well-written script, and the director and producers put actors in who could handle the comedy. In addition to Julia Stiles, major kudos go out to Darryl \\"Chill\\" Mitchell (the wise-cracking English teacher) and Allison Janney (the erotica-writing guidance counselor) for their performances.Definitely one to add to the collection, even if it's as a guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The laughs just keep on coming!","review":"This movie is so good! Great plot and extremely funny. The story is about two daughters. One popular, and one...socially Challenged! Their father makes a rule that the popular daughter can't go on a date unless her sister does. One guy finds out and pays a juvenile delincuent to go out with her. But what do you think will happen when he falls in love with her.

His friend and him decide to make a plan to pair Kat with Patrick.It's a hard trip to get Kat in a liking happy mood, much less to get her to a party that she must attend dually with her sister, or else. The girl's have to live with an overbearing father who takes good watch over his girls.I grew up with this movie and it is a definate high school flick funny for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept me laughing!","review":"This remake of Shakespeare's play keeps alive the the flavor of the orignal play. I've always enjoyed Shakespeare's comedies, and this remake doesn't disappoint. The puns and banter of the characters are fresh and entertaining. At times, some of the actors show their inexperience (this is particularly true of Heath Ledger). Julia Stiles does a superb job of playing the shrew. In fact, she steals the show. My other favorite character is Ms. Perky, the sex-obsessed guidance counselor. After you've had one of those days when nothing seems to go right, pop this movie in the DVD player and get ready to laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is a great movie, even if you don't like the teen genre film. In this update of Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\", Patrick is paid to take Kat on date, so Cameron can take her sister out. The problem is that Kat finds out, after Patrick has fallen in love with her. This is full of comedy and romance, and a must see for anyone who loves a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"90's teen drama at its best","review":"I saw this movie when i was about 12 and from that moment on i loved it. It doesnt take itself too seriously, the light pg-13 humor really reveals that.\\"So mr verona you exposed yourself to the lunch lady?\\"\\"I didnt expose myself it was a bratwurst.\\"\\"Quite the optimist arent we?\\"Its dialog like this that really pushes the movie.

Its fun-loving fun not to missed by all the people who enjoyed Jawbreaker and never Been Kissed.There is alot of excellent movies like this today - a bunch of teens hiding a secret about passion and then falling in love with each other and the other person finds out they were cheating on them.You'll enjoy 'TWO HANDS' if your a Heath fan, he's a really good actor.

Sharp, witty, smart dialogue (unlike most teeny-bopper flicks). 2. It has a superb cast, like Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, and Larissa Oleynick. 3. Great plot and update on classic play. 4. It mocks the stereotypes of high school people. 5. It's the best teen flick since Clueless. 6. The ending was great. 7. The school used in the movie that looked like a castle was awesome! 8.

GREAT TEENS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter than a taco baked in hell!","review":"I must admit, I'm not the most avid follower of any US high school sitcoms but this one truly rocked! The jokes are great and the adaption was spot on by NOT being exactly what ol' Will penned e.g. could you imagine what it would have been like if Patrick had submitted Kat to ritual humiliation in order to get her to date him? Wouldn't have been quite as effective. No lesser characters were overdeveloped and the film was overdone in all the right places. A moving, funny and truly great film that made me feel truly great. An all-time favorite which I will have to get out on video! (Oh, Alex Mack and Boy Meets World are pretty good too, but that's another review...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!","review":"This is an interesting modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" with a great cast. I like how they incorporate all of the characters [with their original names for the most part] in a high school setting, and the dynamics of the cast. The English teacher also mentions Shakespearean sonnets in class, tying in the story's roots. Comical, romantic, funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Movie of All Time","review":"I am in love with what some people like to call teeny-bopper movies. They are all I ever watch. I just saw this movie for the first time few months ago, and I fell in love with it. I love Shakespeare's works and the humor in this movie added to the story line makes it amazing. Julia Stiles is by far my favorite actress and I think she is wonderful as Kat. Heath Ledger is also a great actor (and really cute!) If you haven't seen this movie, go see it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip, funny, in control.","review":"Without being too over-the-top or annoyingly dramatic, 10 Things I Hate About You is a witty, harmless, inventive teen film that did and continues to do more than She's All That or Drive Me Crazy could've wished. The film is refreshing, even if it doesn't have the newest story of the century. It does the Shakespearean thang with hip sensibility and creative script-writing. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger who play Kat and Patrick are an awesome team, they comedically portray a teens version of romance with style and interest. I loved the scripting and the film doesn't go grey with age too quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing teen flick","review":"As far as teen movies go, this is one of the best. Julia Stiles is sassy and smart as Kat, although the writers have set her up with some akward dialouge, and she comes off sounding a bit affected. Larisa Oleynik is perfectly cast as the too- cute Bianca. Her tounge-in-cheek perfectness adds a lot to the story. Heath Ledger, a personal favorite of mine, is funny as the 'bad boy' Patrick Verona, a part which Ledger makes the best of, dispite it's limited range and convenient and unexplained transformation in to a 'good boy' about halfway through. The rest of the cast (Andrew Keagan, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) are effective in their roles. All in all, a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath's cutes film ever!:)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Heath Ledger and he is a very talented actor, this is one of my favorite movies of his.

I highly reccomend it.:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, entertaining movie.","review":"10 Things I Hate About You is a hilariously funny movie. It is a wonderful remake of Taming of the Shrew. It's about two sisters that are the exact opposite of each other. One is very into her looks and wants everyone to love her. The other sister could care less about people liking her or about the way she looks. This movie is about the sisters relationships with others and how similar they actually are. So if you want a good laugh and a little drama, 10 Things I Hate About You is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable!","review":"It was okay when I first saw it in the theater but now that I rented it on video it started to suck.

I know I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smart and funny","review":"Every year we are introduced with a barage of teen roamnce movies and just about every one of them fails because it is nothing but a bunch of cliches. But out of that bunch comes a smart funny high school movie. 10 things i hate about you is smart and very funny. Kat played by Julia Stiles in a winning performance who is sullen and has a smart answer for everyone. Her sister Bianca is bound to become famous. But one problem comes in the way their father dosn;t want Bianca to date until kat does. Since she hates men that will be never. Until she meets Patrick Verona played by Heath Ledger in a great role. She falls in love.Gil Junger directing from a script from Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith is peppy and full on great one liners. The cast of relative unknowns is great. and in a very funny role Allison Janney is Ms Perky the guidance counsoler who is writing a trashy romance novel is very funny. A smart film and a good time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...Definitely a must see movie","review":"I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and totally fell in love with it and it's characters. Yes, I am a teenager, but I also understand that many adults (including my parents and sisters) have enjoyed it. Any teenager that watches this movie can relate to something, which is one reason I found it so interesting. I think many viewers find themselves totally interested in one character and paying attention to that one throughout the movie, hoping he/she gets what they want. Also, the acting in this movie, was awesome. The casting director needs some kind of award for this, because the teenagers portray their characters very well. If you haven's seen this movie, you must see it. Maybe some people find it to be a bad movie, but I think most of you will be very interested in it and want to watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. I'm 12 years old, but I've watched it with my friends, parents, and my little brothers. Every person I watched it with found it hilarious. It was very well written! It was so funny, and I want to buy the video as soon as it comes out! Even if you're not much for romance, I'd have to say that you'd STILL like this movie with it's comedy and even the story.

My only complaint was that it had too much obscene language.Most teens talk like that but it's sending the wrong message when your role models have such a trash-talking character.

The Soundtrack that comes with this movie is also really good. They play the right songs in the right moment which makes the viewer pulled into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat the Cursed","review":"This film was much better than I'd expected. A re-telling of Taming of the Shrew that transfers well to the modern day high school.Good fun throughout, the two leads are very likeable as Patrick takes on the paid task of 'wooing' Cat to enable another school chum to go out with her sister. Cat's poem to Patrick at the end is brilliant - you just know that each time she's saying 'hate' she really means 'love'.Put it in your vcr, cuddle up with your partner and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Superb and Fabulous!","review":"I think this is a superb movie for all teenagers.

Well, \\"Junior\\" almost became the second movie for me to walk out on. I stuck with it, but the whole thing just struck me as desperately unfunny, like a standup comic who only has one good joke but still has 30 minutes left in his routine, so he keeps telling the same joke over and over in different ways hoping the audience doesn't notice. Sure, some people will laugh the whole way through, but others will just start to squirm and feel bad for the guy. I felt bad for Arnold... And wasn't this the last comedy he did?

I'm just in love with Schwarzenegger's character, Dr. Alex Hesse. In the beginning of the film, he is very ernest, obedient, and almost literally married to his job as a scientist. But when he becomes pregnant (which is a result of an experiment in order to try out a new wonder drug to prevent miscarriages), he begins to show the classic symptoms of pregnancy. He had morning sickness, mood swings, and he ESPECIALLY had cravings; but the most important side affect of condition was a motherly bond between him and the baby. Alex was only supposed to take carry out the experiment for the entire first trimester, but what happens is that he becomes emotionally becomes attached to the baby, and he decides to have it. There are many scenes where he shows his symptoms in the cutest way possible!

Before I saw this film,I assumed it would be a sequel to TWINS. The untypical male pregnancy is so hilarious that it will relentlessly tickle any viewer's funny bone! This film was probably inspired by the 1989 episode of NBC's The Cosby Show where Bill Cosby dreams that he and his male co-stars Malcolm Jamal Warner,Geoffrey Owens and Joseph C.

It may not be academy award winning material, but its a true feel good film. After seeing it, you want to see it again! If your one of those people who watch a film just for the simple reason of picking it apart and trying to find ways not to enjoy it, you need to get a life. Just watch it for what it is, a fun movie.For all you expecting mothers out there, you will absolutly love this movie. It basically has a man (Arnold) going through every stage of pregnancy.

Although I do not think this is as good as the other Mariachi films, I was suprisingly impressed with this very low budget film that that launched off the career of Mr. Rodriquez. It was not hard to follow and was entertaining,and it does remind me of Mad Max (even though it is very little) , but the simularaties are that both films started with low budget first's and then succeeded with two fantasic Sequels that followed. So I will say this is one Spanish film worthy of my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"$7K movie and it shows","review":"First of all. I love \\"Desperado\\" and \\"Once a Upon ...\\" films.

The quality of this film reminds me when my small town's local theater would show cheap mexican movies where the acting and editing were poor even to the untrained eyes.Film students just love this film because it was made on $7K budget. It is an amazing film for such a low amount but it's not a great film for the average moviegoer.

The one-star reviewer must have a defective sound system! I especially like Lutoslawski's bold opening with the tympani. Along with catchy folk melodies, there are moments of transcendent beauty in the Bartok concerto, especially the song \\"Hungary, Gracious and Beautiful\\", which is interrupted in an ugly manner, symbolizing the arrival of tyranny.I haven't heard any other performance of these works so I have nothing to compare them to.

Shame there's no low/middle/high option - just an on/off on each light. Also, whilst you can extend the height over three extensions they don't fold up for storage like my other work lights can.They are hot though; frankly they saturate your area with both the brightness and heat of the sun!

I was building a table in the garage and the light made life MUCH easier; I could measure everything, check it was level/plumb and screw the wood together in half the time it used to take. Build quality and packaging were a little iffy. The stand feels a bit flimsy and the box was missing a couple of bolts.

So when Pearl Harbor was bombed she was the only person who voted against war--though a few days later she voted for war against Germany. She was somewhat eccentric and was active in the anti-war movement during the Vietnam era though not in full sync with the moving spirits in that endeavor. She lived on till she was almost 93, active and forceful till the end.

There is something, though, about an empty carnival in the middle of the Kansas prairie that is spooky all by itself.

The location is beautiful, especially the abandoned amusement park (giving at least one good reason to visit Utah), and leaving the viewer wishing the filmmakers had made more than just one feature film. It is not the greatest movie by any means, but it resembles Hitchcock's Psycho in its small size and independence from typical Hollywood.The extras on this Criterion Collection gives greater insight to how a movie can be made and that anyone can really do it.

Poetic footage all the way through, and great organ music. I thought while watching it I'd be so proud if I made it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem","review":"Carnival of Souls is very subterranean, going underneath our merely verbal senses. The plot is of little importance, but atmosphere is everything. The eerie music, strange people and oddly shot black and white scenes grab at our fears of loneliness and death. You know (but more importantly, feel) that Mary is inexorably doomed. The effect is powerful because it succeeds in making Mary a proxy for ourselves. The effects are subtle, not depending on \\"special effects\\" in the usual sense. Rather, they rely on creative use of camera composition, restrained acting (where less is more), and hauntingly strange music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Stage Proto-Zombies!","review":"As a zombie connoisseur to other zombie fans, I must point out that Carnival of Souls should not be missed. Here are some of the earliest images of the walking dead on film. Check it out for the early makeup effects and general zombie styling, which has evolved into the look of zombies in today's films.Also, it's worthy of watching as a traditional ghost story: girl dies, but doesn't realize it for a while & tries to go on living. Very cool vintage horror. Criterion picks great films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnival of Souls","review":"A ghost is a soul which doesn't realize it is dead, and that is what Mary Henry is in Carnival of Souls. When she sees that she is invisible to others, Mary realizes that she's \\"not in this world.\\" The creepy organ music is like something you hear in a silent horror movie,and the camera angles and b&w photography add to the eerie atmosphere of the film. It's a psychological horror film with sexual overtones,like Psycho, and a precursor to Night of the Living Dead. A true classic,not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnival of Souls","review":"Creepy and atmospheric, brooding and frightening. The pace is slow at times but the overall effect is hypnotic. The plot has been borrowed by a couple of very successful films recently - better not say which ones! Shows what you can do on a shoestring budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"It sounds cheap. It looks cheap. There was nothing scary or entertaining about it. The plot doesn't make sense. People talk to her, everything blurs then they don't see or hear her. Dumb. I had to force myself and my friends to watch it. I love old horror films but this one was a dud. I don't understand the reviews saying how great this movie is. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the all-time greats","review":"one of the best horrow films ever made, this one can give you nightmares. made on a small budget, the story will give you the creeps and stay with you. highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best For Those On A Budget","review":"The video transfer on this Alpha Video release is surprisingly good. This film is essential to your film collection and if you are on a budget this is the one to get. No bells and whistles, but you can't beat it for under $8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"It's horrible and does not keep my interest. It's creepy in a very odd, boring way. I didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy low budget film","review":"I saw this film as a kid and recently saw it again. It really holds up. The scene on the bridge sent shivers down my spine and all the carnival stuff holds up well. The musical score by Gene Moore is sufficiently eerie to keep the mood creepy. All praise goes onto Candace Hilligoss who plays Mary Henry in a very intense performance, that is both eerie and surreal. She really makes the film work. The directing by Herk Harvey is very good for a B movie. This movie goes on a little long but it is still worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspense thriller/early horror movie...","review":"Well I purchased this movie awhile back and didn't have a chance to view it until last night.....The movie was great and I watched it in its original format (B&W) because what is the point watching an \\"old\\" movie if you don't watch it the way people would've watched it back in 1962....now it isn't like our \\"newer/modern\\" horror movies....remember it was filmed back in '62. But I think the mood of the film was great...the spooky music was a major factor in the movie...the acting isn't the best and the plot is alittle shaky but overall a great cult classic so if you like horror movies and wish to explore the beginningsof horror movies....you should check out this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DANCE OF THE DEAD","review":"Ordered this Criterion DVD strictly by the reviews here on Amazon. Would like to say I was not disappointed. I did have the end figured out before the closing frame, as others have indicated, but was still genuinely frightened for what was happening to Mary. It has been said that Candace Hilligoss's performance caused you not to care about the character, however I did not feel that way. It was quite an unsettling experience. As usual, Criterion done an outstanding job on the picture and sound quality, and the box art was really nice. If I were to say anything negative, it would be to ask \\"Does one really need two versions of the same movie, especially when we're talking a mere 5 minutes?\\" Highly recommended fright film to anyone who doesn't need buckets of blood, or gallons of gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired horror","review":"Well, there's no denying you'll see the \\"surprise\\" ending coming within the first two minutes, but it hardly matters. Carnival of Souls is one of the best horror films ever. It's nightmarishly surreal and will get under your skin the way few horror films do. It's a shining example of what can be achieved on a very limited budget by talented filmmakers with vision and imagination. What a crying shame that director Herk Harvey never made another feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another insult from Legend","review":"Anybody who has ever seen this film needs no warning to stay as far away from this DVD as possible. It is a moody horror classic that induces nightmares as few other films can do, but much of that comes from the truly creepy black & white photography. Colorizing it would absolutely ruin it, but Legend is a company that specializes in ruining B&W public domain films by colorizing them, as if we're too stupid to enjoy a film with its original cinematography. There are wonderful versions of Carnival of Souls out there - it's good enough that you should seek them out, particularly the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD. But this one? Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carnival of Souls","review":"I don't get what the hype is about. Being low budget is not an excuse for bad filming, Night Of The Living Dead was low budget and that's superb. Carnival of Souls on the otherhand is poorly edited, scripted and dreadfully acted. I felt no fear AT ALL. It does not deserve a cult like status.There are much better horror movies out there. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"CARNIVAL OF SOULS","review":"I expected this film to be bad and I was not disappointed.The old cars, clothes and camera techniques were fun in their own way - and I accomplished my mission - I saw the horror flick filmed at Saltair Pavilion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie that should have died","review":"Just because a movie is made for 35,000 dollars and is independent does not make it good. This is a truly dire film, proceeding at a snail's pace with acting so wooden I was looking for termites. On the mini documentary the cast seem as bemused at the renewed interest in the film as anyone else, and even one of the reviewers was quoted as saying \\"uh, very slow, not one of my favourite films\\". I did a film degree and, trust me, this film has almsot no redemming features. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living Dead Girl?","review":"It 's Halloween night. Scary movie fest at my house. This one came highly recommended, the guy behind the counter at the video store said it \\"disturbed him for days\\". After watching this, I think he'd probably say that about the Muppet Movie as well.Why do people hold up examples of cheap desperation such as Carnival of Souls as Art? With all of Herk's experience as an educational film maker, you would think he had learned something about technique. This is the sloppiest movie I've seen since Plan 9 From Outer Space!!I tried really hard to get into this one. And I must admit that the main actress chick had a hauntingly wierd kind of a face that almost worked, if only she didn't have dialougue!!!I REALLY tried. But the waves of laughter from the audiece just put the last nail in the coffin.Sorry. This one's a [dud]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out bad","review":"Cult \\"classic\\" is basically a long and mostly dull Twilight Zone episode.

Candace Hilligoss turns in a wonderfully bizarre performance as Mary Henry. Gene Moore's organ score is very creepy. Inspirational to such films as \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" \\"The Others\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"I bought this dvd to get an affordable copy of Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS. I can't currently justify the high price of the Criterion version, so this one serves nicely. Harvey's film is a true masterpiece. He coaxes excellent perfomances from every actor involved in this movie, but the real star here is the director. What a shame; what a tragedy that this man did not receive the attention and praise he so richly deserved for this amazing and disturbing film. From the opening credits, one is keenly aware that this movie is a work of art, from the patterns Harvey discovered and lovingly framed in the moving water and sediments of a muddy riverbank, to the ingeniously placed titles as the film begins. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never tire of seeing a true innovator at work. And no matter how many times I see it, I feel sorry that Harvey didn't produce any follow-up features, but happy that he left us this treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed!","review":"Although the pictures in this book were great, the story of the boy who \\"puts his finger in the dike\\" has been changed in this version to the point where it lacks any positive character building morals or lessons.

As the title suggests the main feature is a B-movie schlocker called 'Amazon Women on the Moon' (supposedly presented \\"complete and uncut with no commercial interruptions\\") but constantly halted for technical glitches, commercials and community service announcements (the actual film being parodied is a combination of two different sci-fi classics of the 50's, \\"Cat Women of the Moon\\" and \\"Queen of Outer Space\\"). Most of the sketches are fantastic and the stars include Lou Jacobi, Erica Yohn, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette, Griffin Dunne and Steve Forrest.

I can appreciate satire and comedy skits but this collection of skits surrounding snippets of a campy space movie just doesn't work. Individually some of the skits are good or at least mildly amusing; like \\"Two IDs\\" starring Rosanna Arquette and Steve Guttenberg about a fact checking machine that does a history analysis of a man's dating history to let user's know if he's a good candidate. Or Ed Begley Jr. as the \\"Son of the Invisible Man\\" who doesn't realize he's not invisible and runs around naked.The best part of the movie was looking out for the familiar faces, some who were popular in the 80s and some who are more popular now. They include the likes of Arsenio Hall, Phil Hartman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Peter Horton, Griffon Dunne, Joe Pantoliano, Joey Travolta, Steve Allen, B.B.

I also dont understand why most readers were so appled that she was very intelligent, meaning she didnt use her head all the time. She was young and the baby of the family, of course she was impetious, it made her interesting and allowed plot twists.I loved Alex, he possessivness of Velvet was something I found very sexy. I hated the fact that he took a mistress (Alanna) but Velvet (not using her head) had basically left him so naturally being the macho Scot he was of course he would take up with some other woman in one way or another.

He and Valerie pretty much share honors and the sidemen such as the acoustic bass players (on different tracks) are relatively subdued. Some exceptions, for too brief moments, are superbly recorded by Chesky revealing in intimate detail, the alto saxophone playing. Joyce's voice would seem to be well suited to jazz, the blues and pop. Here, it is easy to call the music easy listening jazz with ballads included.

After #24, in Melanie's Treasure, Sterling is jumping and doing dresage ect. And I think that Christina's Courage should be called Melanie, Kevin and Dylan's Coureage, because they have to put up with that ***** Christina.

There were no catchy sing-along tracks.In fact, when it comes to the track list, apart from the single \`About Us' I'm hard pushed to remember any of the songs.I can remember \`My Number' & 'Incognito' for also being above average, though they don't yell hit.The rest of the album isn't especially bad; it's just boring (I can't review each track as I can't remember them), and with nothing to hook in listeners Brooke is destined to remain undiscovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never ride on Father's Fame for your success...!!!!","review":"99 percent of Famous People's kids, luckily born,with a Golden Spoon in their mouth, fail when they try to ride on the success of their parent(s).

When the show was syndicated & crossed over to America in the late 70's, I was watching many of the sketches seen in set three. Benny was definitely at his creative peak during this period. Sketches which stick out in my mind as the funniest are: \\"Victorian Scandals\\", \\"Bionic Baby\\", \\"Murder On The Oregon Express\\", \\"The Flash\\" number, and the \\"Fire Brigade\\" (with \\"Robin Hood\\"), as well as the recurring Fred Scuttle bits & countless impersonations.Set Five is due to be released in a few days; it will be interesting to compare the quality & content of these sets to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of Deja Vu","review":"Granted, I love getting the shows in their original broadcast format, but as of the last show on disc 2, and the shows following, there is some repetition of skits from the earlier released HBO Home Video releases on DVD.

Button cutout is \\"Omega\\" shaped.Flexible enough for easy installation--not stiff.Matte finish means fingerprints don't show.What I don't like:Like nearly all screen covers, it is exceedingly difficult to get it positioned and applied without getting at least a few dust particles trapped. This is not a criticism of this particular Boxwave cover; it is characteristic of most covers.

Since the last Lime album back in 1993, Denis' work has been uneven. The ill-fated Cherry Lime project was atrocious, whereas his work with Amithia (\\"Music Lover\\") in the mid-90's was superb. I agree with a previous reviewer that Mr. LePage is following musical trends this time around (what's up with the rap?) rather than making them.A couple of tracks are good but the standout is definitely \\"This Is My Life\\" because it's so typically Lime: the synths, the sweet melody, the male-female duet. It's not perfect, but it's as close as you're going to get to classic Lime. The rest of the album is, in my opinion, mostly throwaway.I'm afraid I don't see the comparisons between this release and previous Lime works (this is far from being 80's dance music) or even Bobby Orlando tracks.I'm sorry I wasted my money on this CD.

The author needs to develop an understanding of image color management. An image can be printed out of any number of applications and the color will be the same. The print driver menus can cause the color to change...not the application. Also, a properly color managed image will look similar in RGB and CMYK, not as shown in this book.This is a good book for hobbyists who are not concerned with accurate color, which is fine as long as the book buyer understands this.

For real Im sayin there are some beats that I dont really like but I wind up likin the song because the words he's kickin and the heart he kicks it with is on point.

Overall this was a waste of money...My advice...copy \\"Who we be\\" (which coincedentally ISN'T the one that you hear on the radio with him doing the \\"DaDun DaDun DaDun\\" during the chourus) off of the CD, and then take it to Kemp Mill or whatever store in your area that buys used CD's, and SELL IT!

I only bought the album because I thought that it featured somethng else on it. Plus, I unknowillingly purchased the clean version. I can't stand the edited version. The only factor that saved this record from a one star rating was the cover and photography.You shouldn't buy this cd if you're like me.Try music like C-BO, Spyro Gyra, The Rippingotns, Skywalk, some Rush, and some Blue Oyster Cult.

Even if one does not accept the belief in reincarnation or that Nick Bunick is Paul, the story will open up their mind to the endless possibilities of the spiritual realm; and perhaps remind us all that sometimes God does work in mysterious ways.On my 44th birthday I was awakened at 4:44 AM.

Nick Bunick's recounting of his past life serves only to give him credibility towards his efforts in the future. How do we know that the stories in the Bible are true? We were not there. We do know that there is one all knowing, all seeing, God, and just about every major religion believes in a coming of the messiah, be it Mohammed, Jesus, etc. This book is a very exciting read, and written at a lower level in order to be read by many, not just scholars. Jesus wanted his message to get to everyone, maybe now with televisions everywhere, he can. Read the book again, and look for the message. Will you know the messiah when he comes??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti climatic","review":"I just finished listening to Messangers. one of the things I found most disturbing was the narritive. a story this personal should have been written in the first person. I found myself wondering why a third person was describing how Nick \\"felt\\". And if Nick was now so detrmend to make himself known why did he not!! This was my first audio book. what a disapointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"It is rare that one is able to read a work as thought provoking as the Messengers. This book about Nick Bunick's current and past life asks one to believe in reincarnation as well as the existence of angels visiting to encourage the publishing of the manuscript. As controversial as both subjects are, I found the book inspiring because these business men were so open to heavenly guidance. I also find the book inspiring in the way Saul views Jesus as I feel we would currently view Jesus if he existed in these days. He opens our minds to the humaness of the experience. Much of the comments about this book are exactly like I think people would react to a so-called messiah appearing today. Some would rave, some would doubt, and some some would persecute. Who among us can judge the accuracy of someone's past life regression? The truth is not possible, but the book opens one's mind to heavenly interventions and humaness within a metaphor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb book","review":"What bothers me is that I bought this book. It was over-hyped by Amazon. I didn't realize it was a religious tract. I thought it was about angels--I mean, real, serious, angels.Angels--they don't necessarily exist, it is the idea of them that is so real--can be compelling. Black angels, white angels, macho angels, angels sent on special missions, heavenly CIA Agent angels, KGB angels, Nazi angels.The way I see angels, they are the ones who do the dirty work for God and the Devil--hit men, agent provocateurs, party slush fund agents, spies and burglars.Angels are interesting. But The Messengers is not about angels as I understand them. Don't buy this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Messengers","review":"I bought the book as a gift and thought I was getting a hardback and that it was new,. I paid quite a bit for the book and was shocked when it arrived as it was a used paperback that was $6.50 and I was charged $45. + I was very embarrassed to send it and felt ripped off.NO FURTHER COMMENT,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Goes against the Bible!!","review":"This book may be interesting and it may have some good things to say. I found it is a book that promotes showing love to people...BUT if you take this book to be true then you must completely reject the Bible. At no point in the book does it line up with the Bible. If you hold to the teachings of the Bible you will see that the way it presents Jesus and Saul is completely different from what is taught in the Bible. I found it interesting that at no point does it agree with exactly how the Bible is written. It completely questions the validity and puts the focus on Angels on the same level as their Creator God. I recommend that you purchase the book, \\"The Stranger on the road to Emmaus\\" which expains the Bible in a way that helps to solve the puzzle of the Bible. Plus, how do you know all angels are good?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing! I couldn't put it down...","review":"This is a truly inspiring book. I applaud the courage it took Nick Bunick to come forth with his personal experience and reveal it to the world. The message in this book shines like a beacon of light against the darkness of the apocalyptic cries of most of the world's religions. It is vastly comforting to know there are many people ( and even angels) who are actively working to bring peace to earth. It is a must read for anyone dissatified with the dogma of religion and who suspects the true teachings of Jesus may have been lost in transit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Have been using this digestive aid for the past year with very good results.It is a bit pricey but imagine my surprise when I was able to order from Amazon at a lower price than the company website.Very happy with product AND Amazon service."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 post-Bach late German Baroque vocal works","review":"This is a disc of German early music specialist Hermann Max conducting with Hungarian soprano Maria Zadori among the soloists. As with many of Max's discs on Capriccio and CPO it is a revival of some of the rarely heard late baroque vocal works that form the background to Bach and Telemann.The disc starts with two settings of Psalm 51, Misere in C, the first by the Czech composer Zelenka, the second by the Berlin opera composer Adolf Hasse. This is followed by Dresden composer Heinichen's Magnificat in A, and concluded by German Cantata in 5 movements by the rarely heard Homilius. (The five movements are Verwundrung, Mitleid.. Wie Ist Mir.. Verheertes Land, In Deinen Trummern.. O Sicherer Mensch, Was Schlafest Du.. Ei Nun, Herre Jesu, Schicke Unsre Herzen Zu)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for the journey.","review":"I am now on my third copy of this great classic.

The book starts out in 1941 Portmounts with the Taylor family being bombed out of there home. Family moves to April Grove, where they become invovled with the war effort. This is a great book, as with other by Ms. Harry the reader feels that they are in the action and the reader is able to feel the emotions of the characters. This book does use characters from other books by Ms. Harry, but does not required the reader to know these character whole story. \\"Under the Apple Tree\\" is a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for any young reader !!!!!!!!!","review":"i fortunately got this book along with the rest of the trilogy for my 4th grade son for christmas. a great move, he blasted thru these books with in 4 months. this is the 2nd of the triology. of the 3 he loved this one the best. wish scott young banged out a couple more. truly timeless, well written books for a young hockey fan. thanx & let's go flyers !!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jester","review":"I saw this book in the supermarket, read the summary in the back and put it down right away....Having just finished \\"1st.

My opinion of this book is if its set in medevil times, written in a way that has a modern tone and you still can picture the country side and characters it has done its job...and it did a dam good one at that :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson must be a jester himself","review":"Not only was this pitiful story filled with annoying inaccuracies, anachronisms and gratuitious violence, but it seems as if written by an adolescent. The story didn't flow well, the main character was repetitive and corny, and everytime the writing started to settle down into *some* semblance of normalcy, he'd ruin it by throwing in some grotesque scene. \\"Oh yeah, it's been 5 pages - must be time for another round of mutilated bodies!\\" It was third rate - at best. I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept without rancor the \\"hey buddy\\" and \\"he's so cute\\" lines.I felt slightly better about The Lake House, but I won't be reading James Patterson again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jester by Pattersen","review":"Reads like a Class B Movie, and has no redeeming value.Much unecessary sick violence and I'm sorry I wasted the money on it. Never buy a book by two authors because they obviously get in each others way as looks like what happened in this book.Too melodramatic. The whole section on the Crusade could have been shortened to one small chapter. Too many silly improbables.My advice: Don't buy it. I'll never buy another book by this author. I will also always be susicious of the great positivereviews........don't you ever report a \\"negative\\" review like this ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Money","review":"Unbelievably BAD. Not worth the paper it is written on. The characters were flat and uninteresting. The plot was unbelievable and undeveloped. And 2-3 page chapters! 2nd grade chapter books are better reads.

The book is set during the First Crusade - about 1100 A.D. - but contains dialogue such as \\"Bug off\\" and \\"I guess I have you to thank for these duds [clothes].\\" The period detail is thin, though not as thin as the characterization. Truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a textbook in \\"Writing 101\\" classes!","review":"Having read this book, whenever anyone describes something as being written \\"like a bad novel\\", you will now understand exactly what the expression means.Had I not known the name of the author, I would have thought this to be the work of a singularly ungifted amateur - possibly in their late teens; if I had to read one more time how something had \\"lanced\\", \\"stabbed\\" or \\"flashed\\" through the main protagonist's body or mind, I think I would throw up.The practice of hack writers hiding behind the huge letters of the name of an established author on the cover (Tom Clancy, you have a lot to answer for) may bring in money for the aforementioned author, but it sullies his reputation as surely as if he had written it all himself, instead of just suggesting the outline premise and laughing all the way to the bank. What a shame that his fans are crying all the way to the trash can.Badly done, Mr. Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Fiction Gone Bad","review":"Pulp romance with beautiful maidens??...an outlaw in the forest whose name is \\"Shorty\\"?? This is the Crusades?? Wait, there's more...one jester to another before a gig, \\"You'll knock em' dead, lad.\\" (Really, on page 183). I threw in the towel on page 296. Two-thirds of the way through and I could not go on.Save your money on this one. There are too many good books out there to waste the time to read a bad one. If you're looking for really good fiction about the Crusades, check out Zoe Oldenbourgh...I read her fiction twenty years ago and remember it still. I won't remember James Patterson past bedtime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this one...","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I've read most of Patterson's novels and this has to be my least favorite. It was completely predictable. There were two reasons I finished the book. One was to find out if my guesses were right, and they were. I was very dissappointed. The other reason was just plain curiosity. I wanted to find out how it ended.Also, I can understand being historically accurate with life during the Middle Ages. However, I had a hard time reading about children being killed and raped. Some parts are even worse. (Did we really need to know what happened to Hugh's son?) If you have kids of your own, be warned this isn't an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea!","review":"While I thought I might be interested in a novel told during the time of the Crusades (I love period fiction), this one just seemed to get annoying. OK, Hugh is a wonderful person, looking for his wife. On a mission. He just caused the death of too many people...people I didn't even have a feel for. Maybe that was the plan! The only thing that held my interest was the Jester's tricks and jokes he played on the high commander. Those insults caused a slight chortle!After reading historical fiction like \\"The Dress Lodger\\" and\\"The Pink and the White\\", this just seemed a lame attempt at trying to tell a story with any credence. Patterson, stick to what you do best. FBI serial killer fiction. This was boring!Passed it on to a friend with a disclaimer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very much like ken folletts --Pillars of the earth","review":"did it seem to you that this book was very much like Ken Folletts , \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"? Of course by far a simplified version. How about the wife situation? Lose one to tragedy but find another quickly. Did'nt that happen in both books? Ken Follett did a much better in depth story about that period of time. In fact I am surprised that Follett's is not a classic. The Jester was not one of Patterson's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book came highly recommeded by a freind. And boy does her taste in books suck.

I wish I could get back that week of my life I spent reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and Shallow, II","review":"I like historical fiction and had at least moderate expectations that this would be an enjoyable story, given Patterson's acclaim. Well, I should have gone to the bookstore and browsed this drippy yarn before purchasing it online. Cardboard cutouts would have more depth than the characters in this story. As for the setting and time period, 10 minutes of internet browsing would give you what this novel offers. The authors have a nerve to suggest they relied on historical research...If Hollywood makes a movie out of this, then plot, character, and scene development need little additional work with this novel in hand. My recommendation? Save the ~$8 and get yourself or a friend a latte or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful!!","review":"This is the first book by James Patterson that I've read.

Don't waste your time with this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful and That's No Jest!","review":"I am a big James Patterson fan and I knew this book was going to be something different, but I never expected it to be so unreadable. I read 50 pages before concluding I had better things to do with my time (luckily, it was a library book!). The book was boring and very violent. I wish that Patterson had given us another Alex Cross book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried something new.... didn't work.","review":"I had high hopes when I saw that James Patterson had tried to branch out and try something new. I expected something along the line of Michael Crichton's \\"Timeline\\" . I was very disappointed. While it was a quick read, I found it to be beneath Patterson's usual quality of writing. The plot definately had potential but I don't think Patterson did it justice.My advice.... skip this one or just borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money II!","review":"In the beginning of the book, a religious artifact is found in the grave of a jester.

Apparently Mr. Paterson and Co. used my 1976 World Book Encyclopedia in preparing this piece of ......historical fiction. The research, if any, could have consisted of no more than looking up \\"Middle Ages\\" and reading the two page World Book explanation. Lovers of historical fiction run and hide, blatant misuse of historical events, military terms, regional dialect, names etc etc. Even if you have absolutely no knowledge of history, the story is so far fetched it borders on the absurd. For the simple minded only, it would make a great blockbuster movie. I wish there was an option to give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"History completely muddled","review":"Avoid this like the plague unless you have a VERY high tolerance for anachronisms.

A waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, yes. Historical? Only as a backdrop.","review":"I picked up this story hoping for historical fiction, that is, insight into another era using a storyline as a tool to stir interest.What I found was --- blah. Predictable storyline, no character development, an egocentric \\"hero,\\" 7th grade bathroom humor lacking any subtlety, and no more insight into history than one gathers as general knowledge through movies.Where is the author that can write a true historical fiction on the middle ages, with the same depth and insight as found with Pearl S Buck and China?

I was attached to the characters throughout the book. The story was interesting and captured my imagination. Gave good insight as to life during the crusades. I learned about the book from a gentleman sitting next to me on a flight. This book is intense and brutal depicting the attrocities and injustices during this period as well as the drastic differences between the highborn and lowborn. It also illustrates the love and devotion and tenderness between people brought about from the struggles in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"What time period does this take place in?","review":"The mood and scene was often interrupted by none period dialouge and vugarities as this super healing hero zoomed from one adventure to another. This story would have faired better if it had been published as a comic book.It reminded me of Kevin Costner playing Robin Hood and sounding as if he was talking to some friends on 42St.The co-authurs should take a cue from, to name just two, Ellis Peters, Simon Hawke. When doing a period piece; stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medieval Skit","review":"I had never read anything before by James Patterson...and based on this book, I never will again! Perhaps his contemporary novels don't grate on the nerves quite so jarringly? I had picked this book up because I'm interested in the Crusades era, and thought that this one sounded interesting from the description and the glowing reviews. What a disappointment. The story is set during the Crusades, but the characters act and speak in contemporary ways. The medieval setting is as shallow and unbelievable as a painted backdrop for a high school skit. The plot barrels along at breakneck speed, so I suppose if you want something quick and diverting to read on an airplane, this might be adequate. However, if you want a fascinating book that immerses you in medieval times with realistic characters...this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"No long dissertation just hope he will get back to what he does best and this isn't it! First Patterson writing I haven't completed and enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, hard to put down","review":"I've read all of Patterson's books.

I read the book straight through in a day, I've read some of his books that have literally taken months for me to get through. I wish he would write more books like this.

On his return from the First Crusade, Hugh De Luc finds his son murdered and his wife kidnapped by a duke. Hugh becomes a jester in the duke's court in hopes of finding his wife. The book does have a few flaws. Throughout the story, the characters' use of language is unnoticeably...modern.

I kept reading it because I've read all of Patterson's books, but this is such a departure, and so badly written, that it was a complete waste of time.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Brain Candy","review":"I'm a loyal Patterson fan, so I bought and read this book without knowing anything about it all. It took me about 3 sessions over 2 days to get through it. Not exactly high literature, but it was very entertaining. A good story and interesting characters made it a real page turner. True, it is quite violent (but not much worse than other Patterson novels), but come on, it's medieval France. What can you expect? That wasn't really a very gentle time or place in.My only complaint, as with most Patterson novels, is the ridiculously short chapters. Sure it makes for an easier read, but the number of one and two page chapters in this book was a bit extreme. I find it disruptive, especially when a single scene that should fill one chapter ends up taking up five or six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good book","review":"This is by far the best \\"feel good book\\" i\\"ve read in a long time.

I labored through the book, skimmed most of it, found it predictable as well as horribly written. I am not a huge fan of historic fiction and decided to read it through the end anyway, to see where it would do. Unfortunately, it went nowhere. The descriptive violence was gross, the story lacked continuity and cohesiveness, and other parts of the story seemed to have been pulled from somewhere else.This book is just not worth reading - read Patterson's other books instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and bloody......","review":"What a disappointment! I found this story highly overrated. It could have been written in a hundred pages. It's simply the same bloody, gorey scene over and over. It's also very predictable.

Patterson needs to stick to his usual genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Give it a 0 if I could","review":"How bad can a book be.....truly bad.

James Patterson is usually one of my favorite authors, but I can only read about so many dead children before I just have to stop. I am only halfway through, but am giving up the ghost. I normally have no problem with any amount of violence or profanity in books, but the gratuitous infanticide and the out-of-place modern-day profanity could have been left out. It still wouldn't have made this enjoyable, but it would have at least been readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Patterson novel","review":"Never having read James Patterson before, and being a devoted fan of good historical fiction, I decided to give The Jester a whirl. Although I liked the short chapters and the plot concepts were good, it severely lacked significant detail and persuasion.

It's set up in France, in the Middle Ages; and tells the story of a peasant who embarks in the Crusades to come back to his house -- burned to the ground; his wife missing. He subsequently becomes a Jester to find her, and get her back.While this was written in the usual fast-paced style. I found the story boring.Maybe this time, Patterson write about a world he doesn't master well. Or the main character is just too plain. I don't know.For example, I bought the book because I was looking to be somehow enchanted by the crusades part. It turns out there was no mystery in it -- just blood and guts. While I was hoping for a real adventure; I ended up reading a story that felt too matter-of-fact.I actually could not finish the book . . . too bad!If you want a fun Patterson book, read this one insteadHoneymoon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I thoroughly enjoy \\"The Jester\\". This was on of those rare books IMO anyway, that grabs your attention from the first sentence and keeps you riveted to the final word.I'm a fan of history and the middle ages and the characters that Mr Patterson and Mr Gross introduce you to in this book are so completely likable, other than the bad guys who you will truly dislike and want to see get their come ppance, you can pick your friends and enemies of today that these characters remind you of.I enjoy stories that are told as fiction but that have much truth interspersed throughout.

It tries to blur the line between history and fiction.

It was a let down for me, especially after Andrew Gross and James Patterson co-authored \\"2nd Chance.\\" In a positive note, the book was very easy reading and the story was easy to follow. In my opinion, this does not fall into the top 5 for James Patterson novels. I love his novels and have read every one of them. This was just a total surprise, kind of like \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,\\" a book which I thouroughly enjoyed.

Violets are Blue was horrible, but The Jester is even worse.I love historical fiction, especially if it is well-researched and authentic. This book is neither. The anachronisms and especially the modern slang make this novel a boring and poorly-written piece. It's never explained how these medieval characters determine how the artifacts they bring back from the Crusades are authentic.

It is only that we cannot see it, at least I cannot.There is not real adventure on this book. The writers seemed to have wrote the book in a week. Because is so fast...But also there is nothing on it that makes me feel any empathy with the characters. They are all grey. Even the villains are boring.All seems so cliche.

I am prompted to write a review because I found it insultingly bad. The writing doesn't even approach a 4th grade level. Each chapter consists of only two or three pages. And there are dime-store romance novels on the market that capture a historic setting better than \\"The Jester.\\" Does \\"What flashed through my mind was...\\" strike you as an authenic phrase coming out of the mouth of a French inn-keeper in the year 1100?If you want a great historic fiction set in the middle ages, you must read Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth.

I was not that worked up about the casual nature with which Patterson and Gross treat the historical realities until I actually finished the book and read the acknowledgements which state that they made 'extreme efforts' to be historically accurate. Puke.The book was pretty weak. I agree with one reviewer who likened it to reading a movie script. It moved along at a brisk if unlikely pace with little character development.I found the characters to be ridiculous. Every commoner has a heart of gold and every noble man is a lecherous jerk? Give me a break. Try to offer some complexity. Please.This book received two stars from me only because if you are looking for a brain dead book to read on vacation this fits the bill.

Well, I should have gone to the bookstore and browsed this drippy yarn before purchasing it online. Cardboard cutouts would have more depth than the characters in this story. As for the setting and time period, 10 minutes of internet browsing would give you what this novel offers. The authors have a nerve to suggest they relied on historical research...If Hollywood makes a movie out of this, then plot, character, and scene development need little additional work with this novel in hand.

The events in the story were too convenient to ring true, from the fate of main character's wife to the family connections of his new love. I have a major complaint with the rescue scene at the end, but won't explain and spoil the ending for you if you intend to read it. If you have read it, ask yourself this--considering Emilie's family connections, would Baldwin really have chosen the action he planned to take? If Anne had wanted to stop him, wouldn't it have been smart to let her family know of his plans???Also, the dialogue makes no attempt whatsoever to be historically accurate.

However, it only took reading the first couple of chapters to get me hooked.This book was great. The detail and insight that Patterson has and his ability to tie facts in with fiction is what makes him a great writer. This book held my attention and anticipation to the very end.

The dust jacket makes this novel sound like a Grail quest mystery and it really isn't. It's a historical drama about the struggles of one man to exact revenge against those that wronged him. The characters were a bit cookie cutterish, the plot was slow, and the ending was very anti-climactic.

It has an honored place on my bookshelf.It taught me two valuable lessons: 1) Tackle your problems instead of running away from them, and 2) The grass is not necessarily greener on the other side.Those two bits of knowledge have stuck with me for many years and led me through many challenging times. Thank you, Dr. Seuss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Dr. Suess' best","review":"After years of quoting from this book to my children I bought it for Christmas this year. This is a great book with a timeless message. We all enjoyed reading it together on Christmas day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated","review":"This Dr. Seuss classic story is underappareciated by readers young and old. The verse is creative and enchanting, and reminiscent of that old stand-by, \\"There's a Wocket In My Pocket\\", with its fantastical inventions.Not to mention, this particular story teaches a valuable lesson about how \\"the grass is always greener on the other side\\".If you're a Seuss fan and haven't checked this one out yet, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a book for children","review":"This book is suitable with adults with its message that \\"the devil you know is better than the one you don't know\\", but for children it is just scary. The protagonist dreams of a better place, where he doesn't get attacked, and on his journey to the mystical place where there are few problems, he runs into more and more problems, some of them being violent, others of abandonment and betrayal and the pictures going with these scenes are scary for children. The ending of the book is not the fulfillment of the dream, but the return to the beginning, to the problems he knows. Maybe from an adult perspective it makes sense to tackle the problems at hand rather than to dream of escape, but children need the mystical place and a happy ending, which this book certainly doesn't have. The last picture is one of violence.I usually like Dr. Seuss books, but this book got ruined by the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"book condition","review":"This is my most favorite Seuss book.

The colors are dark, so be careful in when you order. It helps make the balding look not so bad. It's a coverup, that's all it is, but it can make you feel a lot better about your hair. I wish I had found this sooner.Any questions about my experience with this please feel free to email me @ FSUBIGDOGS@aol.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 40 something dollars.","review":"I used Couvre for years which is a paste in a tube. Dermatch is a dry disc. You wet the applicator and rub it on the disc. The small applicator makes it difficult to get good coverage. I found if you use foam wedges that you can get at any makeup counter they provide better coverage. Couvre provides such a wedge. I wanted to try Dermatch because of some of the good reviews and the fact it should last 6 months or more. The Couvre lasts me maybe 2 months but is much cheaper also. I'll use the Dermatch in a pinch when I'm out of my other product but won't spend the 40 plus dollars on it ever again. In my opinion it's not worth the price for the coverage it provides. Also when my hair dries it's a little lighter where the Dermatch got onto my hair providing a slight difference in color from the covered area and non covered area. I really don't care for that feature. The paste Couvre does not do that. I'll stick with my old standby. No more Dermatch for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!!!","review":"This is an amazing way to work magic on your hair. It is near effortless and not messy at all. I wish I had known about this much sooner. My preference has always been to dry my hair without using the hairdryer or any styling products. This makes it easy and possible for me. I just apply it according to instruction, comb my hair through and let it dry naturally. It gives me alot of volume that lasts for days. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it can make your hair very dry and tangled up. However, this is easily managed by rubbing some oil to the ends of your hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers Gaping Parts and Greys","review":"I bought this product because I have an annoying gaping part on the back of my head that looks like a bald spot. I wear clip in hair extensions to make my hair look fuller, and sometimes the extensions would become visible because of my cowlick. This products works great for covering up the part, and the extensions remain unseen after I use it. I also use it to keep the grey hairs that grow in at my temples dark in-between dye jobs. The product is messy, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy. The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it leaves your hair feeling gunky where it's applied, and small amounts will rub off throughout the day if you fuss with it. It looks totally natural however; nobody would ever know that I use it. Admittedly I'm not trying to cover large bald spots, but for the dime-sized gaping part, it's the perfect product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like shoe polish","review":"Have you ever seen those bald guys that try to cover up a spot with makeup and it looks really fake...well this is what that reminded me of.

Then came the real deal with Bombshelter videos which only aired at midnight once a week.Don't get me wrong, it would be great if Mega-Media stations like MTV and VH1 aired punk videos, but get real! To this day you only have watered down, fully cooked, pop-hybrid cheese bands like Good Charlotte, Blink-182, and Sum-41 - and there is little doubt that things are not going to change for the better anytime soon.However, we can all thank The Faction for their raw, hardcore, and downright pure American punk rock sound.

I can play the DVD on another, older DVD player, but apparently some Blu-Ray machines, plus PS3 machines will not play these Cinavia movies. There is no way to know if your Blu-Ray player will play a Cinavia-protected movie until you shell out your money, open it up and try to play it.

No one really mentioned story or characterization in six pages of interviews. So I went in expecting a thin story and a fun ride. little did I know it was a ride to Hades by way of the river Crap.

I'm accustomed to the practice of combining characters and events to shorten a story to fit into a film's time frame. But, this film (and it's sequel) went beyond saving time. They couldn't even get Pegasus right. Perhaps they should have taken a look at the Harry Hamlin film as a reference. Pegasus is the name of a single flying horse, not a type of animal. The writers must have been D&D players who also didn't know the difference. Next time I want to watch the story I'll watch the 1981 version. It's fun with fewer distractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrath of Watching a Bomb","review":"I was terribly disappointed, shocked in fact that this sequel with its star cast could be so awful.

Did the first movie even generate enough boxoffice to greenlight this kind of rehash project? The single-daddy demigod bit is laughable from the get go, but there's plenty of body-slamming action and noise pollution to keep you from nodding off. Worthington hasn't the presence to carry a peplum potboiler like this, while Neeson, Fiennes and Nighy are compellingly wasted.

This movie was fun.That's really all there is to it. Yes, it's steeped in mythology, and it might not follow these stories in a 100% accurate fashion. But it doesn't matter. This is an action packed ride that has you watching chimeras, cyclopses, and gods trying to stop one man. Think of it as God of War on a much smaller scale. Go into this movie expecting nothing more than a fun ride, and you will enjoy it. Also, if you saw the first movie and were disappointed, still give this one a shot. I almost passed this one up since I thought the first movie was a bore. I'm glad I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part 2 of Clash of the Titans","review":"If you love mythology and Sam Worthington, then you are in luck.

This film addresses a lot of those problems, trims the fat off while maintaining something for the humans to fight for (sons) and limits the bad stuff enough to be entertaining throughout. The star though is the outstanding CG, which I think owes more than a little bit to the God of War cutscenes that came before it. Another smart move was giving Worthington's Perseus character help in the form of better comic relief, which reduces the amount of straining he has to do to show warmth to the audience.I thought it would be bad but this will probably end up as one of the more rewatchable blu-rays in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accomplished it's task.","review":"The movie's goal was to create a vehicle for awesome special effects.

The special effects are very well done and the sound on the blu ray is very rich and full. The high definition picture quality is also very crisp and clear.

The garden's lessons give the granddaughter strength when illness strikes Grandpa, and a special joy when he can return for their Saturday gardening together again.

Highly recommended for ages 4 to 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray Blacklisted?","review":"I have a simple question. Why is this movie not available on blu-ray? It includes a first rate cast, exceptional acting and plot development and a message that crosses racial boundaries. I also note that the Amazon description fails to list the names of any of the central cast. Guess they all look alike so just throw in any name or two. Well worth owning despite the numerous slights. It's a hell of lot better than a good number of movies of this circa which have made their way on to blu-ray.

It is a classic that you can watch over and over again.This movie takes place in the time spand of one very intense weekend.The Best Man is about a group of six old college friends that come together for a wedding. Harper (Taye Diggs) has written a unpublished book that is partly fiction but incorporates true events that happen between the group of friends. One of Harper's friends, Jordan,is a big time TV producer and has access to a copy of Harper's book. BecauseJordan lets some of the friends see Harper's book some secrets are revealed that have a major impact on the entire weekend.There are some really great characters in this movie as well as some really cute guys.

This is by no doubt the best black film ever made! I laughed hard, cried hard, and completely enjoyed the superb performances by all of the actors and actresses. And of course I can't forget to mention the pulsating music. My advice: buy the movie and the soundtrack. Both are classics.

I am very impressed with the selection of the cast. Couldn't have picked a better one myself. Taye, Morris, and the others did an outstanding job, one that I'll gladly applaud, but I must admit that Terrence Howard was the \\"Best\\" man in this movie. He had this mysterious perception thing going that got everyone he talked to thinking. His \\"are you sure about that\\" and \\"it's carma\\" attitude caused even the most positive person to doubt what was true. There was a certain deepness about his character that kept everyone one edge. Then at the end the man showed out on the dance floor. It was \\"ELECTRIFYING\\" what he did to the electric slide. The movie was off the hook, and my applaud goes out to the producers who saw that Terrence \\"Quentin Spivey\\" Howard had what it took to be the \\"BEST MAN\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The movie is great. The was no leading man or woman, every had an equal role (despite the top billing of Taye Diggs and Nia Long).

Though the cast was of African American actors, this is movie for all ethnic backrounds.It tells of a group of college friends that reunite for a wedding, but the wedding itself is not the story, its a semi-ficticious book written by one of the friends. Why is the book so paramount? Its actually a true account of events that had occurred between the friends when enrolled in college. The movie also gives an accurate depiction of quality of the up and coming African Americans in the entertainment industry. Everyone did a masterful job! I could not imagine anyone else playing in their roles. The directing was great and the ending was expected but moving.

If you want a toy that builds your child's fine motor and problem solving skills, this is not the toy for you. If you just want an ark to do some Bible-knowledge building, I suppose this would work, but for my money, I'd say there are better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a shape sorter","review":"This is a very solidly made toy, but as for being a shape sorter...it's a joke. You can drop the pieces through virtually any hole and once it's unpackaged it has so many animal shaped cut-outs that it basically resembles a puzzle with numerous missing pieces. The only use my 2-year old has for this toy is dumping out the animal pieces and spreading them all over the house. I regret the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed.","review":"I purchased this for my 2 year old twins that love their little plastic shape sorter. I was quickly drawn to it because it was Noah's Ark themed and looked like it would be tons of fun for the kids. I am also a big fan of Melissa & Doug products.They excitedly opened the box and took all the animals out. The proceeded to pickup each animal piece and drop them one by one through the *same* hole. You see, this is not like the shape sorters from years ago where each piece will only fit into one hole...when turned to the side the pieces will fit in any hole. It wasn't a challenge and they weren't interested in playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for matching","review":"Got this toy for my 14 month old daughter last Christmas and she still plays with it now, a year later. The animal 'drawings' are fun and cute, and though at 14 months she couldn't be bothered to find the right opening for each animal, now that she is a little older she has fun trying to figure out which hole is for what piece. My only negative about this toy is that because the holes on the bottom are so big, pieces can fall out easily, but that hasn't been a really big issue. It also got damaged during a trip between Chicago and Seattle but it wasn't in the original packaging at that point so it isn't really M&D's fault. Overall I like this toy a lot, my daughter has had a lot of fun trying to find the animal matches and making all the sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas and he loved it. He plays with the animals all the time. The pieces are very sturdy , colorful and well made. I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ambient","review":"I bought this after listening to a sample of it. I am one of those ambient music lovers who dislike any hint of a beat in my music. Even chill downtempo music is too busy for me. Yes, I like it slow and moody. Once I find a sound that I like, I want it to change rarely and when it does, I want the changes to be subtle and to happen at a glacial pace. People who like ambient music tend to enjoy contemplative activities - stargazing, writing, painting, meditating, zoning out, daydreaming, sleep/dreaming, etc. The first piece on this album is wonderful for these types of activities. Indeed, it justifies my purchase in and of itself. The third piece wwould have been better without the synthesized thunder - I find it an unecessary disruption in an otherwise good piece. Overall: 9/10. Steve Roach fans will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I shopped a long time before deciding on this video.

But I wouldnt pay to see it again....>:D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Movie 4","review":"If you have seen and enjoyed the previous three movies in the \\"Scary Movie\\" series, number four will not disappoint. Borrowing heavily from \\"War of the Worlds\\", \\"The Grudge\\", and \\"The Village\\", with other movies and Tom Cruise's craziness thrown in, \\"Scary Movie 4\\" is one of the better installments in the series.Back again are Anna Faris and Regina Hall, mainstays in the franchise. Death in a previous installment does not even hinder their return. They do what they did before with the safe effectiveness. Added to the mix is Craig Bierko, who channels his inner Tom Cruise to be the leading man. David Zucker (of \\"Airplane\\" fame) is back again in the director's chair, and he continues to throw jokes and gags at the viewer until they cannot help but laugh. There is not much more that can be said about this movie. If you like this type of spoof movie, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"9/11 \\"Humor\\" Spoiled the \\"Fun\\"","review":"OK. The start with Dr. Phil and Shaq set the stupid but mildly funny tone. These celebs were obviously laughing at themselves. But movie was unwatchable after the very weird and creepy and not funny scenes with Leslie Neilson referring to President George W. Bush and the most horrible day in America in recent memory. Sorry. Turned it off at this point. Don't buy or watch this movie, because it is not worth the nausea you will feel at the attempt to make a political dig in the most inappropriate way possible. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just have no sense of humor.","review":"Well, the good part is you gotta love Anna Faris. She plays the ditz with such sincerity...Great. But this movie...not funny.

It really hit the mark and I thought the formula would be easy to follow with subsequent sequels. But thats not been the case. The second Scary Movie was painfully bad. Just terrible with no laughs at all. The third was slightly better but still disappointing. Now the fourth installment has been released and is another disppointmeent. I think its safe to say that the series is horribly stale and the Scary Movie franchise should be put out of its misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!!!","review":"The Scary Movie series has gotten very childish, but it's still funny. It spoofs films such as Saw, The Village, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, and War of the Worlds. After Tom Logan commits suicide, Cindy Campbell gets a job helping an elderly woman. She slowly begins falling for her new neighbor, Tom Ryan. When aliens that look like the puppet from Saw begin attacking earth, Cindy and Tom split and hope to find each other again. On her journey, Cindy runs into her best friend, Brenda. Together, they try to figure out what Toshio from The Grudge has to do with the aliens, and why they're attacking.

It paradys the films The Grudge, War of the Worlds, the Village, Saw, and a little bit of Brokeback Mountain. I thought the story was WAY too complex. Its more like they try to cram every scary movie into the movie anyway they can. Probally my never watching the Grudge, Saw, or the Village helped me not understand the story.

Lord help us all. This movie was boring, and if anything, far too long. The Wayans brothers did such a good job with the first two films, but whoever has taken over for 3-4 has completely gotten the movies off track. When the Wayans were in charge, the movies were crude, disgusting, and laugh out loud funny. Now the films are stupid, childish, and completely unfunny. How can anyone find someone getting hit and knocked down funny when it happens 5 times in a row? Seriously people, it's not funny at all. It's like a group of over zealous 4th graders got together and wrote a movie script and this is what happened. The jokes are all 4th grade mentality - unfunny, uninspired, and completely unaware that no one, besides them, are getting any joy out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Mitsubishi Kimono Saki Fujitsu'","review":"With Good Friday off, my boyfriend and I headed to the local mega-plex for a matinee show (still $6.50!) for Scary Movie 4.

Chris Elliot is hilarious as the 'Village' idiot and Bierko's spin on Tom Cruise's couch antics is spot on! Yeah, so there's some potty humor, get over it!

But the level of stupidity was much higher than I had hoped it would be, and after a while I could feel my brain cells dying by the hundreds. I eventually walked out of the room to read a book and try to regain some of my lost time and intelligence.

I will never see another one of these atrocities again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did find this to be the best of the series...","review":"There were some gags that didn't hit home but nothing to drag the whole movie down. This is the most visually interesting and ambitious one and as far as I'm concerned the 4th time was the charm. IN this case the gratuitous bits, like the Oprah interview at the end, actually worked great and showed a growing confidence in the material, although I wouldn't mind if they stopped while they were ahead (which, of course, they didn't)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Scary or Funny","review":"I had hoped that this would be funny like the first 3 Scary Movies, but sadly it was not. I watched it twice to make sure I hadn't just been in an unfunny mood, but unfortunately, it seems like they were really pushing the comedy, and tried too hard. I would wholeheartedly recommend the first three in the series, but I would NOT Recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More slapstick than satire","review":"The \\"Scary Movie\\" series was always good for a laugh, but after three sequels the writers and creative directors seem to have worn out the plot.

Yeah, I'm not a fan of the potty humor (the scene with the old woman getting the sponge bath), or homophobic jokes (Brokeback Mountain parody), some of this film had some amusing bits. Tom on the Winfrey show. The Michael Jackson 'cameo' when the Tripods are attacking, the scene where \\"Tom\\" is trying to take the minivan.Other scenes were just lame. (The beginning Saw scene), The scene in the Village.I really can't see rating this film any more than 2 stars. It was Trash TV. But some of the scenes were well done, and I thought the actors: particularly the Tom character and his daughter (dead ringer for the kid in the actual movie), did an excellent job.Recommend this film for adults only. Too much sex and potty humor for the kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty scary...NOT!","review":"Well, I need to say. I have not seen even one of the movies this movie spoofs. Not one. I pretty much stopped seeing all the \\"flavor of the month\\" scary movies. I'm just really sick of them. Kind of funny they also spoofed \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" as that was not a scary movie, right?Any who, I rented this, because I thought it got two thumbs up, but that was my mistake.I won't write a novel on this one, as I don't think its worth my time. Suffice it to say, it was short enough that I didn't get too bored. I thought the \\"cameo\\" scenes were fairly entertaining. I loved the goofiness of it. But something is missing from the originals. Something, maybe the \\"campy\\" humor? Not sure.I did enjoy the scene where all the country's nationals were running around without clothes.

She gets kidnapped(SAW), finds a new town(THE VILLAGE) and tries to escape aliens. But brings no comedy out of this one.I do recommend you to see it, but I must warn you.

I was like totally looking forward to seeing this flick and then afterwards I had the feeling that I had been cheated. Scary Movie 1, 2 and 3 are amazing movies (especially part 2) and are filled with classic scenes. This one does not meet this high criteria at all. To include movies like war of the worlds is also inane since War of the Worlds is not a horror movie at all. The inclusion of spoofs on The Grudge is brilliant and overall I have to give this movie 2 stars since it unfortunately does not deliver the goods like the previous 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Personal Cindy...","review":"Unlike the first three movies this one is not laughable. I could describe this movie as a follow-up of the third film with some references of the last film and cameos of the people that were in the last movie.The movie is making fun of \\"The Grudge\\" and \\"War of the Worlds\\". Unlike the third movie you will NOT laugh in this movie you will rarely find something to laugh at because all of the \\"jokes\\" they throw in feels rushed by the directors and the producers. Also some of them are cheesy or copycat of the first films. I didn't find it funny at all. Some of them are exaggerated as well just to make you \\"laugh\\" but I can say that I liked Anna Farris's performance is as good as the first three films and the come back of Brenda is funny. But the movie is not laughable you will see this movie as a cheap comedy you better rent the first three films because this one is not even close.Make yourself a favour and don't even rent it ok?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked.","review":"Just saw this in the theatre a couple of days ago, and this was a waste of my time and 99 cents.This movie is not very funny at all. As others have already mentioned, everything just appeared rushed. The jokes weren't that funny and it seems that all that the movie focused one was trying to gross out the audience more than trying to make them laugh. When something funny DID happen it was like everyone else in the in audience was waiting on someone else to laugh first. It appeared everyone felt uncomfortable being in the theatre; scared to laugh at jokes that really weren't that funny.The storyline made no sense, it just jumped around all over the place and was very hard to follow. You don't expect much of a storyline in these types of movies anyway, but in any case they should be at least easy to follow...this movie wasn't.This movie was clearly rushed and not very funny at all.

Our hero, or anti-hero, Michael is a Vietnam Veteran on a mission to rid the world of \\"scumbags\\". In his pursuit of justice he survives tougher battles than he had faced in Vietnam, but manages to always come out on top.Though a little preachy in places on the plight of disabled veterans, Mr. Latham had served his country honorably in Vietnam, was wounded and a decorated Marine.

His attitude is described metaphorically as \\"skating on thin ice\\". In this novel, Mason did not only skate but made several somersaults on thin ice. I just applauded that. But Mason's spectacular stunt is not limited to this novel.

If you want to see a movie with astounding special effetcs and a funny story this is the movie for you. Also it doesn't have the usual \\"save the princess and the world\\"-story attached to it, wich in this case is a good thing. Dennis Quaid is brilliant in the role of a honourable (!) dragonslayer, and Sean Connery as the voice of the dragon -bloody marvellous. Along with Braveheart this is the best historic/fantasy movie i've ever seen.BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good medieval action.","review":"A dragon talking (and looking at times) like Sean Connery in Entrapment seems a bit ludicrous, but it works. Dennis Quaid as the wandering knight does a good job, but the dragon steals the show. The camerawork is spectacular, especially in widescreen and Dragonheart has a good score. The one thing that was lacking was the relationship between many of the characters. I don't say it often, but this movie could have been a bit longer to work the personalities out. Even so, it is a great show, with plenty of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I first saw this movie in theaters back in 96' and thought it was terrific!

Although I like Quaid and Connery, their performances (really, the way the characters were written) were cheesy and overdone. The plot was bad and predictable, but the effects, namely Draco, were well done. the only reason I've watched this more than once is Jason Isaacs. His performance as Lord Felton, though forgettable due to the extremely small role of the character who could really be left out, is amazing. I didn't recognize him until I knew that he was in it, and it is totally different from any of his other roles. He's pathetic really, with the high voice, sleazy smile, and general creepiness. If you want to see a brilliant performance, watch for Isaacs-he provides the only grade A character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think All Dogs go to Heaven","review":"After watching this movie once some years ago, I developed a dislike for it. I cried too many time seeing that movie - too much like All Dogs Go to Heaven and Old Yeller in which an animal gave it life to protect a human. Yes for all its intellection and wits, the dragon is treated much like an animal - the kind that guards its human from dangers - after all, the dragon gave its heart to a sick noble then just stood there until the hero of the movie kill the noble for his evil deeds and die along with the evil noble instead of killing the noble himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DTS disk didn't work in DTS mode.","review":"After several attempts, this disk only plays in 2 channel stereo.

I seen this movie in the theater with my wife and kids and we loved it. It has the right mix of drama and humor. Never too dull and never too scary, my youngest absolutely loved Draco. When I got my DVD player it was my first choice because of the DTS encoded sound, this brought the sounds of battle and the beating wings of Draco the dragon into our home just like what we experienced sitting in the theater. Great movie for the family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventures in a magic world!","review":"Esta película no es mas que una bonita historia de fantasía y aventuras, que deja un muy buen sabor de boca a todo aquel que le guste soñar con criaturas salvajes,héroes,espadas,batallas,brujería,buenos y malos...Es cierto que la presencia del dragón perfectamente recreada, atraiga más al público, pero lo que se debe tener más en cuenta son los ideales plasmados(honor,bondad,justicia,amistad,amor,valentía...), los cuales forman positivamente a la persona. Este moderno largometraje se abstiene de sexo duro y de violencia extrema, dos temas totalmrnte innecesarios en una historia que invita a tener buena personalidad."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it, and you will believe!","review":"For anyone who has ever dreamed of doing something great, for anyone who longs to be a hero, this is the movie for you. A grand story that tells the tale of a disillusioned knight whose hopes for the old ways of honor have been dashed when his ward, a dying prince, is \\"corrupted\\" by a Dragon who gave half of his own heart to keep the boy alive. But he finds that the Dragon is not to be blamed; on the contrary, he is a true hero!Even if the plot does not entice you, the Dragon alone is reason enough to see it. He is the world's first virtual actor, the Dragonic embodiment of Sean Connery's wit, honor, and delightful voice. Draco, the Dragon, captured my heart and held it in thrall, from the time I first saw it six years ago. This is the greatest movie ever made.

David Thewlis plays a very nasty, horribly tempered king, as he slices and dices his kingdom to tatters. Hoping to save his life, his mother asks for help from the dragon....and of course, the king recovers. He gets part of the dragon heart. Rather than being grateful, his temper is worse and he wants to kill the dragon.All in all, for an older film, it plays to the viewer with all the hope and heart it can muster.

When a young prince is dying the people ask a dragon (Draco) to save him. Draco reluctantly gives him a piece of his heart to save his life. Draco makes the prince swear that he will not be like his father. Draco was reluctant because he did detect some evil in the boy. When the boy turns out to be bad like his father Bowen, played by Dennis Quaid, blames the dragon and swears to kill all dragon's. Draco then becomes the last surving dragon. Draco tells Bowen that his heart did not corrupt the boy and that the evil was in him. Bowen has to kill Draco because as long as he is alive the prince cannot die.This is a simple story of good vs evil. Fantasy movies tend to be mindless bloodbaths. For a fantasy movie it is quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will bring the heart out in you!","review":"I don't know about you guys,but I difinitly belive!

The DVD features are second to none. The disk includes the complete \\"making of\\" documentary showing early scenes using a mechanical dragon before the digital animations were used.

This album is more metal than their later stuff but you can still hear the Rage Against the Machine influenced rapping and of course their great harmony vocals. Highlights include \\"Sweet Carribean Bungalow\\", \\"Monsters\\", \\"Mother\\" and \\"Blue\\" (my favorite PM song).Also included is a great song \\"Rednose\\" that never made it to any album.

Its still one of my most favorite albums from the area. The music, the lyrics, the harmonies, the whole album is awesome. Its a shame this one doesn't even touch the greatness of that one. Most Pushmonkey fans will probably be upset with what I said and I'm sure seeing them live would make you enjoy it more. I recommend giving that album a listen first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reagan-Gomez Preston was Fab and This Movie Was A+","review":"I admit I am not a big fan of DMX movies, but this movie is truly excellent. The acting was great. DMX shined as King David because of his grimey rap lyrics he was very believable as the dirty shady character. The character that impressed me the most was the acting by Reagan Gomez-Preston. She has played such goody-goody roles in the past I never imagined that she could so convincingly play a dramatic role but she was a scene stealer. Michael Ealy and David Arquette were great too, as was the storyline. It looks like the movie was shot on film and didn't make the transition to DVD that great, it seemed grainy and dark in parts but I loved this movie, although it was a bit violent for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the book you'll like the movie","review":"I read the book Never die alone and it was nice to see it as a motion picture. If your not a fan of Donald goins or DMX then you may not like it, but over all it was a decent movie. Remeber DMX is a rapper not a actor so it's unfair to judge him on the same standards as you would a Densel Washington or Morgan Freeman. DMX does a good job of depicting King. It won't win any oscars, but worth renting when it comes out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage!","review":"My god this movie is so bad that I'd rather get a root canal than watch it. DMX shouldn't have even taken this role. It wasn't worth it for him. This movie was disturbing and off-key. I mean it was disturbing how Reagan Preston-Gomez's character got corrupted in this movie and I felt she just got type-casted and so did Michael Ealy. This is the movie that he chooses after The Barbershops? Oh man! I saw no relevance to having that soap opera star involved with X. That aspect could of been done away with. Everybody involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. No offense X! Ernest R. Dickerson, the man who brought us Juice, really shot a blank with this. I hope he rebounds to direct a better movie than this. And don't even put this movie in the same class as Empire. Empire flows way better and the plot was on cue.

The Silverstone case I bought (despite being excellent in every other regard) has sub-par fans that were too noisy for my taste. I've had good results with Cooler Master fans before, and so this one being inexpensive and rated as relatively quiet, I bought a few. The fan is well designed, and pushes a good amount of air for an 80mm fan. However, it is not as quiet as I would have liked. My fan connections are direct to a molex connector, so I didn't have the option of using the bios to slow down the fan speed. I ended up buying a fan speed controller and setting it to 50% power.

Listen to just \\"Antisocial\\", or \\"Now it's Dark\\". Really pretty good songs, taken one by one. As an album, however, it just all tends to blur together into a bombastic wall of fuzzy grit... and not in a good way.Still very worth a listen, and worh owning. Easily picked up used in local used CD exchange type stores... which also shows how well it's stood the test of time for repeated listening over the years.

Unlike the first Flicka, this movie is less about a horse and more about taming a girl, transforming her from an independent and skillful young woman into a subservient and obedient child. The Dad even talks about disciplining her being like taming a horse to ride, breaking its spirit. If this is the message you want to send to your daughters, fine. You will like the movie.

There are other girl-horse movies out there that do not do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Flicka flick--read book instead!","review":"My 11 year old horse-crazy daughter disliked this movie, and so did I. It's not just that they swapped a headstrong teenage girl for the book's original young, quiet, sensitive boy. We both just thought the girl in the movie was a horrible, spoiled, annoying, selfish brat. We couldn't abide her and so no amount of pretty horses could make up for her one-dimensional character. The book is so lovely, so nuanced--it's a gem that wasn't even adequately portrayed by the 1940s \\"classic\\" version of the story.

It is along the same lines, but not as good as the previous volumes. Each of the previous volumes had about five stories a piece and the stories were color coded. The children love to flip to the title page to pick a color of story they want you to read. This particular book does not have that option, all of the type is in black, but it does still have five stories.

I was not really into Miley's Hannah Montana music set but I really enjoyed her set as herself with songs such as See you again & I miss you which is just a fantastic song. It's nice to see a young girl sing a song like that with such passion but I guess with a great singing father like Billy Ray Cyrus the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.

However, I was SO SO SO dissapointed at the 3D graphics. Nothing appeared to be 3D and trust me I spent an hour trying to convince myself that I was seeing something in 3D. It all appeared blurry even with the glasses on! The one I purchased was the regular DVD not Blu-Ray and I read a review on here that says the Blu-Ray one was excellent. I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I'm tempted to go buy one so that I can experience this concert in true 3D fashion. But again, it's completely worth purchasing the 2D version but you'll be dissapointed if you buy the 3D DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannah Rocks out","review":"I love this DVD and will be watching it loads of times.

My kids get headaches watching the 3D version on TV, but are just as excited watching it with it off. If your kids have any affection for Hannah Montana they will love this. As much as I hate to promote the commercialism of Hannah Montana, the reality is there are many negative influences out there in the entertainment world and Hannah is good, clean entertainment. The dance beat behind the songs really generate excitement with the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to program","review":"I found this timer difficult to program and when I wanted to operate a single valve by itself it wanted to run all the valves it was grouped with on the timer (A,B, or C).

Then came the riots in the 60's and the flight to the suburbs, which we all made. It has remained. Whites and blacks have gone further and further out, some driving up to forty miles to work in Detroit. It is not as much a race thing as disrespect from black and whites in the city. There is not respect for the law, elderly or even themselves. In turn this is where all our large citys are failing.The drug dealers run the citys and it is in plain view.

However, there is a high probability that users like me who leave the lock at work will unlock their iPods and leave the lock on their desks where anyone with access can view it.

Right and once he is finished and presumable tired and ready to sleep what about her?Another disappointment was the brevity in foreplay. Seriously? What woman Christian or otherwise can appreciate such a lack of consideration? The skin is a human largest organ and largest sexual organ and so little was mentioned in regards to taking time with a slow pleasing touch.Finally the complete lack of acknowledgment of the existence of the G-spot.

I would have skipped that chapter since I have no interest in being a parent. But something prompted me to read it. I found a condemnation of the childfree lifestyle. Apparently, the authors have no familiarity with childfree issues. Nor did they seem to have much understanding and sympathy for those who would like to have children, but are physically unable to do so. The authors also do not acknowledge that women's roles have expanded since the early 20th century. The idea that most married women are or will be stay-at-home moms is not reality.

There's never a dull moment in this novel. From love to jealously to murder, the author's uncanny flair for creating unputdownable escapist entertainment shines through.

TMJ are just a group of old men with a lot of time on their hands, thinking they represented a pioneering moment when alternative music reigned. Unfortunately it was groups like TMJ that belly flopped the entire indie-alternative movement head first into the sewage.This album only works for TMJ's core following. Like a cop at a crime scene; go on your way people, there's nothing to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have You Seen Her: Their Greatest Hits","review":"To any and all \\"true\\" Chi-Lites or Eugene Record fans,This album containing the phase of greatest hits or best of... in its title should not be used because it is misleading. This album in particular although contain a few solid hits does not do the group justice. This album is only but a sparkle of the real brilliance of what the Chi-Lites have to offer. Please, please, please, consider the \\"Too Good To Be Forgotten\\" BOX collaboration as your only option. This BOX collection really and truly defines the superb talents of Eugene Record and the group. There are so many vintage songs that only could be found on LP's, but now can be appreciated again on CD.Do not sell yourself short.......Get the real deal! You will thank me for it, but more importantly you will THANK YOURSELF for doing the right thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"have you seen her: Their Greatest Hits","review":"This album is a collection of some very bad re-recordings of their hits. Save your money and your ears by staying for away from this album. The Chi-Lites are one of the great soul groups of the 70s and if you want to hear the true recordings of all their hits, you have to get their BRUNSWICK recordings. All their hits were on Brunswick and the quality is out of this world. The CHI-LITES 20 GREATEST HITS is the album I would recomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertisement","review":"I wanted to read the gospel in Spanish to increase my vocabulary from the best source available. Despite the title, the gospel is not present in this book. It is basically a Mormon's guide to preaching in Spanish. Absolutely useless for me. I am really angry at the seller and the author of the book who so audaciously calls his little pamphlet \\"The Gospel\\". The subtitle of the book is \\"A Glossary of Vocabulary and Expressions For Use in a Latter-Day Saint Church Setting\\". These words were nowhere present on the page when I bought it. I don't know who is responsible, but I would expect a little more honesty when dealing with the Gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dummy Friendly","review":"This book stinks. It lacks entire regions of France. For example, it omits the Dordogne, which is a large, economical for the traveler, region of beautiful countryside replete with prehistoric cave art and medieval castles. There are no photographs. Descriptions of lodgings are few and good budget lodgings nearly nonexistent. Despite having such little information, the book is large, thick, and heavy. This is not a book to carry around with you during your travels. I'm not sure who this book is designed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be!","review":"My wife and I first visited France in 2007 and again this year...didn't even bother with the book this year. Limited in geographic coverage, and not nearly as useful as one of Rick Steve's guides.Long on authors' opinions and short on details that are really useful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"What marks a classic? Maybe its the extra tracks? I remember this album the first time around when the UK's Sunday Times described Steve Ashley as the greatest songwriter in the country. Bit strong but it measured the strength of feeling at the time. This album got great reviews in the 70s and so has this reissue. He was an accomplished writer of music and lyric and Stroll On is probably his finest hour (at least so far as I see another album is on the way). I think this is an even better record as they have located extra tracks from the recording sessions. Check out the quality of these - most extra tracks are the dreck that didn't and couldn't fit. Not so Ashley's for Stroll On - they are gems. Recommended for collectors of English folk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best way to learn embryology...","review":"This book had the BEST pictures. In fact, just this year our veterinary school switched the required text from Langman's Medical Embryology (a very human-centered book) to Before We Are Born.I think the best way to learn about how the embryo develops is to actually see things happening...a professor can say \\"then the dermatomes extend out from the somites...\\" but it really doesn't mean much unless you can SEE it. Before We Are Born really does this well, taking a step-by-step approach to learning the processes of developmental biology. The illustrations are clear, and they try to make them as 3-D looking as possible.If you're taking a developmental biology or embryology course, you NEED this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive...yes... Dense? VERY!","review":"For those who have taken embryology in undergrad and are in medical school, this book is fantasitc. For the rest of us, this book is dense and quite hard to read through. Clinical correlation are somewhat good.While this text is very thin, it is very very dense. I would recommend Langemans instead, that is just a personal preference. This text was standard at my medical school though."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"Not a bad deal for five suitcases of varying sizes. Good for a college student.

I must admit that the product instructions state that the bag is designed for surface use only, although it says that it is supposed to be good to 10 or 12 feet depth, if I recall correctly. (I found one website that reported it to be good to 60 feet!) In truth, this product leaks if you dive. I used it for surface wave riding in the ocean and had no problem. However, I dove in shallow reefs while snorkeling and it leaked, destroying my iPhone and new $80 camera. I was extremely disappointed at the loss to say the least!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well","review":"We bought two bags, thinking it would be hard to fit passport and wallet in one. We only needed one and it fit our keys to the locker rooms, passport, engagement ring and a men's wallet while we floated in the Dead Sea. It worked well, no water leaked inside and it really didn't get in the way. I wore it around my waist, bearly knew it was there. It is a bit more tricky trying to get the men's wallet out of the bag due to limited opening. I recommend this for use at beaches or pools where you are a bit worried about losing important things, even a compact camera can fit in there! I gave it four stars cuz it was a bit hard to get dead sea mud off the strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not water-tight!","review":"Upon receiving the pouch, I was able to inspect the design of the closure more closely, it did not look like it would be water-tight to me, but perhaps I was too trusting after reading all the positive reviews... I purchased this pack specifically for our Hawaii vacation, so on the first day of our trip, I put my cell phone and my camera in the pack, made sure it was locked closed. However, within 20 minutes of playing in the shallow waters on the beach, the pouch was filled with sea water. Of course, my cell phone was instantly ruined. This purchase turned out to be a very costly one for me. On the bright side, my other new purchase - Kodak C123 waterproof camera that was also in the pouch, was not damaged, so that item definitely does what it claims. Please be careful when using this pack; I should've just taken my chances with leaving the phone on the beach under my towels instead of using this pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy!","review":"Took it to Hawaii for a vacation. During snorkeling I had my passport in a ziplock bag and then in this waterproof pack but still it was ruined. This pack isn't waterproof. I would suggest taking additional measures before taking your valuables into the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry as a bone and just the right size","review":"I used this to carry my essentials while snorkeling in the Gulf of Mexico. The size is large enough to hold my Blacbberry Curve, a pack of smokes, room key and some money without any stuffing. It works very well. The belt that comes with the bag does NOT have attachment points other than the small clip which is included. I recommend lacing the strop through the clip and then placing the belt just under the yellow plastic lip and then around your waist. In high underwater currents, it just keeps it more secure. I highly recommend this little bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"not waterproof","review":"This bag is not waterproof. Not quite sure how the people in the reviews i read used thiers, but we took it snorkling and it was full of water after 1 1/2 hours. Glad we didn't put anything that could have been ruined! just money and credit card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets in water","review":"I would not recommend this product. I bought it because it was advertised as suitable for snorkeling but the first time I used it it let in water. Fortunately I had put the contents in a sealed plastic bag as well so it wasn't a complete disaster. I also found the belt/fastening method pretty awkward and ungainly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Every time I used this dry pak in a pool or beach water would get in. I also purchased a smaller one, which would also let some water in. The only system that seemed to work is to place the items in the small dry pak and then the small dry pak in the bigger dry pak. Anyway, I would not put anything that can be ruined by water inside these dry paks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carabiner broke before I entered water","review":"This device requires the use of a carabiner to attach the actual bag to the belt/strap which goes around your waist. Problem is that the carabiner broke shortly after taking it out of the box and adjusting the fit of the strap to my waist. Reading further into the reviews now I see that I'm not the only one to have experienced this. Now I have to buy a new carabiner just to see if this things works. This is extremely annoying and doesn't instill confidence that other part of the device --- the part that's supposed to keep stuff dry --- won't also fail in it's job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribe experience","review":"I bought one before I went to Aruba this May, and I was proud of it at the beginning.But it turned out that I lost the car key and my sunglasses when I was snorkeling.The hook was broken, therefore I only had the belt after I went back from water. And Inever found my car key and sunglasses, I think they should be in Venezuela right now....Keep yourself away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Does keep interior dry at reasonable depths which is all I tested it in.

As one of the reviewers pointed out, this bag seems to leak when \\"overloaded\\". I put 2 iPhones into this bag and it leaked while I was snorkeling, destroying both of my iPhones and taking with it all the pictures and videos of my vacation. This bag is big enough to fit more than 2 iPhones so it did not occur to me that it would leak with 2 phones in there. I would look for another product that has a more secured sealing mechanism. Because of this leaky bag, I lost $470 replacing my iPhones because Apple warranty does not cover water damage and a priceless set of photos and videos. I would not buy this brand of products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item!","review":"This item was definitely worth it! Kept my most important items dry while I snorkeled on Roatan Island. Fits most important things, small camera, keys, money, id's, etc. I like the fact it ties around your waist vs. your neck. I highly recommend it for your next water adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should be called a \\"wet\\" pack","review":"I bought this for snorkeling to keep camera and passports dry while in the water. It was a disaster. It may have been submerged momentarily at times but not much at all. When I opened the bag to get the camera out, there was about a pill bottle full amount of water in the bag. The camera was ruined and is now garbage and the passports were soaked. Unless you just want it for the beach and not go in the water, don't bother with this product. Thanks to Amazon for their fabulous return policy all is not lost. I think I'll be looking at the Otterbox products or equivalent. They look much better made to keep \\"dry\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iphone is dead....","review":"I used this to snorkel with and first time using it water leaked inside and ruined my iPhone.

Terrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but it leaked....","review":"The reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I was able to keep some things in this pack while I was surfing. But it leaked, so if you really need something that cant get wet, do not buy this product. We ended just putting my wife's I phone, but it has a water proof cover on it, so it wasnt a problem.I was going to put my insulin pump in, which is water resistant, it probably would of made it because inside the bag wasn't totally soaked. But it did leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail on test","review":"I bought this here in Amazon and tested it before using it by putting the cardboard instruction inside with a little air and subdued it in a bowl of water. I started noticing bubbles coming out from the bottom part. After a minute on water, I dried it completely and inspected the inside and sure enough, the bottom of the instructional cardboard is wet. Although according to the instructions that it is not meant for underwater and only for surface only, I still would like to see it in my own eyes. I just called Amazon for a refund. They even wanted it back and I told them for ten bucks and change, it would be cheaper if I just recycle it to save them some shipping, processing, etc. They agreed and refunded my money back. I'm still debating if this is just a bad item and buy the same one or go with another type/brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for snorkeling","review":"We took this when we went snorkeling to hold our money and passports. It worked great! Kept everything dry. We did replace the c-clamp that came with it with a more sturdy one (the one that comes with it is pretty cheap)...other than that I would highly recommend this to anyone; along with the 2 other larger size Kwik Tek Dry Paks, they all worked great for what we needed them for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this bag to use for protecting valuables (cell phone, I.D., car keys, money, etc.) while snorkeling in Hawaii. It leaked like a sieve. Fortunately, I put the valuables in a zip-lock bag before placing in the dry pack else they would have been ruined. After the first usage I took the dry pack off the belt and replaced it with another product I had bought to protect a digital camera. I used the other product for the duration of the trip with no leaks. Cannot recommend this product at all based on my experience. Maybe the one I bought was defective but I could not find any apparent flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"i just received the Dry Pack...the belt is not attached to the bag so how is this belted??

This is just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked then lost","review":"This thing leaked like a sieve the first time we used it, forcing us to have to keep our belongings in a zip lock inside the bag, defeating the purpose. Then on the third use it came loose from the clip in the water and it was lost. Thank goodness a kind individual turned it in to the lifeguard! I have bought a couple of the larger Kwik Tek Dry Packs in the past and didn't have the same problem with leakage and loss, but it will be difficult to trust their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke quickly","review":"I had this for just a week when one of the fasteners broke. Even before that, it was very difficult to close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My family and I went to Cozumel and were looking for a dry bag to use during our SeaTrek (helmet diving) excursion. I emailed the manufacturer and asked if this product was appropriate for use at 20' depth. They said that they did not guarantee the product below the surface but that they have tested it successfully to 30'. Well - it worked great. We spent 30-40 minutes at a depth of 20 to 22 feet and it kept everything inside perfectly dry. We had also tested it in our pool at a depth of 9 feet for 2 hours. It worked great there too. I recommend this product but be sure to test it before depending on it...just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once then leaked.","review":"Bought this for a couple of cruise excursions.

Worked well while snorkeling on recent Caribbean Cruise. Items stayed dry. No matter what waterproof pouch I use, I always put items in a ziplock first, just for added security. Held documents, money and camera easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"great waistpack","review":"This item work very well for my travels. I wore it as a waist bag in and out of the water, climbing waterfalls, hiking, and off roading. It kept all items dry. It is very light weight and was more spacious than expected. The only tricky part is maneuvering the knobs to open and close the bag. The knobs were very tight and difficult to turn, especially if you are slightly arthritic or are very cold from long periods of time in the water.Overall, I recommend this item. And I love the attachment that makes it easy to unhook and throw into your satchel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for a cruise","review":"This Dry Pac kept my travelers checks and money dry while I swam with the stingrays in the Cayman Islands. Plenty of room left for a camera and credit cards.

At first from the picture I was unsure what the long bar/bracket was for. Turns out it gets installed on top of the right footrest and covers up the brake lines which lie on top of it. This was a very nice surprise as I only thought the kit included the master cylinder cover and cap. This was a very nice addition and one which I like very much.The master cylinder cover and cap went on very easily and look fantastic! Although I just installed and thus cannot comment on the durability of the pieces, I am very pleased with the quality and look of this kit. I would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dated schism of its own. Interesting, but irrelevant to current Klingon lore.","review":"I bought this with the hope of gaining more knowledge of the Klingons. I had not heard of Gurps nor knew what it was, but in retrospect, I wish I had done more research. This data file is completely useless if you are looking for information centered around the current Klingon lore and mythos. Basically, the entire book is for the Gurps Prime Directive RPG ONLY. It contains nothing in relation to current language, beliefs, or novels. The d'k tahg, isn't even referred to as such. The artwork and the designs of the ships are lame. The only thing I found interesting was in this version of events, there is a lot of depth to their universe. But, nothing that can be reflected to today's more superior Klingons. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhodenbarr, as always, is a thoroughly engaging character.","review":"I have enjoyed all the Rhodenbarr books.

To my pleasant surprise it also came with blades and other accessories even though that wasn't included in the product description.The tapering lever has a wide range, probably a quarter inch.My only complaint is that they are extremely loud. When I adjust the power down to reduce the volume it's not strong enough to cut. I have to wear earplugs when I use them and the noise annoys my wife, but other than that it is an awesome product. I am fairly confident that this problem can be resolved through tinkering with the screws.Include blades, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, left taper, right taper. Also came with oil, brush, and blade guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great really","review":"This thing is heavy which makes it a bit difficult to use when cutting your own hair especially holding a mirror with one hand. The 20.00 cutter at Rite Aid is easier to handle.Also, the smallest length attachment doesn't line up with the metal cutters and it has some burrs on it which tend to scrape the scalp a bit.Buy the cheap model and replace the whole shaver when dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as i thought","review":"This product did not meet my expectations. It does cut thick hair easily, but it gets hot pretty fast ( Andis cool care did nothing!) and its pretty heavy. This is not a good clipper if your cutting your own hair.

This video is a standout to have a behind-the-kit veiwpoint to watch and learn how David gets his sound, and how those paradiddlish linear patterns look off the page. If you are studying any books like Garibaldi's Future Sounds, or Gary Chafee's Linear Patterns- this video is a Holy Grail of insight into seeing these linear musical phrases being applied in music.

It is it's own character, instrumental in separating Steve Martin from his long time love, \\"Becky\\" who thinks he's crazy for proposing to her with a house instead of a ring, but then in bringing him together with Goldie Hawn, who is always reinventing herself and can't believe a woman like Becky would reject a man who would build her a house.

Their senses of timing are tremendous and both have a gift for physical comedy and wringing the best out of every line of dialogue. I disagree with the Amazon staff reviewer, I think this movie is very well constructed, with a tight plotline and just the right balance of jokes and exposition. Not a word or scene is wasted. The humor is absurdist but good-natured, as in older-style films, and the supporting cast does standout service. This is a very underrated comedy, in my view, and I give it a high recommendation for fans of either of these fine actors or zany comedy in general. A very refreshing change from in-you-face gross-out jokes and sophomoric scatalogical/sexual put-down gags that pass as \\"comedy\\" in so many films today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I bought this movie for my wife.

This is a book to understand about the evolution of our mind and a prelude of what is coming on the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!","review":"Ellis Peters was a great storyteller, and this book is a fine example of her wonderful work. The story is about a missing cellist from an English traveling orchestra. The cellist has been missing for 13 years, but events happen that bring his story to the forefront. The story is set in the Austrian Alps, and George Felse and his wonderful wife Bunty are there trying to figure out a mystery. This old disappearance seems to be linked to some modern day crimes, and George wants to follow the thread until he uncovers the long-hidden secret. The book is packed with action, and it will keep you guessing until the end. Ms. Peters knew how to pace a plot to keep her readers quickly turning the pages. Her characterizations are also flawless. If you love the Brother Cadfael series like I do, I suggest that you read the George Felse series as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"read once only\\" book","review":"This is the second in the Inspector Felse series. Unfortunately Ellis Peters has written pages that are full of descriptions of emotional trauma and \\"angst\\" of the protagonists as well as waxing lyrical with metaphysical insights. There is no doubt that characters need to be 3-dimensional, as well as scenes and situations to have reality and flavour, but Ellis Peters seems to have over-done it. Readers can skim through some of the more esoteric paragraphs without losing the thread.

This series does not reflect in any way previous DeCocteau movies and genre. It was a way to make quick money.

I would have to agree that the disc sounds cloudy and distorted. Too bad. the stuff I heard in Chicago was on the level of a steely dan record. AAA radio will probably still latch onto it, but it's a shame that very few will get to hear the excellent quality of this band in the studio... What happened? Does this label realize how good a product this band is? I have to say if you can somehow contact the band and get a copy of the original mixes, you would be doing yourself a favor.

The book is a must for graduate students taking up women's studies or film studies. Ramanathan's prose is direct and insightful. Because the prose is so clear and accessible, this text ranks essential, right alongside of an important work like Alice Doesn't. I especially like the range of films discussed, specifically such complex films as Watermelon Woman. An entire course could work around this book--I plan to use it when I teach feminist film.

John P. Schuster masterfully with these and other questions in \\"Answering Your Call\\".The author makes a strong argument that we often don't feel fulfilled in life if we don't know our purpose. The reason we feel we have no purpose is because we continue to miss our callings when they occur. With this as his thesis he works through the process of knowing what a call is, recognizing when you are called to do something, and responding to your call. This is a fresh and insightful look at defining purpose in your life and a recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Sorry to say it, but this book is crap.

That's false. How do I know? Marley is asked about his latest album, Survival. Even casual reggae fans know that the last album Marley released in his lifetime was Uprising (1980). The video jacket copy is rather sensationalized, suggesting that Marley was on his final journey to Jamaica, via NYC and Miami, where he died. It is true that Marley passed away in Miami, but the facts are otherwise incorrect, apparently in an effort to tap into the rather morbid fascination of this reggae prophet's untimely death. As for the video interview itself, it is an intriguing, somewhat casual series of questions about music, politics, Rastafari and black consciousness, the answers given not only by Marley but by members of his band and entourage."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy it","review":"i dont care what st. louis man says buy the way i hate mark maguire those facts are true but as long as its an interview its exiting watching him talk because hes a legend buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible translation!","review":"This collection of plays by Strindberg is a horrible translation with a worse editing job.

In addition, the actual translation is so bad that important points are lost.In regards to the overall organization, there is no separation between the plays.

Then we turned the door knob...Then the Big Kids filled the large bucket with hot water...).We can appreciate that life was different 70+ years ago, as it will be different 70 years from today.

Just the title made me suspect the book would be enjoyable, but I identified greatly with it as it reminded me of my growing up on an Iowa farm in the 1950's. While we had running water, indoor plumbing, and the team of horses were gone by the time I was nine, the labor, seasons, and lifestyle had not changed. We still had gardening, canning, butchering, baking, and meals to prepare for harvest help. In retrospect, I would not give up those years for anything. The work ethic and family oriented goals were invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching memoir about another era nearly gone with the wind","review":"Little Heathens is a charming, salt-of-the-earth memoir by retired English professor Mildred Armstrong Kalish that is kindly generous with more tales of high spirits than of hard times.

After receiving it though, I can only give it two stars though because first of all, it doesn't get very warm very quickly. You almost have to stand on the unit (at least apply pressure) to feel the warmth, which is difficult when you are sitting. Also, I frankly found the massage portion annoying, it just vibrates and it also cycles through two different speeds (It doesn't have two different speeds, it just switches back and forth occasionally while it's on). Most of the time I don't even turn it on. It does work as advertised, just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the heat???","review":"I bought this item to warm my chronically cold feet.

It turned my perception of the whole voting process in America completely around (I really never suspected it was THIS bad). If you have any interest at all in politics (and if you don't, well, you might be past saving), you should read this, and pass it along, and talk about it. It's an eye-opener. And so entertaining! I laughed out loud several times, and throughout, I felt that the author was presenting really substantial, weighty information in an appealing, witty style.

I end up having to turn his head a full 180 to hide it. The cannons work poorly. In the movie, only one of Stascream's hands turn into a missle launcher. For that reason Hasbro should have giving him regular robot arms, which also woud have been easier to conceal in airplane mode and made a missle launcher to attach to his arm. Like they did for '08 camero bumble bee. The legs are done great, they should have used that same accuracy to make the arms.

Bad Idea!!! after 9 months, the bezel and all buttons ceased to work. the chronograph is permanently stuck in place. After contacting Seiko (COSERV)about my 2 YEAR warranty (which amazon prominently advertises) I was told that I would have to send the watch in and they would send me an estimate of cost.

At first glance, it looks fantastic. The functions are great. Here's the problem, Seiko uses the thinnest and cheapest spring bar on the market. The spring bar is the metal bar that holds the bracelet to the watch case. I learned this from a very reputable jeweler in my area who serviced the watch. In 4 months, I had to replace them 3 times because they would bend and the bracelet would come loose. Because of this very reason, the jeweler I consulted stated that he used to carry them because they looked great and were a good seller, but he got tired of the constant warranty service he had to perform for this very reason. For the money, there are other watches with stronger components and the same features and for possibly less money.

Indeed, this is a dry list of things to do with no information on how to do them. It is NOT meant for general reading. All the books in this series are specifically created to help treating professionals write treatment plans (Treatment Planners) or create progress notes (Progress Note Planners) using language that is potentially helpful for insurance companies or other agencies that may require objective documentation.

Both were remarkable. Grant, though not considered one of our better presidents, was considered one of the greatest generals (and leaders) in American history. We need more men like USG today.This book flows well, and is full of vital information about the War Between the States, without too many, if any, biases or prejudices. Though written well over a century ago, hard to even say it's outdated.Simply put, gripping writing about the Civil War, or indeed, any war in US history. The conclusion was particularly splendid and prescient.And perhaps most commendable is the fact that Grant wrote it while dying a painful death from cancer. That only adds to its merit. Just great non-fiction: the best type of book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unapproachable","review":"Despite an obvious self-consciousness of writing for posterity as a U.S. President and the concomitant need to maintain a certain aloof dignity, U.S. Grant provides candid and illuminating interpretations of the causes of both the Mexican War and the Civil War and the imperatives of slavery, never cavilling in his opinion. He is also careful yet enlightening in his opinions of historical figures of his age. But 90% of his memoirs describe battle movements that are unapproachable to anyone without an intimate knowledge of the field. The average reader thus is left without any way of knowing whether movements were brilliantly inspired, ordinary, or absolute blunders. There is no reason for this, because a great many simplified Civil War maps exist that could have and should have been included in this edition, or, if copyright were an issue, re-drawn. That they were not included is a professional disgrace to the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better appreciation of a great American","review":"This book really provides incredible insight into Grant and what made him a great general. In a plainspoken & straightforward manner he gives a recount of his role in the war and his military philosophy (attack). Unlike a modern autobiography we get nothing personal or confessional (not necessarily a bad thing). Any mention of drinking, or his dismal presidency are omitted and his family gets only a paragraph or two; which is fine because no one is interested in Grant's parenting or presidenting tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I was very surprised a this book.

If it is a real christian movie, like fireproof, I expect real world christians that are living out their faith in and out of hollywood should play the part. # 2 the number of sexual scenes in the trailer itself is just disturbing. Plus where did you ever see the curch giving the glory to the person who sing the song rather than the Lord.

It made me wish I paid more attention to Julia Child over the years. Paris is now on my short list of places to see or even live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lady is for burning","review":"Overall, I liked the discussions on food and where they were in France, but after being a long time fan and having met her, I was surprised how mean-spirited she was throughout the book to Simca and Louisette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used 1st Edition Book in Perfect Condition","review":"This book was in perfect condition when it arrived. I am most pleased with it. It also arrived in record time. I could not be more happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant, fun read!!","review":"I never would have read this book e/x for my book club, and so glad I did!! I've been living in Rome for the past 1 1/2 years, so I just loved reading about Julia's experience with living overseas and her falling in love with French food and cooking. The writing was fantastic -- I felt like I could hear Julia talking; hear the vendors at the markets selling their wares; hear the waves slapping on the port where their apartment was in Marseilles, and smell the countryside of their home, LaPeetch, in France. I so enjoyed Julia's honesty as well, with her collaborators, her relationship with her father, her sister, Dort. It truly was a joyous read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this book...I feel completely inspired by Julie's story, especially her late start at her career.

I really appreciating hearing more about her family and her upbringing, her doubts about her own career and discovering who she felt she really was. I could definitely relate. It was a delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This book is a travel journal and autobiography in one. The personality of Julia Child shines through in Alex Prud'Homme's writing. I enjoyed the characterizations of people the Childs knew during their foreign service years and the peek into post WW II Europe of the 50's. An excellent period piece. The photos included are also a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and oh so Julia!","review":"A collection of anecdotes about Julia Child's life in France is read with spirit by gravelly voiced Flo Salant Greenburg, who doesn't attempt to mimic Julia so that Julia's wit and wisdom come clearly through. Wonderful stories about Julia's cooking school and writing her famous cookbook as well as personal stories about food feasts Julia enjoyed. This is a pleasure for anyone who misses Julia and wants to learn more about her early cooking years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Child - My Life in France - Audio CD","review":"This is just a warning about the audio cd. If you dislike a voice that sounds like she smokes 4 packs of cigarettes a day and has a lisp-then don't purchase this. She can barely get any words out and I turned it off after 5 minutes. Read the book instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who aspires to live better","review":"While I find most food writing, particularly autobiographies, tiring to the core this book warmed my jaded little heart.It's hard not to love Julia Child, but when I got this book I was hardly expecting to come away from it not only satisfied with geeky details of her life but also inspired to explore food fearlessly.The story never bogs down in sentimentality. The prose is tight and focused and the tone is so perfect you can almost hear Juilia's shrill voice recounting meals in Provence.Few things I have read have made me want to not only cook but look at food as a philosophy of life.I have come away from this book changed for the better and I think that is the best thing any author can hope for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much French","review":"While her story is an interesting account of how she became super French chef, there was so much French interspersed throughout that I (who speak English and Spanish) often was at a loss. Some of her stories even had the \\"punchline\\" in French. I understood that the recipes would have some language references, and since she lived in France, I even expected some French words occasionally, but this was over the top. I have it by my bed for when I can't sleep. It puts me right out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Very funny","review":"It follows the movie exactly. Very funny and tells the story of Julia Childs after WWII. If you are interested in this person it is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and Interesting","review":"I didn't expect to like this book but I LOVED it. I learned so much history thru the eyes of a woman who I really knew nothing about. Her sense of humor comes thru and the way she grew and learned new things was inspirational. She was really self taught in a lot of ways from the French language to French cooking. I got to see post WWII in a new perspective as well. Julia Child was a very interesting person in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Gave this book to my wife for her birthday and she loved it. Make your wife happy and get her a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia being Julia and doing it well.","review":"For those who find Julia Child's recipes to be to their liking, plus those who appreciate her refreshingly irreverent attitude toward the culinary arts, will enjoy this book. That is by no means said in a critical way, but recognizes that Julia's manner can sometimes be off-putting to those who take their cooking rather too seriously. I enjoyed reading about her beginnings in Paris and her difficulty in establishing herself in the male dominated world of cooking. Her trials in getting her first books published is a most interesting story of that male domination. She tells an interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start","review":"This book started out quirky and fun and had all the coziness of the movie. However about 1/2 way through she started in with her politics. I ended up not caring what the last few chapters were about because it was mostly her politics and her high opinion of herself. Her writing style was fun and engaging, but she should have stuck to the food and quirks of living abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to juila???","review":"am i the only person not to like this book? not the julia i knew, there is a sourness to it, and not very well edited . some pictures have captions, and some do not, some french is translated and some is not.

No pages were missing/folded/bent, etc. There were several small scratches/marks on the cover but those may be due to an unusually easy to scuff cardstock and the fact that the cover is white. I was, however, disappointed due to the very noticeable red permanent marker dot on the bottom binding that spread across a good chunk of pages. It may not have been an issue had this book not been bought as a gift for someone. This was a second attempt at ordering this book under the \\"new\\" category that had this blemish. I will return it like the first. I guess it is common for books to have this dot, however, at first I thought it was blood due to the irregular shape. If it were me, I would put these books under \\"used\\" or mention this characteristic in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to know Julia Child","review":"After many years of watching her various cooking shows, I finally got a real insight to Julia and her private life. This book is one you can't put down and I didn't want it to end. She was such a delight. How much she loved her husband and their life in Europe, especially France! Her enthusiasm for food preparation is infectious! I heartily recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vocabulary lesson for my 6th Grader!","review":"I bought this book for myself, after my 11 year old and I went to the movies.

A great book flows this one is a great lesson too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight","review":"We saw the movie Julie and Julia and were so charmed that I came home and ordered this book and the cookbook for my culinary student daughter. The book is as charming as Julia and fun to read. It's like she's your friend telling about her life with Paul and the intense work and fun put into her recipes. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Condition - Great Purchase","review":"Book arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. Thanks to the Seller for such good service, and thank you to Amazon for making purchasing items so easy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Life in Her Own Words","review":"This was a wonderful autobiography. Watching Julia Child on PBS I thought of her as almost comical but now that I've read more about her I realize what a remarkable woman she was. I loved reading about what inspired her and learning of her dogged determination to master french cooking and bring it to Americal audiences. The loving partnership she had with her husband, Paul is truly inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe...","review":"I can't believe I didn't review this when I read it. So many of the books I've read don't show reviews by me that I am starting to wonder if this is because the exact edition I have was removed and with it my review. I absolutely love this book and recommend it highly, especially if you love Julia Child already. I wish I had reviewed it when I read it so that I could give it a more thorough and enthusiastic review. Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 50's-the good years!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I was also in France from 1955-59 and reading this brought back many memories.

I bought it because of my interest in Julia Child after last summer's wonderful movie and I loved it. I enjoyed it more than Julie and Julia -- a nicer tone and an interesting historical context. I wish I the chance to watch Julia on TV but will have to catch her on DVD. This is great book, don't hesitate to pick it up. Especially sweet because it was written by Julia's great nephew shortly before her death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love loved this book!","review":"If you are a foodie, a francophile or just love a good personal memoir - get this book. It rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a time for skewering","review":"A book based on letters that Julia Child sent to her husband's brother and his family. The letters must have been transporting, as My Life in France is filled with delicious imagery. Though the book was well written, I was disappointed that Julia the classy chef comes across as less than a class act. She uses a rapier on a number of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia","review":"Saw the movie, read the book, had to have the cookbook. EXCELLENTReally, 8 more words required? That is stupid. Really, Really Really Really Really Supid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read this year!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book reads like a conversation with a terrific storyteller. It's wonderfully entertaining, giving us a glimpse into Paris in the 1940s-50's. But more than that, it reveals, in Julia's very original voice how she developed her interest in cooking, her dedication to her craft, and the perseverence that she and Simca endured in order to produce and publish Mastering the Art of French Cooking after 9 years of hard work and set backs. In that regard, it's a very inspirational book, especially as both she and Simca were both in mid-life (40+) when they began their careers in cooking.So it is both a terrific memoir and a source of inspiration for those who choose to follow their passions. Truly one of the best books I've read this year....I plan to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moveable Feast","review":"This, hands down, is one of the best reads of the year. We took it with us on vacation last month & my wife and I competed over reading rights whenever the kids were otherwise occupied. It's beautifully told and as compelling as a great mystery that you know has a happy ending. It will remind you of your honeymoon in France (even if you went somewhere else) and inspire you to go again. And when you finish, you'll want to find a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and keep going...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Vivant!","review":"This book is just brimming with life, just as Julie Child did during her years in France. This book has inspired me to retrace Julia's steps through France (in 2007), approach the kitchen with more energy, and adopt a more serene approach to life in general...this book is just outstanding. I read it in 7 hours, straight through, and after lending it to those to whom I have promised it, I shall read it again...Bravo Julia for sharing your life in France with us, and Bravo Alex for seeing to it that it was published. What an amazing life, what an amazing person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Background to \\"The French Chef\\"","review":"How did Julia Child hook up with her other two authors and write that watershed book \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\"? And how did she get on PBS in Boston on WGBH? Here's the story, plus that of Paul Child, her diplomat husband.I found this a fascinating book because Julia Child was kind of a childhood icon--we all started cooking differently because she woke Americans up to the fact that vegetables didn't have to come in a can or box and you could do some elegant meals at holidays with things that didn't require a covering layer of marshmallows. We took a trip to Washington and did see her kitchen, reassembled piece-by-piece in the Smithsonian. It's revealing; it's a small kitchen like a workshop, with pegboard and \\"tools\\" on the wall and not as fancy as you'd imagine.This book was a wonderful insight into Julia's life and anyone who cooks and admires her work should read it. Gosh, do I miss her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book.....but.......","review":"Yes, the book is great! I have no problem with the read......what I have a problem with is the shape of the book. Too expensive tosend back so I'll keep it but beware.......you might do better purchasing this book in person where you can inspect the one you purchase. The one I received has many many pages wider than others and some narrower than others. On top of this.....there was a bug.....a small one but still, a bug smashed inside one of the pages.I ordered this for my Kindle but wanted the book as well to look through the photos. This book appears to be a 'second' or 'flawed' that would have been found in the $2.00 bin at a book store.My rating is not for the words but for the shape of the book. I rated it low to draw attention to the kind of book you might receive. $17 + is not an amount I believe should have been charged for this. If that doesn't bother you, great! At least if you read reviews you are warned.Still a good book......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning...audio version a disaster!","review":"I couldn't get through the audio version.The reader, god bless her, was a disaster.She has a rough aging voice that does not lend itself to audio performance.Ouch. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julia Child's zest for life and personality comes through loud and clear, as does her tremendous work ethic and love of all things about French food and wine. My only complaint about the book was that there are french phrases used throughout the book that are not always translated, which I found frustrating. Also, occasionally, there were awkward jumps from one \\"story\\" to something that seemed totally unrelated in the very next paragraph. However, even with these minor flaws, I highly recommend the book - Julia Child had an amazing and very interesting life and it is worth the time to read her memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting book","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this look at Julia Child's life and work. Fascinating and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book for a book group I belong to.It was an enjoyable book to read. However, it did get tedious near the end. You just wanted her to get done with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats off to the First Lady of Cooking","review":"This was a wonderful memoir about Julia Child. I especially found it interesting that she fell into cooking at the age of forty. Her passion to learn about cooking and gastronomy, as well as, her love for good food and wine were contagious. It made me want to get in the kitchen and whip something up. I think what Julia said at the end of the book, sums up what I learned by reading My Life in France, \\"Learn how to cook-try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!\\".While I was reading My Life in France, I watched the video \\"Julia Child! America's Favorite Chef\\". I found it to be a good compliment to the book. It was like a visual summary of everything I had read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good book.","review":"I like the book.

I know much was left out but every recollection is golden. Her love affair with Paul continues to be mysterious. Their love for each other made everything possible. It was amazing how she disliked her father so even when she was an adult. She did wind up going back to her roots in Santa Barbara. She was a toughie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia Child's way to cook is a lesson in the way to live","review":"This book is a wonderful example of how to create a beautiful life.Julia Child's life with Paul is an example of how to derive joy from living with passion and teamwork, doing something really well, creating harmony, changing with the times and making it up as you go along.If you have ever done any reading about \\"manifesting\\" what you want, you'll see it in action here.This is worthwhile reading even if you have no interest in French cooking.If you have seen the movie, this will give much more backstory on what made Paul Child tick."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life in France","review":"My goal was to read this book and Julie/Julia before I saw the movie. I did do that and I am happy I did. The movie doesn't do My Life in France justice although it does capture the Childs' love for each other and Julia's love of food. But how could it? I thoroughly enjoyed My Life in France, after only seeing Julia Childs in caricature or SNL sketches it was fun to read how this amazing woman carved out a place for herself by doing what she loved. An inspiration to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I adore this book, I got into Julia Childs cooking sometime ago and after reading the cookbook I wanted to know more about the person. This book takes you along with Julia while traveling around France. You feel like your beside her taking pictures. So from the cookbook to this and now an obsession. I can't wait to start a new chapter in the Julia saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Appetit!","review":"A beautiful memoir of an amazingly well-lived life. For anyone with a love of la belle France, this will be endlessly entertaining. Those who remember Julia Child's groundbreaking cooking shows will hear her oddly distinctive voice coming through these pages. It's a love story about her relationships, especially Paul, her talented husband. Wistful, sentimental. You'll wipe away tears by the end of the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Story, With Recipes","review":"This is a happy book. Child's joyful recounting of the first years of her long, successful marriage to Paul Child describes her discovery of France, and especially Paris, and food, which became her life-long vocation. Every line of this memoir is filled with energy, enthusiasm and delight. Moreover, and not incidentially, Child's tale provides a fascinating glimpse into life among the ex-patriot, American foreign service community in Paris shortly after W.W.II and during the early fifties. There are also accounts of the history of some of Child's favorite recipes; I took to reading \\"My Life in France\\" with a copy of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" at my side, and my family has benefited in the form of ratatouille, French potato salad and, this evening, leek & swiss cheese quiche. Definitely a rewarding read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could hear her voice . . .","review":"Bravo!

Prison Break's Dominic Purcell and funnyman Orlando Jones play two members of a TV crew planning to get some footage of a gigantic killer crocodile, but instead fall prey to it as it terrorizes the African landscape. The first thing you'll notice when you see the beast of the film (dubbed Gustave) is that the CGI effects borderline passable and made for TV bad. Combine this with the cardboard acting (Purcell is asleep at the wheel, and Jones is the standard joke cracking sidekick) and civilian direction, and you get this exercise in B-movie mediocrity. It's not absolutely terrible by any means, and if you so desire to see Primeval, you probably already know what to expect here. Then again, there are better ways to spend your horror movie viewing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"More CGI than Shrek!","review":"The Croc was so cartoony I thought I was watching the sequel to Pete's Dragon.

This inspires a crew of flunkies to go to Africa to find the man eating beast, but instead takes a turn towards the economic problems of the people. I wish in the first 10 minutes the croc would have eaten the crew and gotten the movie over with. Orlando Jones starred in this mess in which I saw better acting from him in his old sprite commercials.This one definately doesn't get my seal of approval.

Usually, I am happy to find two or three gems in the whole collection while I feel I have to slog my way through the rest. Not so with this collection! I am happy to report that there is not a single dud here. And, in fact, some of my all time favorite short stories are included.I confess to not being an Asimov super fan. Most of his novels are OK, although don't seem to withstand the test of time too well. So it was with some trepidation that I approached this volume. The book begins with Dr Asimov's introduction where he describes his hits and misses regarding his attempts to incorporate his predictions of the future. This is truly enjoyable to read. And the stories are spot on. Each is thought provoking, just as quality science fiction should be.

This book is a great description of Shiraz the way it was. It shows how people there faced many threats from invaders, but they stuck together in their families, schools or Sufi brotherhoods to make Shiraz one of the greatest cities for art and literature. And Hafez was the best of them all. It explains how Hafez responded to different events, which gives more meaning to some of his poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I ordered the book hoping to read about the history of Shiraz.

But the longer I looked at it I realized that, looking at the stainless side, the bow-tie was angled to the left instead of the right.

I had been debating between getting one of Canon's ZR cameras or an Elura for a while. Finally settled on the Elura, mostly due to it's tiny size. Haven't had too much time to play around with it yet, but so far I just love this camera. Fits right in the palm of my hand to carry around and shoot video wherever I go. Works great with iMovie using a firewire cable (not included, grrrr.)So far, my only gripes are 1) the included battery gives you less than an hour of recording time, making spare batteries ... a must; and 2) the LCD screen and viewfinder is a bit TOO small... way smaller than on the ZR series. Definitely try before you buy.

Its very susceptible to wind interference.A few months ago it started intermittently stopping in the middle of recording and jamming tapes.

The album starts out with some good newer hip/hop (Kweli, Black Thought, Masta Ace, J-Live) and then transitions into an old school funk early days of rap \\"megamix\\" with Grandmaster Flash, Sugarhill, Biz Markie and such. Then it effortlessly flows back into more contempory stuff like Clipse, Mobb Deep, Wu Tang, etc. At all points Paul's style and flavor are heard with snipets of any number of obscure samples and a small amount of scratching.
