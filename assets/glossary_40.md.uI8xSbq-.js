After 20+ hours on the phone with tech support we had them send out a replacement, which has exactly the same problems, and I think the problem is their terrible software. Its software locks up the host machine at 100% processor use, the scanning is very poor quality when it works, which is seldom, and the printing locks up with random \\"49 error\\". It does send and receive faxes ok.

However, this model blows through toner cartridges like prunes through a goose. We replaced an old HP 1200 which used about 1 cartridge every 4 to 6 months, with this unit that is now only making it about 3 weeks to a month on toner.Scanning is fine. Copying is fine. Faxing is just fine. NO problems with any of it. But if we don't find a solution to the excessive guzzling of toner, it may be too expensive to continue to use as a printer. And just so you know, we have decreased the density and resolution in an attempt to save a little, but I have not seen a difference in the toner usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEPENDABILITY?","review":"The 3390 was easy to set up and register, but when I investigated extended warranties I found that I could purchase only two more years coverage from HP, not one more year, and the tab was almost half the price of the 3390. So no go. Our previous 3330 failed after a couple of years and wasn't worth repairing. If we have the same experience with the 3390, we will be off HP forever. Other than that the machine works fine and meets all of our needs. However, it seems a bit loud when running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good hardware, sorry software","review":"The hardware on this printer is excellent. It shares the same toner cartrigde as the 1320.

They plan to write the story of how they got to freedom in Vermont. Free, a young person living with Beth, & Mary, that came Gran are writing down the story as they speak it. It gets to late to write, so Gran & Mary go back to the hotel. They finish thier story later & tragically find out that Beth is very ill & may die. They sum up the story and get ready to leave, since both Gran and Beth think it's best, but Mary wants to bring Free with them, but fails to persuade anyone. They go home, and that is where the story ends. I think the theme of this story is finishing the story. I rate the story five stars because it's captivating, it really pulls you into it and makes you feel like part of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"\\"Steal Away\\" was not what I expected. I expected more adventure and bonding between Beth and Susannah - I couldn't quite understand if they were true friends or mere acquaintances who went through a trying experience. The concept of going back and forth from the \\"past\\" to the \\"present\\" was interesting and different, but couldn't save this book. The relationship between Mary and Free was also confusing. I came to the conclusion that they were not fond of each other, because of Free's bitterness. The beginning and ending letter added to the confusion and the \\"unspoken\\" words and emotions made me reread paragraphs to fully understand what happened. The plot and the way the story was constructed was enjoyable, but the writing style used by Armstrong was annoying. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steal Away","review":"I did not like the book because it was confusing to read, they went back and forth from when Susannah was a little girl, then a grandmother.

It is about a woman named Mary who has a flashback of her learning about her grandma's experiences while running away from home to Virginia. Her grandma is named Susanna and her parents died so she had to live with her aunt, uncle, and cousins. She leaves home after she realizes there is nother there for her. She runs away with a slave named Bethlehem and on their jouney they face many problems. One problem is they don't have food or water, but they make some friends along the way. Anyone who likes Historical Fiction, risk and trust would love this book. I like this book because Mary finds a whole other side of her grandma. You should read this book and make up your own mind if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, poor execution","review":"I enjoy reading about the many and varied forms of travel, so an account of an African adventure by microlight was intriguing. I felt that both the location and method of travel offered exciting possibilities. I was disappointed, however, by the account that was written in the book. The author, not a pilot but rather a student, travels with her flight instructor. Yet I never got the feeling he was part of the adventure at all. He was there to pilot, instruct the author, and seemingly act as so much a 'driver/mechanic' for our 'intrepid adventurer.' When the slightest hint of trouble with the aircraft cropped up, the author abandons both plane and pilot to carry on alone, leaving him to catch up after making repairs. I was let down that Ms. Dodwell seems to take pleasure in the novelty of the adventure - a photo of her alone with the plane is on the cover - while a major team member of the expedition was shuffled to a minor role in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No appeal to the selection","review":"This had absolutely no appeal for the general public. What was the author thinking? If a writer is going to write specialized material, then don't try to put it in the hands of everyday people. This belongs to law inforcement interest areas only. And even then, only to those interested in days of old. There are much more up to date subjects to be written about. I doubt anyone else would even care to invest their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing there was a **NO** star review","review":"Well...i must say Mr. Kouri has taken Books to a whole new low, it was not even the slightest bit interesting to a lay person or a crime expert, if you want to read a really good writer about crime, i would suggest a book by Robert K.

Other editions I've seen are full of interesting illustrations and fake 'newspaper clipping' images to help heighten and convey different aspects of the plot. Not that this is at all necessary as it's a great book on it's own - but if you're putting \\"illustrated edition\\" on the cover of the book and only including one or two very poorly executed images, well, all I can think to say is shame on you. Add to this the fact that I counted nearly one copy error per page of the book, and all I can say is don't waste your money on this edition, and in fact, stay away from any titles published by 'the echo library' altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"War with the Newts is a good book not only for its intellectual value but also for enjoyment. The plot is interesting and easily captivating. In an age where exploitation in its many forms (politically, racially, environmentally, etc.) is still prevalent, the books stands as a strong satire to the possible, if not far off, consequences of society's actions. As the satire builds and the newts gain control, the book becomes more interesting, especially in a realistic sense with its constant explanatory footnotes and articles from such established periodicals as National Geographic. The final chapter is noteworthy, as Capek reveals his consciousness of the reader and his/her possible reactions to the brief (some would say sudden) ending. An easy and entertaining read, War with the Newts is defintely worth reading.

Of course, the Newts, like any species which decides to ape humans (oops! too many species in one sentence), must go to war with them. Er, us. Imitation, flattery and all that. The book is 240 pages with a minimum of one cry and one laugh guaranteed per page.Karl Capek, the Czech novelist, essayist and playwrite, died shortly after the Nazi invasion of his country, thus saving the Nazis the trouble of sending him off to a concentration camp. He is (all you SF fans will know) the fellow who dreamed up the word \`robot'. He also had a good hook into human greed, hypocracy and pomposity. He was a democrat without illusions, an occupation requiring a doctorate in humor, black, tongue-in-cheek and otherwise.In the end - well, in the end the Newts only want the very same things we want. Not very comforting, is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, funniest, truest thus saddest books","review":"War With the Newts is one of the best, funniest truest and thus saddest books I've read in a long time.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to read such an interesting yet intellectual book. I think that you would have to be a politics, economics, sociology, psychology, biology, and english expert to get all out of this book that you possibly can. The seemingly outlandish plot of newts overtaking the world somehow loses its ring of fiction during the course of the novel and a reader begins to see how it all happens. You begin to question human history and where are we headed. The sarcasm and wit it takes to write such a page turner is true talent ( not to mention the insight of culture).

The author describes well in the book how terrible and awful the Hiroshima was after the bomb. I am a high school student who have never experienced war. This book helps people who has never experienced war to understand how terrible and awful the war is. It has been more than 50 years since the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima. However, there are many people who are still suffering from the aftereffect of the atomic bomb today. After you read this book, your perspective of an atomic bomb would be different. I believe that we should never use the bomb again. I suggest to read this book, especially if you have never experienced war. I hope peace will be with us in our world forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book I have ever read","review":"This review may annoy people who feel strongly about the book or the incident, but Hiroshima really is the driest read imaginable. I had to teach it to an extension English class and when the time came to discussing the text, all 24 students owned up to not reading it because it bored them senseless. I couldn't feel angry about that because I too found it so dull that I struggled to get through it. I ended up supplementing it with other non-fiction texts.

Your feelings of compassion for the Japanese people will quickly disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of bang for the buck","review":"This is one of those books that is worth the price of admission many times over. It contains the stories of several survivors of the nuclear bombardment of Hiroshima, from what they were setting out to do that fateful morning until how their lives turned out decades latter.The first portion of the book, dealing with the survivors' stories of the bombing and its immediate aftermath, was the stronger of the two. It was as haunting, mesmorizing, and terrifying read as I have ever had, yet weighed in at only about a little over hundred pages. The latter portion of the book, which Hersey added years later to show how his subjects' lives had turned out, was somewhat disappointing.Overall, this is still an excellent book, whose haunting images will remain with you for the rest of your life. Well worth a few bucks and a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"An immensely powerful pathetic argument","review":"John Hersey's slim little volume here is an immensely powerful pathetic argument against the dropping of nuclear weapons in particular and against war in general. He deals with the aftermath of the lifetimes of several survivors of the dropping of the first nuclear weapon on an inhabited place. Many were killed instantly, others were crushed in the debris and rubble, and others weren't as lucky - dying a slow death from burns and radiation.This is an immensely humanizing work that I wish those in power would read or at least be aware of before they made devastating decisions. We in human race have been lucky enough that we haven't had to write a sequel to this book based on a different war and a different place on the same scale. Sadly, we write little ones every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"Great Purchase CKVKLJ;JNVKZ;KCVJJVK'ZJXC'VKLZXVMK'ZLXMCV'ZLKCV'LKZMX'LKVCCVCVCVCVCVCVCVCVC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Mercy Girls and the Book They Have In Common!","review":"The book Hiroshima by John Hersey is a brief literary work written about the experiences of six different people who survived and witnessed the Bombing of Hiroshima. The book was very suspensful, leaving you hanging at the end of each page, quivering for the next thrill of foreboding. The book does not judge America's decision in using the Bomb. The book does not take Japan's side, or even America's side in the War topic. No matter what the readers views are, this book is extremly valuble to those fact thirsty and to those WWII students. It's compelling and raw and we Four Mercy Girls strongly recommend this book for a new slide on your view finder."},{"rating":"2","title":"content? in a nonfiction? i didnt think that existed....","review":"i had originally expected this to be another cookie cutter books about what had happened and why we should all feel sorry and the like. what surprised me later on as i got on in reading it was that had one been not yet informed on the unlikely event of august 6, 1945, one might think it to be a rather compelling fiction story. it was much akin to Night and The Grapes of Wrath in that it told a story about something often taken for granted. one thing is for certain though; read this before you go out and see pearl harbor. it puts nonbiased views better in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"The message sent was good, but I didn't care for the story","review":"Overall, I felt that Hiroshima was a mediocre book. The message that the book sent to it's audience was good, but the overall story wasn't exciting enough for me and became rather boring towards the ending of the book. I felt that some of the details included toward the ending were unnecessary and seemed to make the book drag on. One, and probably the only part of the book I did like was the first chapter, where it was described where all of the characters were when the bomb was first dropped and how far away from the center of the blast they were. I felt it was interesting to see the different activities the characters were performing at the time of the bombing and then how they were all in the same state of shock and wonder after the bomb was dropped. Overall I think that the message sent was good, but the ending probably ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting glimpse into what it was like on that day","review":"Hersey tells the story of several individuals who survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.What makes the book so fascinating is the very detailed, personal experiences of these people; what they were doing, what they thought when they saw the flash, what their injuries were, what they did in the minutes and hours and months after the bomb hit.The one thing I didn't like was that it was told in the 3rd person. I would have liked to have read those individuals accounts in their own words (but of course, translated).Also, because the various accounts were from people who all had some sort of connection with each other (and why were most of them ministers or doctors), I got the impression I wasn't getting a representative sample. I also would have liked to have learned more about these individuals views on the war, the bomb, Americans and the aftermath of it all.Overall, though, a very interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering read","review":"I agree with some of the comments about the one-sided-ness of this book. However, Mr. Hersey was telling the story of six people in Hiroshima. The context of the war is implied. The context of the reasons for dropping the A-Bomb on Hiroshima, is implied. This story, I believe, is an attempt to let us see the consequences of that fateful day, through the eyes of those that lived it. I have also read Iris Chang's \\"The Rape of Nanking.\\" I've read other books that detail the atrocities of both the Japanese AND the Nazis. This book, \\"Hiroshima\\" is a unique glimpse into the lives of the residents of Hiroshima."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real cost of War","review":"\\"Hiroshima\\" by John Hersey is true story about August 6, 1945 when one action would forever change the course human history. The day that first atomic bomb was used against other people. Mr. Hersey tells about people who were just going about their everyday business. A Doctor, an office worker, a priest and others. And how one event would effect them for the rest of their lives.This should be a must read for everyone, because this what war is all about. Not glory, lose of life and untold suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Haunting.There are no simple conclusions to reach, regarding the use of the atomic bombs against Japan. This is still a highly controversial and painful subject for citizens of many nations around the world, as the effects of war remain with us for so many generations afterward. The very attempt to discuss the events of Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) is like traversing a path mined everywhere by trip wires which are difficult to avoid and easily triggered.Hersey's work here recounts the experience of Hiroshima survivors, the horrors of what the people in Hiroshima lived through, on that day, a horror the world rightly continues to grieve and mourn, and to fear greatly the potential for repetition. Hersey's Hiroshima was the first to personalize the experience for Westerners, the first to tell the story to the West from the perspective of those who lived and worked in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb.Moving. Disturbing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyewitnesses to the bomb","review":"This slender volume is to Hiroshima what \\"Night\\" is to the Holocaust. It doesn't explain how the bomb was made, or why it was dropped. Rather, Mr. Hersey writes about Hiroshima from the perspective of survivors, who are fairly average people.

I read these years ago when the movies started, when Craig did Casino Royale I decided to re-read it, (Casino Royale) again, I then decided to re-read all the early ones, which I think are superior reads, but that is just me (obviously).The movie from which this book is based is considered to be the best of the early movies, without the pizazz and gadgetry of 'Goldfinger'. It should be noted also that this book was written before Dr. No which is sort of important. The opening of the movie Dr No discusses Bond getting a new gun, this was caused by an incident in the book 'From Russia...' but ignored in the movie for obvious reasons.Anyway, I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seller,with great communication, has great stuff.","review":"This is a great book from a great seller.

I like how the first half of the book concentrates on Bond's enemies, The reader gets a real inside-look at the Russian side of espionage, the loyalty of Russian spies is quite remarkable as they really consider their homeland to be like their \\"mother\\" and appreciate everything the state has provided for them. I didn't mind at all that Bond was hardly mentioned for the first hundred pages, it made for a better build up when Bond must confront the villians. The espionage is this book is more deep and involving than in the other Bond Novels.

It is not completely seasoned in yet, but so far it is not sticky and cleans up quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"You must read the directions for seasoning this authentic Chinese wok very carefully and be willing to spend time scrubbing off the coating, painting it with oil, baking it twice, airing out the burning oil smell in your house, and burning pungent veggies in it... but that's how you season a wok! If you want a wok that comes ready to use, this one is not for you. Once that substantial bit of work was done, it made for an excellent addition to our kitchenware.

If I had read this book first, I probably would not be inclined to continue with this series. I felt like I was just dropped into the middle of a cast of characters without being properly introduced to them and what their roles are (history, etc.). The one thing that seems to be consistent is Cross' habit of long sentences infused with prepositional phrases and lots of words like however, therefore, etc. I realize the protagonist is an English professor, and I don't have any problem understanding the sentences, but I find myself getting impatient having to wade through all that excess just to get to the point of a sentence.

During those 15 pages, I found not one supportable fact. You get the feeling reading the book that the guy just sat down & wrote it one night.We already know most Hollywood & liberal types barely got out of high school, few went to college and I'd bet there isn't a single one of them who majored in public policy or administration.

Say what you want about some of the dull parts and cheap shots, this book needed to be written, and Hirsen is a vital man in Hollywood for doing so. These people are not only mostly ignorant schmucks, but arrogant and preachy at the same time. Good combination? They live wonderful lives of privilege, but find time to castigate America and capitalism at every turn, voting for the party of failure and demeaning those (policemen, military) whose yearly salaries are less than one pair of their shoes.

I hope this book will awaken more American servicemen, Christians, conservatives, the middle class, citizens of the \\"fly-over states\\" as the sophisticates like to call us, and others they don't like to realize these people are practicing propaganda in many formats, not just entertainment.Thanks Mr. Hirsten for writing the book many of us would like to have written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leftist Hollywood Uncover","review":"This book is great because it shows why the Libs in Hollywood are so hypocritical in their causes and shows why hollywood hates AMERICA.

But, it's all truth, and, it's about time that we learned how stupid these people are!

It is unbelievable how he faked an FAA license; a law degree from Harvard and enough bad checks to keep him in permanent retirement.If Frank's jetsetting life-style is too much to believe, then you will have a great time reading of his jail escapes by 1.) fishing himself down an airplane toilet and 2.) just simply walking out of prison after convincing guards he was undercover.This story is just to unbelievable not to read!

The Book may become a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you intend reading from cover to cover.","review":"What a great book! I found the book hard to put down as I needed to know what was going to happen next. I recommend purchasing this book but I also recommend not starting it until you have time to finish it. The first chapter may have started a little slow but once the stage has been set, the action doesn't stop. I had previously owned this book a few years ago and when I was looking to re-read it, I couldn't find it. I ended up purchasing another and it was worth it. Very enjoyable! I hope you like it as well as I enjoyed it. The best part was knowing that book is non-fiction... and it really happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"A charming, likeable con man you root for? Frank Abagnale IS that guy. Amazing to believe he got away with what he did (airline pilot, doctor, lawyer etc.) at a time in life when most kids are still trying to figure out what to major in. Even more amazing is how he turned everything around as an adult. Fast, enjoyable read.If you like this kind of likeable, conniving character, you may also like \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" & \\"Delano\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and far-fetched white-collar crime","review":"This is a flat and ultimately boring tale - incidentally, devoid of \\"fun,\\" despite its subtitle - that promises much more than it delivers. Abagnale's compulsive lying, the felonies it engendered, and the numerous women he met but never really seems to have known begs the question, \\"How did he get that way?\\" One would hope that the author would have wondered, too. One might assume that there was some terrible deficit somewhere in his early life. Unfortunately there is no introspection in this story, and no self-awareness, either.An autobiographical portrayal that, finally, allows the reader to think of Austin Powers as a deep, sensitive, and complex man. In addition, it's an unintentional catalogue, whether factual or not, of just how much a reasonably clever, ambitious, well-spoken, well-dressed middle-class white American male, intending to do harm, could get away with - albeit before Interpol. Depressing stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save time, save money","review":"Abagnale's a swindler, all right. If you paid good money to buy this book, he's swindled you out of it.Times and dates don't add up, for one thing. He contradicts himself, for another. It's readily apparent that this guy writes fiction, and even THAT'S not particularly readable.Watch paint dry instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antisocial Personality Disorder has its upside...","review":"I read the first edition of this book and was struck by how clearly the author's actions illustrated a psychopathic thought process. That he has chosen to channel his actions into a \\"socially acceptable\\" career makes for a fascinating read! Too often we are shown \\"profiles\\" of psychopaths in the serial-killer-with-cold-dead-eyes category. Here's the more common version... ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was MUCH better!","review":"I loved the movie, it inspired me to stop at the bookstore on the way home and buy the book. However, it read like a penthouse forum letter! (Not that I have much experience reading those...but, anyway!) It should have been called \\"Catch an STD from me! I got a lot of sex from foxes\\", he used the word foxes a lot in the book while refering to women. It just felt like he was a very insecure person, he needed to reiterate time and again how tall he was, how handsome he was, and how much he scored. But, he was a criminal, and most criminals are insecure. The movie I give 5 stars, it is very different from the book. I read the book in a day, so, it did hold my, if only to see if his writing could possibly get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abignale cons his way into the reader's heart","review":"Frank Abingale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"juvenile fiction","review":"Abagnale begins this tale of fraud in a voice that is somehow insecure--like a Jr. highschooler exagerating the details of his first date. I thought this might be atributed to his young age when the book begins. Unfortunately, the book progresses from start to finish in this shallow braggart's voice, providing little or no insight into the life of a \\"successful\\" grifter.The lack of writing skill and depth might say something about the sociopathic nature of the confidence game, but for me it only cast doubt on the truth of his so-called exploits. Could this person actually have posed as an M.D.?--a college professor? I was left with doubts. In short, it was a disappointment.I can't understand how so many readers find this drivel to be so impressive--..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat-free literature: tasteless without substance","review":"A true account of this man's life might truly be interesting if written by a more subjective source. The hyberbole and bravado laced in this tale exposes it for what it is- another con, this time on the reader! There might be some basis in fact to some of these stories, but what we are left with are simply written \\"vignettes\\" without any insight into the man who generated these charades. The book ends apruptly without any resolution. This material might have made a mildly interesting (if poorly written) magazine piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't watch the movie. READ THE BOOK!! It's AWESOME!!","review":"If it was real, well I have only to say that my hat goes off for you Mr. Abagnale..This is one of the best books I've ever read in my life, it's funny, ingenious and much, much better than the movie.. The adventures described by Mr. Abagnale take you directly into the trouble he went to get what he wanted, pure determination, a lot of brains and just plain mischief is what makes the story great.I truly advise that you read this book, for it will soon be a classical!! Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe & Hardly Modest","review":"The author's exploits may have been true, but I doubt they were accurately reflected in this book. I was skeptical of the non-stop cons and impersonations performed by Abagnale, not to mention the bragging details. This book started out good but was not very interesting for the most part due to its far-fetched nature.I would like to have found out how the author ended up on the right side of the law but the book ended abruptly and left me hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW TO SUCCEED AS A TOTAL DIRTBAG!","review":"This guy actually seems proud of his exploits. Wow. Has he no shame? And why does our world embrace the bottom of the barrel like this? It's an interesting read...but like the movie \\"The People Vs. Larry Flynt\\" it glorifies someone who is deviant and destructive, then people cheer him on. I don't get it! But the bigger the creep/con man/hellraiser you are in this world...the more the gullable public wants to hear about you. What a shame. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abagnale Meets Walter Mitty","review":"I realize it was a different world in the 1960's & 1970's, but some of Mr. Abagnale's alleged exploits are, frankly, beyond the realm of credibility. (He traveled throughout Europe with an entire entourage of airline stewardess'. Better yet, no one in the group was aware they were scamming their way across Europe!). This book is simply an amusing tale. Save your money and look for this book at a yard sale or even on eBay. This book was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting read","review":"A highly entertaining and amusing book about a very crafty fellow. Curl up with this book on a rainy Sunday afternoon and enjoy Abagnale's wit and exploits. The revelation about French prisons is shocking. Did anybody say that France is a developed country??? The contrast with the Swedish prison system could not be greater. If you are going to commit a crime in Europe, go north (avoid the Mediterranean countries). It would be interesting to meet Abagnale in person. Glad he ended up using his creativity and intelligence on the right side of the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun read","review":"The true story (well, maybe, considering the source) of Frank Abnigale, the world's youngest and most successful check forger and impersonator. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"You don't normally think of true crime books as being funny, as well as entertaining. But this is not your average true crime book, and Frank Abagnale was not your average criminal. I kept thinking that if this kid (most of his crimes were committed while he was still in his teens) had used his ample smarts toward something more societally productive, then he could have made his fortunes legally and avoided the jail stints, including his horrifying 6 months in a French prison. Luckily, he has since turned his life around and is using his expertise on criminal activity toward the betterment of society. You go, Frank!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"beware the co-author","review":"Over the years I've read this book three times and enjoyed it immensely each time. After the first reading I loaned it to a friend who read only a few pages before quitting in disgust. Abagnale certainly does come across as arrogant and boastful. A couple of years ago I searched online bookstores to buy the book and read it again, and I realized that Abagnale may have been a victim himself. Since he was not a writer, his publisher gave the writing assignment to someone named Stan Redding. (A search of Amazon's database shows no other books credited to Redding.) Maybe Abagnale is/was as obnoxious as the book made him seem, but there is also a strong possibility that Redding decided to give him that persona in the book. Read the book and enjoy it for what it is, without judging Abagnale's personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vicarious ride!","review":"This is the reason why spy movies, detective novels, and superhero movies work - we always dream of being this cool, this rich, this courageous - and Abagnale is the real life version of the Bond, Pretender, The Saint, etc. The adventures are exciting, entertaining, and even educational! Plus, there is a perfect element of heart and soul in his story - a broken home, a delusional kid, an intelligent thief, a horrible experience, etc. I had originally bought this because it has been picked up by a movie studio, and Leo DiCaprio has agreed to play the lead. It has a great movie feel to it. This book is so worth reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Questionable","review":"Book represents accounts inflated, if not outright pure fiction. Wish I had good rememberance of that Univ of South Carolina mention somewhere connected with this con-author that Mr Abagnale was once invited to speak at the school but declined. Seems, allegedly, someone there had the goods on him as to veracity of the accounts depicted in book. If not actually scared off, Abagnale is likely a 60's-era con whose exploits and other would hardly pass in todays 2000-era technology. Somehow he must have the gift of gab and front a speaker's bureau to yadda yadda in front of unsuspecting groups which likely wouldn't have the mentality to question Abagnale on anything. Abagnale's laugh is that his con is still on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Golly How The Truth Will Out","review":"I was the Chairman of the Lecture Comittee of the Student Union of University of SC in 1982. We booked Frank Abaganale for a paid speech about his book and exploits. Prior to his appearance we heard rumours that he was not what he said he was. We asked our area Police to run a \\"rap sheet\\" on him. Absolutly nothing showed up on it. According to their records he had never been arrested, served time or had a warrant out for his arrest. On the day of his speech we asked him to sign a simple statement that what he was about to say was true. He refused, cancelled the booking and all other dates booked through colleges. He claimed he had no need to defend himself. In our research we could find no records of any of his exploits Believe what you will. The book was a \\"fun\\" read."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY SUSPICIOUS","review":"Have read many reviews from people who have discovered discrepancies. For one thing, the U of South Carolina club that called him ahead of time, ahead of his planned lecture there, regarding discrepancies---Abagnale never showed up. The State Police helping him load money into his car is too far fetched to even believe. These reviews from young people: before you go gah gah, ask a wiser person this question: Is this guy Abagnale stretching everything or some things?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating quick read!","review":"\\"Catch Me If You Can\\" never fails to keep the reader's attention from beggining to end. It amazes me how Mr. Abagnale was able to mascarade as a pilot, professor, doctor, FBI agent, and a whole slew of other professions without ever being caught.As Mr. Abagnale writes on his web site, this book is not intended to be a biography but a fictionalized account. Thus, some of the details may have been altered and some of the plot may have been dramatized. I would have liked to have known exactly which parts of the book were true and which are fictionalized. But nonetheless, I would highly reccomend reading this fast-paced, exciting book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Interesting True Story","review":"\\"Catch Me If You Can\\" is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. For non-fiction fans, this book is a \\"Must Read\\". The book proves that truth is stranger, and more interesting that fiction. Frank Abagnale is one of the most interesting characters that I have ever read about. His life of deception is truly amazing. He impersonates a commercial airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and more with amazing results. His intelligence and creative thinking keep him one step ahead of the law for years, while he lives the life of a successful professional when, in reality, he is not yet out of his teens. His ability to outwit others is hilarious and scary at the same time. I'm happy that Frank is now a letigitimate financial success and I can't wait to see the new movie based on the book. The movie is scheduled to come out in December, 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast reads leaves you craving substance","review":"The story pulls you in immediately and moves right along, but you soon become aware that you are actively spending time and money to listen to a liar. This makes you feel like his current sucker. The decsription of banking procedures at that time are interesting, but by the end of the book the complete lack of either introspection or interst in another human being make it all just a long-winded boast. It left me wanting to read an account of the same material written by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Non-Stop True Criminal Story","review":"Catch Me If You CanIn the autobiography of Frank Abagnale's life, \\"Catch Me if You Can\\", Frank is on the run from twelve European governments and the United States' FBI. Over the course of his criminal exploits across the world, he falls in love with numerous woman and swindles checks worth over $2.5 million. He disguises himself as a doctor, lawyer, college professor and an airplane pilot. This is a story about overcoming difficulties and making something out of nothing. Frank now works for the FBI preventing the same thing he did for more than 5 years. Justice is always served for those that need correcting. Everyone that loves non-stop criminal stories will love this book because there are twists at every turn. However, the end of the story is a cliffhanger which may be a drawback for some. For everyone else though, this book engages one as to how such a master plan could be pulled off by a single teenage boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great to meet the real frank abagnale -!","review":"to meet the real Frank Abagnale was fansinating - the french prison was worst in book than movie - & he showed the words of the times calling the ladies \\"hot foxes\\" many times - still can't believe his story - pretty close to the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Kick in the Head","review":"I gave it 4 stars only because I reserve 5-star ratings for books I could not have lived without reading, so to speak. But it is a fascinating account, and if you like knowing that it's a big world out there with people doing interesting things, you'll probably enjoy this book. Abagnale is obviously intelligent and likes to have fun -- an infectious combination. I'm interested now in reading his follow-up,The Art of the Steal: How to Protect Yourself and Your Business from Fraud, America's #1 Crime. I suspect his advice will be more helpful than the dispirited, obfuscating \\"instructions\\" of the credit reporting agencies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is the Biggest Con of All","review":"The book purports to be the escapades of a mid-1960s con man. The biggest con is getting anyone to pay good money or to spend good time reading it. I spent 10 cents for the book at a yard sale and took it to the beach for a light read -- and I was ripped off. The awful writing and ridiculously outdated sexual phrasing made this one of the most painful reads I've had in a long time.Is the book true? I have no idea -- and it doesn't matter. The author is so thoroughly dislikeable and pompous that you just don't care.It's not often that I'd tell someone to see the movie rather than read the book. But this is one of those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime tales from a most adventurous angle","review":"I don't know how much poetic license came into play. But regardless, it's a terrific tale. I'm just glad he's now on the right side of the law...we hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank Abagnale","review":"I was at a convention a few years ago where Frank Abagnale, spoke of the stories in this book. His astounding and confounding stories of his life intrigued me to buy the book. It is a book I couldn't put down, even when my eyes were tired and sleepy. The movie was entertaining but was only a short version of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will keep you up all night","review":"I wore out two of these books by handing them out to friends. Amazing story that after my own childhood I know is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun page turner teaches me to be more bold and creative","review":"What fascinates me the most is Abagnale's guts to try the things he did. I attribute his success to two things.One, he is willing to try things others dismiss as impossible. For instance, he posed as an airline pilot. Few passengers or airline crew members would imagine that the person flying the plane was a fake. Abagnale was certainly practitioner of the motto \\"take the path less trodden.\\" Perhaps willingness to try one's hand at the uncommon and the unthinkable is an important trait for an investment career.Two, luck. Survivorship bias. There must have been other fakes that got caught at some point. Abagnale is one of the sample paths that managed to survived the longest.Very well-told story. Smooth transitions from an anecdote to the next. Rich usage of funny expressions.Interesting comparison between the prison systems of France/Italy and Sweden as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Better than the Film","review":"If you enjoyed the movie starring Leo, read this book, if you DIDN'T like the movie, then DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK. I love a good confidence scam. And Frank Abagnale claims to have pulled off almost all of them. It is great to see the cat mouse game he plays with the authorities and how he gets out of jam after jam by simply lying about everything to everyone.Yes this is a book about a criminal, but the years he spent in a french prison i think paid for his crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible (Non)Ending","review":"Except for the ending, I would have rated this book somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. But when I reached the end I felt like someone had ripped out the last pages. We know (from the beginning of the book) that he served time in prison in the US, and that he eventually went to work for the FBI. What had my curiosity as much as anything throughout the book was how he made the transition from crook to crook-catcher - and I was totally disappointed to find out that none of that is included.If you like reading books where someone has...discarded the last half, then this is the book for you.Someone wrote in another review that they thought the earlier editions had a more complete ending, with updates of what the author was doing at the time. If that is so, I would recommend searching for one of the earlier editions and not waste your money on this disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This was a very fascinating and fun read but entirely different than the movie which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. That's why I bought the book. I would say the movie is very loosely based on this book. I highly recommend both to anybody who likes fun and wants a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the book you will love the movie","review":"This is one of the best book I ever read. I thought it got realy into his mind so you know how he thought and felt at that time in his life. I loved the movie it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I thought the movie was a lot beter than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read","review":"This book was interesting. I haven't seen the movie, but Frank Abagnale impressed me with his ability to transform himself. The book is written quite simply, making it a quick read, but worth the time it takes to read it. This story doesn't really have a sort of moral highground or super-enlightening sense to it, but it's a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie, skip the book","review":"The troubled boy's quest to re-unite his separated parents, the innocence of simpler times, the glamor of American Cold War chic--well, there hinted at here. But the place descriptions are flat, the dialogue is wooden and the family dynamic is never fully developed. A notable exception--Frank Abagnale's vivid description of his life in a French prison. I think this is one of those cases where the movie will transcend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liars and other Liars","review":"Anybody who crossed paths with either Frank Abagnale OR Stan Redding probably knows not to believe anything either of them writes.Too bad we don't have a National Truth Squad. Of course there wouldn't be nearly as many schlocky books.It's a fun read, but NOT factual,"},{"rating":"1","title":"his biggest con yet -- posing as a \\"writer\\"","review":"The writing in this book is horrifically bad. Don't believe me? Read the first two sample pages provided on this site. I would call the writing moronic, but that would be too unkind to the morons of the world.Another problem is the story itself. The man opens his book with a tale where he risks the lives of some 140 passengers on an airliner, as he is at the plane's controls, though doesn't know how to fly. Yup! This is something to brag about.Then, on the same page, the author boasts of milking innocent people out 2.5 million dollars by age 21. Quite an accomplishment. And to think most of us only get through college by that age.Imagine if Mr. Abagnale devoted his life to, say, selfless, noble undertakings for no reason other than doing good. Now that&#65533;d be something to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving true (?) story of a con man","review":"First--definitely an entertaining and fast moving book. It kept me on the edge of my chair and was a quick read. It was a nice accompaniment to the movie and was great to have some of the details that the movie left out. However, it's still hard not to be skeptical of this guy. Once you're a con-man, it's gotta be hard to leave that behind. So, while I generally buy the story, in the back of my mind I wonder how much of it is embellished.... Regardless, this was a fun read and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down - Fascinating!","review":"This book will have you rooting for the bad guy! He is larger than life, smooth-talking, and above all, gutsy. You won't believe the things he comes up with to get himself out of trouble - if I remember correctly he escaped from police custody 4 times (using 4 completely different tactics). Several reviewers have criticized the book because this guy is arrogant, but so many of my favorite stories have characters (like James Bond) with big egos, so I loved it. Truth or fiction? I don't know, but either way, it is a fun read. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner","review":"If you have seen the movie, and read the book, then you know that even though the movie is decent, it doesn't hold a candle to the book. This is a work of genius. Focus on The Family radio played Frank Abagnale's testimony, and it sounds almost unbelievable, but there's things in here that you can't talk about and just make up to talk about. I read the chapter about the French prison system. To just imagine the conditions of being confined like that, WHEW! The most accurate part in the movie had to be when he impersonated a doctor, and when it came down to it, went before a medical board, answered a few questions (which the movie didn't show), and became not only a pediatrician, but the head pediatrician down south in a hospital. Amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the movie first?","review":"If you, like me, have seen the film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks and are playing with the idea of reading the book, you are reading the right review! If you were in front of me, I would look at you with a grin (as if to show that I knew something you didn't) and encourage you to do so.Frank Abagnale is less likable in the book, which is to be expected, but is still far from what we would consider a true villain. It caught me by surprise about halfway through how I was so fascinated by a crook with little or no moral values. I suppose this is how we live out our own bit of villainy. Overall, a fun read that may possibly help you appreciate the film even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining!","review":"This book really got me from the start. The author's excellent narrative style made for a fun read. He also uses metaphors very skillfully throughout, and some of the more humorous ones even made me laugh out loud.I had a hard time putting it down at times. The intelligence of this guy to pull some of this stuff off is incredible! I don't condone or justify stealing and lying, but the stories are amazing nonetheless.Read the book! I promise you'll be entertained at the true adventures of this young man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you tried to do today what you read in Frank Abagnales humorous account of his one boy crime spree in the mid to late 1960s you couldn't get away with it. The security hole in paper instruments have long been closed by document consultants, including the reformed Abagnale. Airline security was tightened drasticly long before 9/11.So is the prospective con man out of luck? Hardly each new technology produces its own security flaws. In an age of identity crime, it should come as no surprise that the smarted and more sophesticated the technology becomes, the smarter and more sophesticated the con man becomes.Attention to detail, steel nerves and fantastic luck will get you far in the con business, but it will also get you thown in prison sooner or later. Abagnale's story is a modern morality tale, whose ultimate lesson; \\"there's no such thing as a free lunch\\" should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Read","review":"This book was one of the most entertaining I have ever read. It was both funny and interesting. The life he (Frank Abangale) led was amazing. After reading this book, I cant wait to see the movie. I highly recomend this book for any one that can read. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still worth it...","review":"Okay, so the lack of an actual ending literally made me scream, but it was still worth it!

I suspect that there are many people like this. But F.A. managed to do it ten fold...The ending though needs improvement. We know that he has worked for the past 25 years for the FBI. What we don't know is how he was caught and how he wound up working for the feds...Curious..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This is very readable book.The author is clearly a crook but a likable one.The scams he comes up with during the 60\\"s are humorous and feasible.Book reads like a novel.

It sure would be interesting to read about how he got from where he was to a respectable figure in society.Read this book you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This is a hard to believe but impossible to put down true life account of Frank Abagnale's early life. I could not believe the situations he was able to get away with and how close he came to getting caught on numerous occasions. I recommend this book to everyone that wants an interesting journey into the life of one of the best con men in the world. You will never forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Know problem: TLC shipped with invalid product keys","review":"This game is amazing! I'm a huge fan of the Fable series (except the new stuff, III was disappointing and Heros and The Journey are Microsoft ruining a good thing).HOWEVER!!!!It's important that you should know that it is a known issue with Microsoft that many copies of Fable: The Lost Chapters were shipped with invalid Product Keys. Also, Microsoft no longer sells or supports this game and cannot/will not provide you with a working Key, even if you provide them with a valid part number of their choice.If you are like me and purchased the game without knowing this, then look online for recommendations on how to resolve the issue. If you paid for a game, you should be able to play it, regardless of whether Microsoft supports the game anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning this game has problems","review":"Although this game as reviewed by others might be fun please know that there is NO SUPPORT. The game has a lot of loading and saving problems and there are a lot of people that can not play it on their computers. All of the sites for this game say that eventually they will come up with a patch to fix their serious problems but that has not happened yet. You may be buying a game that you cannot play. Their only advice is to play something else until, or if, they get these issues resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I bought this because it was inexpensive. I was quite suprised to find out how much fun it is. It is simpler than Oblivion and more linear, but it is very entertaining. If you like RPG's I recommend this highly. I beleive Fable 2 is coming out next year. Try this first to get an idea of what to expect with newer graphics and open play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Don't be fooled - Fable: the Lost Chapters is nothing more than an expansion pack (and a pretty limited one at that). I got this for my husband because we both enjoyed the original Fable, despite its shortcomings. From the way this one was marketed, you'd suppose that it was the same world, same character, with some new adventures. Instead, it's the same game with just a few added missions tacked on at the end. You have to play the entire game over again (can't import an old game from the first Fable) and in the end, for all that work you've done, you get just a few new missions. Not worth it at all.So - if you haven't played the first, go ahead and get this one - it'll be fun. But if you have played the first, don't believe the ambiguous packaging promising something new - if you want new adventures, just get a new game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unstable","review":"The game runs great, unless it decides to randomly crash to desktop. Furthermore, the inability to save when ever you want combined with the random crashes makes the game difficult to penetrate. Inquiries to microsoft about tech support results in their suggestion that you reinstall windows. Even though every other piece of software runs fine and the only problem is with Fable.

When we tried to load this game (also used) on there, the only thing it did was replay the loading screen over and over again. In so thinking that it was the used game, we went out and BOUGHT a brand new one from a different store, hoping to return the old one. This, however, turned out to not be the case. The new one did the same thing as the old one and when we tried to return it, we were told that they would trade it for the same game. We already had two defective games, why would we want a third? When I called Microsoft for a refund, they told me that I would have to talk to the retailer. Alotta good that does me since that's where I had just come from.

Although it's not necessary to play this one to understand the second, there are some refrences and its overall a very good game.

I can't say I vehemently disliked it because it was, in its own way, an acceptible introduction to Gilbert & Sullivan for children. This sort of programming is not uncommon for introductions to opera, operetta, and other classics, and I've certainly seen worse. Even as a self-proclaimed G&S purist, I am still not adverse to reasonable experimentation and adaptation - as this film most certainly is! - but also (as a purist) I had to cringe at some of the truly drastic changes made to the original, and I don't think that 70's pop music mixes well with G&S, either, and why on earth are most of the characters fat? They may as well have turned this over to a Japanese anime studio, which would have probably done a better job at adaptation.

His characters seem both to themselves and to us to descend into this dark hole of apostasy, damnation, and doubt over the course of the book, but in the end, one is left with the strange paradoxical feeling that that very descension was somehow the life of faith and love of the Christian. This is part of what makes me love Graham so much, and specifically \\"Heart of the Matter.\\" He understands the heart of the believer, and what he tells us - if we are honest - is painful. But there's a comfort in it, if for nothing else that Graham normalizes it for us. Those of who are believers in God, yet who wrestle somewhere between love of him and hatred for him, between faith and doubt, are reminded that perhaps we are not abnormal. That is how I felt reading this book, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel, buy another edition","review":"I am not going to say much more about this great novel, as there are plenty of good reviews.My only problem is with this edition with a preface & comment by James Woods.

Religion has not been rejected but in a way rather integrated to an idea of life but it extracts its price for life to claim its own place. Major Scobie didn't know that the love that never existed between him and Louise would not be honoured even by mistake after his death. He was mistaken to assume that he was setting Helen free from the sin and trouble of their love by his death. Everything remains the same vindicating Heart and even religion at the end!

It looks like sand.The worst part is that after I stained the piece, some of the wood filler bubbled up, causing ugly bumps that needed to be sanded down and restained.

Thats when I discovered that this wood filler is not all its cracked up to be. I was able to see the areas I filled in and it looks blotchy! I'm so mad!

Technically she was harboring a murderer! Once she realizes that he WAS the murderer, she must have been devastated.Some say Anne shouldn't have capitalized on her special relationship with the Petersons, but the truth is they used HER. I can't imagine how traumatic it must have been for her to know this guy held her baby during its christening! After all she went through helping this murderer, Scott, she deserves the income and peace of mind that this book hopefully has given her.I love Anne's writing and hope this will not be her only book. I think she should write more - fiction or non-fiction - she's truly gifted. She's so level headed, a great mother and wife, a loyal and loving family member to those who raised & care for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Bird it a nasty person","review":"I liked the book. I would have liked to have met Laci as she seems to have been a nice person.But really the author Anne Bird is kind of nasty and petty. For example she complains about Scott Peterson going out to diner with the extended family and ordering a nice bottle of wine while her husband had the house wine and she got stuck kicking in more money than she felt fair when they split the bill. She really has some issues and needs to seek professional help, lots of anger there from her being given up for adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bood Money","review":"This book is a shameless attempt to cash in on a famous case and nothing more. Ms. Bird's 33 reasons are the proof of this crass motive because, to put it mildly, they are lame.For example, Ms. Bird says that because Scott arrived at her home in a variety of cars is proof that he killed Laci. Because Scott maintained his pool, this is proof that he drowned Laci in the pool. I'm not giving away any of the book, because Ms. Bird has already discussed these points in the media.The author came from a privileged background and apparently lacks the compassion to appreciate the difficult circumstances that led to her birth mother, Jackie giving her up for adoption. If Ms Bird were an honest person, she would admit that she was influenced by the media witch hunt surrounding the Laci Peterson case, and that is what convinced her of Scott's guilt, rather than the 33 reasons she describes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a terrilble book.

There were many mistakes in print, making some passages difficult to understand and some of the pages were missing the last few words on the right side of the pages which was maddening. Also, the picture section was so small they were more like thumbnails and almost impossible to see!There are a few questions I have: what was the significance of mentioning Scott wearing his wedding ring?

Anne Bird took advantage of the fact that she was family to make a quick buck. She claims to be the best of friends with Laci, although they met roughly four times. She must have said \\"He's my brother\\" 900 times. She makes it sound like she was the only person who believed that Scott Peterson was innocent, and stood by him until the very end.

I eagerly purchased this and Catherine Criers book when they came out. This 'Anne' comes across as petty and jealous with not as much insight as she portrays. The 33 reasons she gives for Scott's guilt are her own personal feelings, and some already known circumstances. What I got from this book is that Ms. Bird was intoduced to the Petersons in 1998 and hung around for some parties and good times. She decides that she is above them, withdraws, and writes a book exploiting her family. I don't see how she was close to any of them and this book was written in poor tase, I think. I don't think much of the Peterson family and Anne is no exception. They deserve each other.I definantly believe Scott is guilty but his own sister backstabbing him is a bit much. That family has some serious issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time","review":"This book is proof that anyone can write a book and get it published. I kept wondering to myself if Amber Frey had helped her write this as it was about as enlightening as hers. I didnt feel there were any real revelations and so much \\"filler\\" writing, details that were not important to the book. I personally think she is acting out of anger for being given up for adoption and may have a drinking problem. If you must read the book, wait for it on paperback.

While I'm sure that she knew and loved Laci, her claims of condering her a \\"sister\\" and the extreme closeness she shared with her & Scott seems unlikely, since she never once visited them at their home, nor did she ever meet Laci's family. This was a tragedy for all involved, but the book is superficial, and contains many facts that were well reported in the media. Save your money and buy Catherine Crier's book, a much better take on the Peterson investigation and trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This book will basically tell you everything that you already know from watching Nancy Grace and CNN. I do think that Scott Peterson is the scum of the earth, however, this book in no way proves that he committed murder. Sorry, but it's true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This was a very disappointing read. Anne Bird offered no real insights to why she believed her brother was guilty. The writing was terrible and all the stories were contrived. The editor should have done a better job. The author was pretty much rambling in no direction until the end of the book. It was also obvious throughout the book that she wasn't really a part of the Peterson family, \\"in the know\\" or very close to Laci. The fact that she's trying to turn her various encounters at holiday functions into something more was very apparent. Save your money and borrow it from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood Brother by Anne Bird","review":"Anne Bird could have and should have asked questions when she had the opportunity. I was disappointed in the way she said she handled her relationship with Scott. All in all the book proved to be anticlimactic and it would have been better to just write all this in a journal or diary. It was mostly about her and her feelings or lack thereof.When I finished reading the book, I said \\"What a loser.\\" Simultaneously Anne Bird's and Scott Peterson's faces appeared in my minds eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the reasons??","review":"This is just another person making money from the deaths of Laci and Conner Peterson. Ms. Bird comes across as a very jealous sister, jealous of Laci and her beauty and jealous of Scott and his relationship with his Mother.I read this book through to the end and then I went back and re-read her \\"reasons\\" she believed that Scott was guilty. First of all, they weren't reasons, just senseless drivel drummed up by the publishing company and author to make it appear that there was actually a reason for her to believe in Scott's guilt.When she talks about her son going missing she doesn't let us know that he was \\"lost\\" in a hotel room with all his relatives and was located within a minute or so. The rest of the reasons are also misleading nonsense. Thank God I got this book from the library and didn't waste my money on it nor put any money in Bird's pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I cannot believe this woman actually wrote this book. Yes, her story about reconnecting with her birthmother was interesting but just because Scott Peterson happened to be her brother doesn't mean she needed to write a book about it. Anne Bird is making money from this. It's revolting. I honestly think she just wanted to make some easy money and get some attention. She has nothing to add that we don't already know concerning his guilt. She wasn't ask to testify, so obviously the procecutors didn't feel she had anything to add. I think that their mother delivered two sociopaths, one to kill and one to profit from it. This woman is a piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"read if you want to know what scott was doing while lacey was missing","review":"i enjoyed reading the book. it is very easy to read and it gives good insight into a sister's true love, albeit \\"blind love,\\" the creepy side of scott peterson, and how different family members dealt with the tragedy. a better read is \\"inside the mind of scott peterson,\\" keith ablow. now he gives insight to how family members DIDN'T deal with the tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"eureka","review":"Her skin, her hair, her smile, her dimples. Lacey- the doll-like bride. Scott is the golden child and his adoptive sister has a butt load of info about his relationship and wants to air the family's dirty laundry. HMMMMMMMM. Maybe she killed Lacey and framed her bro in order to get rid of the \\"golden boy\\". It would be an interesting twist if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"sold her REAL family out","review":"I did find the book interesting,however the more I read I was shocked by the fact that she involved her REAL parents in this cesspool. I am sure they were embarrased and maybe even frightened. She gave Scott a key to her parents cabin at Lake Arrowhead, plus a key to their home in San Diego. Her husband made it clear to her that he did not want this guy in his house and she would whine \\"He's my little brother\\". She owed nothing to the Petersons yet she drug her family through this sewer. She admits her marriage is in trouble. Anne you should have thought about the people you REALLY owe something to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my opinion","review":"Not worth the paper its printed on. Sour grapes it looks like, her mother gave her away and kept Scott, not only that they were well off. I take what she says with a grain of salt. I truly believe shes just trying to cash in on a tragedy. She should be ashamed of what she is doing to her family !! Would you write a book like this about your brother?? Just as sick as Amber Frey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne, why the need?","review":"I had thought Scott was guilty. Then I found out he was my cousin (as are you, we share the same great-great grandparents). So I started researching the case. How can a man be convicted on the way the media portrays him? Anne, I am confused about why you felt the need to write this book when Scott had already been convicted? Also, you failed to provide any compelling evidence to me to prove his guilt. It's heartbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong with the world today?","review":"How can you people who liked this book actually say its something everyone who likes a good suspense should read!? This is about two families who's lives have been completely destoryed televised for people's sick pleasure.I saw on the news all those losers who cheered when Peterson was convicted. \\"Yay, lets all cheer for a man who we never met face to face who is going to get the death sentance\\" Sick, sick, sick!I especially hate all those people who follow the story detail for detail, for Gods sake people, get some lives quick before you realize you are making complete (...) out of yourselves.You people need to realize that if his own sister or mother, or whoever wrote this book from hell itself would do this, think of how sick and demented you were if you actually followed this case!Go ahead, click the un helpful button, I dare you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What people will do for money!!!!!!!!!","review":"(Well a kid at heart at least)As Ron Grantsky stated, this is her claim to fame, and how shockingly low people will go to make a name and money for themselves....I do agree that Jackie Peterson is also a sociopath though, I am one of two children given up for adoption as well, and the child kept is my mother's \\"golden child\\" too, so I definately relate to that, however I would never betray my own sense of dignity by writing a book about one of my family members to profit from them, that is despicable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cha - ching!","review":"Another lame attempt to line the wallets of Gloria Allerd and two more \\"victims\\" of Scott. Spend your money on something important...a local womens' shelter, childrens' hospital, Lacie and Conor's memorial fund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another person profiting on Laci & the baby's death","review":"I just think it is sick, all of the people (including Amber Frey) who are jumping at the chance to profit off of a tragic death of two innocents. I am sure that Laci's parents were offered book deals too, but they actually knew and loved Laci and would not put out a book like this. SICK PEOPLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see the relationship","review":"Yep, this one is related to Scott Peterson. No talent for anything but trying to get money off a young, dead woman. It IS disgraceful. Money never lasts, reputation goes with you to the grave. Hope she visits Lacy and baby Peterson's graves and lets them know how thankful she is to be getting her pieces of silver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"I wouldn't care what my brother did -- I'd stand by his side and would NOT write a book trashing him. If I knew he was guilty? I'd kick his butt personally, but I would not make money from it. Family is family and blood is blood. Her brother is in jail and is probably going to be executed. Why would she trash her brother like this? TO MAKE MONEY! She betrayed her own brother for money. Scott is absolutely guilty -- there is no doubt about that. I have no respect for a sister who would make money from this. I would still love my brother and try to understand what he did -- not that I would ever condone it. I'd still be his sister til the end -- when he's executed. Which he deserves -- but I'd tell him before he took that walk -- that I still love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed It!","review":"Anne Bird answered a lot of my questions concerning her personal upbringing and how she began her relationship with her biological mother, Jackie Peterson.I found her book to be very sincere and honest. While I didn't learn very much about the activities of Scott Peterson, as mostly everything in this regard has been discussed or brought out in other media,she did give insight into some of the Peterson \\"clan\\" and how they operate. I think if you are interested in this convicted double murder by Scott Peterson, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Thank goodness I only spent 50 cents for this book at a thrift store and still feel like I was ripped off. Anne Bird wrote this for her gain. She had only meet Laci a few times but professes to have been so close to her. What a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash Backs of the Casey Anthony Case","review":"This Book was very interesting! I have never been faced with anything like this but how far do you go for ANYONE when ALL the facts point to a certain person. This book reminded me a lot of the Casey Anthony case with all the lies, lies and more lies and the mother (and sister) sticking up for him even after it was layout in cold blood! The sister finally comes around but the mother is still in Cindy Anthony denial! I understand loving your children to no end as I have 6 but I dont think I would be so blind as Jacky Peterson or Cindy Anthony! And if I knew what they know I would not back my child. I would love them but would not back their evil ways.Anyway, this book is definately worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Reading","review":"It is obvious that Anne Bird is a new author, however do not let this shy you away from this book. You get another perspecive of how many lives that what Scott Peterson did were affected. I personally like to follow this type of people watching as there are always so many victims in crime. Anne Bird is also one of those victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"33 Problems I had with this book","review":"I purchased this book after Ann Bird's appearance on Oprah with the hopes of getting an inside look at the Petersons, who seem to be a very dark and dysfunctional family. However, Ms. Bird did not deliver on anything new or substantive. I also came away with the impression that her relationship with Laci wasn't as close as she would have had readers believe and that her book was more an opportunistic vehicle for cashing in on the Rocha family tragedy than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"While the book did not strike me as being written by someone looking to cash in on a tragedy, I have to say that I am not sure what her the author's mission in this was. The title indicated that she had 33 of her own reasons why she believed Scott killed Laci. So I was under the impression that the author would spend time actually talking about these 33 reasons. She did not. She merely mentions a list of the 33 reasons why she believes her brother to be guilty, but doen't really expand on any of them. And they really are not what I consider good enough reasons to write a book much less call it \\"33 Reasons why Scott Peterson is Guilty\\". It's misleading. So if you think the author has anything profound to say, forget it. Other than that, I thought the book was just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for it to come out in paperbook","review":"Anne Bird does not really shed any new light on the whole Peterson case. She did however manage to explain the whole Jackie Peterson/adoption thing. Wow! She should be very happy not to be affiliated with this family. What a bunch of losers! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Called it \\"Blood Sister\\" Instead","review":"I have absolutely no love lost nor sympathy for Scott Peterson. But the fact that this book was even written is repulsive to me. To betray a family you claim you want to know better for a few bucks is insane. Haven't Scott's parents been through enough?Oh, and there was nothing earth shattering in this book. No new tidbits of info. Just a tattletale book from a spoiled and greedy family member. (Don't buy the book, do like I did -- read someone else's!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get it for 0.37 and that's all it's worth.","review":"I support the other comment made by a poster:Editor, where were you when this book was written? The writing is so terrible. Maybe .37 is too much for this book actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I honesty think this woman just wanted to make some easy money and get some attention. She has nothing to add that we don't already know concerning his guilt. She wasn't ask to testify, so obviously the procecutors didn't feel she had anything to add. I think that their mother delivered two sociopaths, one to kill and one to profit from it. This woman is a piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor: Where were you?","review":"Although the story was compelling, the writing was horrible, and I have wondered who edited this writing for the author! I think I've seen enough of the Scott Peterson story---it's too bad that poor Laci (and Conner) couldn't have seen the real person he was. As I reflect back on this book, I feel the sister wrote it for publicity for herself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blood is thicker than water?","review":"Scott Peterson is Anne Birds brother by an accident of birth. I read this book thinking of Anne Bird as a stupid drama queen who likes to be the center of attention. If you are into real life crime ....don't bother!Its all about her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad depiction of odd people","review":"With all due respect to the author...I have no idea why this short read was ever published. Unpleasant Christmas stories should be mentioned perhaps....but not written down. The only good thing I can say is that it took little time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlow Excels at Comedy","review":"I've seen alot of Harlow films, and in my opinion, this is one of the best. It's funny, upbeat, and although the costumes aren't as striking as in some of her other films, I think that it suits her character. Harlow is perfectly cast and in her element in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Jean Harlow Vehicle by Anita Loos","review":"Sam Wood is the director of THE GIRL FROM MISSOURI but this movie so thoroughly marked an \\"Anita Loos film\\". The legendary comic author/screenwriter never had a better actress for her stories than the beautiful, talented and totally endearing Jean Harlow and the Harlow/Loos combo whipped up a number of classic motion pictures. MISSOURI is one of the less known of the bunch but it's a fine comedy of a sexy gal from the wrong side of the tracks who is bound and determined to land a rich husband but all she seems to land is trouble. The influence of Loos' famous novel GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is unmistakable on this original screenplay right down to having the brunette sex-obsessed (as opposed to money-obsessed) best friend. Lots of laughs in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wifes undies.","review":"I was pleased with the promptness of delivery and the packaging of these products.

They are very well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best underwear period!","review":"Love, love, love this undergarment!

They fit true to size (according to the measurements given in the Product Information section), are super soft, and really don't ride up. As other reviewers mentioned, they also look sleek and modern -- and look nothing like the granny panty look.I'm definitely going to be buying more and replacing all my old undies with these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the best underwear","review":"I discovered these a couple years ago at a department store. I have purchased them several times, slowly phasing out all my uncomfortable panties... It is easy to feel spoiled wearing these, since they are comfortable and pretty, also they are reasonably priced. Not only do these feel great on, as several reviews attest, but they also look good (new, really) after many machine washings. I air dry mine, which I think keeps them nicer, as well. Since I know the colors and the size I want, I really love being able to have them shipped to my front door, via Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pantie ever","review":"I have bought about 15 pairs of these panties in the past month or so and love them. I used to get the same style pantie from Lane Bryant's Cacique collection, and they are very comfortable, especially in warm weather. These have enough coverage for men(like myself)and women. Yes, I am a man who wears these, they are so much more comfortable than what are designed for men. I am not embarrassed about it, and buy at stores often with the sales assistants knowledge that I am shopping for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby Loves Them Too","review":"I have to agree. These are the best panties I've owned. Comfortable, wash well, hold their color and elasticity, don't ride up or slide down. I wear a lot of jeans that ride low and work perfectly.

The intricate world of Washington in the years of 1979-1980, without naming names, a gentle gloss over realities. The politics is just a backdrop, however, for the Halleck family. Maurice, the head of the family, leaves a drunken, convoluted confession and his car is found in a brackish swamp in a small Virginia town. His children, Owen and Kirsten, are convinced it is the doing of his wife and his long time friend (and wife's lover) Nick; everyone else is convinced it is a suicide due to his unscrupulous practices in D.C.

The book is easy to read, with many photos of his family. He wrote of his love & concerns for his family, their strengths as well as their weaknesses. Other books on the Mayo Clinic are more like text books, & don't allow us a glimpse into the life of people who have become well known. This book is not a text book.Unfortunately this book is out of print. I had lent to someone years ago & they failed to return it.

It seems to be the same thing over and over again with Milk Chan doing some of the dumbest things on earth. The problem is that the stupid stuff this kid does takes to long to set up and there's no sting to any of the comedy. Notice that there are three volumes of DVD's but Adult Swim only played half of a season so obviously someone agrees with me.

Much of the DVD is spent naming family members and friends from either Egypt or Brazil and listing all of Hossam Ramzy's productions and where to buy them failing to indicate whether they are CD's or DVD's.

The only thing i have with this game is this lack of multiplayer in any form. Basically in gun, you do a series of missions in the beginning to establish a story line, but then your free to go where you want. By picking up a horse (dont worry not hard to find them roaming around) you can ride between towns, at each town there are side missions and the main story line.

The only bad thing about the gun is that it hurts alot( unless you are wearying a water-proof jacket) and it dosent have a scope.

Even on those terms it fails. E.g., how can a section about wills be part of the \\"joys\\". If anything, wills are a problem about being gay, and irrelevant to gay sex, joys or not. I would say that this book is not at all directed towards gays, who I'm sure will know much , much, much more about the subject than has been written here, but towards those who have a prurient interest, are mere gawkers, or who are timidly venturing towards it.

They do have Mapwits software, which with some effort on your part create your own maps, but it's only available when you buy the pro bundle, $90. If creating your own maps is a bit much then the costs can be very high (pda software $50 then adding approximately 12 maps, as much as $90-180 more, totaling over $200).

In Rummy the oppoenent ALWAYS gets three Kings - never lay one down.The worst part of the game is the mouse buttons. You cannot change them and they're backwards! Also you have to drag the cards to lay out (in Rummy), not quick way to do so, and if you dont place them exactly where the box is they return to your hand.Overall very frustrating and mildly entertaining. With a little more effort and a programmer / designer who had actually played the games this could have been good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Most of the people involved with programing this game seem to have been dedicated to making it as irritating, unenjoyable and predictable as possible. Solitaire seems to consist of anly a few variations; only the values of the cards dealt change. After a while you come to know which game you'll win. In poker the players do really clever things like check with a straight and raise with high card."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection of application oriented excercises","review":"Hal Saunders offers a good collection of application oriented exercises.

They shipped me a used unit that was described as new and was also damaged before it was shipped from what I can tell. The unit broke after the first use. The manufacturer informed me that Joe's is not a direct buyer of this unit and they did not know where they were getting them from. They were however kind enough to fix the unit for me although I have still not received the unit in the mail from them yet.This unit only roasts 1/3 of a cup at a time and not the 3 ounces that is described on some of the pages on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I recieved this roaster for Christmas and am very underwhelmed. It is constructed with 1950's technology and has no fan speed control and no temperature control. In otherwords, you will never be able to fine tune the ideal roast for different types of beans and personal preferences. What is the point of roasting your own coffee beans if the quality is virtually guaranteed to be lower than that available from your local speciality roaster? This is the type of appliance I would expect to see in a cheap import store selling for $19.95.I can't imagine anyone actually liking this machine. It's not much more than a hot air popcorn popper that runs at a higher temperature and has a spring loaded timer on the power switch. I think a manual stove-top pan roaster is a giant step up from this poorly concieved device. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Off with a Corn Popper","review":"I just went through my second one of these and each of them only lasted one year with weekly use. I would roast the two ounces at a time, fifteen minutes apart, until I had a weeks worth--about a pound once a week. I've done the same thing previously with a corn popper that I bought at the thrift store for 3 dollars, and three of them have also only lasted one year. I bought the Fresh Roast in hopes that it would last longer than the one year that a used corn popper works, but it didn't. Considering that the Fresh Roast roaster can't be had for less than about 80 dollars, the corn popper is a much better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does make roasted beans, that's about it!","review":"I've had two of this product and really the only reason I bought the second one is I got a good low price. The machine is poorly made and the timer and the settings is a joke. The first machine burned up when the timer did not shut off. I'd recommend watching it carefully. My first machine lasted two years and that was infrequent use at that. I fully expect the second machine to last no more than the first because, if anything, it is worst made than the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fresh Roast Ripoff","review":"I would not buy this coffee roaster. I first purchased one a year ago, and the whole base cracked down the middle within 6 months. It was nearly impossible to get the manufacturer (Fresh Beans, Inc.) to honor the warranty, but it reluctantly shipped out a new model (after accusing me of \\"abusing\\" the machine). The second unit never worked properly, and I had to work through the Better Business Bureau to try and receive a refund. The manufacturer told the BBB they would refund my money. I returned the unit, and I am still waiting for my refund (it's been 5 months!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing account of potentially interesting story","review":"Having read two excellent works on Irving vs. Lipstadt (one by a journalist, another by a professor who served as an expert witness), I decided to read this book, which was the first written by one of the two main characters of the trial. Very briefly, I can only say that it was a bitter disappointment. Professor Lipstadt fails to shed any new light on the case, filling up the book with all sorts of irrelevant details. Instead of providing, say, a historiographic or philosophical account of her battle with Irving, all she does is to recount - in mind-numbing detail - her trips across the Atlantic, her bewilderment with British court procedure and her reactions to events in court.I struggled to finish this book and would recommend instead \\"The Holocaust on trial\\" by DD Guttenplan or \\"Telling lies about Hitler\\" by Richard Evans, both of whom have more interesting things to tell us - and in mercifully shorter works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame On Emory","review":"it is gratifying to know that there is some sanity in this world. Dr. Lipstadt stomped the holocaust denier David Irving into the ground, and we can all be thankful of it. My only comments are (i) it is a pity that Dr. Lipstadt's initial work, upon which Irving sued, was not well written, and (ii) Lipstadt diplomatically downplays the fact that Emory University, where she is employed, contributed only a paltry amount to her defense. This is perhaps indicative that Emory's traditional attitude towards Jews has not really changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.....MEANINGLESS.....DETAIL.... wake me when it's over","review":"The author seems desperate to convince with a huge quantity of boring, tedius, very selective information. The trouble is that quantity is not quality, and in this regard the book is severely lacking.Actually the author reminds me of a child caught with its hand in the cookie jar, blathering a huge quantity of information offered as excuses - none of which really address the heart of the matter.The book contains large dry patches, reminescent of a menopausal woman, that will be greatly appreciated by even the most severe insomniacs.Although I am finished with the book, I am keeping it by my bedside for just such a purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and Irritating","review":"This unoriginal Spanish film is just another tale of defenseless women being stalked, bullied and tortured by a psychopathic mama's boy.

He tells few personal anecdotes. He also has little to say about the great plague year or the great fire of London.

I just took Brian Hoffner's Tactical Pistol I class in Houston, TX and we reviewed that area as an effective target to immobilize threats. Hoffner sells some targets on his site that have the major hit areas if anyone is interested - you just don't get the bad guy image, just Alpha (Center of Mass), Bravo (head), Charlie (pelvis) and number circles.

Apparently, the narrator, Ibn Fadlan, was real enough and did travel to the Northlands around the time period when this novel is set, but Crichton wrote the novel on a bet that he could make an entertaining story out of Beowulf. Personally, I thought Beowulf to be pretty entertaining on its own (even in 11th grade, when I read it), but this adaptation is also a good read. The movie later made from the novel, \\"The 13th Warrior\\" with Antonio Banderas as Ibn Fadlan is remarkably true to the story, then again, maybe not so remarkably when you note that Michael Crichton was a producer. At any rate, a good novel that can be enjoyed by almost anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did someone say Beowulf?","review":"Yes people, as I am sure those who read it know allready that this is Michael's retelling of a centuries old story and one of the most important epic poems in the early english language. Why does noone recognize it for what it is instead of some dumb warrior adventure? Within the first 10 seconds of the movie trailer I knew at was Beowulf, and very excited at seeing it receive a film treatment. As a young reader I was fascinated and entranced by the Beowulf tale, and find Michael does a fantastic job selling it from another point of veiw and literary style. I think we all know Michael is a scholar and not a hack writer! He spent a great deal of time researching background so as to create interesting parallels. So please lets at least give him the literary credit that he deseves instead of cheering it as a fantastic adventure on it's own.Oh, yes I liked the book :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"If you like short novels, I can't recommend this one enough.

The only cool part is that it has a brief description of the customs and lifestyles of the Vikings in the barbaric North..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent early work fusing fact and fiction","review":"Michael Crichton has taken a real 10th century manuscript depicting Ibn Fadlan's journeys into the northern country of the Rus, and worked it into a rousing adventure story. His text follows the original so closely at times that it doesn't read as smoothly as a modern novel, and has therefore been misunderstood by a number of readers. Nonetheless, those interested in an anthropologically-oriented volume showing the culture clash between Arab and Norse, with a great deal of adventure and bloody battles thrown in, will enjoy the book. It becomes clear during reading that the story familiar to Europeans and Americans in Beowulf is present here. Despite some claims, this does NOT appear to have been inserted by Crichton - professional historians had already noted this connection in the original Ibn Fadlan manuscript and written on it in professional journals. Another example of supposedly European literature originating in earlier Arab manuscripts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me guessing","review":"Crichton did an excellent job on this book. The introduction completely confused me but once I started onto the beginning it was great. This was one of the very few books I can actually read.

I was actually disappointed to find out it wasn't true. This was a great job of Michael Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can dig it to the utmost!","review":"I truly loved this book. What many readers didn't like about it is exactly what I liked. That it really seemed like just a translation from an old text. Crichton keeps you guessing if the original text really existed, or if he completely made up the whole thing. Similar to Jurassic Park and Andromeda Strain where some of the books in the bibliography are written by characters in the story. And of course the story itself was wonderful. I like the way he really researches his subjects so the reader gets a feel for the society back then.

As mentioned above, there are incredible parallels. One not mentioned above is that both Buliwyf and Beowulf's fathers are named Higlac, if I'm not mistaken. And both, I believe, are set in or near Denmark. (\\"There's something rotten in Denmark\\", to misquote Shakespeare.) What is the story here? Is this ancient manuscript of Ibn Fadlan real, or is Crichton, (an author whom I greatly admire, BTW,) ripping off the old Beowulf legend, whether consciously or subconsciously? To carry the parallel even further, the hairy, man-like monsters Crichton/Fadlan describes are very similar to how John Gardner described Grendel in the book of the same name (Grendel.)

I only bought this book because it was the only decent looking thing on the supermarket shelf and I needed something to keep me occupied while I hid inside my apartment during hurricane Floyd. With that aside I have to say this is a remakably entertaining piece of fiction. The first three chapters are based on an actual 10th century manuscript while the rest is loosely based on the legend of Beowulf and the Hall of Heorot.

The narrative ends with a description of the final battle between the Northmen and a group of extremely savage people or almost-people called the Wendol, which is basically the story of Beowulf retold from a new perspective.This is one of Crichton's shorter novels, barely more than a novella, but it seems about the right length for the story it tells. Too many authors pad out their stories with extraneous material just to create the impression that they're giving you more than they really are. All in all, a good read if you enjoy historical adventures and don't mind a deliberately dry writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story, but not true.","review":"I loved this book. Michael Crichton does an AMAZING job retelling the story of Beowulf. One of my favorite books I've read, but this is not an actual manuscript and not a true story.

Having a first person perspective eliminated his trademark cross-cutting, and overall it was a flat and unemotional experience. Numerous things were changed in the movie, but it's no better. I'm glad that Crichton didn't write any more like this. All his other books are gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton phoned this one in","review":"If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel. This was mostly a bore. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"OF COURSE IT'S A BIG HOAX !!!!","review":"The fact that Crichton tried hard to sell this a a \\"true\\" history darkens all the merit this book could have.

Eaters of the Dead offers nothing I thought it would, the action is chessy and not convincing. The characters in the novel are dull and confusing, as is the entire novel.

Ibn Fadlan depending on Herger the translator, Buliwyf showing courage through the journey while still accepting Fadlan, an outsider, into his clan, and the rest of the warriors fighting against evil and enjoying it are examples of how I gained interest in their personalities. I almost wanted to jump in and fight with them against the monsters of the mist. I don't want to give anything away, but I almost felt sorry for the vikings at the end.

Once all were fed the went into a village. not to give it away they end up getting there goal and it all lead to the vickings. I do think you will like the book if you have time to reread and consitrate. Michael Criton truly wrote a complex novel and put alot into it. He really makes you feal as though he was a vicking himself.(he wasn't 700 A.D.)If you like the movie 13th warrior make sure you do read this because,he did change it around quite a bit.Michael Criton wrote a Great book make sure you read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Insights","review":"This book goes way back and really describes the way different cultures came into contact.

The characters are well drawn, the more barbaric aspects of primitive life are not flinched from, and though some found them tedious I must admit that I enjoyed the 'scholarly' material in the introduction, footnotes, and appendix. The handling of the 'dragon' was a nice touch.The fault that prevents this book from getting five stars from me, though, is that the climax is rather underwritten. After all the difficulties, terrors, and carnage inflicted by the mist-monsters it seems that the final confrontation is over too quickly.Other than that, this is a fun little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I enjoyed the movie (13th Warrior) and wanted to see if the book was better (as these things usually are). In this case, my surprise when that wasn't true was a pleasant one.

All things considered, I enjoyed both just about equally, with just a slight edge to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History or fiction?","review":"This book made quite interesting reading. After debating on whether or not to read it, I am glad I did. The book weaves a tale of mystery and suspense which makes it easy read. While reading this book, one asks themself, is this really a true story? The book is SUPPOSED to be based upon actual documents written in 922 A.D., somehow though Chrichton has made this story come alive with characters and suspense. He (Chrichton), provides footnotes explaining events throughout the book, one may find this too descriptive or difficult to follow while reading, but it helps the reader understand how the passages were interpreted from the document. A problem which a reader may have with this book, however, is the pronounciation of many characters throughtout the book. A short book, it should only take a serious reader a day or two to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I came upon this book by accident.

Based on the actual diary of an Arab man traveling with the Vikings, it is sometimes difficult to believe this is a true account and not just pure fiction. Eaters of the Dead is the epic journey of one man who strives to find himself and his place in his world. The main character is richly described. His emotions and internal conflicts are laid before the reader as he witnesses the horrible habits and rituals of his foreign companions. The settings are depicted so finely, you can almost taste the darkness and smell the smoke. What is most compelling about Eaters of the Dead is how the author shows every defining moment with such clarity. All in all, a great, solid story that needs to be slowly savored! A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read quite a few of Micheal Crichton's books and this is by far the worst. The whole book was written in an utterly boring fashion. But the real disappointment was how he handled the Beowulf story(which the book is spin off of) He took a great story and turned it into a semi-descent story adding at least three hundred pages too it all. considering that half the charcters where already made and he had the potential for a great plot the whole thing sucked. I would suggest finding a translation of the original instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed, nice try... falls short of good","review":"Ingenious idea to write Beowulf from an outsider/foreign point of view. Crichton starts off strong with wonderful tense and regurgitative viewpoints that can only be describes as \\"short\\" and \\"journalistic\\". The style is strange yet highly interesting. And then the style changes abrubtly. It's no coincidence that the first 3 chapters were paraphrased from the acutal Ibn Fadlan manuscritps and the remainder of the novel is Crichton's attempt to copy that style. Although he proceeds with the story at a furious pace, it seems to get lost in his attempt at \\"faking\\" this ancient prose. Like I said before, nice try....falls short of good. If you want to read something magical, based in history(?), read Beowulf and wonder at the magic of orginality, not originality trying to duplicate magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton, Eaters of The Dead","review":"Eaters of the Dead is something a little different from Crichton and if you don't like what he does here, at least it is a short book and won't waste much of your time. I am one of the ones that didn't enjoy it as much. My reason is simple and pathetic: I do not like this sort of writing style. It reminds me of authors like Charles Dickens. I have attempted and failed to read several Dickens novels and I usually end up hating any book that reminds me of him even if the writing isn't much like his. The presentation of the novel is very well-done though and makes it seem more real. It also reminded me a bit of Congo because it involves \\"dark hairy brutes.\\"In short, Eaters of the Dead gained my respect and not much else but it was still fun to read in some parts and it wasn't overly long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Different Read","review":"When I started reading this I only had the vaguest inclination of what the Beowulf story really was. It had everything I'd want in a story, strange characters, interesting plot, and it evoked such emotions as excitement, dread, and repulsion. I found this translation particularly interesting though because of the footnotes. The entire thing is riddled with footnotes explaining possible variations of words, different explanations and theories, etc.I think the best part of the entire story was the most unintentional aspect of it, the fact the last sentence ends after three words leaving the reader to wonder. That all being said I'd only recommend it to people with the iron stomachs needed to deal with the brutality of the ancient world as well as an inquisitive mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is for the Audio Book - not the printed book","review":"I enjoyed the movie - not a great movie - but entertaining.I like to listen to audio books at the gym and thought this would be fun.I was sadly disappointed.Many of the first tracks was irrelevant and tedious, and discussed the authenticity of the original manuscript and copies.

It was more of a lecture than an enjoyable experience. After 30 minutes of fast forwarding and skipping I put it aside.

I recently read a Crichton-like novel (in its lay-out more than its subject matter): THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE by Craig Furnas, and it is fantastic. I'd read that before this. But EATERS OF THE DEAD is interesting. I have to give Crichton credit for taking a chance on this book, since it deals with viking-days, which certainly is not standard Crichton-fare. His publisher was probably none-to-happy when he turned in the manuscript. Do you think Grisham's would be happy if his next book was about Eskimos hundreds of years ago?

I had trouble reading it, and had to look up practically every other word in the dictionary. After the first thirty pages, I felt like putting it down, but resisted. Now, I kind of wish that I had. It got a little bit easier to read, and the plot developed more after about 45 pages, but that was not even close to being enough to make it one of my favorites. I do realize, however, that there may be many readers out there who enjoy reading a novel with Shakespereian style writing (is that even a word?) and I do recomend it for them. It just was not really \\"My cup of Tea\\" as they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, but not bad","review":"The Movie was very entertaining, the book was very dry and slow reading, Please DO NOT take this book, or the movie as a true showing of the life of the Muslam, or the Viking.

Read the book if you like, but enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissapointing","review":"As a loyal Crichton fan, I'd have to say I was very dissapointed and at times disgusted with this book. It was extremely fake and pointless, not to mention dull and boring. If your planning on reading a Crichton novel, get Jurassic Park or Sphere (true classics) and forget this book exists"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I have generally enjoyed all of Crichton's novels, but this one was awful. The characters were dull and they were not developed well. The story never really went anywhere. It's a good thing the book was short, otherwise I never would have bothered finishing it. I don't like giving only one star because I have a lot of respect for the author and I've really enjoyed his other works, but it just doesn't deserve any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"I have read 7 of Michael Crichton's books and they are among my favorites.

I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. In fact, the only reason I read it was because it was bundled with Sphere and Congo into one book.When I read Crichton's footnote saying that he wrote the story as a challenge to come up with a modernized version of Beowulf, I felt as if I had been made the butt of a practical joke, with everyone pointing their fingers at me laughing!The story was slow, the characters were lifeless, and it seemed to me as if I were watching a bad 1950's sci-fi/horror film (emphasis on BAD). I have read worse stories, but had the sense to cast them aside before completing them.This may be an interesting chapter in Crichton's literary life, but only to historians.

About 20 years ago I read a story of Danish hero and now I see it was the Beowulf story. The impression I got then was so strong -- partly because of the splendid illustrations-- and now I'm glad I can get the epic from the web freely, though I wanted a nicely bound copy and ordered it at Amazon.com. I even wish to learn the old English to read it in the original tongue, though it may be much boring. So, this book is a nice and exciting, and feasible retelling of Beowulf, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"susie in hampstead","review":"I have to admit I found this book interesting and enjoyable.

This is not one of them. His unmistakeable style was present but he seems to be trying to parody himself--unsucessfully. I read the first book and didn't like it much, and only read this one in a pinch. At times the sections were boring and I ended up skimming over several pages.For me I need to find a character to like. Since the characters in this series are mostly vain, self-satisfied and brutish it was impossible to find anyone admirable or likeable. So therefore the rather thin plot of a group of people on a hunt through the American wilderness did not engage me. A disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Yarn","review":"With the look and feel of an old dimestore novel, \\"The Wandering Hill\\" is populated with interesting and memorable characters, great action, and simple yet thoughtful prose. McMurtry's writing is, as always, crisp, elegant, very funny, and never dull. By the end of this second installment in the series, Tasmin is well-established as one of the great McMurtry characters, and the supporting cast of various mountain men and Indians, and the hilarious Lord Berrybender, offer much entertainment. McMurtry's writing is like the fine claret Lord Barrybender has the good fortune to stumble upon after a long dry spell on the prairie - it seems to get better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wandering Hill","review":"Hard to put down once you start reading. Another first class novel by Larry McMurtry - my favorite author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong finish","review":"This is the second in the Berrybender series and like the first, my impression of it changed dramatically and I'm not sure when or why. In both this book and in Sinkiller, my feeling throughout that it was too episodic in nature as to almost be disjointed and the characters were so unlikeable, I didn't care what happened to them anyway. In this installment as in the first, however, by the end I found I was enjoying the book and contemplating the next installment. The greatest advice I can give about this book is that if you start it, finish it. It truly needs to be evaluated in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second in a series","review":"This is the second in a series of novels about the Berrybender family's adventures in the American West during the mid-19th century. I especially enjoyed listening to the CD version as each part is read in the character's voice, and this book is full of characters. It is especially entertaining to watch the father pursue his two main loves: hunting buffalo and young women. Its not for the faint of heart, with graphic violence and raw language."},{"rating":"2","title":"McMurtry's Berrybender novels becoming epic classics","review":"Larry McMurtry's The Wandering Hill is the second installment of his proposed tetralogy following a wealthy English family and their trek to the west in the 1830's. Whereas the first novel, Sin Killer, started slow and revealed a zany, action-packed tone, Hill charges straight out of the gates but mellows eventually to attach the reader closer to the glorious characters. This tetralogy is essentially one giant novel that will equal Lonesome Dove in characters and story. The writing combines subtle humor, fast-paced action, and startling violence that brings the reader directly into the savage world. If you have read Sin Killer, pick up The Wandering Hill immediately. If you haven't read Sin Killer, pick up both books and lose yourself in the exciting yet tragic world McMurtry has created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting........","review":"This book will be a dissapointment to Lonesome Dove fans. I did not see character development to speak of, action was absent, plot was thin, and after 400 pages, I was still waiting for some excitement. As part of a 1600 page book (four novels), it might be ok, but not as a stand alone work. I'm glad I only spent the money for a paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I've read The Sin Killer and The Wandering Hill and I have enjoyed both. I can't wait to read the next two books in the series. there are a lot of characters and you would think it would be overwhelming when you first start reading, whoever, the cast rotates and gets killed offso rapidly, that you never really have to keep track of that many characters at once. Quite a bit of violence, and in general can be a harsh book. It is an interesting read though."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of McMurtry's worst","review":"This is one book I could put down.

It's really got a lot of neat features, and you can't beat the 12x optical zoom. Image stabilization is really wonderful. However, I noticed a fair amount of barrel effect coming from the lens at wide angles (i.e., zero zoom). This is annoying, but after researching more I discovered it's fairly common in SLR digital cameras. Oh well. I use software to correct any really obvious barrelling, but it's still annoying and, therefore, not worth 5-stars. Fyi, when you buy a camera from Ritz they allow you to take free photo classes.

If you like it, you will probably like the book, but if you don't, you probably won't:\\"An altered level of arousal (awareness) with acute onset may be caused by various factors (i.e. structural arousal alteration, metabolic arousal alteration, psychogenic arousal alteration). Structural causes are divided according to whether the original location of the pathologic condition is above or below the tentorial plate. Pathologic processes include infectious, vascular, neoplastic, traumatic, congenital (developmental), degenerative, polygenic, and metabolic causes. Metabolic causes are further divided into hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, drugs, and toxins (both endogenous and exogenous). All the systemic diseases that eventually produce nervous system dysfunction are part of this metabolic category. Alterations in arousal range from slight drowsiness to coma\\" (page 356)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review by nursing student","review":"This book was required reading by one of my current classes. Huether's and McCance's book is as entertaining and painful as a root canal. The book is bad about jumping from topic to topic (referring you to other chapters for more information), and tries to make the most basic information worthy of a Nobel Prize in difficulty reading and sheer dullness. The graphics presented \\"for ease and understanding\\" are so detailed and difficult it becomes almost funny to the late night student reader. The language is obscure and written for the PhD with alot of time on his/her hands to ponder the joys of patho, and not a nursing student. The book does offer an occasional clinical photo to help you with your frequent bouts of narcolepsy. Great gift idea for those you really hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graduate nursing student","review":"Of all books that I read in undergraduate and graduate schools this one is the winner in dullness and difficulty reading.

Save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow the dozen or so chambers up. The instructions were terrible. You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next. The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all. My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"More trouble than it's worth","review":"My daughter was so excited to use this toy with her friend on the first warm day of spring, but was sorely disappointed. It took nearly three hours to fill each individual chamber with air, and by the time I was done, her friend had to go home. If you leave it outside, it gets very grungy and it is a pain to clean all of the grass and dirt and bug carcasses out of the crevices. And since you can't fit in through a regular door without deflating it a bit, ours wound up mostly outdoors. Some chambers leaked and went flat.It was somewhat fun, although I was worried that the kids would roll over too hard and break an arm. It's hard for the younger kids to push around. My older daughter did have fun in it during a raging hurricane, sitting inside with a hose running.Too labor intensive. Looked like a good idea, but in reality was a pain in the neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giga Ball review","review":"This was a great idea for my 2 kids for Christmas, I thought. Unfortunately the Giga was a hassle to inflate with about 15 air chambers took close to an hour to fill. Then our first time pushing the kids around with 2 friends (only one child in at a time. Each kids weight was under 80lbs. It is rated up to 150lbs.) the one air chamber ripped at the seams. I now have a giga ball that was used 1 time with duct tape holding one panel together. It ripped on 3 of the four sides holding it together. Most of the chambers are held by 5 seams. This chamber was right by one of the two openings. So my Giga Ball experience was pretty flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giga fun","review":"My kids loved this toy! They can sit in it, roll around in it, climb on it...it's great!

How nice - mind didn't. It took four hours to fill up with a pretty good air compressor because the air leaked out faster than it would fill up. I kept patching holes and new ones kept appearing.

After that we noticed several of the seemingly almost 20 separately-inflatable bladders were leaking. The next day the kids wanted to play with the ball again and it required more than 1/2 hour to reinflate it. After that I never had sufficient inclination to spend the time required to reinflate it. Eventually we just got rid of it.But for the many other reviews describing similar leak problems I might have thought I just received a defective one. If you do get one that does not leak please be aware this is a large ball and, as another reviewer noted, because of the many cracks it does pick up dirt/bugs/grass and is hard to wash off.

Why? No one really knows, but all of the fellow clinicians and physicians Gregory trained with are dead...except one. And she happens to be his ex-lover, whom Gregory's wife, ADA Lauren, knows nothing about. Along for the ride again is prickly detective Sam and a pair of ex-FBI agents who are the only ones who believe the stalker is real. But how do you pursue a criminal whose identity remains shrouded in mystery? One who changes his M.O. so frequently, a pattern cannot be established. One thing is certain, however. His vicious cycle of murder is rapidly increasing.Full of great action sequences and thoughtful musings, this novel perpetuates White as one of the great psychological/medical thrill writers of the past 10 years. Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not impressed","review":"I've now read almost all of the Alan Gregory series, and have liked most of them. This one didn't do it for me. White has said that the next Gregory novel will be the last, and I think that's a wise choice on his part.I particularly didn't like his character development of the ultimate villain, probably because he chose to develop that character in just a few pages at the end of the book.On a side note, if you're new to Stephen White, I suggest you try to read this series in order. White has a nasty habit, in his later books, of lengthy references to characters and events from earlier books. Yes, some authors do that, but White seems to do it more than most, and I find it annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting References to the Front Range...","review":"Other than that, I found \\"Manner of Death\\" a dull read. I found the characterization shallow, the interrelationships between the characters unbelievable, and the premise for the murders -- and who the murderer is -- hard to buy into. There is no suspense to speak of, except for a short scene involving a private plane. If it weren't for the fact it is set in Boulder, CO, I would not have finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping read!","review":"Denver Post reviewer Carol Kreck stated in her review that \\"Stephen White's 'Manner of Death' pulls readers along like a steam train. Don't crack this thing unless there's nothing else to do, because once started, nothing else is going to get done.\\" I couldn't agree more, so I set aside a Sunday and read the book in one sitting, which makes it easier to keep track of names. I have read all Stephen White's mysteries and like them very much: Alan Gregory is a likeable, believable hero as is his wife Lauren. I was dismayed to read the Kirkus review above and find that it contains \\"spoilers\\": events that don't happen until more than 200 pages into the book. Also, Dr. Arnie Dresser's funeral took place in Evergreen, not Denver. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If your time is valuable, pass this by!","review":"If you go to the Q. & A. section of White's web page you can read about his not really knowing what will happen in one of his books until the characters reveal that to him during his writing. Manner of Death was a good example of that revelation. The first 350 pages offered little in support of the culmination of the novel. If as a reader you hope to be able to put the pieces of the puzzle together along the way, you are out of luck here. There are no pieces to put together until the very end and unfortunately those that do get put together at the end are not at all intriguing or memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful suspension of disbelief","review":"I definitely don't expect much from books I pick up while waiting for airplanes, but I found this book interesting and genuinely frightening. Even after I made it off the plane, I had to finish reading before I attended to other business. It asks what would happen if a group of people you knew were being killed one by one and you had the distinct idea that you were next, but nobody could prove that murder was involved? There are holes I could pick in the plot, but I should say that they didn't bother me while I was reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad...","review":"This was my first Stephen White read and I was thoroughly entertained. Just enough clinical sophistication melded with psychological suspense kept it interesting and believable.

But, don't expect to find tables as loose as they suggest. Many examples are unrealistic.on page 82: loose games average 6 to 8 players to the flopWhen was this true? it certainly is very uncommon today to see a table AVERAGE 6 to 8This is not a good book to get a realistic foundation.To get a well rounded hold'em foundation, see Gary Carson's Hold'em PokerThen for a deep understanding, regularly study Sklansky's Theory of Poker"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Find","review":"I am impressed with the wealth of information I have found so far within this book.

However, most of the stuff in this book a good player will all ready know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for new players","review":"If you know anything at all about hold-em this is not the book for you. It does help with learning how to figure odds but everything else it covers can be picked up with a few hands at the table.

It is not an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive low limit holdem book!!","review":"Small Stakes Holdem takes you to the next level and teaches you expert play allowing you to DOMINATE the low limit game. When playing online you don't need to be playing the middle or high limits to make a nice living. Simply playing 2/4 or 3/6, and using multiple tables you can earn anywhere from $15-60/hr on Party Poker. Depends on how many simultaneous tables you can play and how proficient your play is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"This book will only teach you to spew chips.

The editing and grammar are jokes, but more than that the advise, according to one fellow I played with in Vegas, gave him the knowledge to buy in over and over five times (while I played with my same money). This fellow said I could never understand Sklansky--Boy, was he was right! He left the table penniless, while I played all night on my initial stake.Sklansky needed an editor, somebody to make an index, and (in general) somebody who knows how to make a good read even if his advise is horrible...Skip this book by all means. A real waste of money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated & Overly Optimistic","review":"This book is no better than any other low limit book. It also is unrealisticly optimistic about how stupid your opponents are, even for a low limit game.

Yeah, let's all go destroy low limit poker making 100k/yr, anyone can do it, read a book, quit my job & play poker, just like on TV (note: sarcasm).Edit: This book deserves 3 stars, but I've given it 1 to help try balancing out everyone else's infatuation w/ it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best poker books I've ever read","review":"This is a book that will open your eyes. If you play low-limit hold'em with any kind of seriousness this book is absolutely must-reading.

I don't like seeing others at the table that clearly understand the topics covered in this book. Easy to understand (though not the easiest on the market) but very thourough. An absolute must read for any limit player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handle with care","review":"This book is extremely easy to read, and full of important concepts that are explained in a very easy to understand manner.Some key concepts are: raising for pot equity, finding hidden outs, and don't give up large pots easily.The books only weakness is that is does not spend much time discussing folding. The book has three major assumptions 1. the reader folds too much. 2. Your opponents are bad and aggressive 3. you are playing for a big potThis was an eye-opening book for me, but it's recommendations should be used cautiously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small stakes Hold 'em: Winning Big With Expert Play","review":"These guys are very knowledgable and the book is very worthwhile.

I got the impression that this author merely wants to have a book to sell to suckers like me. I regret buying this book. This book sucks. I have tossed the book into the trash.

Gibbs' treatment of the various kinds of figurative language opened my eyes (to use a metaphor!) to the \\"approximation\\" or \\"fuzzy logic\\" nature of the langauge of poetry and of everyday life. By this I do not mean that Gibbs champions Deconstrucitve reductionism; rather, his many, well chosen examples empahsize the dynamic interaction of words and experience. This is a valuable, insighful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Price Is Wrong","review":"The music took on a silent movie role and was annoying, never pleasant or entertaining. The story totally escaped me. Only the wardrobe prevented me from removing the DVD before the closing credits. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Compared to other historical fiction such as the wonderful works of Sharon Penman, this book was fairly mediocre. It was overlong, the characters were poorly developed, and the mystical Celtic world seemed as imaginary as much of the characters' interminable \\"dreaming\\": I think the title of Scott's later book \\"Dreaming the Bull\\" would have been far more appropriate for this one. Also, the children had such gravity that I thought they must be at least in their late teens, before finding out that they were in fact 11 and 8: such convincing characterisation! I don't remember a single character laughing in the entire 500-page novel: Scott certainly has a gift for writing cheery fiction. However, it gets two stars for sheer size, an interesting premise and some tenderly drawn love-scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruelty to Animals","review":"The book was interesting at first but I stopped reading when I came upon cruelty to animals, a dog. Perhaps I am super sensitve to animal cruelty becasue I had just lost my dog of 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I'll admit, not many 13-year-olds are going to be reading this book, especially considering that it is an adult book, but it is an amazing piece of literature!True, the plot may be slightly difficult to understand, at least for me, but it is really, really good. It took me about three months to read, and usually a book of that size takes me a week, max, but that was because, for it to really pull me into it, i needed some time, as in an uninterupted hour or more, to read it. (Sorry for the run-on sentence!)Some of the content may be considered \\"for adults only\\" by many people, such as when, towards the end of the book Breaca sleeps with a man to whom she is not married, but we all know enough about that by the time we turn 13, and if we don't, then we need to learn.Altogether, I say that this is a book well worth the price and time it takes to read and I say we should all propose a toast of long life to Manda Scott for writing this beautiful series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks character development, dialogue, and plot","review":"The best things about this book are the battle scenes and the historical setting. Unfortunately the characters never feel very real or believable. Key characters like Eburovic (Breaca's father) figure prominently in some sections and then disappear from the story even though they haven't gone anywhere. The second most important character, Ban (Breaca's brother), never develops a personality of his own and never feels remotely convincing.Buyers should also be warned that sections of the book include episodes of homosexuality, rape, and sexual mutilation. Some sections are gratuitously perverse, while at other points the book reads like a gay romance novel. This book is definitely not appropriate for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I can only speak to the entertainment value of the book, which I found dull and disapointing. As a fan of historical novels, when I purchased this book, I was looking forward to delving into a reconstruction of the Celtic past. I sought a sense of time and place, neither of which I felt were well developed or well researched in this novel. The character development lacked depth or age-appropriate emotion, and I felt I didn't connect or identify with any of them as I was meant to. The author's writing style reads as though it is forced, and many of the dramatic scenes in the book are over-stated or imbued with angst I found difficult to relate to. Most of the relationships the characters develop are pedophilic and perhaps incestuous, a detail I felt unnecessary and at times uncomfortable. It isn't a novel I would recommend, and I won't be following the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great product. It sticks very well to my truck.

Okay, the basic premise was alright, and the character designs were okay. But there is NO character devlopment, NO good dialog, NO good action (despite the entire movie pretty much being a series of chase scenes). And what the heck is that blob creature? What the heck?

This is a small barcode on all 4 corners on the underside of the paper. But when they packaged the paper, the ink on the bar code wasn't dry yet so the barcode ink has dried on the print-side of the next sheet in the pack. After printing you can still clearly see these marks because the printer ink doesn't stick to the already dried bar-code ink.

While her book is entertaining, I'm afraid that it is horrendously biased and smacks of pay-offs and vindictive gossip. Unfortunately, the readers that this book will most appeal to (namely those new to or outside of the sport, casual observers) are likely to accept Ms. Brennan's anecdotes as fact. For those of us that were there in many cases, or know those involved, this is a deplorable tabloid-istic smear essay. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Read","review":"This book is now dated, figure skating is scored quite differently now, then it was when this book was written. The skaters in the book have long since been replaced by a current crop. Not being an \\"insider\\", I don't know how the \\"politics\\" of figure skating have changed, but I'd suspect that the \\"politics\\" is also at least a bit different from when the book was written.Still, the book is an entertaining read into the world of figured skating in the '90's. The book introduces us to personalities and gives us some background on the famous personalities of that time period. It's interesting to contemplate that today's prominent figure skaters were just starting out when this book was written. In that regard, this book provides an interesting look at how today's prominent skaters were raised in the world of figure skating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A distortion of the truth","review":"Christine Brennan had the ultimate opportunity to write an inside report of the world of figure skating, but instead she wrote a book full of sensationalistic journalism.Opinions are passed as fact in Brennan's morphed view of figure skating. Unlike Beverley Smith, Brennan did not have much experience in figure skating when she began writing this book, and it shows. Her \\"revealing journey\\" is one of gossip and stretching the truth.Beverley Smith's \\"Talking Figure Skating\\" is the best alternative to \\"Inside Edge.\\" Smith respects the sport much more than Brennan, and she is considerably less biased and opinionated.Take everything you read in \\"Inside Edge\\" with a large dose of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"She tells it like it is...","review":"See the starts of Michelle Kwan.

The book in question is pretty worthless. I was very disappointed. In fact I will never buy a book from this series again. Basically, it is a list of words in Italian that are almost the exact same as what the word would be in English but with different suffixes. For example, the english version is important but the Italian version is importante. The English version is incredible the Italian version incredibile. In other words you can guess what the word means anyway. Don't buy the book.

She was sympathetic to the traditions and needs of the Native American people. She wrote this memoir many years later, and she seems to have based it on her notes from the time period and her memories. I think this book would have been better written closer to the time she spent teaching the Sioux, perhaps there would have been a little more detail to her stories.I still feel that Elaine's life was fascinating, and I find encouragement in what she was able to accomplish in her lifetime. The story of her life is inspiring, but this book was far from my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the Winter","review":"This game is fun for all ages.

This film is currently showing on ON DEMAND and I was fortunate enough to see all 480 minutes of it. Being born in 1955, I learned a lot, frankly way more, than I myself ever knew about the times. I have yet to see a more complete and absorbing film chronicalling the soul and heart of the Era.

This transformer looks very cool but it is very hard to transform. The instructions unlike the older ones has only pictures to help you transform it and that does not help at all. The spring loaded punch is very anoying.Every time I touched it went off. It is hard to make it go back into place. You have to get its legs exactly in the right position to transform to a car.It was so hard to transform back to a car that once I got back to a car I kept it that way and did not transform it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barricade not as good as in the movie!!","review":"Before anything else I say, I want to make it clear that I love the character Barricade and its many incarnations. I loved him in the movie as he was one of my favorite characters and then him being a Saleen Mustang just boosted that even higher!! Now for the toy all though cool looking in car mode all the detail is there once he turns into robot mode he isnt as impressive. I mean the overall look is there but compared to the other Transformers from the movie line he is probably the simplest looking one. To turn him from car to robot and back again is a very unpleasant task and then the fact that you get a feeling you might break something snapping everything back is unsettling. i personally dont like the spring loaded punch, for one thing it seems like it might break while putting the arm back, and too it looks awkward one its done. So again great character, mediocre toy, but if you absolutely just want to have Barricade for your collection a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you figure it out","review":"A lot of people have bad mouthed Barricade due to his difficult transformation and realtivley loose parts. However there is a trick to the transformation that once you have it down Barricade is actually one of the easiest to transform of the movie line. His waist is what I would call double or even triple jointed and when putting him back into his vehical mode it folds up around his head. Before I had this down I kinda just left him hafl tranformed and said it was \\"Barricade after he was in a wreck\\". Anyway that's really all there is to it.

It is definitely geared more towards older children age 5 and up. Another drawback is the fact that you have to use the keyboard to maneuver the characters instead of the mouse. Obviously it is very difficult for a 3 year old to understand to push the space bar to jump, the contol button to move sideways, and the directional buttons to move, etc. Also, the game became stuck with 30 minutes of playing with her.

There are the usual coincidences and improbabilities that mystery stories typically rely upon, but they detract only a little.What REALLY detracts from the reading, if you bought it on Kindle, are the numerous typographical errors. Clearly the text wasn't proof-read at all when it was converted from print to digital. Very annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to the rest of the series...","review":"I came across Steven Saylors name in an article I was reading about movies, in which the author was saying how perfect these books would be for a Hollywood adapatation.I went out and bought the first book and was not disappointed.

You can't beat that in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mystery book","review":"Roman Blood is a very good mystery book. Normally I don't like mystery books, but I really enjoyed reading this one. Another good thing about this book is that it does a good job describing ancient Roman life.

It was difficult to see the map of Rome on the Kindle which is why I gave my purchase only 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Historical Crime Fiction","review":"I greatly enjoyed this. I thought that it worked as crime fiction and as historical fiction.There is a fair bit of exposition and historical background especially early on. However it wasn't too jarring and a lot of it was fascinating. At times it felt like I was getting a sneaky history lesson.The protagonist is an interesting and well drawn character. Most of the other characters are convincing and there were some fascinating and realistic portraits of actual real historical figures.The pace was maybe slightly slow at the start and maybe at times everything was a bit too neat, especially at the end.I loved the writing style. I thought that it really was well written. Despite being a big book it was a really quick and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Blood is extremely good","review":"Roman Blood by Steven Saylor was well written and well researched. Saylor was able to blend his fictional writing with factual information in a very interesting way. Being the first book in the Roma Sub Rosa series, this book has led me to start reading the rest of the series. Roman Blood blends action and mystery. Gordianus the finder is a very intriguing character that will make you think more than you think you should. Roman Blood is a great book to sit down and read to. Its entertaining, but also, if you are interested in ancient Rome, it will give great information on everyday life and Roman government. Also, the ending is a doozy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read","review":"I've been reading a lot of mystery novels lately so I'm rating this one in comparison to others.

I'm not sure what I liked better; the interesting plot, the characters, or the period detail. All top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding Historical Fiction","review":"I was not sure if I would like this one - turns out I loved it. I am not a reader of mysteries, but I do enjoy reading historical fiction about 1st century BC Rome. The plot is a typical murder whodunnit with perpetrators that are willing to stop at nothing to avoid being caught, which places the investigator (in this case Gordianus the finder) in intensely dangerous circumstances. What makes this book stand out from the pack is that Saylor immerses the reader into the Roman world in a most convincing manner. You will see, hear, and unfortunately SMELL Rome in a way that makes you feel as though you've been there. Saylor paints a picture that is so vivid it is very apparent that he has done his homework thoroughly. 5 stars all the way. I'm hooked and have already picked up the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful re-creation of Ancient Rome","review":"This is a masterful achievement. Historical study teaches us that Roman sources are few; that what we have are at best transliterations centuries later; and that the majority of classical texts are lost and not likely to be found. And in spite of this, Steven Saylor is able to create a picture of Rome and Roman society that teems with life, that draws a complete picture that the sources individually do not, and in my limited expereince, seems to be historically accurate and true. Not to mention its one heck of a great story. This is historical fiction at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical continuity great, however a fair novel","review":"Steven Saylor does a well-informed and colorful job of writing a mystery set in the historical context of ancient Rome, but that's about the only place this book has high merit. Those with good knowledge of Roman history and culture will certainly admire tha, at least. If you're not interested in the great job it does with these details, the plot will probably confuse, bore, or disgust you. The title is appropriate, there's lots of blood; and sex, and danger, and all the grimy aspects of a murder mystery novel. The ending is really good, though, and after making it all the way through the book I ended up glad that I had. Nonetheless, it was not an exceptional book, and in a number of instances, offensive. Unsuitable for young or unsuspecting readers. For those classicals with respect for Cicero, he is done amazing justice considering the standard the rest of the book has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roman Blood","review":"The book was awful. Everytime I started a new page I had to reread the half the other page to know what was going on. Also the things that happened in the book weren't very descriptive in the parts that had a lot of action especially in the begining with the murder. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"CSI\\" in a book","review":"Now lets be honest with everyone I myself can not stand to read, I would rather get my teeth pulled out. I would also much rather watch T.V., but when I was reading Roman Blood for school, somthing changed me about this book. It reminded me of the hit T.V. show \\"CSI\\". The book Roman blood involves Gordianus a vary cunning and smart detective.I only have one beef with the writer Steven Saylor...Steven my good man you made me loose a ton of sleep reading this book because I couldn't put it down. I love the way how you described everything, it felt like I was in the midst of all the action. I am begining to wonder if Saylor lived in the time of the Roman era, to know all of this information, PROPS TO YOU MY GOOD MAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"a terrific book, part of a terrific series","review":"Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series is wonderful for the exploration of character, for the mysteries (of course), and for bringing Ancient Rome to life. The descriptions of Rome made me feel like I was walking through a city teeming with life, people, sights, sounds, smells.The novels seem to become more complex as the series goes on. Roman Blood, the first novel in the series, is the most straight-forward murder mystery. Arms of Nemesis puts Gordianus under pressure with a time limit, and looks at the way slaves fit into Roman society. Catalina's Riddle takes place on a farm, in the midst of a possible revolution. The Venus Throw involves, scandal, politics and an examination of morals. I haven't read the other books yet, but I have ordered them.

It's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama. Henry Czerny, though, gives a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing, and Lise Roy is superb as his wife in the film's second part. And the Canadians go further than American filmmakers ever could or would, suggesting how available the boys' bodies are, and what could be attractive about them. Finally, the whole snowbound, wood-paneled production is goregous to look at.

Jeff Allen and Roger Klein make us aware that learning requires both physical and mental preparation. By introducing physical relaxation and positive mental imaging skills into the classroom environment, children develop essential learning prerequisites, increase self-confidence, and enrich creative interactions between teacher and child. The lessons of Ready, Set, Relax should be eagerly integrated into every elementary school curricula."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for parents to help their children relax!","review":"This book gives excellant information about how stress affects children.

They could have made it a little bigger, but it is lovely anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"This movie deserves to be viewed. Boy A was a juvenile when he was convicted of killing a young girl. The film follows his attempts to live a \\"normal\\" life after his release. In the beginning, the British accents are a bit hard to understand, but the English subtitles helped while my ear became accustomed to the dialect.Boy A is moving, to say the least. The acting is superb. I would have preferred more on the back story--the murder itself--and an update on his Father. I like closure and to have loose ends tied neatly.I have added this movie to an approved list for an education class I teach."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent and unique","review":"This is an unusual film dealing with a young man who's recently been released from prison.

It is insightful, powerful and excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't quite give this five stars...","review":"Boy A is definitely a powerful, gripping drama that you simply can't stop watching. But I'm put off a little bit by the way Boy A's friends and lover react to him. He's constantly putting his head down and not talking. Now *my* friends would consider him to be some kind of retard. Yet everyone he interacts with is generous with support and compliments. I can't see any real person in this age group who would go the extra mile to pull A out of his dumps. I know this is essential to the plot. I just don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very watchable","review":"Don't worry, I won't give a play-by-play of the story. I will say that it is a thoroughly touching and interesting movie that showcases the life of a young man released from prison for a childhood crime. Watching him start over is pretty remarkable. His social awkwardness coupled with his failure to move on from his haunting past, make the lead character vulnerable and relatable. I can't stress enough how watchable and interesting the concept is and how well-acted the parts are. I hate to be cheesy, but the movie will make you think. It's got a lot of dark psychological themes and well-developed characters. Additionally, it's very fast-paced as well as multi-dimensional in that it covers several facets of human emotion and human life. I honestly think that everyone would be able to take something (not necessarily the same thing) from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling drama with excellent performances","review":"Here's proof yet again that the Brits outshine just about everyone else in making movies, even when working with a small budget.Andrew Garfield is superb as Jack Burridge. If there's any other young actor today who can convey angst, humor and all-out likability as well as he can, I don't know who it is.The 100-minute running time zips by quickly. There isn't a wasted moment in the entire film. The flashback scenes are well-crafted and non-gimmicky. The characters are real. And the dialogue is quite clear -- glad to be able to leave the subtitles OFF (unlike \\"Red Riding Trilogy,\\" also starring Garfield).Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Objective basic text","review":"This is a basic reference book on Opus Dei covering its history, its spirituality, the founder, and its significance.I wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody who sincerely wants to find the basic facts about Opus Dei, without any need for rumors, gossip, spectacular revelations....just the plain facts about this Roman Catholic organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purple camo oh yea","review":"Speedy service.

Not very often do you get new insights into the theories of education and the art of mentoring. Usually teaching seminars are just tune-ups on the basics. There was a lot of truth that seemed intuitive in Mr. Stuart's findings, but his approach is definitely unique, and I greatly appreciated hearing his thoughts. I think his ideas are useful for teachers who struggle with at-risk students (both the privileged and non-privileged types), and as far as I can tell that's pretty much all of us. I highly recommend this book as a great resource for teachers who are interested in growing in their ability to mentor students effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring.","review":"This book could be really good. Yes, it could! There's only one problem. It's boring. While it covers the lives of the generals, such as Witzleben, Stulpnagel, Fritch and Beck in excrutiating detail, it somehow fails to get the repect and interest of the reader.

It is very simple,non-complex romance story, and revolves around 2 time periods (before they met, andafter they have married). We liked it mainly beacause it is simple, has nodeep mysteries or mind boggling special effects. People who see this filmmight view it has having no substance, but this film was not created as a hollywoodblock buster or a must-see world event film. Two guys who never met beforemeet in an awkward moment, then meet again later at a party where they slowlytake off. Another thing we liked about it is this is not a boy-meets-girl, breaks-up-with-girl, and gets-girl-back boring type of film that is so old its not worth to renting.Its slightly different where no one breaks up and keeps you thinking howthese guys ended up like they did.Daniel J.

The \\"short\\" stories in the book are extremely lengthy and wordy. The authors take multiple pages to state what would have been sufficiently written in a short paragraph. This is not my preferred style of reading/writing, however the various authors are accredited. The passages require thought and reflection from the readers, which is good, but I do not find it helpful as a textbook for an English class. We are required to read texts that are wordy, yet expected to write with concise thoughts and statements. I think that a book that modeled the style of writing we as students are expected to utilize would be a better fit.

What Space Cowboys is, is a below average movie, with a few laughs. It is enjoyable to a certain extent. However, that is about it.

The jokes about the main characters' ages and Donald Sutherland's libido were very good. But, as another reviewer stated, the 2nd 1/2 of the movie really lets you down. For example, I expected more tension and a better follow-up of the question of how a US design ended up on a Soviet satellite in the middle of the Cold War. Unfortunately, they didn't follow up on the issue at all. No questions were answered. Also, there was no sense of an urgent need for self-sacrifice on Tommy Lee Jones's part when he makes his fateful decision.

After the first half, which mainly deals with these older gentlemen trying to get back into shape to go into space, the second half is too dramatic.

Cinemaphotography: Yes, there is CGI, or whatever they are using to provide us the amazing space scenes. Sharp, crisp, colorful-- unlike any Space film I have ever seen. And realistic beyond belief-- or I should say realistic to the point of looking real.3. Feel-good qualities: No real romance (and no sex whatsoever-- very family friendly) but strong relationships, male bonding, etc.At the end of the film you feel good about the movie and the characters, and you have seen a very exciting film."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride","review":"While this movie is described as about a group of aging astronauts called back into service, don't believe that cliche totally describes the movie. It's quite funny and serious. The training scenes with the younger astronauts makes this worth owning alone. But more important is the critical plot that develops from what you think is the main plot about 3/4 of the way into the movie. The cast was brilliantly selected and they all contribute in unique ways. This film pays off in the end.

The believability factor of four geezers being sent on a orbital repair mission was stretched beyond willful suspension of disbelief.Had they chosen a project other than this, perhaps a \\"Last ride of the...\\" type Action/Comedy/Western, I believe we as audience members would have gone along for the ride with a bit more gusto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very technically inaccurate, but mildly funny","review":"Well, this film is definitely following suit for technical inaccuracies in movies. NASA wants to repair this \\"broken\\" Soviet satellite before it burns into the earths atmosphere, and then miraculously launch it back up into Geosynchronous orbit. Ok. First of all, if the satellite was originally in a GEO orbit (22,000nmi above earth) how did it get all the way down here in low earth orbit (~210nmi)?? Second, why would you want to put a military defense satellite with nuclear warheads all the way up in GEO?? Third, how the heck do thy launch it back up to the mmon at the end????

Albeit the seemingly mandatory sexual references which really have nothing to do with the plot and don't actually add to the flow of the story buzz around like summer flies but if you're willing to live with them and just shrug them off it's well worth the read.

For all crime novel fans please read.... you will not be disappointed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby, its cold outside","review":"... let me emphasize that this spine- (and whole body) chilling book takes place in the *fictional* town of Algonquin Bay, Ontario, CA. I suspect, though, that like Ed McBain's Isola and others, the name is a fictionalized nomer for a real place: North Bay, eh? I further suspect that the villains herein are fictional spawn of Canada's gruesome twosome Bernardo/ Homolka.Giles Blount's first novel is a \\"captive\\"ating tale of the evil some men (and women) do. And the US reader learns something of Canadian Law Enforcement along the way. Are they referring to Notre Dame football? The Apocalypse? No. The \\"Horsemen\\" to which they refer, in a non-deferential tone, are the Royal Canadian Mounted Police."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment!","review":"This book hooked me on the first page, with its description of just what winter is like in Algonquin Bay, Ontario, in what even Canadians call \\"the North.\\" John Cardinal is a police detective with a Past and a string of murders of adolescents to solve. His partner is Lise Delorme, six years in Special Investigations (i.e., political cases and what we in the U.S. would call Internal Affairs), whose assignment is to investigate Cardinal, as well as to help solve the murders. So far, so good. Blunt gets you into Cardinal's mind, into the personality of this frozen little town, into the relationship between the local cops and the RCMP . . . and then he blows it completely. One-third of the way into the story, he tells you who the killer is. A serious error on the part of the author. What began as a potentially first-rate murder mystery degenerates into a mediocre thriller. At the two-thirds mark, I gave it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Police procedural","review":"O Canada, your Ontario setting was the only good thing in this novel. Everything else was... well, blunt.

This one and Lost Girls by Andrew Pyper. Of the two \\"Forty Words\\" was by far the better. For readers tired of the \\"series\\" novels where the detctives are cardboard cutouts that Dashiell Hammett used almost a century ago, this book is for you. The characters are all well developed and real (some real frightening). The book avoids the vices of most mystery books (the sexy feamle who may or may not be trusted, the deep dark secret that would change evertything, etc.) Some reviews have suggested that the book is too sadistic, but the sadism only makes the book seem more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous play, fabulous recording.","review":"This is a review of \\"Waiting for Godot,\\" Naxos Audio Books; Unabridged edition (March 2006).A great play rendered in a pitch-perfect performance. Listening to this recording brought to life a play I already know quite well in new ways. The actors capture the language's cadences, the characters' vacillations between resignation and curiosity, and the play's intelligence and humor. The sound effects are simple and effective, and the recording quality flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"An acquired taste","review":"As an absurdist philosophical exploration on the meaning of life (or lack of), it entertains in the dark perspective that life itself is a comedy, with or without a punch line, when one spends it waiting for something else than life itself. \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is very much an acquired taste. Reading the book has to be less satisfying that seeing the play, but this shortcoming is mitigated by the fact that it is generally performed with a minimalist décor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for Godot, Maxnotes","review":"I had the joy of seeing Waiting for Godot performed on Broadway last year and wanted a copy of the script. I found out when these notes arrived that it was not the script, but I decided to read it anyway and I am very glad I did. For anyone who has enjoyed this work of Beckett's these notes add a dimension to the experience that makes it richer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"The Kindle edition listed here is NOT Harold Bloom's edition.

This book was alright, it's not one of the best of the series, but it certainly isn't one of the worst. The mystery is okay and there is a reasonable amount of action. I wasn't glued to the book with every page, but it did manage to keep me more-or-less interested throughout. This isn't a book I'd highly recommend; although, it is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Fans of Janet Evanovitch and Dan Brown will probably enjoy this, but if you are looking for an interesting story, well-told, look elsewhere. This book follows the standard romance novel plot, with more violence and explicit sex. It is written in the sort of breathless, unedited prose that keeps the story moving along without allowing the reader to stop and realize that nothing of interest is happening. It would be an improvement if the characters were two-dimensional. As it is they are stock characters, drawn with all the subtlety of the inhabitants of TV commercials. This book has nothing to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful read","review":"It's prime time Sunday evening and I just finished reading THE ASSASSIN.

What is going on in Hollywood these days?Anyways, the plot is horrible, the acting is horrible, the lighting is horrible, the cinematography is horrible, and the directing is a joke. You are better off watching grass grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the movie or Barnes will sue you!!!!","review":"This movie is so incredibly awful that the star, Steve Barnes, has filed a lawsuit against an Atlanta radio station and it's dj's for making fun of it. Although it doesn't seem possible, as pathetic an actor as Steve Barnes as shown himself to be, he is an even more pathetic human being.Buying this movie would be a crime against mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to Radio!","review":"I am a Barnes fan from his early morning radio show days.. All I can say is that when people try to do a cross-over from one medium to the next they should really rethink doing it in low-budget.. The movie IS however quite entertaining from Corey Feldmans performance.. I said entertaining, not worth buying.. Rent this if your 99x morning show fan/Steve Barnes fan/or a Corey Feldman fan.. As for the young & the restless star it was an eye-opener on how old I really am because I thought he had died!!!

If you want to visit Fort Williams and Spean Bridge (which are about 20 miles apart), you have to look under the F's and under the S's (over 100 pages apart) to find information about these two towns, rather than being able to turn a page or two, as the Frommer's or Eyewitness guides permit.

It ran 4 minutes, then the motor burned out. I was given a refund for the purchase price, but lost over $35. in shipping charges over this fiasco.

Excellent for basic everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the counter space","review":"I bought this based on the positive reviews and am terribly disapointed with this thing. I tried to slice a round roast with less than stellar results. The manual stated you need to shut this thing down after 10 minutes to let it cool off..Come-on..whats the deal..this thing cant run 10 lousy minutes?? Well, no, it cant. It got real hot and ran lousy. It seemed to have very little power. On the plus side, it is easy to clean up and the blade adjustment is nice. This might be good for slicing up a tomato for your sandwich, but for anything more demanding stick with your basic knife, it's just not worh the space it takes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maximal over-writing...","review":"It is a grand thing to be beautiful, young and rich. That statement has nothing to do with Ms. Eberstadt's novel. That's her. I read this book after being misinformed that it reflected something in fiction of the facts around Jean-Michel Basquiat's life. Well, Isaac - Ms. Eberstadt's vaporous lead character in this novel - is nothing like Basquiat neither in his physical description (Isaac is a lumbering, blond, blue-eyed New Hampshire farm boy) nor in his art (as described in her novel, Isaac's paintings are as overworked as Ms. Eberstadt's fevered writing). This book is only worth reading if you don't have to work for a living."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of precious trees","review":"I was so disappointed in this book, especially after reading so many wonderful things about it in every magazine that reviewed it. Fortunately, I waited until it ended up in the remainder bin, and only paid $7 for it. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, and the writing is so overwrought and pretentious; I found it painful to read. Ms. Eberstadt has no understanding of what it is to be an artist. She writes from the viewpoint of a rich society girl. I couldn't get through the book; I stopped halfway through in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Privileged and precious","review":"Amazing how delicately Eberstadt poses her vapid insights and observations, passing them off as high art when it is so painfully obvious she and her prose are the products of the Upper East Side, wealth, and publishing connections. This is rarified, elitist, and thoroughly contemptuous. Awful in what it represents."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL DEAL","review":"This is exactly what I wanted genuine Nokomis by Coty.

The book has raised controversies, not the least being \\"How can we get there?\\". In this book Barnett outlines the process for developing an international core consensus for a plan of action to handle unruly states and unruly non-state organizations. He shows how the US can make realistic arrangements with China and India to make them security allies in Asia, to deal with Asian problems like North Korea and deflate the sails of terrorist organizations. He calls for significant transformation in Blueprint_for_Action:_A_Future_Worth_Creating, but in return he points out how real \\"peace dividends\\" can be obtained.

I picked this book up for 5.99 and I'm guessing the author is already thoroughly and rightfully discredited. The author promotes fascism (of the classical kind) to a degree comparable to Hilter's National Socialism - even despite that much overused metaphor.The author's main point is that \\"might makes right\\". It has never worked before and it won't work now. It is contrary to the American Perspective and well, the Constitution. The people won't stand for seeing their sons and daughters spill their blood for the CEOs and Chickenhawks who have never seen combat and don't know a thing about it.If adopted, this plan would lead to not only the destruction of the American way of life, but our country's existence. It should rightfully be consigned to the trash heap of history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting but dangerous idea","review":"In this book, Barnett is proposing a system of utopian collective imperialism - a system under which the developed world would cooperate to impose order on the non-developed world. Both to prevent trouble and for the recipient's/victims' own good.Leaving ethical issues of imperium aside, there is a serious question as to the viability of this plan. Barnett is very willing to sacrifice conventional warfighting abilities in order to support his imperial forces. This might work - but only if the rest of the developed world goes along with it. A dubious proposition at best.I'd recommend reading this book - but only to be able to refute the arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memories!","review":"The track 'It's You' has never let me down in all the years this album has been released---the backgrounds with Patti Austin and Valerie Simpson elevate this cut like only a small few can do.

It would be worth a lot more than 99 cents if it were useable. Unfortunately, It is completely useless in this version and is worth nothing. Anglo-Saxon (Old English) has characters that are not in the standard 26 Latin character set. This version garbles them so that they are not recognizeable. Even the text that you can make out ends up being split up in ways that make it hard to read. It is impossible to search for anything because of the character font problem.Too bad! I thought maybe I could search for an Anglo-Saxon word and find it. Does not work. Even searching for words in modern English does not work on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Astonishing","review":"I found this book to be quite astonishing.

This cd could have been good if he would stay away from club bangers and focus on the thing that make us love R.Kelly like the erotic love songs and when he gets in touch with his spiritual side. Although some may think it is a bit hypocritical, but most of us have the same personalities. Anyway, this cd seems really forced and I know he could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This is not the R. Kelly we all know and loved instead this is a wannabe rapper (sorta like the Tyreese rap album)I don't think he can rightfully claim to be the king of r&b if he doesn't make r&b music!

R.Kelly's latest release DOUBLE UP, fails to bring that R&B feel to it. Yeah, it does bring more Rap than he usually does, and I can't lie...\\"I'm A Flirt,\\" was a good song.

I expected more of the crooner side of R Kelly since he is 40 years old now! It is especially dissapointing knowing he is capabale of such great CD's like TP2 and the Chocolate Factory. It appears he has done what with many artists are doing now, rushing through albums just to get something out there and lose focus what made them big in the first place. Carl Thomas CD is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the!!!???","review":"This cd is not good. I think that R Kelly could do way better. I bought this cd on hope that it would be some bomb @#$ R Kelly @&%!. When I got in my car and started listening to this mess I was disapointed. I'm a 25 yr old woman and this cd does not appeal to me at all. R Kelly is too old to be puttin mess like this out.I dont even think Usher would take this route. Best song on the cd is \\"Imma flirt\\".The song \\"Same Girl\\" is not tight. Usher should slap hisself for saying yes to the song. Note to R Kelly:Stop making songs with stupid induendos. It was tight at first but its stupid now. make a better cd next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What He Used To Be!","review":"I will start by sayng that I am a 34yr old who was hooked on Kelly since his start with Public Announcement. I was 16 or 17 and Kelly was the bomb. Somewhere after You Remind Me, it went all wrong! I gues we, his initial audience, became to old for his interest so he aimed for the younger fans and got himself wrapped up.Nevertheless, I supported him. I remember when Chocolate City was released with the bonus Loveland disc, I was the only person waiting to purchase it and got it for only $7.99. Best purchase I ever made as I still play it continously to this day.Well, I have said all this to say it's been a long time for Kelly to still be in the game but it is time he realizes that a 40 yr old SHOULD NOT be still singing about being a babby daddy and tryin to get a number. I mean the same girl track, come on - he nor Usher is 15!I rated this album 1 star because I am not a 13 yr old and two, zeros aren't a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still at large!","review":"Make money for a large record company and you can stay out of prison for ______ing underage girls!

I have always been a huge fan of R Kelly and it pains me to say this is one of the worst CDs EVER. He started to get on my nerves with singing conversations, but now it has hit an all time low. Real Talk was a surprise, but after you got past the shock it was completely awful as well as laughable. I'm not 30 yet and to me this CD should appeal to no one with an ounce of sense. Luckily I didn't buy this I heard it from someone else, this is not even worth burning off the internet, don't waste the CD and definitely don't waste the money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the hell is the King of RnB???","review":"For the last 15 years I have been a die hard R. Kelly fan...I got a little shaky when the charges came up, But nevertheless I still rocked with him. NOW...I dont know. Its like I'm 24 and even I'm tired of the club songs. I want the R. Kelly that recorded Born in the 90's, 12play, R. Kelly, TP2, R. (2disc) and Chocolate Factory. TP3 and this double up, I can do without. As funny as \\"real talk\\" is, its nothing you can sing with...nothing you want to sing 10 years from now like you would \\"Slow Dance.\\" This is disposable music thats he's putting out right now!

Every artist is allowed a foul-up. Kells' foul-up was TP.3, but he's done it again with Double Up. It doesn't appeal to those who came up with him during the time of Born into the 90's, 12 Play, R. Kelly and R. Like many reviewers have stated, R. is 40 now. It's time to make music to reflect it. Double Up has some of the weakest lyrics I've ever heard from an R & B album. You're not 25 anymore, and neither are the majority of your fans. Don't just say you're the \\"king of R & B\\". Prove it to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of THE worst CDs ever.

Nothing beats a grown up and apparently most of the world feel the same way. Anyway, I originally bought this Cd because of two songs in particular but I ended up with more, so yes I'm happy that I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for the indiscriminate","review":"This album is a symptom of a much larger problem as this is what passes for R&B nowadays. R&B has taken on the worst aspects of Hip-Hop radio style with every track being made to bang in the club rather than touch the soul. As the previous reviewer wrote, I too was expecting a little more maturity from a 40-yr-old with Peter Pan syndrome. Throughout this album I wasn't sure if Kelly was trying to get me to dance or just make me laugh. Tracks like \\"The Zoo\\" and \\"Sweet Tooth\\" are just to darn juvenile. A concept that you would think a person in his position would be trying to distance himself from. \\"Sex Planet\\" is just plain dumb and most of the songs dont say anything beyond the usual Rap themes of party and bull. The only saving grace is the tracks are banging so its okay party music to have in the backround if you can turn your brain off to the lyrics. My wife can do that, I'm cursed with the need for substance so I can't do that. 2 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedophile","review":"Can't take any of his songs seriously, everytime I hear him sing I think he's tryin to sing to the 15 and 16 year olds.

Lost all credibility to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Retire","review":"This CD is not good at all. He needs to leave all the crunk, snap,thug-a-boo music to the youngins. I don't even like it with them, but at least they have an excuse.

The first chapter was excellent, spot-on with what I thought the book would be able. The author ably described the exciting future and the possibilities of change that portable 3D printers, CNC, etc could lead to.The rest of the book (90%) is totally different. It is a short couple of pages on student projects from pupils of the author. Each 2 pages is a different project and summary, usually with a picture. That's ok, but it isn't the most exciting book then. The focus changes completely to just a list of ideas. Some are exciting, some are kinda boring. If you just want a list of cool, exciting ideas and projects it'd be much better to google the Make Blog and get an unlimited list of great ideas (with instructions to DIY).1-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book should be read by everyone who is involved in helping other countries.

This book is more of a sumation of some of the possibilities that microfabrication can bring to the world. This was a very good read and is inspiring to those with imagination. Well, if you don't have imagination, you probably aren't going to do too well when microfabrication tech truely becomes much more mainstream in the next 10 years--and it is coming despite any unenlightened assertions to the contrary. The 3D printing technology is already being proven and people with brains realize how fast printing technology comes down in price.Also, I've seen a computer controlled wood milling machine on the market for under 2k now; metal milling won't be too far behind. A clever person could put such things to good use in a small business framework.If you have an imagination, this book will be a good read.

The MIT FABLabs have been set up in a number of places around the world and this book tells us of the experiences that MIT students, et al, have undergone in setting them up and the things that they find people interested in making.There is nothing in this book about other people's developments in personal fabrication (such as Fab@home or RepRap) but these may have occurred after the book was written.All in all the book is a useful starting point introducing people to the perhaps novel idea of personal manufacturing, a growing field of endeavour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited value","review":"It's hard to take this book seriously when it states (p. 8) \\"The term neutral is not defined in Article 100 of the Code.

(It appears 315 times in the NEC itself.) Further, the neutral is not always grounded. In a large sidebar in Article 200 of the Handbook, it states \\"The grounded conductor is often, but not always, the neutral conductor. For example, in a single-phase 2-wire or in a 3-phase corner-grounded delta system, the intentionally grounded conductor is not a neutral conductor.\\" The author seems to have an inadequate grasp of his topic, both conceptually and factually.

Also,the bulbs are available on Amazon for about 10% of the big box store cost. Make sure to use a tissue or glove to hold the new bulb when replacing it. Oils or grease from your fingers will shorten the life of a halogen bulb dramatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the 20W instead...","review":"I have just installed a system with both these 10W and some 20W lights, too.

The story follows the opera \\"La Traviata\\", which is not new territory for Metzger (Carmen, Baby), and is based on the Alexandre Dumas story \\"Lady of the Camellias\\". The most interesting aspect of this film is the use of color, the extravagant costumes, and the photography. This film has a reputation as being a sort of \\"soft-core\\" sex film, but actually it is very tame compared to many other adult films from that decade. The film does have some flaws, such as editing and acting, however it is visually soothing. The soundtrack by Piero Piccioni is the best psychedelic film music I have ever heard. A good choice for fans of that \\"Peter Max\\" look."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EARLY 70s PSYCHO-ITALIANA","review":"An old story gets a soft-porn twist in Metzger's 1970 outing. Some artfully framed sex scenes, Piero Piccioni's catchy, sexy soundrack, and some fun costumes of the period-imagining-the-not-too-distant-furture make the enterprise a cut way above most films of this genre. Production design fans will like it for no reason other than its aesthethic, which recalls Pietro Germi's great TENTH VICTIM of four years earlier (1966). This was Metzger's best foray before Zalman King usurped the genre (you know, TWO MOON JUNCTION and all that jazz). What one should really do though is find the incredible score by Maestro Piero Piccioni (available on Easy Tempo Records).

It was not much of a story, nor was it particularly erotic. It is one of only handful of movies over the course of watching literally thousands that I could not finish watching. I tried twice, but it was just too boring.

Instead, I had to stop watching it 30 minutes into it. The transfer is terrible. It's full of scratches and it's out of focus or taken from a very old film stock.

As a young woman with a small baby to raise, I found this book helpful with some nice ideas, but without the time to do them in.

All her suggestions for saving money assumes the reader/bride a/ knows how to do all this and b/ has the time to do it all. Most of the chores also need to be done in less than 2 days before the wedding. She suggests the possibility of borrowing all the flowers for the wedding or making them out of silk flowers.

Isabelle Huppert is enchanting and self-assured as the mother. Louis Garrel is the come-of-age son. MA MERE takes you into sadism, nudity, sex and incest. Not exactly family fare.

Facile, shallow characterizations of morally defunct and corrupt people mixed with lots of bad, cheesy sex scenes.

Somewhat provocative and engaging story is undercut by too much philosophical rambling, a general air of seediness, and a downer ending. I'm not saying that those elements represent weaknesses of the movie, only that they'll prevent you from enjoying the film on anything other than an \\"artistic\\" level, if you're inclined to do so. In other words, this isn't an exciting movie about a sexy mom introducing her shy son to her sexy friends. Though there is a sexy mom and some sexy friends. So, if the mere presence of those elements- underused as they are- is enough for you, go for it.

When his mother comes back, the relationship begins to turn incestual, and during a lovemaking scene in which some bloodletting is performed she dies. The son mourns her death in his own way, and cries at the end. I didn't exactly get a clear sense of what was happening, but it is a unique film that I enoyed watching.

Christophe Honore definitely manifests such a desire, but his film infinitely bores and oozes a school-boy's titillation with the 'merely' sexual in Bataille's novella 'Ma Mere'.There is always an anti-visual element in Bataille's work, marked by his obsession with the blinding sun and the blind patriarch- hence, to anticipate the visual in Bataille, is to expect something more than pallid drama driven by character analysis and stunted spectacles of sex. It is a challenging task to represent the (anti)retinal equivalent of the disorienting syntax of Bataille. Disappointingly, Christophe Honore's film is no visual experiment - it only shows individuals experimenting with sex! These myopic, cinematic interpretations of Bataille's work do him more damage than 'honor'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I watched this trash for almost an hour.

The film leaves you thinking. The mother who realizes she is dragging her only love into her world and wishes to save him but he is already tainted. You really have to watch this film more than once in order to understand it.However, while watching this film I had the feeling we still get a much cut edition here in the states.

I am sorry to say I was disappointed. While the characters are more realistic, the plot made no sense.

Still in all if you are looking for a good read this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basis for new series","review":"If only the writing of the preface of Grave Sight wasn't positively awesome, I would not have had such great expectations for the latest from Charlaine Harris. BUT, the body of the book wasn't the gripping caliber of the preface. The premise is an interesting one - a young woman who was struck by lightning when she was 16, and it changed her life - the trauma added a new sense - the ability of finding the dead and seeing how they died - She now travels around with her step-brother helping folks find their missing loved ones - for a price - The story bogs down as Harper gets too wrapped up in the small town intrigues, and you lose track of what she does -If Ms. Charlaine centers on the premise of the talent of the characters, and what drives them, she'd have a great series.Hopefully the next in this series will take off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I really liked the Sookie Stackhouse series so figured this one would be good as well.

Charlaine Harris is grossly over-rated and is really a below-average writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly good","review":"I too read this b/c of vampire series. I expected this to be different, and it is. I liked the grimmer heroine but found the plot predictable. I figured out who the killer was by page 5, but I kept reading anyway b/c the book was enjoyable. I also found the romance lackluster, but that too was okay b/c Harris' eye for atmosphere kept me reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I usually enjoy Charlaine Harris so much, and was excited to read a new series. I did finish this book, but I never connected with the characters. The story wasn't edgy enough. The characters weren't charming or funny. I had a difficult time making myself finish, secretly hoping something wonderfully exciting would happen and save the story. This one is definately not my favorite Harris book. Don't waste the time, just re-read one of the Sookie Stackhouse books, it's much more fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Harris's book but I have to sya that I was very disappointed with this one. I thought it had a very interesting premis but it just didn't pan out. Also the editor did a terrible job going over this book. There were typos in the dialogue, parts of conversations just made no sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"New series, good read","review":"I'm excited about Ms. Harris new series. As always, her characters are well written. Harper and Tolliver are only trying to make a living from Harper's handicap (finding dead people). They are asked to come to a small town to see if they can find a missing girl. Harper does find the girl, but doesn't provide the answer the town is looking for. A murder occurs after they leave the town and when asked, they return. Ms. Harris has crafted a great story, there is tension between Harper and Tolliver (brother/sister tension IMO) and it seems everyone in town is kin in some manner. A GOOD read, can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dark","review":"This is a very dark book-even darker than the Lily Bard series. I have always enjoyed Ms. Harris' books-especially the humor and characterizations of the characters. None of that was present in this book-it was populated with deeply negative characters and the storyline itself was negative and depressing.I found the intense-and borderline psychotic-neediness and dependency of Harper to be very unattractive and unsettling. I, like previous reviewers, just don't like weak, needy women."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I'm used to from Harris","review":"While this book about a woman who can sense dead bodies and see the how they died, is from one of my favorite authors, I have to agree that it didn't keep my attention like her \\"Dead\\" series. I agree with most reviewers, that I was uncomfortable with the relationship she has with her stepbrother. I know they depend on each other, but I thought at any minute they can jump each other and it gives me the creep out factor. The book was an easy read, but I wasn't sure I enjoyed the experience. If this is the beginning of a new series, I'll probably wait until it comes out on paperback before picking it up. I came away from this book not really caring about the main character, unlike Sookie ( who I can't get enough of!). Sorry, just not a great book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise for Me","review":"I enjoyed the dark tone of this book. I feel like the subtle affection between Harper and Tolliver is something that could really happen to two people in their positions. I like the way they take up for each other and lean on each other so much. Charlaine Harris does a great job keeping you guessing about the murderer until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I've read all of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books and although the first book was a little hard to get through, they continued to get much better and I loved the series as a whole. So I was excited to start on this series even after reading some not-so-great reviews. I was not impressed...at all. It started out good. I had high hopes. But the bad guy was soooooooooooo obvious right from the beginning. The jail time story line was a page filler at best. This book is not terribly long to begin with and it could have been cut in half without losing any important information. I enjoyed the two main characters, Harper and her brother. I plan to read the next book in this series hoping that they will improve like the sookie stackhouse series did. But this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave reading.","review":"I found this book hard to stay with. It was dull, boring, and I had the killer and the plot figured out before I was half way through the book. Such a disappointment after reading the Sookie books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad i didn't buy it","review":"This book did not live up to my expectations of the author. I really enjoy the Southern Vampire books, and this was no where near as entertaining. The story is plodding,even the action is monotone, the characters have lots of potential, but are dimly painted and i just couldn't care for them, the plot is predictable, the motives obvious but unrealistic, a blatant knockoff of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake...all in all this was a sad attempt at mystery writing. This book gave me so little, i can't even give more of a review. If you must read it, please borrow from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea...","review":"Coming with great enthusiasm from the sookie books, I was hoping to find an equally as good series to start reading. Although the book is well-written and interesting to those who enjoy this stuff,this genre just doesn't do it for me. It's more detective story than I expected, and it was slow-goin' for me. This Sookie fan was disappointed. P.S.- there is nothing romantic about this book. At all. And no sexual tension between the two main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get in the car and leave","review":"I think Vicki nailed it in her 'great premise, bad execution' review. After I saw the story was spinning it's wheels I skipped to the end and did not miss much. What I did miss was rehashed and the ending was just to obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggghhhh...","review":"What a bunch of drivel...the main character couldn't have a drier, more uninteresting personality if she were a soda cracker! Beyond being totally predictable as a mystery, the rude, dismissive, and completely cold and colorless attitudes of the two \\"siblings\\" made this book almost unreadable. Why should the reader care about anything in this book when the humorless main character barely can bring herself to care acout anything but herself? The characters in this book, with the possible exception of the policeman, are ridiculously flat and self absorbed. I've never felt the need to write a review before, but I couldn't let go of the irritation that felt reading this. The most irritating thing about it is that it could have been executed so much better by an author who even pretended to appreciate her readers by inserting even an ounce of personality into her characters. I felt like I needed to wash the dust off my hands after reading this formulaic and shallow piece of...work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozzzzz","review":"One thing that I have to say is that it is a fast read. Besides that the book is a total letdown. First off, I kept reading it thinking it is going to get more interesting but sadly it did not. The characters are extremely uninteresting and undeveloped. The main character was hit by lightening at a young age and now can sense the dead. Besides that, that is truly all we learn about her. Oh and she has a strange fascination with her brother. Then the book takes place in the most boring town that sets the backdrop for the whole book. And lastly, you know who did it from the very beginning but you keep reading in order to find out why he did it. And the reason on why he did it is not even that plausible. I am truly sad to say that I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for the next Sookie or Bella?","review":"I am book worm in a readers block. I loved the Sookie Stackhouse Series and enjoyed Twilight. I am an avid reader and have been downloading sample of some books for the last 2 weeks. I decided to give a try to Charline Harries first book of the series Grave Sight. I must say that at the point I reached 50% exactly on my Kindle I started screaming in frustration. I figured out the answer to the obvious mystery. I would not recommend this book, if you are looking to continue after Sookie or Bella, it's a very fast pace book with a bunch of filling in between pages. Charlaine is a great writer it's a fast read and its not a heavy book, but honestly it's a very weak mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Read","review":"The characters are much more interesting than the plot of this mystery. Harper, the protagonist, was struck by lightening, which somehow gave her the ability to hear how people died when she is close to their corpses. She is now in business with her half-brother, Tolliver, helping people find out what happened to their loved ones. One of the strengths of the novel is the siblings' relationship--they are survivors of a very abusive childhood, and take care of each other. One of the weaknesses of the novel is its predictability--I caught on to some of the mysteries hundreds of pages before any of the characters did, and I am no Sherlock Holmes. Nonetheless, this was an entertaining read & I'll be sure to check out the next novel in the series. I do appreciate that this mystery was not too graphic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"Hopefully I won't offend the author when I say I had never heard of her before about a week ago, but now I'm very glad I have. I really found this first novel in the series a good read, it piqued my interest so much so that I had a hard time stopping reading. I purchased it for my Kindle and as soon as I finished it, went back and got book #2 and I haven't regretted either one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"I really LOVED the Sookie books, but this series was horrible! Boring was the plot, boring were the characters. And the inconsistencies about drove me nuts! First Nell was \\"under age\\" but she was in her last year of highschool. Then the book said she was 16 and a few chapters later, she was 17 (but no birthday had taken place). I love Charlaine Harris but I am very detail oriented and her inconsistencies when she writes drive me crazy! Then, apparently, a man kills half the town because he finds out that his two kids were having a child together. Come on! When the book FINALLY ended and I found out the reason for the killings I could not believe how stupid this book was. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A change of pace","review":"I have never found Ms. Harris' books particularly riveting, although typically well-written with an interesting story line. My problem was that I wasn't really able to relate to the main character, this is not true for this book.Ms. Harris does something that most authors have trouble by making a different character who does not strike you as exactly the same as every other book she has written. I actually like the main character of this book much better than Sookie, thus finding the entire book much more riveting. Also, the main man (romance?) in this one is much more likable than those in the Sookie Stackhouse series.If you maybe have read one of Ms. Harris' books already and found that they were interesting, but not one of your favorites. Try this one it really is a different and enjoyable change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave Sight horror","review":"I am 63% of the way through with Charlene Harris' Grave Sight and I have no interest in finishing the reading of this novel. There is no mystery here; there is no suspense, no drama, and no romantic interest. All of the characters are duds, just like the supposed heroine, except for her ability to find dead bodies and relive their final moments of life before death claims them. Obviously, Charlene Harris was not struck by lightening when she came up with this bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harper Connelly Series","review":"I've read all of the Sookie series, and love the writers humor, unique wit, and creative style.Unfortunately this seriers is not as fun or uplifting as I'd hoped. The writing is good, the mystery also is really good, maybe it's just the subject matter....finding people who are not lost but dead, beyond hope,most of the people the hero deals with detest them, etc.... I will finish the series because I bought them, but won't buy anymore. Having lost my own child and a husband who deals with exploited/missing children professionally, brought back too many bad feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a Sookie Stackhouse....","review":"I love Charlaine's Sookie Stackhouse series. Based on the love of that series, I decided to give this series a chance. Sadly, this series is such the same story over and over again, with some small changes here and there. I read 3 books from this series and the last one made me yawn.Not that much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"Thank you for my books. I am very happy with the turn out with the delivery. The books seemed like they were practically brand new...even though I bought them used."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult character to like","review":"Like many other reviewers, I'm a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series. You get sexy vampires, violent murders, comedy, and Sookie. Sookie is the main reason to enjoy the series; she's just such a likable gal, despite everything.Not so Harper, the protagonist of this series. She's depressed (or seems to be), deeply cynical, and just plain negative. In real life I find these sorts of people draining. OK, so maybe it makes for a well-rounded character of depth, but really, is such a person enjoyable to be around?I think I'm going to skip the rest of the series and try one of Harris' other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me interested!","review":"I wasn't sure that I would like these books. I read all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and watched True Blood on HBO. I started reading these and I am already on the third book!! Love them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating premise, great character","review":"I loved every book in this series; if you like the paranormal, with some maybe-actual-science and good mystery thrown in, you will appreciate these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grave Sight","review":"The first in the Harper Connelly series, this is a quick, intelligent, fun read. Harper has been struck by lightning and because of it, she can find dead bodies. An interesting line of work leads her into a mess in the small town of Sarne where she's been hired. Along with her step brother Tolliver, Harper sets out to find a body and ends up nearly getting herself killed.Like many of Charlaine Harris' stories, this one is packed with funny characters, an interesting story plot and it's fair share of dry humor. Makes me want to read more in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to DIG DEEP to finish this book!","review":"After reading Harris' Sookie and Aurora series, I was excited to meet Harper. I will NOT be reading another Harper book. The plot was lame - through the entire book the reader finds themselves asking \\"WHY are you staying in this town???\\" Then, Harper and her brother finally decide to leave, only to agree to a last meeting with the townsfolk. The meeting is predictably a trap that Harper manages to escape from.If you are dimwitted you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sookie Stackhouse","review":"Harper is no Sookie. I love the Sookie Stackhouse books, and was excited to read these, but I had to force my way through Grave Sight. Harper is whiney and moody and all she ever wants to do is \\"get out of this town\\". Tolliver, her brother is not any better.These characters definitely don't have much appeal. I read the 3rd book first and liked it better. Mainly because there was some relationship tension between the 2 characters.I wasn't entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewww....","review":"I didn't care much for the book at all. Infact, I can't really think of anything I did like about it. I didn't care much for Harper's character. I found her annoying and her reaction towards her brother's one night stands are somewhat creepy. Tolliver wasn't much better. He travels all over with his sister and picks up waitresses. I got bored with Harper's story of being struck by lightening repeated again and again and again. I had a difficult time getting into it since I disliked the two main characters and found their overly close relationship rather creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not nearly as good as the Sookie Stackhouse Series but still worth the read","review":"I did not really know what to expect with this series. After reading the Twilight Series and the Sookie Stackhouse Series, I thought I would never come to like another series. While this series is not nearly as good, it was still pretty entertaining. Charlaine Harris has a great imagination! I would have never expected a sixth sense as finding dead people. Good read overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series(and book) are both confusing and going downhill","review":"I have a question. In this book it says Trib is a buckskin. But the cover, and parts of the book, has him as a paint. I hope that the series will come back. Sammy, Cindy, Max, Heather, Tor, Mandy, and Asheigh. You're proboly thinking, hey, Ash is in the book? She isn't! This is not the same Ash! Joanna, please oh please come back and make the series about racing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina is SUCH a brat!!!!!","review":"Ok, look I totally LOVED the book Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle because besides that book just being all around great, I really admired Christina in that book.....she was brave, nice and not bratty. I liked her attitude in that book. So then I heard about these books coming out in the series about her and I was really excited and I started reading them and really DISLIKING them. Christina has SUCH a bad attitude and she's so bratty, stuck-up and spoiled. So either they change Christina's attitude or get the books back to racing....and if they don't then the TB series has just lost another customer! So change the series so your readers can enjoy the books again!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP IT!","review":"I just read this book and its not that bad! I like the racing ones better, but face it, these are more realistic. How many young girls train RACEHORSES the way Ashleigh, Samantha, and Cindy did. I think Joanna is really smart to alternate books between jumping and racing. GREAT idea and a GOOD book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Here?","review":"I haven't read this book, and I don't plan to! What has happened to this series? It was set up perfectly when Glory's Joy was born, and I thought Honor Bright was going to make a good star. But it didn't get far enough to reach full potential! Is this series up for sale, and whatever crappy \\"author\\" wants it can buy it and write a few books, until they are booed down from their pedistol by their \\"adoring\\" fans? The series used to be mediocre, in my opinion, but it has progressed to downright INSULTING! Don't expect me to waste over four dollars on what is worth only the paper its printed on! The awful \\"Thoroughbred\\" series has just lost yet another customer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is SO pointless","review":"Why do we have so many books about camp? It's boring and all the same. I don't think the writer is very inspired. I'm not reading these. I refuse to because they are stupid. I might read a few of the racing books in the future, but as far as the jumping stuff, I'm not going to read pointless babble. And if the future racing books are just as petty and unrealistic, I'll quit reading those too. Just because it has some races in it doesn't make it wonderful. May the writer remember that. It has to be more than a few races. Research won't kill you. Your readers aren't stupid, they're unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Camp Book","review":"In this book, Melanie has to win the last show of the session at Camp Saddlebrook. Otherwise her dad will take her home. Lately, lots of wierd things have happening and Melanie's been blamed. Can Melanie prove to her dad that she has changed before he takes her back to New York for good?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be fair","review":"Although we all know what a gift Ms. Campbell has, we should remember how challenging it is to pick up where someone else left off. That is not saying that I prefer Allison Estes' books, but I think we should be fair. Camp Saddlebrook, which was not written by AE was, I think, the best so far of the \\"Christina books.\\" And I just thought of something: The character Max Smith, who I, personally think is a sweetheart, was not created by Joanna. Karen Bently developed him........"},{"rating":"1","title":"They are getting a little better....not enough though","review":"I have to agree with everyone, the books are hard to write. I have written 3 short stories, titled- \\"The Black Colt\\", \\"You Killed My Sister, the Devil Shall Kill You\\", and the third isn't titled yet.Also, these books do haev some mistakes in them. Like when Princess got hurt and in book #16, page38 and 39, last line on pg 38 and 1st 3 paragraphs on 93 were saying that Ashleigh didn't want to ride another horse in the Derby except for Princess, but Ashleigh was NOT Princess's jockey. There were a lot of mistakes in all of the \\"new\\" books, expecially the \\"newer\\" ones- like 23 and up.all in all this book was ok, though very predictialbe. The only charater that I don't like is Christina- but only at times.hopefully the books will get better. If anyone wants to talk bout them e-mail me at LuvTBracin@aol.com (love thoroughbred racing)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone agrees!","review":"I see that everyone agree's about most of these books. It is very true that some of the facts are getting mixed up. Example (21, I think said that a filly hadn't won the Belmont stakes in over a century.) Ashleigh must be a 110 years old. And what did Wonder do then. I disagree with most of the other readers though on Cindy and Glory. I loved the two of them. When I read about them I got all warm inside, because they were such a good team.Christina is another story, I like her but she dosn't belong in this series. This series is about racing after all. They could write that Christina has a younger sister whom loves racing, or maybe Samantha and Tor could have a kid. BUT NOOOOO more show jumping! I'm glad that Joanna Campbell has a new series on Ashleigh and I will read it faithfully! Keep up the good work Joanna!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up!!","review":"All of you stupid people who are dissin' Melanie should look at this more closely. Melanie is a girl who was bad just to get attention since she got so little at home with her father. As you can see if you really read these books she is trying to clean up her act. I only gave this book 2 stars because I haven't read it yet. I miss Joanna as much or more than the rest of you but I believe that we need to give these books a chance. I really loved the books about Cindy and Max and I want to know exactly how their relationship turned out. I would love it if either Joanna Cambell or Karen Bently came back they were both extremely good writers, well the more I think about it I liked Karen Bently better 'cause she gave the books more feeling and emotion. I actually cried when Cindy and Max fought, that's how good she was. Okay I just wanted to say to stop dissin' Melanie. Good-Bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melanie's Last Ride","review":"Melanie's Last Ride is a good, suspenceful story if you know some of the background information on the rest of the series (Created By Joanna Campbell). Melanie is at a three week riding camp in Kentucky for three weeks with her cousin Christina. Once she gets settled in, bad things start to happen. Someone has been sabatoging things and it has all been blamed on Melanie. Then a fire is started and she gets blamed for that too because someone found her sandle that had fallen out of her bag on her way to her cabin. Once again, Melanie gets the blame for it all. In the end, the camp finds out who the perpetrator is and Melanie gets out of all the trouble she had gotten in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It STUNK!!!","review":"I used to be a faithful TB fan.

Camp Saddlebrook was the best and then it dropped into the toliet! You lost your touch! Camp Saddlebrook was the absoulte best, but this one just fell off the cliff! No good! Mel needs to have her pesky attuide and funny fever, like she did in #28, but she lost that all in #29. I have to say this book is not on my #1 book list. I own all of the Thoroughbred series, and this one just makes stop and wonder if it was really worth it and will it still be worth it. Also I still think Christina is and always will be a brat. What kind of kid cries when she gets a horse on Christmas and her birthday, just because it's a racehorse and not her dream eventer? Come on! Get Real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better","review":"I think the reason Melanie books are better then Christina ones are because Melanie is not a brat. The author does do a good job conveying Melanie's distress at being wrongly accused of all the pranks. I miss the horse racing aspect of this series, and I'm glad to read it will be coming back. In an answer to a reader who asked why I love Joanna Campbell so much: I don't like Karen Bently because her writing was too happy and the horses were always wining. Cindy was obessed with wining. I don't like this new series of authors, not because they are bad writers, but because they failed to follow the story line and added a whole set of new characters without telling us what happened to the new ones. When Mrs. Campbell comes back, she'll at least know whats going on. I know maybe her books will be as bad as the rest, but hey, anything can happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Campbell is not writing these books","review":"There is another writer, which we all know will be fired in a few months like all the others. You would think that they would find a REAL writer and not a jumping instructor. Joanna Campbell will write THREE books that come out in AUGUST. If the new writer reads these book reviews, WHY DIDN'T YOU READ THE SERIES?!!!! WHY DON'T YOU RESEARCH? It isn't hard to write about racing. Anyone can do it. Why do you have to go and write about what you think you know? Geez, that's selfish. The world doesn't need another jumping series, but I guess that is what we have now isn't it? Why don't you want to be original? Are you scared? Did you think that you can't handle it? What is the reason? Why jumping and eventing and camp! of all things? Why couldn't you bring the readers back? The one's that left when it suddenly went to eventing? Didn't you hear?

Had to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Under rated Jane Austen","review":"This is Jane Austen forey into more serious literature, and many of her faithful fans dislike it because of Fanny's, the main character, lack of romance. I beleive it may be one of Jane Austen's best novels. It is a more clear and accurate portrayal of the sensibilities of the time. It goes more into human nature especially about the heart and why people fall in love.It is a simple story about a girl ,Fanny, who is taken in by her rich Aunt and Uncle. Fanny is an incredibly nervous person. Only her cousin Edmund can make her feel at home. She is raised very properly, although stiltedly because her uncle wants to be sure she realizes she is below their family. The entire family grows dependent on her. Fanny falls in love with Edmund who falls in love with another. I won't ruin anymore of the story. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no walk in the park...","review":"I am an avid reader of Jane Austen and the main reason is her use of wit and empowered female characters. Unfortunately, Mansfield Park has neither of these. It is touted as one of Austen's most \\"complex\\" and \\"intricately plotted\\" works. I enjoy the sense of fun that is so evident in most of her novels, and perhaps, I simply find Mansfield Park to dark for my taste. I could not relate to the main character, Fanny, who, in my opinion, was an extremely naive ninny.While I pleasurably breeze through Austen's other novels in an afternoon, I found Mansfield Park took me several days to read, because of the breaks I took when I became bored with the story. (Something which has never happened to me with any other of her books.) This novel is not a style I find appealing, but, who knows, you just might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not one of her best works","review":"Generally a fan of Austin's writing, I was surprised at the dullness and ineptness of the text. The story dragged on leading the frustrated reader in no direction. Do not recommend this as a first Austin read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"While this book touches upon the society of English countryside gentry and their sexist, classist and patriarchical lives, it is quite dull. The plot drags and the characters, though their personalities are developed, don't do much. Nothing interesting happens until the last 50 pages or so. Overall, a good book to fall asleep with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author","review":"This is not my favorite Austen (that would be P&P, closely followed by S&S), but it is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book of my favorite author","review":"Fanny Price is the poor, orphaned girl who virtually serves as a servant in her wealthy cousins' house. Only her cousin Edmund Bertram treats her even remotely as an equal, even though she is of a higher moral character and behaves with greater refinement than they. When newcomers (brother and sister Henry and Mary Crawford) come to town, they charm the Bertrams. But the Crawfords are shameless and lead various members of the family into ruin.I read this book for the first time in either high school or college. I found Fanny so preachy and pallid as to be unpalatable. Even after re-reading (I thought, \\"Am I missing something?\\"), I hated the drab main character so much that I can't find one nice thing to say about the book.

Too bad there isn't a decent film version available for download."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"The story line was captivating and I was completely taken with the book. I did find it somewhat difficult to read in some places as Ms Austin did not differentiate women or men with first names but addressed them as As Miss ? or Mr ?. It took some rereading to try to figure out who was actually speaking or being addressed, especially when there were several characters in that particular section."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, until the last 30 pages or so","review":"It was a really captivating story, and I could not put the book aside. By the middle of it I had a sensation that the story was rounding in circles and getting nowhere, but it still held my attention. Then, things start to happen and I could see that all that had a purpose, which didn't justifies the lenght of it however. In the last pages everything I was almost forced to like and accept is trown away and so fast concluded that I felt like Austen had got tired of her writting and hastily put an and to it. With all the faults it is still wanderfull and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"this book was interesting enough. i love jane austen. my two personal faves were pride and prejudice and emma. this was interesting, the plot was intriguing and everything. i just thought that way too much was going on throughout the book. it was event after event after event. it was definitely suspenseful. the end was satisfying enough. fanny is not the best of jane austen's heroines. my favorite character was sir thomas. he was cool. i enjoy reading books of this sort generally. fanny could have been more interesting. i don't get why she was so totally in love with edmund the whole time that he was in love with mary crawford. it is a good read if you have time. it took me a month or so to read it because i had to read in the few spare moments i have aside from school reading and other work. i do recommend it to people who enjoy jane austen and those who are willing to take a good chunk of time out of their day to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near-fatal attractions","review":"A psychologically-intricate exploration of the power of sexual attraction. Fanny Price has barely enough integrity to keep her attraction to cousin Edmund under wraps; Edmund, meanwhile, is so utterly transformed by his desire for Miss Crawford that he pretty much pimps Fanny out to Miss Crawford's licentious brother.Austen's bleakest work, Mansfield Park is a meditation on both the demonic power of sexual desire, and the fragility of any morality that simultaneously celebrates physical beauty AND tries to regulate the bewitching effects that beauty has upon all of us.And if you're paying attention, you won't be fooled by the all's-right-with-the-world, David Lynch-like ending, either. Indeed, the center does not hold..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mansfield park","review":"I thought the book was very good. It was my first read by this author and I will continue to read her other novels. I did at times get lost in her sometimes long conversations and I would have to back track a little to see who was talking or being talked about. Overall I would recommend this book and enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jane's best work","review":"Having read Jane Austen's novels numerous times, I realize why Mansfield Park is so forgetable. While the story takes place during the same era of her other novels, this novel was not as exciting. It was an effort to read through to the end. I found it a rather laborious read, in that, friendship between Fanny and Bertram was the only emotion with no undertones that give Jane's other novels more depth and romance. The other characters were colorful and/or eccentric, however,the story was rather dull. The ending is also underwhelming. I just didn't find it as engaging as Pride and Prejudice and Emma."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Less Romantic, More Realistic Austen","review":"As a fairly big Jane Austen fan I came into this masterful novel (after the first fifty pages) expecting a great love story put off by the lowly financial means of the protagonist. However, the central figure, Fanny, has many qualities that make her an ulikely figure for the role of seductress. She is quiet, shy, and completely unsure of herself. She indeed has very few qualities that make the reader expectant that she will be able to marry above her means. Instead of an enthralling love story I found the novel full of subtle but interesting social commentary and excellent characterization of the protagonist. While not quite a Pride and Prejudice style page turner, Mansfield Park is worthwhile for its character development and carefully crafted, mature writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been an avid Austen reader for many years and I place \\"Mansfield Park\\" at the bottom of my list as a favorite. Jane is really boring in this one. I have read her books over and over, especially \\"Mansfield Park\\" hoping that I would appreciate it more, but to no avail. I purchased the BBC video not too long ago and that was boring also. I recently purchased the EIGHT cassette version read by a Maureen O'Brien. This was the WORST. Miss O'Brien speaks so rapidly, she cannot be understood half of the time! I had to keep re-running the tape to grasp what she was saying! This certainly has not made \\"Mansfield Park\\" more appealing. It's still down at the bottom of my list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rambler Of A Story","review":"This book is not good at all. I usually have no problem getting into a story, no matter what period it is written from, but the Author rambled on & on for the first 15 or so pages, that I finally gave up on reading anymore. The story line was not very strong at all, therefore it did not get much of my attenton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Descriptions, No Plot","review":"I found when reading this book the story strayed from it's main character, Fanny, and went on for several pages, and sometimes entire chapters, about points which are irrelevant to the story. I also found the writer using excessively long sentances, and drawing out passages which could have easily been put in many less words.I also found that the story seemingly goes nowhere. There is little or no character change, and there really is no conflict in the story line.So if you want a dro pdead boring story with no action whatsoever, read on, dear reader, read on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not Jane Austen's best!","review":"The first half of the book was kind of slow, but by the middle I couldn't put it down! It was wonderful and had a few surprises. I am trying to read all of Jane Austen's books...so far I have only read this, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma. I would have to say I like both P&P and Emma better than Mansfield Park, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moderation","review":"Unike her other novels there was no one really to hate or to love. Fanny was sort of a dull lead character so I think the other people in the story were writen in such a way as to not overshadow her. The book was well writen but did not envoke much emotion like Jane's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Jane Austen's best","review":"I am a huge fan of classic novels. I had to read Pride & Prejudice for English Lit in high school and I've been hooked ever since. I've read several of Austen's novels and I had trouble making to the end of this one. I felt like throwing the book down in frustration several times because it was so slow and hard to follow. Fanny was too quiet for my taste and I never understood Edmund's interest in Miss Crawford. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, go ahead and read this book, but make sure your wide awake, otherwise you might just fall asleep due to boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, what a wonderful story!","review":"Fanny Price, the heroine from this novel, is the biggest drawback to the story in my view. She is the sort of woman with whom I have never had much in common. She is insufferably sweet, eternally turning cheeks, and almost totally incapable of speaking her mind if she is in disagreement with others. In short...she is the ultimate in \\"goodness.\\" It felt plastic to me.For whatever criticisms I have of Fanny Price, I cannot deny that the reader is forced, throughout the novel, to wish her well. I truly yearned with my full heart for Fanny to get the life and love and attention that she so heartily deserved.The story, though not as funny as Pride & Prejudice, is quite entertaining with little twists in the plot that one doesn't necessarily see coming and with an ending that really could've gone either way.I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I'll probably read it again, and I would definitely recommend it to any true Austen fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful; Delightful!","review":"I am an avid fan of Jane Austen's writing. Her wit and social satire are brilliant and still incredibly relevant today. While Mansfield Park does not, to me, surpass her brilliance with Pride and Prejudice, I found I enjoyed this book more than Emma, which I think is slightly overrated. Mansfield Park had me on the edge of my seat for the final third of the book--Jane Austen is a timeless author and a breath of fresh air to those of us who are tired of the sex, violence and lack of originality so prevalent in today's \\"literature.\\" Three cheers for Jane!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convoluted","review":"A more complex story than the other Austen books I have read with more fully rounded characters.

Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny \\"insipid\\"! I love the other novels, even the underrated \\"Lady Susan,\\" but I could not finish this one.Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version:Mansfield Park (1999). Frances O'Connor creates a spunky, witty version of Fanny Price that deviates from the novel and is all the better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like bad books... This is a must have!","review":"Definitely one of Jane Austen's worst books. At the beginning you think ...What?!! At the middle you think... Pretty good! But by the end you think... Give me a toilet so I can flush it down!!!!!!!!! You wait the ENTIRE book for something that happens in the last 2 pages. I quit 3 pages before the ending positive that Fanny would never get married. But then my sister said, \\"You just have to be patient.\\" Then I told her that I had been patient for the last 384 pages and I certainly was not going to \\"be patient\\" any longer! Well I was patient and finished it, but I must confess I no longer know where the book is. Because when you turn around and throw a book into a cramped toy room. It is incredibly hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanny is bland and insipid.","review":"With all of Ms. Austen's delightful, engaging heroines, couldn't she have done better with this one?WHAT a tiresome prig she is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Austen at her worst","review":"Mansfield Park is by far the worst book by Jane Austen. I am an avid Austen fan, and have enjoyed all of her books, except this one. I had two main complaints with this book.One, Fanny Price is the most annoying heroine. She is far too complacent. She accepts the bad treatment she recieves from her cousins and aunts with no complaints. It's as if she feels it is all she deserves! Also annoying is the fact that she is so delicate and ill all of the time. To have such a colourless creature as the central character of a book is a mistake.Second, the ending was horrible. It's as if Austen suddenly realized the book was way too long, and she had a deadline to meet. After torturing the reader for so long, she sums up Edmund and Fanny's relationship in just one chapter! If only she had edited the majority of the book, and nailed the ending better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't finish this story.","review":"This is the second time I have read this book, and I just can't finish it. I purchased \\"Murder at Mansfield Park\\" and had to remember the characters. Unfortunately, it's just too boring. I'd like to take Fanny and knock some sense into her. Tell her to be more human, more tolerant, more likeable. However, that's how things were back in Jane Austen's time. Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, were not as hard to get through. I will not waste my time on Murder at Mansfield Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a tough one","review":"I guess, if one were to compare Mansfield Park with a book by almost any other author, it would stand out. Unfortunately, however, I compare Mansfield Park with the rest of Jane Austen's oeuvre, namely P&P, Emma, Persuasion, Sense & Sensibility, etc. Against that kind of competition, Mansfield Park is weak. Fanny Price is an insipid wimp who watches life pass her by. I have always found it hard to believe that the woman who gave us Lizzy Bennet, Emma Woodhouse and Elinor Dashwood could have given us Fanny Price. The former do not suffer fools lightly, and Fanny is a fool who enjoys suffering.I do recommend that people read this, but only AFTER reading Austen's other books because Jane Austen at her weakest is superior to most authors at their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh geez...","review":"This is one of the dullest works by Austen. However could someone get into the book and actually finish it without having fallen asleep. A dreadful book to read, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a flat boring read...","review":"This book was a major disapointment. I had never read a Jane Austen novel before I read this book and I thought it would be a pleasant experience. I found the book's main character to be flat, and dull, possesing none of the characteristics that make an interesting person or an interesting read. I thought the book would never end and when it did I felt like throwing a party. This novel isn't dark and complex, its just bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I like Pride and Prejudice best, closely followed by Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility and Emma. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent; the story line flows with a sense of inevitability that is both charming and compelling. My preference for P&P has to do with the like-ability of the central characters to a late-20th century (or, now, early 21st century) reader. I find Fanny just a bit too much like a frightened rabbit and Edmund just a bit too much like toast soaked in warm milk. But I love the book and return to reread it every couple years. And how better to do that than on my Kindle?"},{"rating":"2","title":"arguably Austen's greatest","review":"Jane Austen wrote a whole lot of good novels, but Mansfield Park is arguably the greatest. It is darker in tone than the rest of her works. It has a somewhat dark humor to it. The protagonist is put through the emotional wringer (as her protagonists often do, but more so here).

To tell an unconverted man, dead in sins, to \\"grow in grace\\" would doubtless be absurd. To tell a believer, who is quickened and alive to God, to grow is only summoning him to a plain scriptural duty. He has a new principle within him, and it is a solemn duty not to quench it. Neglect of growth robs him of privileges, grieves the Spirit, and makes the chariot wheels of his soul move heavily. Whose fault is it if a believer does not grow in grace? The fault cannot be laid on God. He delights to \\"give more grace\\".

This is good, though I do think at times it may seem he believes otherwise. The book sometimes explains something in a thousand words that some may explain in two hundred. It is interesting read considering the book was written some hundred twenty years ago. He complains about easy conversersion without counting the cost of departing from your oldways (sins). That giving life to Christ is not a simple prayer but athoughtful process where you stand before God. He expresses the difference between having more Christians and having less Christians but more devoted. He also disdusses the visible and invisible Church.

After checking it out my 100th time, I finally read it. It is a well put together book although nowadays, it would be considered outdated by some of the science in what makes a tornado go (I believe the book leaves off in 1953 or 1954 when it was published). Barring that, it is a well researched book and it gives some good insight as to what it was like to experience tornadoes before the days of Doppler Weather Radar and even regular radar. All you had was some good country sense and hope that somebody spotted the storm before it reached you...a lead warning time of just minutes usually.

The one we purchased never worked correctly, it never snaped back into place after it was transformed the first time and so we went online to see if we were doing something wrong and we found tons of people having the same issue. A bad batch of toys that Hasbro should enter a recall on in my Opinion!! When I called Hasbro to inform them of the issue, they said they could replace the toy once we sent it back but could not guarantee that it would be the same one. Now my son is out the Bumblebee Transformer he really wanted and we can not get it replaced. (nearly impossible to find without paying and arm and a leg) This is a $10.00 toy through Hasbro! Buyer beware this toy will frustrate your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff!","review":"I would have rated all 1's but my son does play with this even though it does not transform. I have read similar reviews; the front end as a Camaro will not click into place. If this toy were cheaper I could have lived with it but this is such a ripoff! As far as educational value it teaches kids that they won't get what they pay for and to not trust toy manufacturers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trust those who say bumblebee is broken..","review":"Like the many who reported having bumblebee's front part of the camaro refusing to stay put, I have the exact same problem. The latch to keep the stupid spring loaded front hood is of the wrong side which basically makes this version of bumblebee unable to transform to a car. You're basically stuck with the robot.Barricade is extremely hard to transform back to a car but I was eventually able to do it. I can't believe it took me that long too. I bought my kid maybe 5 other transformer toys and this is the first time I have been disappointed. Stay away from the Bumblebee/barricade combo toy. You'll only regret it later...I definitely am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made. DANGER","review":"My son is almost eight and has been playing with Transformers for several years.

On first conversion attempt, parts started falling apart and by end of May most of them have chipped away one by one even though I tried converting it carefully myself. Wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't lock together quite right","review":"Warning: once you transform this toy into robot mode, you will NEVER be able to put it back into perfect vehicle mode.

The front end pops off whether the thingie is pushed in or extended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken, WARNING to all!","review":"Do not buy this toy.

We purchased this bumblebee for his birthday. When we received it and took it out of the box the right door fell off. It was cracked and not fixable.

Horrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bumblebee broke down...again!!","review":"I have now had this problem with the hood of my sons Bumblebee. My 7 year old bought Bumblebee with his own money, and found out after a day, that the hood would not latch, which is the same problem everyone else has. I have examied the toy, and found the little yellow piece that is attached to the hood, and the button, is very weak, and part of it just snaps off. So, we just got home from taking it back to get another one, and we have not even been home for 1 hour, and the same thing happened again. The toy is a good toy, but now my son is also stuck with a robot, and not a car. I will not keep wasting gas to exchange this toy, but I will try it one more time. I think it would be fine, but you just have to be extremely careful with it so it does not break. I'm willing to bet, that out of every ten people that buy one, at least 8 will break. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disappointed...","review":"As one of the first TF toys I saw in the store, I snatched up the \\"classic Camaro\\" version of Bumblebee. Unfortunately, it has a pretty poor paint job. His face is missing some of the silver markings that should have been painted, and the \\"missile launchers\\" are solid yellow instead of the translucent purple that are shown on the package. Also, the windows are painted instead of being made of translucent plastic like on the Alternators. The legs of the robot are awkward and hard to pose, and I had a hard time on the very first transformation sequence, where you push a button to fold down the front of the car. I was afraid I would break it, but you have to push the button very hard to get it to work. I hope I don't have one of the defective ones.It seems like every time there are new TF toys out they get more and more fragile. Not much of a play-toy, more of a collector's item."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"i remember transformers as a child being a LOT more durable then this hunk of crap. parts fall off, legs come out of joint. if you must have one buy a different model i know there are better made t-formers out there"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great philosophical/social treatise","review":"Despite its title, this book isn't really political as such.

This movie got me so paranoid I could barely go to sleep without first checking underneath my bed for giant plant pods.For me, this is one of my favorite classic thrillers. It really does a great job with the suspense and foreshadowing. It leaves you guessing until the very disturbing end. The acting is intense and believable and it really is a complete package. If you are looking for a truly chilling movie experience, watch Invasion. It's not your typical slash-fare. In fact, I don't think there's barely a drop of blood in the entire film- but that is what makes it even more interesting. It will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"None of the remakes come close","review":"This is a great old flick! It is scary in so many ways, and it has some cool effects for its time.

It's a great classic of the 1950s that still ranks as a mind-thriller. Too bad the director was forced to add the naration and the beginning and closing sequences. The movie would REALLY be creepy if it had ended with Miles (Kevin McCarthy) standing on the highway screaming to passing motorists, \\"You're next\\". A perfect cold war inspired film.

I especially like that the original \\"Superscope\\" aspect ratio of 2:1 was used, not quite Cinemascope, but more widescreen than the standard 1.85:1.

Next to Kevin, I liked the pods best--great special effects, and realistic--chilling when found in the backs of trucks en route to other US destinations. After Kevin and the pods, I then liked the action, the horror of realization, the attempts to prevent panic, the campy background music. Still entertaining and better than any re-makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's a classic but...","review":"It's severely spoiled by the imposed framing story - where the authorities defeat the Pod People after all - and (for me) by the obvious right-wing bias of the filmmakers.

So, it's pretty obvious that I'm something of a horror authority.So it boggles my mind that this movie is considered something of a horror masterpiece. How? It's just a movie where people get replaced by giant green beans! Does that seem scary to you? Maybe the sequel will have a Cauliflower serial killer.

Harrington, being a seasoned tournament player, breaks down tournament play into a fine art. It isn't a book purely for a beginner, basic concepts must be understood before diving into this read, but Harrington does a great job of presenting some rather advanced techniques in a clear and easy to understand manner.

Add Slansky's 'Hold'em Poker For Advanced Players' and Barboianu's 'Texas Hold'em Odds' for full coverage on odds and math and you will have all you need to know for winning. The rest is practice and patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I decided to get back into poker (esp. NL hold'em) after dabbling with the game a couple of years ago. Wanting to gain useful knowledge, I decided on getting this book, due to the favorable reviews. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. This book has useful knowledge on literally every page. I am about 1/3 way through the book in 2 days and plan to re-read, along with taking notes, due to the large volume of useful content. As a side note, Dan Harrington is great to watch on TV tourney's - very solid player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for tournament play","review":"I have read 5 or 6 poker books and this one is probably the best -- especially if you're playing in tournaments.

Hopefully I will also learn to be a better poker player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record... all killer, no filler!","review":"A great set of mid-1960s, West Coast-flavored trucker songs... Adams, a sassy singer who sounded a bit like Loretta Lynn, had a sizeable hit with the novelty song \\"Little Pink Mack,\\" and they naturally tried to follow it up with similar material, like \\"Six Days Awaiting,\\" an answer song to Dave Dudley's wildly popular \\"Six Days On The Road.\\" That didn't work quite as well, but the rest of this album is still a lot of fun -- it's pure, glorious Bakersfield twang, and definitely worth checking out if you like the cool old stuff. Adams even pays homage to a West Coast foremother, Rose Maddox with a fine version of \\"Big, Big Day Tomorrow,\\" a great old weeper that Rose recorded a few years earlier. Folks looking for lost gems in country's past would be well advised to snap this tasty reissue up now, while you still have the chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellcaster's Everywhere!","review":"This is a great deck for any YuGiOh fan, it works perfectly with the new Spellcaster's Command deck to create quite a powerful combination of magicians and spellcasters. I would recommend this to any player who enjoys the spellcaster type monsters and wants to build a good deck out of them. There are some cards specifically the Dark Eradicator Warlock that can only be found in this deck aside from buying it separately online. Another great thing about these cards is that it requires some sort of strategy to use correctly, hopefully a child can learn something about balance and strategy when using them. If you are a spellcaster fan and you want some great cards, this deck is a great buy.Thank you for taking the time to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This wasnt my favorite book of the \\"Polly\\" series, but I really enjoyed finding out what happened to all the charecters, mostly Polly.I wonder why the author made Jasper be their uncle? It doesnt seem right for Polly to marry her uncle, even if he was her age, and not related by blood, but by marriage.Ive also noticed about the books that the Five Little Peppers scream and cry and dance and twirl and spin and shout very often. People are always geting hurt ,not on purpose, all the time. in this book, i think Polly broke her arm in a train wreck.But Im glad there was one last book about the dear Pepper family. i wish i could find out what happen to the rest of the clan though.Well good luck.

Then you can truly appreciate this work of staggering insight into the world of today.This is the book (or collection of essays) written by Huxley in 1958, 27 years after he wrote Brave New World. He begins by reevaluating his previous work and Orwell's 1984. Then he will open your eyes to some of the biggest problems we face today. It has been almost 50 years since this book was written and many of the things Huxley predicted are happening all around us. It floors me that so few people have read this amazing work. So quit reading this review and read the book already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gloomy but truthful glimpse at the future.","review":"This book puts forth the arguement that a society as depicted in Brave New World is likely to be the end result of mankind if we don't do something to prevent it from happening. This is an all-too valid arguement. Huxley claims that through overpopulation and the survival of the physically and mentally inferior our race will be put into such a state that a totalitarian regieme will eventually be able to seize control and eventually prevent those under its control from realizing their predicament. I go to school with plenty of morons and blind optimists who would do nothing to stop such a despicable form of government from taking control.

Rothbard really managed to make monetary history and theory accessible for anyone choosing to read it.In my mind, it's the writing style that makes this book, not the ideas. Most of Rothbard's ideas come from Von Mises. The essay reads as a defense of Von Mises's position in places.Yes, the book does read as somewhat opinionated, and no, he does not go into extensive detail. I am not faulting him for that though, as these are just short essays. Really, my only fault with the book might be the redundancy of having the two essays packaged into the same book.

The reviews made me question the right weight to select, I was afraid the 100 lbs. would be too easy. But I do a lot of reps and I'm glad I didn't get heavier ones.

The handle should be further in the palm than many people use it, the rear grip should be to the lines just below the knuckle because you want to close the gripper all the way. The only way to do this is to \\"set\\" the gripper (close it slightly so your fingers can begin to wrap around it) with your free hand before closing it all the way. Good quality product.

When you start reading a new section, you don't think, \\"Oh, that's just what Hugh Mainwaring thinks.\\" You realise that the statements were actually what real people, not just characters, thought.

This novel gives us some excellent insights on how sick a society South Africa was in the 1950's. However it's an extremely difficult read; shifting between past and present tense, dialogs were the author doesn't explain which characters are speaking, a great many references that are unclear to readers who know little about South Africa. Another reviewer called the novel \\"docu-fiction\\". That's exactly what it is. It has no protagonists. We learn very little about who these characters are and have trouble caring about them, aside from the grief inflicted on them by hateful Afrikaners. This was Paton's last novel. He was pushing 80 when he wrote it. He still had plenty to say. His ideosyncratic story telling detracts from the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"These cymbals rival any other cymbals out there.

He explores family and sports in a very personal way that's funny and touching. His reflections on sports though, are in a way the most touching part of the book. Greeny's clearly sad sports have lost so much innocence, but still finds beauty and joy in the ability of sports to give us heroes and something to believe in greater than ourselves. In a way he's out to save the fading beauty of sports he knew as a kid. For those of us who've become jaded with professional sports over time, Greeny's optimism is a passionate reminder of the love we had for sports and sports heroes when we were kids ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character and truth revealed....","review":"...well from Jason Landings review. after ammy pulled all 85 of his reviews for the copy and paste jobs he performed from Barnes and Nobles, he finally wrote his own review!First off, it was typical. The content was short and revealed that not only did he not read the book, but he doesn't know how to use sentence fragments properly.Second, his use of smack is not fresh but about as stale as a 2002 dorito chip found under the cushions.Third, it's obvious to us now that he is not competent enough to write good, solid reviews that invoke criticism regarding self knowledge of the product.

He seems like an \\"everyguy\\" and I enjoy his wit. But....in this book he comes across as very shallow. Why, because he constantly has to punctuate his stories with design-label name dropping, as if he's looking for affirmation....and whose affirmation would that be, the fans of Mike & Mike (NO!)...so who? Which leads me to the question, who is this book written for anyway?All in all the Greeny comes across as someone who doesn't have much meaningful to say.

It was ok at first (age 1), because my son couldn't reach the pedals, and his feet just kind of dangled. But as he got a little older, he always seemed at a loss with what to do with his feet. (There's nowhere to rest them.) He would try to rest them on the pedals, and inevitably jam them with his foot. Now he can reach the pedals (age 2), but hasn't mastered them yet. But his feet are dragging the ground. I guess I can raise the seat up, but this still won't solve his dangling problem. Secondly, the canopy and cup holder are useless, and our bike doesn't steer particularly straight, even though we have tried to correct this.

Even though we found it difficult to steer from the back, it was great for her at first -- she enjoyed riding as we pushed and she LOVED the basket in the back. However, once she had the coordination and the length in her legs to push, this trike proved to be a serious dud. It barely has any torque (if that's the right term); the pedals slip all over the place. She's pedaling, but she's not getting anywhere.

Everyone is always stopping us telling us how adorable it is. Since my son was only 9 months when we started to use it, we bought a Kettler seat harness and attached it to the seat - it will leave permanent holes, but it is worth having the safety feature. I'm glad we bought the upgraded model, the steering is great, my sister has the base model and the steering is a little difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"As I can see, this toy is durable. under supervision it does not have any risk.

The trike doesn't come with a seat belt to it (as many people have asked) but if you get theKettler Seatbelt 3 Point Harness Seatbeltfor the kettler brand trikes it fits on here perfectly. All you need to do to install the optional seat belt is drill or punch two small holes in the back of the seat and screw the straps in. I have a very big one 16 month old (35 lbs) and I didn't trust him to stay on the trike himself. I installed the seat belt very easily but I left off the middle strap (to make it a three point harness) because it held him on very well with out it, and believe me he put it to the test! I uploaded images of where to install the seat belt in the images area of the product viewer. All in all I found this trike to be of very high quality and I can't believe I ever thought of spending the rediculous price of the kettler trikes. Great first trike!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"This is a good buy for the money. My wife has a ford Focus and it folds up neatly in the back. The rubber tires are much quieter than bike's with plastic tires but the stem caps are crummy. I think the sun shade is useless and if the wind is behind you the trunk will blow open with every gust. These are minor issues and wouldn't stop us from recommending this bike. We are also glad for the tall handle that actually steers the bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun At First but then hard to fix","review":"My kids loved this bike until it got a flat tire in the front. The back tires you can fill with a regular pump, but the front tire is special and I was told to fill it at a gas station. I tried but it didn't work. I am trying to find a replacement tube b/c I fear it may be flat but am having a VERY hard time finding it. The design on this bike is stupid. Why make it so hard to fix! I am very disappointed and I expect more for the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice features but room for improvement","review":"This tricycle has nice features such as parental steering, bell for child to ding, and storage box. Though the age range for the toy is from 2 to 5 years old some children may be too small to reach the pedals - the seat is not very adjustable. This can be disappointing if you are intending to help your child learn to pedal as it then becomes nothing more than a fancy stroller. It seems a little expensive, but if you can get it on sale (and maybe pass on the sun shade) it may be well worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an addendum","review":"Sent word to Amazon that this battery did not fit the Motorola i530.

We can seek excitement or adventure which Maya possesses but our lives call for a transfer of personal confidence and reliance in childhood to self awareness and integrity of manhood. A child knows his wants and can muster courage, but nothing as a life and death struggle in the wilds of India demands. A best friend is required that exceeds the guidance of a father. Maya, the elephant has its mahut Raji as the ready soulmate for Terry. Boyhood is surrendered in friendship and with this change Terry out grows his losses.

I purchased it in hopes of learning how to properly use the instruments for approaches/landing and the control tower. All of the lessons in the book refer you back to the \\"Learning Center\\" (on your computer) - why even bother using this book. For someone looking to have a paper reference to coach them through something, this book is not it! I wanted a step by step lesson and it gave me \\"try the Learning Center.\\" It also skips over a lot of the key steps and assumes you already know how to do certain things. What makes this book even worse is that it doesnt even provide a list of common commands.

The album was released in 1997 and very few to no people knew about this group. In Overcast!there is two mc's Slug and Spawn before he left Atmosphere and fellow producer Ant. This cd has the closest style of underground hip-hop like Slug's group Headshots. Headshots Volume 7 is the best of all, but until Headshots Volume 7 comes out on cd in 2005, this is the best Atmosphere album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, but not their best","review":"Overcast is the perfect first album...not counting \\"headshots\\"...that any hip hop group could release. It's been called \\"life music\\", and that pretty much sums it up. The beats are much more laid back than anything else that they've put out, and WAY less...\\"emo\\"...for lack of a better word. Spawn isn't up to par with slug, but very few people are, so its not a very big deal, and he doesn't stand out or anything. All the songs are amazing, well produced, and essentially perfect. but again, this is not atmosphere's best. Lucy Ford is by far the ultimate atmosphere cd. but even still, this album is not mediocre..or anywhere remotley close to that. buy this now and cry tears of joy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame it didnt work","review":"The first atmosphere album was a glimpse into the future of hip hop in the Twin Cities. All of the Headshot fans(such as myself) couldnt be more excited for the debut album for the 4 members of atmosphere (THATS RIGHT I SAID 4)Its just a shame that they couldnt work out their differences. They had such a great sound. It was almost as if every track one emcee would set the bar and the 2 would duel to raise it higher and higher. ODE TO THE MODERN MAN is a perfect example of what iam speaking about.If anyone wants to check out Spawn I encourage you as he is still rapping, although under a different name.

I microwaved this product in the company kitchen break room, and now it stinks like a Chinese canal full of dead fish.After cooking the product as directed, I peered inside the open box. UGH. It looked like a bloody red concoction of fish innards. The odor was incredibly BAD. Instead of tossing the box into the kitchen trash I had to toss the box in the outside dumpster.While I do enjoy seafood, this horrible prank of a product stinks really bad.

There is hardly any curry or coconut flavors, and in fact it tastes more like pine sap than anything else. I followed the stove top directions (cooking food in cardboard seems weird to me) and was slightly put off by the aromas. They weren't horrible, but didn't smell like curry either. At first bite, my heart sank. I was expecting a rich, tongue-wrenchingly spicy red curry, and all I got was an artificially thickened, oddly pine needle tasting and not very spicy concoction. There are much better choices if you want easy, microwaveable lunches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the \\"YUK\\" review","review":"We just tried the Red Curry Noodles yesterday (haven't tried others; maybe they're good) and we were horrified!

This is my favorite novel. What cinches it for me is not the story \\"line,\\" but the careful choice of words, and use of metaphor. Few get it so right. I am pleased as punch over and over reading what comes forth from Margaret Atwood's deft brain. Example: During one Thanksgiving dinner the young Elaine is watching and listening to an adult conversation concerning the turkey's ability to fly having been bred out of it's body in favour of easier containment issues and larger, jucier portions of meat. It occurs to Elaine that she is \\"eating lost flight.\\" If that kind of realization doesn't appeal to you, as metaphor, you might not like this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really excellent novel, outstanding","review":"From the very start of the novel, I couldn't take my eyes off it. It is a psychological tale, but also talks about feminism and many other things. What impressed me most was the way in which Atwood describes Elaine's feelings, like if it was herself. It really is a good book, and -I'm not exaggerating- it makes the reader realise some important things about life. Besides, it goes deep into human feelings. It's worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it.","review":"I gave it a fair shot, but it never really grabbed my interest.

I loved it then, which was why I picked it up again when I had to write a major paper. The second time around, the book seemed pretentious, and self-indulgent. The character of Elaine, who had seemed so strong the first time I read it was reduced to a one-dimensional weakling.There are always bright spots, however, when reading Margaret Atwood. One of these is her poetic style. (I hate her poetry, but the translation of that same style in her prose is more enjoyable).I wish that I hadn't read Cat's Eye a second time. My opion of Ms. Atwood and her work would have remained more complimentary. I would recommend Cat's Eye to adolescents around the age of sixteen or to those readers who are not looking to read with a critical eye.My suggestions, if you are looking for a novel by Margaret Atwood, are The Handmaid's Tale and Alias Grace -- both better expressions of her talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I DON'T SYMPATHISE WITH ELAINE !!!","review":"I read this book for my A- level course and i enjoyed it. Atwood is a very talented writer and this book is evidence. But i can honestly say that i don't sympathise with Elaine. Cordelia seems to give a reason as to why she bullied Elaine (not that that means she should have) but Elaine had no reason to bully Cordelia herself. She took advantage of Cordelia's deterioration .Everything is in her mind...... and she is a psyco. But the book is very interesting and i don't regret reading it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible character study","review":"This novel, much like The Robber Bride, presents how the relationships between women can twist due to certain cultural pressures. I find myself drawn to this book because of the detailed characters. A personal relationship develops between the reader and Elaine; I missed her when I finished! In fact, I almost began to think about how she would react in certain situations! I enjoyed this book because of the detail to character. Mrs. Smeath, Cordelia, Elaine's parents and brother, Carol Campbell . . . . all of these characters exist in our minds so clearly and realistically due to Atwood's detail and sharp observation of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a man, and I LOVE this book!!!","review":"Margaret Atwood explores the human psyche in this poignant novel about a female protagonist who takes a retrospective on her life by painting pictures of her childhood. Atwood uses different colors to describe the world of artist Elaine Risley. And the use of flashbacks was very effective in telling the story. The main conflict of the novel deals with the reconciliation of Elaine with Cordelia, her childhood tormentor. There is an Elaine and also a Cordelia in all of us, always fighting for domination. Elaine could also be Atwood's alter ego, since their childhood events sometimes coincide. I enjoyed this book very much (though it could've been shorter) and would recommend it to any man and woman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers Insight into Bullying Between Girls","review":"Margaret Atwood covers the subject of girl-on-girl bullying with honesty and wit. The tortures extolled by Cordelia onto, not just the protagonist, but all the girls in their group are similar to what happens in girl cliques all over the world every day. When girls bully, it is mean and subversive, while boys tend to be forthright and physical in their bullying. This novel delves right into the manipulative nature of girls and how the girl-group dynamic affects them as they grow into adults.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"Never before has the pain and laughter of childhood been illustrated with such unique and yet accurate detail, at least for this reader. Atwood's writing is impeccable as she weaves a past-and-present story with fluidity and style, and ingeniously blends dark humor into serious themes. The novel is both poignant and bitingly funny, thanks to Atwood's insight, wit, and her ability to create characters who are hauntingly alive. An outstanding reflection on the consequences of human behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This is a well written book, a page-turner; I like the details of Elaine's past and am interested in what viewpoints formed her as a person. However, I also think it is quite depressing. I read it a couple of times, years ago. When I saw a positive review on it I read it again, and each reading makes it more depressing. Her outlook is bleak, and I really don't see anything positive or uplifting about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull....drags on a bit. Not tied together well.","review":"This is a story of a woman growing up. The childhood friends that you have, the choices you make/the consequences, and how the past can haunt you. I have read two other books by Margaret Atwood and I liked this one the least. (Oryx and Crake, The Edible Woman) I feel the book was too long for the material covered. Also, the book talked about the children too much and the last half of the book has little to do with the first half. I wouldn't recommend. I also have a friend who read the book who had a different view of what the story was about (feminity/coming of age as a woman in a different time), but she also found the story to be lackluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"After reading both Cat's Eye and The Handmaid's Tale, I decided that Atwood's narrative style is just not for me-she's very poetic and deep, but hers is a style that people either love or hate. I found this story to be void of any content I care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"This book drove me NUTS! I bought it because I absolutely love \\"The Robber Bride,\\" but this one just seemed like a big waste. I spent the whole book waiting for something interesting to happen, but the detached voice of the narrator sucks any excitement right out of the story. But all the other reviewers seem to love it, so maybe you should read it anyway and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Eyeball","review":"Horrible. You can't understand a thing. The writing has too much detail which is hard to follow. There are still questions unanswered. There are problems unsolved. This book is frustrating to read. A book that takes forever to read which seems more like an autobiography than a book to read for pleasure. This is a book to read just to say you have another book under your belt. There never is a climax, nothing is really solved. The book seems like a huge run-on sentence that has too many flashbacks. One can get lost going back and forth between past, present, and future. Maybe when I'm older I will understand the thoughts and flashbacks as an elderly woman, but right now this book seems like a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"pretentious, moi?\\"","review":"Elaine Risley was bullied by her friends as a child and was scarred forever after. Pile up as much philosophing and moralizing as you want, in the end what you are left with here is more than 400 pages filled with a depressing middle-aged woman's memories of her miserable childhood and bullying friends. Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst. What twaddle. Dreary, dreary, dreary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia ain't what it used to be","review":"Material which is fresh and immediate in The Edible Woman loses its edge in this rehash of scenes from the Toronto of yesteryear.

This one really hit home for me, and now I'm reconsidering the relationship between me and my childhood best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent study for high school literature :)","review":"An intreguing plot merging past with present that was studied for a year 11 literature course.

But otherwise an excellent read and starting point for exploring a wide range of issues"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't you read this?","review":"Come on, this is a really good book, even though my neighbor thinks it's about bitchy teenaged girls. Good coming of age novel, and engaging to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"There seemed to be no point to this book. It does not typify womens' relationships, and it is extremely frustrating to read, because the main character is a real sissy. She's been mistreated by her friends as a child, yet keeps hoping to run into them again. It makes little sense. There is no climax or real story-line. The book is little more than a bunch of flashbacks. I was extremely disappointed. You can do a lot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star was too good","review":"First there were giants of the literary world: Joyce, Wells, and Wilde, geniuses who had mastered the human psyche and emotions and observed society in a brand new way.

You have to read between the lines. Also, the writer's style leaves a lot to be desired. For example, he says, \\"what would happen if you were to do such and such\\" and then 3 steps later you figure out that you were actually supposed to do that thing. Other times he presents you with this question, so you assume you're supposed to do what he says, and then later you realize you shouldn't have! No consistency whatsoever. I don't believe anyone proofread this book before it was published. There are literally hundreds of serious typos which leave you scratching your head. A current book on Oracle 9i forms is desperately needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware, Don;t buy this book, It is useless!","review":"This is the worst computer book ever written, this book has numerous errors and is absolutely not helpful. I was very disapointed, it does not contain any text regarding oracle forms, no sample code, no explanation, no examples. Instead it contains a bunch of labs which the readers are suppose to complete themselves without any knowledge.Absolutely not recommended for studentsNot recommended for intermediate and advanced developer either, because it has not information about oracle forms.I ordered this via next day shipping, since I needed it urgently as I am taking an adavnced database course at university.I am returning this book immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be done","review":"In order to use the course (and the prerequisite courses) you need to download tons of Oracle software on a one-month trial license or spend a couple of thousand dollars.

It has so many errors in it that one would wonder if they even edited it before they decided to publish it. If you are smart you will not buy this book.

After 10 pages, I was struck by the appallingly poor quality of the author's prose style, and wondered if he would be able to maintain his average of at least one tired cliche per page, so began keeping track. 75 pages in, when I gave up counting, he was still on track.For those who are content with purely plot-driven books, are undeterred by inherent implausibilities, demand nothing beyond stock (and stick-like) characters, and are not given indigestion by sheer bad writing, this may be your cup of tea.

The series follows them through their day to day high school lives. There is not a really much of a point to this anime except laughs and gags. Laughter is the spice of life they say.I really enjoyed watching Azumanga Daioh. It can definitely lift up your day if you're bored or a little bummed.

But it's too bad that supporting characters (I also like them too) like Chihiro, Miruchi & Yuka, Kimura's Wife and that one female student from the end of ep. 11 have less appearances. Despite that, it's a great anime and I mostly recommend this copy of the complete collection (more than the 2005 and 2008 copies) since they have all the bonus features including the very short movie on the last disc.

The only unifying elements are an over-elaberate mocking of Chinese literary conventions in English and a common narrator in Kai Lung. This is as a hut made of ill placed and random sticks. Some of the sticks may be interesting, but as a whole they do not provide much shelter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leather, not nylon","review":"Not what I expected, but fit my Optio S5i perfect.

I do know this; the tight rhythms and viciously vibrant bass-lines of this album made me a fan.Check out the gritty groove of \\"Your Mama Wants You Back\\"( I'm on my way,baby). It will raise the hairs on the nape of your neck! Serious,sensuous,solid funk,B-funk,the real bomb, with an undercurrent of blues(on the cut\\"They Say I'm Different\\" she pays tribute to variuos blues artists). This album is the aural equivalent of sensuality; unapologetic in its in-your face sexiness; unabashed in its examination of taboo subjects(He Was A Big Freak, Don't You Call Her No Tramp); unrelenting in its musical audacity. When you consider that she was broaching these subjects and producing this funky blues-rock sound in the mid-1960,s it makes what she was doing even more incredible! Betty Davis,ahead of her time, but always on time,with her music and her mischievousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the correction","review":"I'm not sure why Mr. Weidenbaum/Amazon would not check his/their facts before putting finger to keyboard.

My son has a cowlick and very thick, dry hair and he just loves this stuff. The smell is wonderful! I'm half tempted to try it myself. I can just comb right through his hair after using it and it really makes it shine. I use a berry shampoo and then this as a conditioner on him and he smells just incredible.

They are very large, larger than I expected. I usually staple the top edge to a piece of cardboard and haven't had any issues with the targets falling off at the range or anything like that.

That's as good (or in this case, as bad) as it gets. It's not fun, or particularly excting, and while it might have seemed like a good idea to give Norris a hand at comedy, it doesn't work.Firewalker is quite missable. Both actors have made many other movies that are a lot more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another flop from Golan-Globus.","review":"Those execuative poroduces Golan-Globus gave us yet another flop. Firewalker has some funny moments but it is too hokey to be believable. The cave sets look really fake and laughable, not to mention the acting. Many Norris fans many disappointed with his stab at comedy, but I enjoyed it. First rent, then buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firewalker","review":"Firewalker is a movie that will make you laugh. Chuck is calm, relaxed, and able to jump at amonents notice. Lou is an excellent actor and makes the combo of him and Chuck work really well together.

Not a martial arts movie. More of a comical Indy movie. Not much of a body count.A Great movie for just plain simple relaxation.Would I watch it again? Yes, I've watched it about 5 times by myself just for my relaxation. Good movies are few; great ones even fewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This album is worth the money if only for the new version of THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK - I'll never forget seeing John sing this with just his guitar and the most tremendous soaring voice.

Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not include GRAMMAR?","review":"I've attempted to use this book to teach first year French, and ended up spending obscene amounts of time supplementing it with personal materials so my students will have SOME idea of what things like relative pronouns, compound tenses, and locutions triggering the subjunctive are. The students HATED the daher exercises, the CD crashed all computers at the language lab, and the kids ended up frustrated, linguitically stunted, and angry about the monumental amount of money they had to spend on a worthless textbook. The book is a travesty, and is sure to damage any students subjected to it in place of real language instruction. Multimedia for multimedia's sake is just damned stupid, and has no place in a thinking, caring faculty: as a teacher and someone who wants the best for my students, I would NEVER touch this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story is beautiful","review":"The book delves in to the emotions of the characters so much more than the movie.

Joan Vinge is an excellent writer and, in my opinion, adds to this beautiful tale of forbidden romance. I can't say whether you'll enjoy it as much as the movie because i don't know, but it really gives one a sense of the emotions drive the characters. The epilog is an amusing and quaint surprise as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petty good toy","review":"This is a pretty good toy, it is fairly poseable and made of quality plastics unlike most of the Movie Transformers toys. The transformation is fairly simple involving only about 6 steps and all parts of the toy can store on the toy, both in robot and vehicle mode.I collect transformer toys and I love Optimus Prime, so this toy was a no-brainer for me to buy. Having said that, this version of Optimus Prime only appears in the movie for about 2 minutes, and during those two minutes he is very hard to see (dark, hidden behind objects) so there is no real way to tell how movie accurate this toy is.All in all it is an interesting and well made version of Optimus Prime, but aside from the packaging it is hard to tell which character this is supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors but read for the info not the recipes","review":"When this book first came out it had so many errors that it was recalled and reprinted and supposedly corrected. (Or so I read on a message board). I own the 2nd printing.I really like Alton Brown. I admire and respect him. I think he's a wonderful person (I've met him), a great educator, and a good cook. But this book makes me embarrassed for him. I have the version that is supposedly \\"corrected\\". Yet each time I make a recipe there are so many mistakes I'm scared to make another. I've made the bread recipes and each and every one has \\"issues\\". I have written myself a note in the book to not make any more recipes but to use the book as a reference and a learning tool. As a \\"why does this happen\\" book, it's great. If you make any of the recipes, proceed with caution. The Focaccia recipe on page 260 is great, if you add an extra cup of water. Eat is right out of the oven. Yum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to learn more about baking this is it!","review":"Alton Brown is not only good on TV but great in books too! I loved this book and will be handing it down to my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Alton Brown is just perfect. This book is smart and great for any baker with a technical mind. I absolutely love the design of the book and using a method flat to bookmark the page. Awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So exciting you might forget your purse!","review":"My sister was so excited to receive this book for Christmas that she put her car keys on it so she wouldn't forget to take it home. We drove 45 minutes to her house before we got the phone call saying she had left her purse behind at Grandma's house.We love Alton for many reasons:-He gives lots of scientific explanations for why food does what it does.-He's very funny!-He will tell you when it's important to spend money on something for your kitchen and when you can just cut a hole in a Frisbee, seriously.What a guy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time, make sure the recipes are RIGHT","review":"Have a first printing of this book.... and very, very mad at it. Sure, it's great, explinations are wonderful, love the layout of the book... but they must have spent so much time on all that, and overlooked the recipes. The errors in this book make me very disappointed. I write instructions for a living, and totally wrong ingredient lists and instructions are inexcusable, for any cookbook and more so for something with Alton Brown's name on it. The first recipe I tried out of this was the pizza dough, which was so filled with errors (that I learned after the fact) that it was a disaster. If you do buy this book, check out AB's website after you get it and make sure to correct everything you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Printing Errors to be Useful","review":"Well, this would be a really interesting cook book if the editors and author had done their editing jobs. The mistakes make several recipes impossible to make unless you look up the corrected recipes online- some of which don't even resemble the recipe in the book. For example, the brownie recpe in the book calls for steeping the cocoa- but gives you no volume of the water (\\"tk\\" is not a volume measure). However, when you spend some time searching the web for the corrected recipe and finally find it, there is no steeping of the cocoa at all! That's a MAJOR error- not just a typo. If you want this book, wait until it is re-edited... or buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alton Brown is King!","review":"Great book from a fabulous chef!

I learn something from him every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I am so angry with Alton Brown for putting his name on this book!! Remember when you were young and you thought the world of your parents, they were like gods. I think of Alton Brown in a similar way to a knowledgable relative. He brings science and cooking together with a heavy sprinkle of humor, so brilliantly that he constantly inspires me to cook. I look up to him as a role model and thought he could never let me down. Until now, with this book. Sure the techniques are sound but the recipes are TERRIBLE! Where did they come from? You won't find them on episodes of Good Eats, or even the Food Network website. I found the bread and biscuit recipe to be a complete failure with far too much liquid to dry goods. What a mess. I was cursing Alton's name. How could he let me down by putting his name on this terrible failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many errors in this book.","review":"I have the first edition of this book. My husband and I have both baked recipes in it, and we've slowly come to the conclusion that it is not to be trusted. There are many errors, especially in measurements, which is funny because Mr. Brown seems to be all about weighing everything, in order to get accurate measurements. I went to the website that someone mentioned on here to correct some things, but I know from personal experience that that posting does not cover all the mistakes. Also-- Mr. Brown uses a lot of buttermilk, and when he uses buttermilk, he seems to also use a lor of salt. Either that or buttermilk is naturally salty? At any rate, everything we made from this book that had buttermilk in it was too salty for our taste. I cut the salt in half on those recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minus one star for making me fatter than I already am!","review":"Alton has put together the kind of cookbook even a confirmed bachelor like me can relate to. If you have a sweet tooth, or just love the smells and tactile experience of baking, then this is for you too.Beyond the basics of some great ideas on foods that are simply way too fattening for me, the book itself is beautiful. I bought a copy today and am working on something as we speak. Not only are the ideas fabulous, but the book itself is an entertaining and mouth-watering presentation. My friend and I are enjoying laughing about some of the descriptions, and preparing to indulge in some treats.Warning: Do not open when you are hungry - you will regret it. Each page = an additional 20 minutes on the treadmill. You were warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Immortal Caesar is an excellent read, well researched, very well written.

I felt I must review this movie because it needs a lower overall rating. I like crazy movies, movies that push the envelope; but this movie just made an attempt and failed on the unfunny side. It is a NASTY movie which I would be totally fine with, if it were actually funny-it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible..............................","review":"This is really bad.

This is a R rated comedy... and a very fuunny one!","review":"Ok, first off it is very coarse, and totally in line with what I could expect from the Farrelly bros. If you thought that it was a romantic comedy, than you were mistaken, and may have been disappointed. It is a comedy... a very funny one. If you are the type of neurotic person that is typified here, than you may be offended. If you are expecting wholesome family comedy, then you WILL be offended. But for anyone who became romantically involved with a closet case screwball, or knows someone that has, then you will laugh more each time you see it.It is R rated for a reason....in fact, I would say several very funny reasons. And Stiller, along with all the cast, proves that they have not only depth of character, but a sense of humor for electing to be in it.Heck, I've seen it four times, and I've found something new to laugh at each time.

No, it's not brilliant -- and it's not nearly as funny as There's Something About Mary (to mention a previous Stiller film) or as touching as The Goodbye Girl (another Neil Simon play that was made into two movies).But it's an entertaining look at a man who falls in love with a woman -- while he's on his honeymoon. Malin Akerman and Michelle Monaghan provide OK support, but not much more, as the crazy bride and the girl he falls in love with, respectively (I really don't get Monaghan's appeal, but maybe that's just me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"I didn't buy this movie on here but thank god i got it on sale, and i didn't waste too much money.

I expected some potty humor, I expected some uncomfortable (for me) jokes about sex. I thought it would be something like \\"So I Married An Axe Murderer\\", I had no idea this would be as cringe inducing as Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights. It is all of the body functions of 8 Crazy Nights and the discomfort of the Ben Stiller's stupid charter's actions from Meet the Parents, without the humor of the latter.

However, I seee nothing of value in this movie. The sex scenes are so tasteless that they aren't the least bit amusing, much less laugh-out-loud funny. The language Jerry Stiller uses seems beneath someone of his age--you'd think, as old as he is, he'd have acquired at least a modicum of diginity. I hung in there until the finish hoping that, at least, the movie would end decently. Sorry I bothered!!! I wasted my money. I also wasted something more valuable--2 hours of my life!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near Stillers best","review":"I hated this movie. It had such great potential. And as the other reviewers say, the ending is horrible too. Ben Stiller has such great films but this one could possibly be a career breaker. NOT a good movie at all. The character of Lila, Eddie's wife, is beyond annoying. She has this laugh that makes you want to through things at the TV...seriously. Almost didn't even finish watching. And the attendant at the resort they stayed at was not funny either. The plot line had potential like I said but falls short of achieving.

I would rather spend 2 hours getting paper cuts on the most sensitive parts of my body than to watch this movie again. The plot is non-existent. The weak attempt at humor is tasteless and just awful. The acting is like a home movie that people forgot to turn the camera off and recorded two hours of nothing. I am astounded at how bad this movie was. I mean it wasn't even cult classic bad. It made Army of Darkness seem like a modern art masterpiece. This movie is so bad that the people who made it should be prosecuted for wasting so much money on a movie and not spending it on something worthwhile like another Rambo movie. Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"The fist half of Heartbreak Kid had some laughs. The second half was pure boredom. My wife and I simply didn't connect with the typical Hollywood \\"marriage is horrible\\" tripe, especially considering that this was a movie for couples.And that brings me to my main point: on the surface, this is a movie for couples, but the movie itself is very anti-couple friendly. There was a ton of crude humor moments that my wife and I both hated. For example, there is a scene in which a woman's hairy lower region is revealed in all its very hairy glory (no kidding), and the woman proceeds to urinate on the back of Ben Stiller. This is completely seen on film; every aspect.It was at this point that my wife checked out.

Heartless and awkward, Ben Stiller is as confused about his sexual preferences here as we are with his lack of sincerity or sense of relationship. An afront to thinking men, women and children this venture finds no value in Mexican culture nor the animal world (in a graphic scene of bestiality). Unfortunately, better cast members than BS are taken down with this sticky man of war and will no doubt regret all but the great Mexican beach location.

The game has a confusing setup, andseems to focus more on mindless destruction of major cities. But then,what 10-13 year old boy DOESN'T want that in all of his games? Now, I'm not saying the game isn't fun. Quite the contrary. I'm just saying that if you are looking for a game with a good storyline, this is not what you've been searching for. However, once you have all of the controls figured out, you can have all the fun you want just running around New York City destroying huge buildings and beating random giant monsters. Overall, I would say that this game would be good for the kind of people who enjoy games like Soul Caliber or Super Smash Brothers.However, this game has slightly more complicated controls. But, once again, when figure all of the systems out, it can be pretty fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"great nostolgic game","review":"i grew up watching godzilla movies so i really got a kick out of being able to play a game with him and the other monsters i grew up with.

This is incredible to play and the story mode is absolutely fantastic! There are four different factions for the game. There are Earth Defenders, Which are monsters like godzilla and mothra, rodan, and anguirus. then there are The Global Defense Force, Which are robotic monsters like kiyru and mechagodzilla. then there are Mutants like biollante and destroyah. then ther are the Aliens, like gigan and King ghidorah. The choices you make in the story affect who your allies are, and the faction you play as affects the outcome of the game. This game is very long, so unlocking things may take some time. WARNING: there is a little language in the game, i just thought I should point that out. So all in all this game Is THE BEST GODZILLA GAME EVER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok gameplay, but got boring","review":"I'm not particularly a fan of the Godzilla films. I did watch the 1998 Godzilla movie and enjoyed it. I was expecting some similarities in this game, but I couldn't find any.I played story mode as I thought it'd be a good opportunity to learn the controls. Getting started, it was difficult to figure out what the objectives were (asides from smashing the other monster). After a couple hours struggling to get Godzilla to execute the moves, I simply gave up. It was unresponsive, as many other reviewers have indicated.I believe the best aspect of the game is the multiplayer brawl that you can play. The brawl-mode reminded me of Wii Sports-Boxing.This game just didn't cut it for me, and will likely end up as a gift to my cousins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla Unleashed: Not Worth the Money","review":"if you absolutely have to own this game, wait for it to hit the bargain bins. it looks like it should be fun, but the controls are really confusing. the levels end abruptly and there isn't a lot of incentive to unlock stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have the Tylenol handy","review":"We love our Wii, but we were really disappointed with this game, the worse Wii game I've seen.

She looks great on the outside but once you start peeling back layers you can see she's not all she's cracked up to be. The graphics and look of this game are great. With the graphical ability of today's games you can make a game that is very eye appealing and not spend any time on the gameplay or AI of the game itself. This is exactly what is going on here. The writing is poor, the premise is boring, but having said all that it's great to look at. If you are looking for a fun game with great gameplay this isn't it. If you love monster premise games and are more concerned with the look you will probably be happy but don't say you weren't warned.** NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Unleashed","review":"I purchased Godzilla Unleashed for my grandson who was a Godzilla expert at 8 years old.

Nevertheless, you can see from the samples that much of this book consists of ordinary outlines, not of charts at all. The author's \\"Charts of the New Testament\\" on the other hand, is quite good, and is almost entirely composed of charts in visual form, such as one would use on an overhead projector, to help the students to visualize the material taught.Let us remember that Zondervan is in this business to sell books, more than to help readers learn. Just as the \\"Dummies\\" series is nothing more than a marketing strategy for a series of how-to books written by unrelated authors who pay the fee to use the name, likewise not all these Zondervan books of the \\"Charts\\" series are created by the same authors or for the same noble purpose, but mainly to identify themselves with the successful series, and to sell.

Having been around JWs my whole life, I know that many have several translations of the bible on their book shelves.

The next morning I took her to my vet, who said her blood glucose level was through the roof (620!), but could find nothing wrong with the other bloodwork.There were dead and dying fleas everywhere, I will say, the product does its job...but at what cost to the animal?? The other dogs wanted to eat grass, so I imagine they didn't feel all that great from the treatment.I did bathe the affected Pug in human shampoo, and she slept well the following night.

After one more day of watching the poor fellow suffer to the brink of insanity (he was starting to cry with frustration), I realized that matters were definitely not improving - as recommended by a veterinary website, I bathed him using dish detergent which stripped the medication from his skin. Thankfully, his scratching frenzy subsided quite soon after. Amazon were great, by the way, and gave me a full refund on the product after sending it back to them. It's not usually their policy to refund on a product, but I guess they have had a lot of complaints!I then decided to buy him a flea collar instead which has been very effective with no reactions and is MUCH cheaper (it costs $5 and last 6 months!).

MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS PRODUCT for not listing the potential side effects.

In any case......we applied it to our 4 maltese yesterday afternoon and by last night TWO of them were having a bad reaction (bright red skin, scratching and just freaking out) and the other two were scratching the spot! We called the 24 hour emergency hospital and they said to bathe them and to give them Benadryl. If they don't improve today we have to give them antibiotics. My smallest is suffering the most right now, scratching the spot and crying. I just gave him another 1/2 of the Benadryl and hopefully it will help. Going to send Advantix the bill for any vet costs.

I put the K9 Advantix on him on a tuesday and when I came home from class thursday he was freaking out hiding in my closet (he has never been in my closet before). He was panting heavily and didn't want me to touch him whatsoever. Anytime I made him get out of the closet I noticed he kept trying to bite something on his back.. I'd imagine this was his skin becoming very irritated. I had no idea what was wrong with him until I realized the only thing I changed was his flea medication. The effects wore off by the 3rd day, but I was afraid for his life. I tried calling the number on the box.. I left my name and number, but no one returned my call.

My Cairn had no reaction. My Lab did. The following day, she was lethargic, and I washed her, to try to remove the product from her skin. Tuesday morning she vomitted and would not move, she looked stoned and we took her to an animal hospital. They treated her for a reaction and her symptoms. Oxygen mask, I.V., etc... By the end of the day she was having seizures and was moved to an overnight facility to be under watch. Her situation worsened and by mid-day on Wednesday she had passed away. I must note she was an indoor dog, not subject to chemicals, a healthy weight, great demeanor, and has not ever had medical problems. Within 72 hours she went from a lively, 8 year old lab, playing in the backyard with my son, to passing away. The only difference in her life was the K9 advantix."},{"rating":"2","title":"no fleas","review":"I have 4 dogs- 2 Saint Bernards,1 Saint mix and a shepard mix.

Both dogs were kept mostly on the trail, both dogs did brush against the grass. After the hike, my mom's dog with no tick repellent picked up 7 ticks. My dog, 4 days after Advantix application (no baths), picked up a dozen ticks. Not only did we pull 12 ticks off him within 48 hours of the hike, none of them appeared to be dying.

Within a day of using the Advantix, the dogs were not scratching and biting anymore, and shortly after that I stopped seeing the fleas altogether. I vacuumed vigorously which I'm sure helped, but with this product you pretty much don't need to use any other flea traps, carpet cleaners, etc. It kills the fleas in the \\"dog's environment\\" also.

About the 4th time, my pug/westie mix started jerking towards her hind/tail area (I had put most on the back of the neck and a small portion at the base of her tail).Since we had used this product before, we first thought she had hip or back problems so took her to the vet and specialist. After $1500 and 4 trips to the vet, including major pain medication she was better after a few days so assumed it was just a joint/back/hip problem that got better. The next month, right after using Advantix again, the same thing happened which led to the obvious conclusion it was an alergic reaction. I wished I had known it could be washed off with dish soap (per the earlier review) because she had to spend another 2 days until she stopped reacting to the treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS WELL!!!!!!!!!","review":"Used to use Frontline Plus but it seemed to stop being effective as i was finding fleas on my dogs.

My dog's reaction was fairly mild, but she recommended that I go back to Frontline.I went back to Frontline, no problem.When I ran out, I decided to try the Advantix again. My dog was about 1 year old and about 4.5 lbs. No problem whatsoever.I did some research afterwards and read on the internet somewhere that Advantix is not recommended for dogs under 3 lbs.

My dogs have NEVER had fleas & 2 weeks later I noticed them scratching & saw fleas on them! I swear this Advantix stuff doesn't repell, but attracks fleas.

It even led to a major infestation in my house. I have never had that occur with any product before.

We have a serious problem with fleas in our yard, which we plan to treat next spring (the lawn).When I use K9 Advantix my dog has 0 fleas and 0 ticks, she is not bothered by it, and it is very minimal mess. Some brands like BioSpot have so much goop in the tube that I wonder if it simply rubs off onto the couch, her bed, etc.Although some brands work better than others depending on the geographic location and climate, I highly recommend K9 Advantix for your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"still have fleas","review":"Your service was great quick and efficeint.

What concerned me is that he began biting at his nether region, which resulted in little cuts (he's never done that in the time he's had fleas). Also, when I gave him the commands he has already learned really well, it took many repetitions for him to finally follow them (he stared blankly for a long period of time). In addition, his urine became darker even though he consumed the same amount of water he usually does. The only positive aspect about this product is that I found a few dead fleas 9 hours after use. Still, I won't make the mistake of purchasing this product again. Especially after reading all of the horror stories & realizing that this harmful product does not even have any warning labels for possible side effects, why risk your dog's health?

If you read the Advantix description, they just say it \\"repels\\" ticks, not that it prevents or kills them. Wish I had interpreted that for what it really meant in the beginning.

He then went on to develop leg tremors, difficulty walking and climbing stairs. He became lethargic, acted like he was nauseated or dizzy. He lost nearly 10 lbs. in two weeks. Our vet and groomer said it was the Advantix, that they have had other dogs come in with neurological symptoms after the product was used. He has gotten better, but he is still not himself. When I called Bayer, they said all of this was an unusual reaction to the product, but if you do research on-line, you will see thousands of animals that have had bad reactions and/or died."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE FOR EVERY ANIMAL","review":"I just switched from advantage to advantix and my dog had a rash where it was applied. That wasn't too bad. But a few days later he began having seizures and vomiting. I had a strong feeling it was the advantix but Bayer doesn't list adverse reactions on the package so I called. I was told that couldn't happen as the medication is not absorbed into the skin. Do you know of anything that isn't? Skin has pores! It was a dumb response and they refused to report the seizures and vomiting but did report the skin rash. So I guess Bayer will admit there are adverse reactions, they just get to choose which ones. And if you google adverse reactions to K9 Advantix, you'll see my dog isn't alone.

With it, they pretty much stay away for up to 4 weeks after application. I guess it works on fleas and ticks too since she's never had any of those obnoxious parasites either.

Looks kinda weird and can be dangerous to touch if you don't wash your hands right away. Side note: My dog is 68 pounds but I've been using the 55+ lb version of Advantix since she was 50 pounds. I called the company back when my dog was smaller and told them the mosquito protection wasn't working too well and they told me to go the next size up. Once I did, I didn't have any more problems.

It did not bother my two spaniels, but my bichon started going crazy. He would race through the house, run in circles, try to bite the spot on his back, right above his tail; or he would just sit and whimper. I called the 800 number on the box and was told that the dog is feeling tingling similar to when our foot falls asleep ( I wonder how they know this?), to not bathe him yet, and that it would subside in 24-72 hours. Five days later, he was still in a lot of discomfort. My vet said it was too late to bathe him at that point, and I had to take him in to get a steroid shot, and five weeks worth of prednisolone pills for him to take.

Instead of being the friendly, playful dog he usually is, he only wanted to be alone and secluded himself. After another few hours and by the end of the day he would not walk as if it hurt him to walk. He chewed and scratched all day where the medication had been applied as well as his paws. It scared me badly but after some research I realized it was an allergic reaction, I'm glad it was nothing more serious because it was a saturday night and the next day was a sunday and almost all the pet clinics were closed except for some far away. Within a couple of days and after a bit of benadryl he was fine and I'm very grateful, but we can no longer use this product and my money has gone to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog had TERRIBLE reaction. I feel so bad.","review":"I have a 15 lb Bichon frise/ poodle mix. I tried this medication on her this morning. About 1 hour after application she started scratching the application area and whimpering. She began to run around frantically while whimpering and crying. I immediately washed the infected area with Dawn dishwashing soap. I then took her to the vet. He told me my dog had an allergic reaction to the Advantix. He said she won't die from it as it takes a dosage 10x than what I gave her to do that. He told me to wash the whole body with Dawn and gave her a shot for pain and one for itching. He gave me some meds to give her while at home. I feel soooo bad, she is still scratching and whimpering. He said that dogs with white fur have sensitive skin. It's best to give them an oral medication like Comfortis instead of topical ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE!","review":"Almost took my Husky to the vet after using this product.Within an hour of giving this to my dog he was acting very strange. He was almost paralyzed in his hindquarters, he couldn't walk more than a few feet without hitting the ground and then would frantically start biting at his rear end. He wouldn't come to me when I called him and would just go lay down with a scared look on his face. I felt so bad for him and felt even more upset with myself for not reading more into it.

The same chemical used in it to kill ticks was used in an earlier flea control product and was deemed unsafe by vets.

This book has confirmed for me just why he's my favorite. This time, the web-slinger is against an implacable foe who can't be so easily disposed of because he's successfully convinced nearly everyone that he never was the Green Goblin. Worse, he strikes at Spider-Man and his alter ego with impunity, given that if Spidey tries to do anything about him, then he'll be seen as a criminal and Norman Osborn will get away clean. The dilemma he presents Peter with is diabolically clever: Either take the opportunity for financial security and leave behind his responsibilities, or continue being Spider-Man and possibly jeopardize his current position at the Daily Bugle. I was really rooting for Spidey to take down Osborn after he secretly poisoned Mary Jane.

This book simply bored me to death. The technique is written in prose form, I respect it, to some degrees, it is a type of art. However, the backcover of this book did a poor job of explaining what this book was supposed to convey. Maybe it is because there's nothing to review about! All said, this book showed the heart of evil as well as violence through the bleak characters of Popeye, Gowan and Red. They kidnapped the promiscous girl named Temple and took her to Memphis, where we meet a even more feared underground criminal gangs and bootleggars.Overall, I'm really disappointed in this book because I thought that William Faulkner, one of the best writers in the last century, should've done better. A lot of has to do with the style that he writes in, but overall, a very boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reviews are much better than the book","review":"This was my second shot at trying to appreciate William Faulkner. I read Light in August a few years back and gave it 3 stars. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck, a contemporary of Faulkner's, who is often compared to Faulkner. Some reviews have said if you like Steinbeck you will like Faulkner. I disagree. Steinbeck writes clear and concise stories that are carried by his creativity and a reflection of the life he led. To describe Faulkner's style in Sanctuary, I will borrow from another review that said it was \\"oblique and distracting\\". I finished the story with a half-hearted understanding of what I had just read. By reading all of the other reviews on this site I now understand so much more about the book.

Sanctuary starts off with a well-to-do man from the city stumbling across a ramshackle farmhouse where moonshine is being made. From there, the story spirals off to include Temple (a rich and popular teenage girl), Mrs. Goodwin (the moonshiner's common law wife), and Popeye (a deranged misfit). Their paths continue to cross as the book goes on; sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.Faulkner is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. I've been slowly reading through his books after tackling all of Cormac McCarthy's work (the two authors are very similiar, in my opinion). One thing with Faulkner, I've found that it works best just to keep on reading even if encounter something that doesn't make sense.

There were a couple shown briefly, with one stripping down to, dare I say it - her bra!

In the book, she touches on Mistral's possible Lesbianism or in a White-Race supremacy belief before turning into the defender of Native Americans and Mestizos. She also talks about the use of pictures and other visual elements to create Mistral's image. The book is not easy to read, but brings new aspects on Mistral's life to counterback her \\"Mythical\\" and \\"Sanctified\\" Image.

Had previously read ITH by mathew hilgger, but lee jones's text is so great in the way it presents strategic information, I now prefer it to ITH.As for this book, I have no idea what the people who say this is a great introduction for hold'em are talking about.The presentation is confusing, the book contains a lot of fillers with little valuable information. Rules of hold'em aren't that complicated that requires the extensive chapters on reading the board as this necessarly comes with experience and doesn't take that long.As for strategy, I admit Miller is a bit more agressive than lee jones(which depends on the stakes you play in) and does present very valuable ideas, but I think the presentation is less than functional for complete begginers, for whom this book is intended.It is a cheap book...in all ways possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Started in Hold'Em","review":"I have read four books on holdem poker and this has the best and most understandable format of any of them.

It does give Goldberg's reflections on the writing process with emphasis on her internal thoughts and processes when writing. I was disappointed in this book, as it seems to be a recycling of old material, such as her well-known writing practice. This book is primarily a book of musings on the writing process. I do not recommend this book for those who are seeking how-to-do it information on the craft of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"Basically, the author just rambles on until she finds her point. In fact, she admits that this is her writing style. Yes, the book is well-written. It is like a conversation with an interesting author. But I did not find it helpful. It will not teach you to write well. It does not contain many secrets. If you simply want to connect with a brave author who has mastered her own voice, go for it. If you are looking for guidance to become a better writer, you should probably avoid this. To become a better writer check out David Morrell's book on writing and Stephen King's book:On Writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try It Before You Buy It!","review":"For someone who spends so much time meditating -- and writing about that experience -- Goldberg is the most neurotic nonfiction writer I've ever tried to read.

Her \\"voice\\" was so irritating that I just had to put it down a third of the way though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older & Wiser...And Very Honest!","review":"After reading some of the reviews here at Amazon, I was a bit hesitant to try this one.

Written with Natalie's trademark simple, straightforward honesty, it confronts life \\"after\\" _Writing Down the Bones_ & _Wild Mind_. Where does all the free writing & mind exploration lead? What's the point of it all? She takes us there in this book.Natalie & I are at opposite ends of the spectrum on God, philosophy, and morality, but I've never found a writer who can motivate me to write quite like she does. Her willingness to \\"tell it like it is\\" is refreshing and inspiring.Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience","review":"An avid fan of Natalie and her books, I was excited to hear about this one and bought it the day it came out. Like all her books, this one encompasses a certain time in her life and her feelings about writing. I just like the way she writes. So much of it is personal and I enjoyed reading about how certain books have affected her. Every chapter is a novel in itself. She really gets to the root of who we are as writers and why we write. I especially liked the part where she described her need to know the author and the story behind him or her. I thought I was the only one who checked out a book before I read it and felt that nervousness at the first chapter. This is a great book and I am recommending it to all my fellow writing friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"A babbling stream of zen consciousness nonsense.

In fact, reading books about writing is silly. If you want to write fiction, read fiction. If you want to write poetry, read poetry.

The book has a whole section devoted to reviews of fast food restaurants, another on preparing frozen pizza, another on the virtues of aluminum foil in cooking.

This book's story is centered around a small NC town during the Civil War, and paralells the lives of two young girls, whose circumstances bring them together. The book deals with several different issues and the author tells the story in the most interesting and creative way. Angels Watching Over Me is a very appropriate title because the two girls definitely need a whole legion of angels to watch over them.

The built in electric pump worked great, and our guest felt that he was sleeping like royalty up off of the floor for the remainder of his visit--especially as compared to his accomodations of the previous nights. It stayed inflated for 10 days, even though our cat had discovered it and made it her bed during the day time. Luckly, she only used it for sleeping, not for sharpening her claws. We found the deflation mode slightly more challending than the inflation mode, and fitted bottom sheets didn't work well on this mattress, but would definitely recommend this product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Product!","review":"I don't recommend this air bed, I am disappointed in the performance of this mattress! The air seeps out, my guest is a petite person so I don't understand why the air mattress would lose air so fast.

The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them. The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection. The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.

When in the heat of an acting moment, this move will result in a real kick to the groin and an actor that can not complete the performance. The production values are terrible as well. It seems to have been shot with a poor DV camera and no lighting. This is a High School workshop that is being video taped. Certainly not a very high training element. It is a pity.

But the layout is the stupidest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has ruined everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft.

The \\"Other Nations\\" section is one page, the Commonwealth Wirraway (Australia); why not include it under British Commonwealth? The photo of the Fw 190 has been used SO MANY times; get something different. The photo of the Ju 87 has been retouched (during WWII?) and is just plain bad. The Bf 109 photo combines the worst of the Fw 190 and Ju 87 photos: over used and retouched.

I have a new appreciation for that journey after learning about the determined man who made it possible, whether directly or indirectly. He laid the foundation for swifter travel to the Keys.

Standiford certainly knows how to keep the reader's interest, as I had only limited knowledge of Flagler beforehand but found this to be a fascinating history of the story behind the story. After doing further research on Flagler and the project online, I found that some elements were left out or altered slightly for the book, but overall it's a great read that will certainly satisfy any history buff or fan of quality literature. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of the Guilded Age","review":"At first glance this seems to be sort of a regional bit of history. Our main protagonist, Henry Flagler, turns out to be a peer of Rockefeller who embarked on an almost pyramid-building type of project to bridge the Florida Keys. Although mostly a curiosity, author Les Standiford uses this project to bring the Guilded Age of American business to life. He manages to convey the peril and monumentous task that Flagler spearheaded with his ocean railroad, and the writing is taut and to the point. In fact, my one complaint is that there are glimpses of other topics that Standiford only mentions in passing, but could have also made for compelling reading and a wider canvas. But what is in the book is very informative and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie","review":"If you want to take a trip down memory lane this album will put you in the mood.

You really appreciate the talent of John Fogerty, who created that gritty down South CCR sound. He can still do a pretty fair job of rocking even now.

At the lengths there makeing CD's now.....\\"I'm sure they could tack on these 5-6 songs to the end of this album, AND make a ONE CD album \\". Which is what CCR needs, with all the hits. They haven't had a new hits colletion in over 15 years....Just add some songs mentioned above and there you go ( A 26 SONG HITS COLLECTION ). JUST PERFECT,since all there songs are short in length....anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Lord, Stuck In Lodi Again...","review":"Great compilation! One of the best available for any group or artist. I believe this is one of the only collections that contains every single a group ever had, including the b-side sales attachments. With every single included here, there isn't any room for any classic album tracks, which is the only slight problem I have. Yes, they are available on the next volume(all album tracks), but it might be nice to have a couple mixed in here, so we could have some on the same disc. But overall, most of these singles are some of the best in rock 'n roll history, and you can either get volume II for the album tracks, or pick up the individual albums that you find necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"This CD brings us with some of the best nuggets of American folk, rock, R&B, ever. I grew up listening to CCR in the early Seventies. Back then, their music would sound just great to me. Today, I feel really happy to have my children listening to this masterpiece and regarding it as just great as well. This album managed to bring together the best of CCR, and make me long for that time, when a rock band would turn me on and on. This CD represents one example of what has musically been the best in my generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Rocks most important songs","review":"this disc has some of the most important songs ever released.this is very essential to any collection.the songs have been rerecorded and done over&over again.but Creedence Clearwater Revival have put their stamp all over this disc.great songs,words&Music."},{"rating":"2","title":":D","review":"CCR's music certainly deserves 5 stars and leaves me all smiles, but I'm hesitant to give this album itself 5 stars. I realize it's a greatest hits collection, but, being a real fan, I feel that it barely scrapes the barrel. CCR is one of those groups where you MUST have the albums to really get it. I'm basing this review on the music though, which is what it's all about. My personal favorites are \\"Green River\\" and \\"Who'll Stop The Rain.\\" \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\" and \\"Someday Never Comes\\", the 2 closing tracks, are excellent as well. Though I don't count it in my top 5, the 11 minute, 4 second rendition of \\"Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" is just plain awesome. \\"Fortunate Son,\\" with its plain spoken lash at American government and society, remains a classic today. I could be here a while rambling on about the high points of each song, but I won't. I'll leave it you to discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grand introduction","review":"This is a fine starting point for this band, one of the finest of the late 60's-early 70's. Most of the hits are here. This will make you want to check out some of their regular albums (Green River, Willy & The Poor Boys, Cosmos Factory, etc). To Fantasy: this band is due for a major retrospective and remastering, hopefully with bonus tracks added to the CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a class of it's own","review":"CCR had a style that nobody had done with R&B, Rockabilly (although they don't really sound countryish, which is great), Classic rock and other stuff. This style resulted in one of the best rock groups of the 60's and 70's. This album is the best representitive in their discography of the enduring style they helped create. It's a classic collection in rock history. You won't regret getting this if you love CCR and the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE GREATEST HITS COLLECTION","review":"If you want a quick smattering of this all time great band, grab this record at once! Almost all of these songs are true classics. I started with this one and was so impressed that I collected all their original recordings. The music is a good blend of Americana music at its best between the late sixties and early seventies. I prefer the eleven minute version of \\"Grapevine\\" from Cosmos Factory and don't care for Hey Tonight too much but otherwise this is as close to perfect as you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"so cool","review":"this album is the best in this world for a man like me. i spend so mucht time on road and this album was my best friend in intro the years. i lost it(the album),and i miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compliation CD","review":"This is a great collection of CCR hits. There are so many different types of music on this CD, which is one of the things I really like about it. Some are mellow and easy going, and some are rocking and get your blood pumping.

Then this greatest hits collection is a perfect introduction. The songs are well sequenced and have aged extremely well..but then, so do most rock songs.

Do yourself a favor and just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of The Best","review":"Being the age that I am,I have listened to Creedence and the unique voice of John Fogerty for some 37 or 38 years. This CD offered me all of their most popular songs without the expence and trouble of searching out the individual albums. I am pleased with this CD,yet that doesn't mean that I won't buy another Creedence album in the future. This album gives me what I want,yet allows me the freedom of increasing the list without a great deal of repitition. Having released the amount of music Creedence has,it gives plenty to listen to with a surprise or two still in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest band of all time!","review":"My son is 18 years old, his fav artist is Will Smith. He has had my copy of Chronicle for the last three month's and won't give it back, I can't think of a better way to sum up the enduring appeal of CCR who are criminally ignored in the UK these days. John Fogerty's vocals are just incredible, rasping, rocking, brilliant. Every track is a classic, even CCR's version of Grapevine which surely is the only other version worth comparing with Marvin Gay's. The only fault with this album is the omission of Born on the Bayou.

Everyone was doing it!!As for the actual music, this band couldn't be beat. I wish these guys would sit down with some of today's tone deaf artists and teach them how to write a genuine melody. Or maybe that can't be taught. Well, if not, then at least show them a good guitar hook or two.CCR just had everything: a bear of a singer, catchy tunes that are in no way too poppish, and a sort of folksy electric guitar that seemed to go with the flow. Just listen to the album and see how many fun rock songs you recognize.Hey, they may have been hippies, but you shouldn't hold that against them!!! Like I said, it was the 70's - everyone acted that way!!Long live CCR, a band that makes Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young look like total stoners!!HAVE A GOOD ONE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Still love this music all these years later.

PERIOD! 20 tunes of Rock-N-Roll, and for the price is well well worth it! John Fogerty has had a tremendous career on his own,but his performances with CCR are unforgettable. J C Fogerty composed some of the most popular songs in history, namely: Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising, Fortunate Son (which by the way, is currently being featured in a popular TV commercial),Up Around The Bend, and Who'll Stop The Rain. The band had over 14 top 10 hits and sold millions of records world wide. The song \\"Proud Mary\\" is more associated with Tina Turner, who also made a hit with it. One thing is for sure, the Amazon.com price for this CD is a steal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for classic rock fans","review":"Whoa, I don't even know where to begin on this one! Might as well start with the basics: Chronicle covers CCR's twenty biggest hit singles. Seeing how popular CCR is, this means it's loaded with classics such as Proud Mary, Green River, Fortunate Son, Bad Moon Rising, Have You Ever See the Rain, Who Will Stop the Rain, I Heard It Through The Grapevine, Travelin' Band and Run Through the Jungle.

The Bates method has been proven time and time again not to work.

He's got a good understanding of what the Bates Method is about (even most interested people totally miss it), and he's a good writer and a smart guy, so I'd have to say that I like this book and recommend it.From what I understand, Huxley didn't end up improving to the point where he had normal vision all the time. His failing to read a paper one time at a speaking is what's referenced a lot by the critics as \\"proof\\" he didn't benefit. Give me a break.

But Danny's lifestyle will eventually catch up with him. Now, one of his friends wants to reveal the truth about Danny Spain's life.I absolutely enjoyed reading the book, because it shows you how a Hollywood life could be and how it could end. Interestingly, Tamblyn based the character Danny Spain on biographical details of an existing Hollywood actor who is rumored to be gay.Tamblyn's characters are all believable, thus the protagonist doesn't always behave in a lovable way. Tamblyn allows the characters to make mistakes, which makes them even more human.A very nice read, indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonely King","review":"The story follows the life of Daniel Gibson from childhood to his violent early death.Daniel desperately seeks the attention of his father, but to no avail.With the safe distance of a voyeur, the reader accompanies Danny from his first sexual experiences to far inside the homosexual-milieu.After a long struggle for recognition Danny finally achieves a meteoric career within the dream factory of Hollywood.This only works by making a painful decision: to be popular or to be loved.To hold either the Oscar in your arms or the homosexual partner. To have both of it is not accepted by society.With enjoyable verbal trials, Tamblyn projects day dreams into a framework made by the basic biographical data of a certain Hollywood star.

She made some of her chapters of the book funny, nice and sad. At the start of the book, it was cool.But as it went on the book got sader. The sadest part of the book was when Alma said to Jackson that Billy Boy was beating her and even wrose hewas beating the baby too. Thats why I didn't like the middle ot the book. Because how could someone be so mean and hateful to hurt a baby. I mean a baby can't fight back.

If you play with 8th notes for one song, your pretty much stuck with it the whole set.- You need a headphone to quarter inch adapter if you want to plug into a system. No quarter inch out, only headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome metronome, worth buying","review":"Tama's RhythmWatch is an awesome machine. I've had mine for a few years now and Ive never needed anything more. Ive been drumming for 12 years and using a metronome is an absolute must. Whats great about this one is the ability to dial in different notes, eighth notes, quarter, half, full measure, triplets. You see the dials on the machine. Each specific dial adjusts the volume for every one you feel like turning on. You can adjust the sounds a couple different ways and it goes all the way to 9/4 count.

The stories are told and that's that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish Read","review":"This book attempts to discuss the samurai but it is written as it was intended for children to read. The chapter on ninja truly was one fixed with Hollywood like fiction, i.e. the ninja having a glider-like flyer that they used to drop bombs on a castle. Also powders taht caused their target to laugh and could not be stopped, sort of like the joker from Batman, and finally mentioned that a throwing star could kill their enemy while they hid among the crowd. Absolutely not true. The throwing star was not a weapon that killed people. It was used more for a \\"stop the chase\\" weapon.

Almost every song on here is excellent (the first 3 songs being the best). When i heard they were playing at Larkfest i had to go and i still haven't processed how incredable this band is live.

Even though John (and George) wrote beautiful songs, they could never top Paul. So, having purchased his Sitting in the Backyard, or whatever the last album was (it was awful except for the song played in The Lake House), I was hesitant to buy Memory Almost Full, but the reviews convinced me. I wish I'd listened to my instinct. This album sucks. He comes across very pitchy, and the words are as bad as the music. It's like he's just writing to write, not because he has all this talent to share. A huge disappointment. Save your money.

Sadly, this the third disappointing Macca release in a row. Driving Rain, Chaos & Creation, and Memory Almost Full are all mostly filler with only a few songs. The last great McCartney CD was Flaming Pie.There are only two really good songs here - Dance Tonight and Ever Present Past. The rest is pretty dreadful. The lyrics to the End of the End are poignant but there is no melody and the whistling is just annoying.

If not, it's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory Almost Full...","review":"Is simply a great album. The songs have a nostalgic feel to them that takes the audiences through Paul's career from Beatles to Wings, to even some his more eclectic recording like McCartney II. These songs are among his best! From a production point of view, the album sounds like an amalgamation of his two previous albums Chaos and Creation In The Backyard(2005), and Driving Rain(2001).

Print out the lyrics to \\"Dance Tonight\\" and read them. This song might actually have been ghost-written by his daughter Beatrice.

I've been a Paul McCartney fan from the beginning through the children's video \\"Rupert and the Frog Song\\" and Band on the Run. With all the hype I was expecting to be elated by the songs on Memory Almost Full. Instead I heard myself repeatedly say \\"I've heard this before. He's just repackaging the familiar. The only truly overflowing with life track was Dance Tonight. It seems he wrote it in the kitchen with his family present, after the entire album was recorded. In Dance Tonight you can tell Paul is happy. The others songs have a forced undertow. If he can maintain the vitality he brought forth in Dance Tonight for his next album then we might have some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in every way","review":"This is a wonderful recording for all of us who were Beatle fans and all of us who were't.

One of the greatest things about the album is that he has not only kept the high quality of songwriting so evident on Chaos & Creation, but has rediscovered the joy that was missing from that disc. That doesn't mean the songs have no substance. Except for the opening \\"Dance Tonight\\" and the closing \\"Nod Your Head\\", the songs explore some intriguing and occasionally dark subjects. Plus the album has a higher quotient of uptempo material than many recent Macca releases--including the exception rocker \\"Only Mama Knows\\". Early favorites include the \\"See Your Sunshine\\", \\"Mr. Bellamy\\", \\" \\"Vintage Clothes\\", \\"House of Wax\\" and the moving \\"The End of The End\\". True McCartney fans will NOT be disappointed. (The deluxe edition has three fine songs...with In Private being an instrumental. Great packaging!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My First \\"McCartney\\" Disappointment. . .","review":"Like the gal wrote in an earlier review. . .\\"I'm surprised at all the good reviews!\\".Like most all of Paul's CD's. . .I've either preordered, or purchased without any sampling. When this came in the mail, both my wife and I were severely disappointed. Paul's voice was sounding whiney and strained. . .and. . . with exception of a couple of tunes, the writing wasn't all that good. We feel that Paul's talent has finally succumbed to his ego. His work smacks of a man who feels that everything he does is genius. If all this wasn't bad enough. . .I find that the two entire CD's can be loaded on one standard CD-R. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Paul believes that his fans want to hear 20 minutes while he dribbles on about how he came to write the songs. . .Great marketing ploy here. . .little else. Sorry Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Lifelong Macca fan. I'd been anticpating this album and was very disappointed. Listened once. I can't imagine putting it back in unless I use the track filter on my player. There are a few songs that I love, a few that were decent, and about half were absolutely unlistenable. Topping it off with \\"Nod Your Head\\". Yikes. Where is the maturity? This is a grown man. His attempts to recapture an angry youth definitely did not succeed. And, honestly, is that what the fans want? Certainly not this one. The lyrics and tunes are shallow and forced. I love you Paul, but not this album. I'll be putting it away as a keepsake.

I waited anxiously for the release of \\"Memory Almost Full\\" and watched the video and followed all of the P/R that was available. I have to say that Paul's premiere release on the Starbucks label is a true disappointment. The CD is disjointed. The music is choppy, the lyrics telling but not touching. \\"Dance Tonight\\" which Paul says his three-year old daughter, Beatrice, loves is best left to the pre-school set. It is catchy, senseless tune that is far beneathe Paul's talent. While in Starbucks on several occasions, employees and customers alike expressed disappointment at this CD and I'm surprised that Starbucks even bothered with this. If Paul's name wasn't on the cover, this CD would never have seen the light of day.I wanted to love it. I'd planned to love it. But .... this CD is just not one of Paul's best.

The enduring \\"Gratitude\\" and the infectious \\"Vintage Clothes\\". \\"That Was Me\\" is simply great. \\"House of Wax\\" is mindblowing akin to The White Album. \\"The End of The End\\" is spiritually solacing. \\"Nod Your Head\\" closes the album will sheer heavy metal. Paul the peaceful veg was very animated on the three rockers \\"Only Mama Knows, \\"House Of Wax\\" and \\"Nod Your Head\\" that are certain to be concert highlights. The three bonus tracks are stellar including an instrumental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent McCartney Outing","review":"Although not as dark as his last album, the classic \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\", Paul has made another fine album which is almost as good in its own right. It is a potpourri of catchy ditties to rockers to Beach Boy \\"Pet Sounds\\" influences. There appears to be more of a Beatle Sound here too (imagine that). First rate vocal work as usual is present in every cut and every cut is superior except for the curious inclusion of the downright awful \\"Nod Your Head\\" as the closing track. Filler like that we don't need (What was he thinking?). The limited Edition contains 3 solid bonus tracks and a rather lengthy but informative McCartney discussion about the album. Paul has now made 5 great albums in a row starting with the wonderful \\"Flaming Pie\\". Any of these so called fans who are still questioning McCartney about his present day validity as an artist have apparently not heard these last several albums. Keep 'em coming Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's still got it!","review":"It's disappointing to read the negative reviews here regarding 'Memory Almost Full'. I suppose some folks will not be satisfied with anything less than another 'Band on the Run'. We are all changed through the years by life's experiences and it's perfectly understandable for a songwriter to express his or her own changing perspectives through song. The McCartney of 2007 is not the same as the McCartney of 1973; so what's wrong with that? I think this is a fine collection of songs and it continues to grow on me with every listen. The only negative thing for me is the inclusion of the song 'Gratitude'. It's a weak addition to an otherwise outstanding collection of songs.

Admittedly, this novel starts a little slow, but does establish an interesting storyline. I always enjoy the manner in which some Trek authors bring together different pieces of Trek canon (makes me feel very nerdish) and this book found some untouched material.In terms of a story, there isn't a strong or clear villian to Titan's hero relationship, and the most clear conflict in the final stretch was over far too quickly. I'm willing to forgive typical storylines because this book finally got Titan's exploration underway and moved beyond known space.If you skipped the first two novels, you should pick up Titan here. The first two only established a few pieces of the story arc, namely Vale's acceptance of First Officer (but if you read A Time for War, A Time For Peace, you'd probably already be under that impression), Tuvok and his wife joining Titan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"It was like sitting in front of your TV and watching it unfold before your very eyes....I love this series so far.

However, like most things online, the pictures always look better than the actual products. The green paint on the dragon is not as bright as pictured on Amazon, and there's so much less contrast between green shades.There are two versions of the dragon--one with green spine spikes and the other with beige spikes. I was hoping to get the green, but oh well.I also like the low price. One thing I'd to point out is the product arrived late. Seller didn't ship after I contacted them. Hopefully that doesn't happen too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Particular Dragon Owns!","review":"This is my very first dragon(aside from my girl who is from the Year of the Dragon, and yes she is like a dragon when she is mad!) from McFarlane's figures. First of many that is... Since I always have fascination for dragons ever since, and these toys are rare here in the Philippines. When I found a place to buy them, this is the first one I chose...Why? Cuz its unique... not your traditional dragon with wings and all, but as stated, a water dragon. It reminds me of such mysteries as Nessie and how frightening it would be if such water monsters are real(or still alive that is!)...Great design - that of a serpent, unlike the series 1 Water Dragon which is like a salamander, and Series 3 which is like a Sea Dragon(a type of Sea Horse)...

The humor works sometimes, but too often it serves to mark this book as the work of an amateur, one step up from a vanity project.The author appears to have done a great deal of original research, but explains none of it and cites no sources beyond a bibliography of older books and articles at the back.

I was hoping for a nice gentle, pure, chemical-free soap. It claims to be a glycerine soap, but Amazon chooses not to list the other ingredients, some of which are pretty nasty. However, they are listed on the side of the box. Like sodium meta bisulfite...this has been removed from most foods because of harmful side-effects so why would anyone want to absorb it thru the skin into their blood stream? Also contains propylene glycol which you will find in anti-freeze. This is good for the skin? The soap is made in India and I guess they have different standards for \\"gentle\\" soap.

The Repertoire release of this album contains a great selection of bonus tracks (and the only compact disc appearance of \\"Umbassa And The Dragon\\"). However, the tape-drag at the beginning of \\"Oh, Daddy\\" and the fact that the stereo tracks are more \\"centered\\" (not as hard left/right as the way they are found on the Laserlight and Rhino multi-disc sets) stop this from being the definitive CD version.I haven't heard the Sundazed version yet to see if these problems were corrected. All nit-picking aside, I hear Repertoire is out of business and any Turtles fan would be wise to pick this up while there's still a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turtles Concept Failed","review":"I assume this album was originally meant as some kind of parody of the \\"Battle of the Bands\\" concept. Maybe an excuse for covering different styles that would not be logical to touch on an ordinary album-concept.The idea may be good enough on its own; the big problem here is that very few of these songs are good enough to stand alone, which make them pretty uninteresting here 35 years later.Fortunately there are a few exceptoins. I somehow always found \\"Chief Kamanawanalea\\" pretty funny. And of course the McGuinn/Clark cover \\"You Showed Me\\" which has almost become a pop-classic.\\"Elenore\\" is a good pop song, nothing more. The same can be said about the bonus tracks \\"She\`s My Girl\\", another hit-single from this period, and \\"Sound Asleep\\"Except for the mono versions of \\"Elenore\\" and \\"You Showed Me\\" the rest of the bonus tracks are pretty poor.I would recommend a Tutles best of compilation instead of this tiresome original."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinker","review":"This cd just isn't like the others.

It is only then that you can truly enjoy a lot of the backstory that is alluded to in these three stories.

If you watch the show, you'll love these, but otherwise, you might get lost in the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!!!","review":"Charmed is a great TV show and I love the fact that each sister has their own unique story in this book! Although I love Charmed and I am a huge fan of all the sister's, my favorite one is Piper, played by Holly Marie Combs. To me Charmed is not just a show about how three sisters fight demons and warlocks everyday, I watch Charmed because in a very big way, they are just like us, and that is exactly what this book implies. Piper wants to have children and have a normal life with Leo, but with a sister's power's gone awry and with the fact that they are indeed the Charmed Ones, Piper feels like maybe having a baby might make things more difficult. Pheobe and Paige's stories were also very good, I enjoyed the whole book very much and I would definately say that if u love Charmed as much as I do, to go ahead and buy this book, it is well worth the money!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever!!!","review":"it has three stories one for each of them. imbolc yule and samhain. phoebe's was about one of their ancestors going into her body to save her husband. paige's is about one day when she went to a nightclub for an all-nighter and a demon drained her powers and everybody's soul. piper's was about her wanting to have a baby and paige's orbing goes wonky and she orbs everywhere like her middle school."},{"rating":"2","title":"seasons of the witch vol.1 charmed","review":"this book really is cool.

There are 19 Pueblos in New Mexico, and more in Arizona. Which Pueblo is this book about? There is great variation from one to the other. Most troubling, however, is McDermott's presentation of the kiva. Our kivas are not places of trial. They are more akin to churches and temples where cultural knowledge is passed on from one generation to the next. Finally, extended families are central to Pueblo culture, and there is no stain of illegitimacy conferred on those who don't know who their father is. This book should NOT be used to teach about Pueblo Indians. These errors are major ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents:\\"Sequencing of events\\"is crucial to comprehension.","review":"Arrow to the sun is a fascinating story of a boy's trials to find the answer to a question. A skill you can emphasize with your reader is to retell the series of trials. Questioning during the telling of a story also reinforces comprehenhsion: What was the boy in search of? Why did the boy become an arrow? What other story can you think of where a character must go through trials to prove him or herself? Who are the Pueblo people? This last question will lead to a study of other Native American cultures and folktales. Teachers: run with this! Use this story as a springboard to the study of the Anasazi,LaKota,Aztec,or Mayan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pueblo Indian tale.","review":"This children's book is based on an old Pueblo Indian tale about a boy who is son of the Sun and who wishes to meet his father.

The book won the 1975 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children. Children will love the story and the colors of the book have a great appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARROW TO THE SUN by Gerald McDermott","review":"Arrow to the Sun is a 1974 children's book by Gerald McDermott, adapted from Pueblo Indian myth. Here, the son of the Lord of the Sun strives to find and be accepted by his father.The story is straightforward, as these folktales go. On its own, it's largely unremarkable. But McDermott's illustrations are mind-blowing.Done in gouache and ink, the art features thick curves and right angles in a somewhat abstract style that's reminiscent of Pueblo art (it's also reminiscent of Atari 2600 graphics). McDermott's judiciously limited use of color heightens the art by drawing the focus to its texture and focusing on the mood of the story.Arrow to the Sun is a fine children's book with some of the most spectacular illustrations ever; it's certainly McDermott's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Deception Here","review":"When I saw the first review that was posted, I thought a little correction was in order. This is a reprint of a book that first appeared before Stephen King had even begun to publish. The title has nothing to do with Stephen King and there is no reason anyone should think it does. This is, in fact, one of the most innovative novels of its time, and we are lucky to have it back in print. In you are at all interested in complex narratives about musicians, this is the novel for you. Heck, I bet even Stephen King would enjoy this book.

The reviewer immediately before me, Mr. Sageev, has done an excellent job of describing the book and enumerating its many virtues. Read his review...then read the book. I will underline one point: this is NOT a dry economics text as you might fear; it is hugely entertaining and illuminates many aspects of American history. And \\"entertaining\\" need not mean \\"sophomoric.\\" The book is economic history made popular, but it is solidly grounded. In that regard it reminds one of Robert Heilbroner's books half a generation ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-buy for any amateur historian","review":"Exciting. Filled with stunning statistics meshed with lively interpretations and many surprises. This book is really a survey of American history, but from one perspective: the development of America's capital wealth and influence. What is fascinating is that this string of events that made the USA what is is were largely unrelated. Stuff just happened, although sometimes one need prompted an opportunity or solution. No grand plan drove the events, inventions, improvements, developments. They happened because of the relationship of need, opportunity, and free enterprise.This book should be in every historian's library. Do yourself a favor and get it. I thank Gordon for a wonderful book.Roger S. Peterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but shallow and biased","review":"Gordon is a fine writer and An Empire of Wealth is a not too demanding read. But it is also not too demanding in another way. Although interesting in parts and sweeping in scope, the book is basically a 419 page (I have the paperback) puff piece. Most red-blooded Americans will find Gordon's boosterism infectious (I did), but what is significant about the book is what it doesn't say and what Gordon chooses to leave out of history.Acoording to Gordon, all of the U.S.'s wealth was (1) essentially built by great men, (2) come by honestly (or through charmingly ingenious roguery), (3) a matter of simple addition, with little downside. Anyone even slightly familiar with the history of the industrial revolution, the westward expansion, the struggles of trade unions, Government corruption and favoritism, or monopoly practice will need to check their intellects at the door. This is history as big business cheerleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Fabulous","review":"\\"An Empire of Wealth : The Epic History of American Economic Power\\" by John Steel Gordon is an absolutely fabulous work of History and Literature. If this fast moving and exciting survey of the greatest nation the world has ever known was placed in the hands of American students it just may revive the study of History in this country. In an age of political correctness and horribly written text books John Steel Gordon proves that history is not boring, only that there are boring teachers and badly written history books.

If you can answer \\"yes\\" to these and countless other questions contrived to create the impression that J.P.

Many subtleties in the original writing were lost in this English translation, but the storylines have been well captured.All the stories are interesting, and from one chapter to another they slowly bring alive the character of Fujieda Baian. At the end of the book you begin to like Baian, and you wish that there were more.

The film has some fine moments of insights and sentiments, and it also contains moments that feel contrived and forced. High caliber actors did their usual fine job, but most of the characters are presented superficially.

South Park is an amazingly funny show. This goes for every season, including season 5. It is a smart show that has a message about society or issues our country is facing and proves many good points about the hipocracy that happens in the U.S. I love the US but some people in this country are idiots and Trey and Matt point that out in hilarious fashion. Every episode of this season is hilarious. I recommend this buy to anyone who loves to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great... but imperfect. It doesn't have Spanish subtitles.

SNAP! For a year and a half, I visited every junkyard within a 40 mile radius of my house and never found a replacement part that would work. The main thing that made it impossible to find was the straight down base that was unlike any American, European, or Korean antennas.When the top part of the broken antenna finally broke off, I had had enough and then had the epiphany of looking for it online and there it was! This antenna fit perfectly and I've recommended it to a couple friends who ended up in the same boat I was in.

You have to over inflate it to get it to bounce like a normal ball. but then it feels like a rock.- Has a real cheap/tinny pinging sound when you bounce the ball. rather than a nice deep bounce sound.i dont understand the 4 star rating for this ball. it is a virtually unusable ball for any type of serious or even casual player.P.s yes u can re-inflate the ball. it just a bit hard to take off the cover for the pin.I hated this ball so much i had to return it. feel sorry for the sorry sod who ended up buying it. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat in a few days","review":"I had purchased these balls for my dog to play with, and since we have had success with the \\"Never Flat\\" subset of spalding they seemed like a fantastic deal.

I thought it was a defect and called Amazon for a replacement. Sadly, the second one must have been it's twin because it went flat after a couple of days as well. Either this is a manufacturing defect or the ball has been sitting in Amazon's warehouse since the Civil War and lost air when I took delivery.The sounds isn't as bad as some reviewers have complained. Sure it's not quite the normal thunk but a little more hollow and echo sound. You're not going to go deaf and it certainly isn't going to improve your FG percentage.

I inflated it to 11 pounds, which feels about right.Overall, a good ball.There are some people who have commented that you can't inflate the ball. That is not true. The hole where you stick in the needle is covered. I used my fingernail lift up the the small black covering and then I used needle nose pliers to pull up the black covering. Then I inflated the ball and pushed the small black cover back over the hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best outdoor ball on the market!","review":"This is my second Neverflat outdoor ball and it is EASILY the best outdoor ball offered by anyone. i play out in my drive way and i have never had a ball that has lasted even half as long as these balls do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Flat Basketball Spalding","review":"I've had this basketball for over two years and have used it on multiple surfaces. I have left it out in the rain and sun and it still doesn't lose air. It is easy to grip and handle and can be used anywhere. Good quality and VERY durable, it has landed on rose bushes MANY of times and it never lost air. When I got this ball it cost $50, it is way cheaper now, great deal and a no brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Others are right about ping sound and un-inflatedness","review":"There are three undeniable comments in the reviews, which I've also experienced:1) A hollow, metallic ping every time it bounces. I'm playing here at a university indoor court, and every group of guys I play with has commented \\"hey, this ball sounds weird.\\" When the game ball is chosen, this is the first they toss away. The ping has the quality of the inflated \\"Thunderstix\\" that are distributed at MLB playoff games.2) A regulation full size ball should be inflated between 7.5 and 8.5 lbs PSI. This Never Flat ball seems to come on the low end of that. Despite only receiving it two weeks ago, guys at the gym have all said that it bounces flat. Although nobody wants to hear whiny comments about their new item, I have to agree on the lack of bounce. Over a year of this before I can inflate it??3) Having read others reviews, I now understand why I'm typing with small cuts on my left index and right middle fingerpads. It's on the rough side for bballs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good outdoor basketball","review":"The basketball is of quality construction and lives up to the Spaulding brand name. Only thing that I didn't expect is there is no way to pump air into the ball because the needle spot is sealed shut.

If they had a bigger budget, it could be made into a A list movie.The actors did a great job. The special effects where decent, if they had more money they could had did a even better job. The story line was good because they did show a beginning and explained why and how there are zombies. The endding was great because it ended in a way that it should have based on how it started and progressed. Then, I liked the end, end part were it tricked me and I wasn't expecting that. lolI really loved the girls in this movie.

If you are looking for something Pooh bear, happy and educational, go with the new My Friends Tigger and Pooh DVD. It came out at the beginning of March 08 and has 3 episodes (2 stories each).

It's too scary for my daughter, who will be 3 next month. Pooh and friends embark on a scary adventure to Skull, and along the way, they are caught in scary caves, fall from crumbling stone bridges over high gorges, the lot. I didn't realize how big an effect it had on my kids till my daughter, who never has been afraid of the dark, suddenly began refusing to sleep alone in her room because she was afraid of \\"shadows.\\" Come to find out, when Christopher Robin reappears at the end of the movie, you first see his big, scary shadow approaching.

That is too say it is cold, plodding, and witless. Pooh, tigger, rabbit, and piglet discover their inadequacies on a dark, angst ridden search for Christopher Robbin. He went to school, left a note, they misread it, etc. This leads to an overlong, anxiety producing adventure through dark, harsh terrain with terrfiying falls and the like. My two year old insists on watching it although it scares and disturbs her. It should be rated PG-13."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars (not 1 star) - don't buy it (sorry amazon)","review":"We have Piglets Big Movie which is an absolute favorite of my 2 year old. So being the sweet mother I am, I bought her this movie. It petrified her. It required constant narrative on my part to explain away the disturbing scenes - which predominate the film. It is dark and scarey, and slow, and depressing. The ending might be great but we only got through a half an hour of the movie - waiting for the tone to change.

The plot is predictable, and frankly, a bit dull. Many reviewers have said the movie scared their small children,and I can almost see why. While Pooh is exploring a cave,we hear ''spooky'' echoes and mysterious growling in the distance. Pooh falls from a tall height and into a murky swamp. And yet,during all this,the film has a cartoonish tone so none of this events are truly disturbing,however scary they may seem.

We rented this great-sounding movie to watch with our 4-yo daughter as she has wanted to watch a Pooh movie. While this movie starts out wonderfully with a great scene and song about friendship between Christopher Robin and Pooh, the bulk of the movie is spent with Pooh and friends looking for Christopher Robin. During this time, the 100-acre wood is made to seem like an extremely dark and scary place, which we were not expecting, and the tone seems to get progressively more gloomy. We told my daughter that it would get better, but it got to the point where a despondant Pooh sings a sad song and my daughter just started bawling, and asked \\"When are they going to get out of there???\\". The \\"good parts\\" of this movie at the beginning and end don't begin to balance the long sad part through the majority of the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed!","review":"This movie is terrible! It doesn't hold true to what winnie the pooh and his friends are all about. The movie is very dark and scary! I do not recommend any parent buying this movie for their child.

I purchased it to get a lay person's view of string theory but the book hardly refers to string theory at all. It covers a lot of material in the first 90% that I was already familiar with and did not need another book to explain it all to me again. I was expecting a book that concentrated on events over more recent years, and not another book going right back to the beginning of quantum theory. In my opinion, the title misrepresents the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, there are bad books better than this!","review":"Recently I have found myself a student of all things science with a tremendous appetite for the abstract.

As a laymen, each of the above books presented it's own challenges in appreciating and understanding the text. However, each was gratifying, fulfilling and difficult to put down until the last page was finished...Contrary to the good writing I've grown addicted, is John Gribbin's work in \\"The Search for SuperStrings, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything\\". I found the book to be like a visit to a planetarium that insists on keeping the lights on during the show, interesting facts but impossible to follow. Worse, I was insulted by the authors frequent references to his other works; this book felt like a cheap commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little information about strings","review":"This book was a disappointment, while there is some excellent background on the structure of matter and quantum mechanics, there is very little on the topic of superstrings. In reading through it, I got the impression that the segments on strings were an afterthought, something that needed to be mentioned but in no great detail.If you need some knowledge of quantum mechanics and the historical development of the understanding of matter, then this book is worth reading.

It just caused different feelings in both of us, in everyone else sitting in that theater. It is a delicate subject, and the sympathy Ramon provokes in you is beyond imagination... how you feel his pain, and his need. Maybe it is because I am Latin American and understood the language that the film appeared to me as 100% real, as something close to every human being.

The real message of the movie: Why the the people can not understand the pain and suffering of others. Sometimes the society that we believe perfect and tolerant is in the wrong path to grow. The perfomance of Javier Bardem is the best. For me, the movie deserves 8 accademy awards. I was waiting to see it here in amazon to buy it.

But it is a tender and nuanced treatment of the subject that raises the major questions and includes the major stakeholders--the legal system, a religious priest who is caricatured as moralistic and uncaring, friends, and a three-generation family that lives with and cares for the quadriplegic Ramon, who after a diving accident 26 years ago wants to end his life since, he insists, it is a life with no dignity. Ramon's brother adamantly objects: \\"nobody kills anyone in my house.\\" Others are not so sure. Four women in particular loom large in the film's plot. I will not spoil Ramon's final choice, which to the film's credit is not clear until the very end. The Sea Inside is based upon a true story in Spain, and was voted Best Foreign Film for 2004. In Spanish with English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"like other reviewers, I was crying hard throughout the entire movie. I don't think it matters if you agree with euthanasia or not, the movie goes much deeper than that. Each character is strong, and absolutely moving. The issues make you think about disabilities, death, life, poverty, love, friendship, family, etc... It's really a beautiful film, despite the final results. One of the best movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional in Every way","review":"I cannot say enough about this film. The subject speaks for itself, so I won't comment on that but what proves inspiring is that this is a total love story (not only between a man and a woman). The acting all around is exceptional, and Xavier Bardem, under the direction of Alejandro Amenabar, creates a very appealing Ramon Sampedro without oversentimentalizing a subject which could have otherwise been sensationalized. Combine this with a thoughtful, interesting, philosophical dialogue, that leaves the viewer mentally revisiting the film long after its conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Corolla","review":"If you were to use this for a Toyota Corolla, you'd be disappointed. Certainly not made for it. The wiring on the corolla is so very different when compared to this one. Probably works well with other cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is NOT what you get","review":"Reviewed this product once but someone must not have liked my comment. Yes, the socks are adorable. I bought them for my son and daughter-in-law's baby shower. My son is a true sports nut and coaches high school soccer. However, when I received the box, it contained 2 pair of tennis socks and NO soccer socks (the main reason I purchased them).

Download DVD Shrink, it's free. Use Nero Recode or any other converting software to convert it to mpeg. Many free programs to do this too. Then download PSP Video 9, also free. This will shrink it down and put it right where it needs to be on your PSP. I've ripped hundreds of my DVD's this way. Works like a charm. I use an older version of PSP Video 9 as I don't like their newer version as much. Find version 1.74."},{"rating":"1","title":"carp","review":"worked only a few times.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!I bought from target, so I thought it was a real program that actually worked, but I was sorely wrong.Hear that sound? 30 bucks down the toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear descriptions","review":"a clearly written overview that goes nicely with the works of Alan Watts.

The mask conforms and the seals tightly to my face without pinching, and I can wear my safety glasses. For the most part I have been using it during the remodeling of my basement. It is perfect for filtering out fiberglass and plaster dust. I have come out of a room looking like a snowman without any dust getting into my lungs. The mask is easy to clean and filter changes are simple to make and filters don't cost much. This is great protect against all nuisance dust and I should have purchase this mask long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also good for cleaning out your garage","review":"The mask fits my face perfectly. It's comfortable and easy to ware for long periods of time. You can breathe normally and the vents keep it from getting hot or muggy inside the mask.The straps are adjustable and hold firm. I don't think they'll stretch out any time soon.One thing I didn't like was that I didn't see any information on the packaging about how to order replacement filters... That could just be me though. Lucky for us Amazon has them.AO Safety Replacement Filters for Woodworker's Respirator, 4-Pack #95191"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"Bought this at a good price to use while cutting laminate flooring. Worked great for that. Also, Used it while grinding down some concrete. Again, worked great. Then used while mowing as it was very dry and dusty, with a lot of pollen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I purchased this a couple of months ago and have had a chance to use it several times. The first time I put it on I was a little apprehensive about the way it fit, but I did get used to the fit pretty quickly. It is a little strange to have the bottom sitting on your chin and not under it, but the mask seals fine for me. I would guess that if you have a long face, the mask may not work, but it fits my face fine. If fact- I don't even notice how it fits anymore.It seals, keeps the dust out and keeps my safety glasses from fogging up. The only complaint (and it's minor) I have is that I've has some condensation issues, but that's probably due to the cold temps in the garage when I'm working. Besides- a damp mask is much better than brown lung.I'll never go back to the safety masks again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"It works well and is as comfortable as a mask can be. I didn't give it 5 stars because I do get a little air coming in around my nose sometimes. I've tried adjusting it but it still happens. Who knows, maybe it is just my nose. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"This respirator arrived promptly and I was eager to try it out. Like most woodworkers, I have used the cheap disposable face respirators for years with limited success; most of the disappointment coming from the fit and the amount of air leakage along with my glasses fogging up. As advertised, your safety glasses will not fog up and the fit, even with my moustache, is good and efficient. The fit takes a while to settle on, but once the correct combination is found you will be pleased with the results...buy the replacement filters at the same time so you won't run out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great for air born wood dust","review":"My main motivation for purchasing this respirator was safety. However, I've noticed in the past year that after working with cedar I will suffer an allergy attack. Since wearing this respirator out in my shop during the completion of my cedar project, I have not suffered a woodworking allergy attack.For me it is very comfortable and works quite well as I've noted. Follow the directions that come with it. They describe how to ensure a tight seal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd Buy it Again","review":"I've been using this respirator in my hobbyist woodshop for several months, and have been very pleased with the fit, comfort, airflow, and effectiveness. I find that I'll wear it for a dusty operation (such as hand-sanding with no dust collection), then forget to take it off as I do other things around the shop. It's that comfortable to me. When you change the filter cartridge -- an economical process -- you'll be amazed at the gunk you've kept out of your lungs. Of course no rubber mask can be built that will fit EVERY face out there, but based on the feedback I've seen, it looks like it fits most folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good. Can wear it a long time comfortably.","review":"I was looking for a respirator that did not fog my safety glasses, was not bulky, and reasonably priced. The side vents work for keeping my glasses from fogging very well.The mouthpiece does feel a little small, but seems to seal and work.Update 11/2008 : Been using this for some time now. This has become my defacto respirator. It is comfortable to wear so I wear it without hesitation. The filters are easy to find and easy to swap out."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small aound mouth aera.....","review":"I think the concept of this woodworkers respirator is great but unless your a very small person or a child these will not work. I am 5'11 and have an average size head. When these are properly installed the bottom part of my mouth is exposed and does not fit properly. When it is fitted around my mouth, it does not fit right around my nose. The rubber mask needs to be a little larger to conform around the areas it needs to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly reasonable product","review":"A reasonable wood dust filter for the price. A little restrictive in moving air in and out but bareable. Fits over my big nose and seals well enough to avoid fogging my safety glasses. Which is my original peeve with paper filter masks - always fogging my safety glasses especially in either hot or cold weather. In the end a good dust collection system is the solution but this is a reasonable $15 fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for allergy sufferers","review":"This is a great product. My husband uses it for yard work and it has helped with his allergies."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made, small, not worth the price","review":"the mask is fairly small, appears to be cheaply made especially the rubber strap - this strap will not stand the test of time. had i actually seen it in the hardware store i never would have bought, particularly at the near to $15 price. To me, the price/value would be more apt in the $8 range. It certainly does not look like the pic on amazon - the pic makes it appear larger than it is, the surface area of the filter hence will be limited in it's ability to handle larger volumnes of air over time- but then they want you to buy replacement filters faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product - almost perfect","review":"easy to wear, small, and light, and is not a burden to put on and take off- which makes all the difference. once you put it on, it works great, easy to breath through, and you hardly even notice that you've got protection - but you DO. ever since I started using it I stopped having wooddust taste and small all day long which is a tremendous hazard. I highly recommend this product.The only thing that could have been better is if it was slightly larger..not by much. I'm 5'11\\" and have a normal head size, and when I position the respirator on my nose, it covers my mouth, but it doesnt cup my chin... so it just feels a bit odd - still does the job, so I'm happy about that, but it would have been nice if it was a bit longer to fit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposeable mask","review":"The main complaint I have about the mask is it's fit. Initially - it felt a little uncomfortable - but I got used to it where it didn't bother me to wear the mask.I was really excited to find an economical dust mask that I could replace filters and not spend too much money on the filters. I still have 2 packages of replacement filters that I'll probably never use - after replacing the filter once - the mask no longer seals around my face.I think they could fix the problem if they had a dual point attachment connecting the strap to the mask. But it attaches at one point like a pair of swimming goggles so there's not alot of flexibility to adjust the fit.My conclusion is you get what you pay for - and I'm currently looking for another alternative to replace this respirator. It worked well initially - when I could get a good seal around my face.Jake"},{"rating":"2","title":"good mask","review":"This mask works very well to cover my mouth and nose. It has a great seal. The only thing I wish.....and I know it takes a more expensive mask to do this......is that it was easier to breathe in and out with.EDIT: I have contacted AO Safety by email about replacing the baffels in the mask that have worn out, and they have not contacted me back. I have instead gone with a 3M mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Dust Respirator","review":"This is a great product that, apparently, is no longer supported by AO Safety/AeAro/3M.

Beats the disposables hands down. This respirator has never fogged my glasses. Only cons that prevents a five star are:1. The bridge of my nose gets a little sore after wearing for a lengthy time (2+ hours)2. It takes a little time to get used to breathing through this device, especially if the filter is getting filled up.Other than those two details, love this respirator!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carbone nails it!","review":"Carbone takes the role of the enterprise architect and lays out a step-by-step approach for success.

No doubt this is the only book that I have been inspired to throw in my fireplace. The way she wrote these characters, it seems that Bushnell is a misogynist: 1) is a whore, 2) is a despiteful bitch 3) is crazy, 4) is boring and unoriginal. And most of the characters are so underdeveloped, like the Princess - supposedly she turned crazy and hooked on prescription drugs after her in-law offered her a Xanax. Pa-lease. If you are looking for a good read, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"It's difficult to rate this book.

If you read for entertainment, take a pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it negative stars","review":"What a waste of time. I only kept reading it because I thought something redeeming was going to happen. The characters were not at all likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"It seems to me the only reason this book was published was to tout the name of Candace Bushnell, who inspired the popular television series, Sex and the City. But if you read it (and Sex and the City) you will learn that the writing is no where near as good as the writing on the television show. The trampy characters in Four Blondes are boring and cliché and give the reader no reason to like them.Chick lit is fun when it's well written and the characters have some redeeming qualities. This is just a weak attempt to entertain by exposing four bimbos with a repulsive lifestyle.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Trick Pony","review":"I am a huge fan of HBO's SEX AND THE CITY so I was excited to see what Ms. Bushnell would have to offer in this her latest book. All I can say is the FOUR BLONDES is desperately in need of a brunette, a redhead, or SOME form of diversity.The characters in the book (four shades of blonde) are completely flat and uninteresting. From the ditzy model to the career girl writer to the hopeless social climber, Bushnell's attepts at satire and humor are weak and dated.Don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes and vacations as much as the next girl but somehow the pursuits of these women come across as so superficial or mind-numbingly uninteresting that I didn't care one way or the other about the outcome.I'm an African American woman so I don't need to identify with these women but I would like to be ENTERTAINED! This just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did I Ever Finish This Book","review":"I rarely put down a book once I have started it, and my reputation is intact with 4 Blondes, but how I ever got through it, I'll never know. The first segment, Nice N'Easy got me hooked, despite the trashy sex element (no, I'm not a prude, but this was a little over the top). The subsequent three segments went downhill, until I started skipping pages. Based on this reading experience, I will not be looking for Bushnell's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, boring and a waste of money!","review":"I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so poorly written. I am a \\"Sex and the City\\" addict, and was very excited to read \\"4 Blondes\\". I can't tell you how disappointed I was to discover how truly awful this book was: Little or no story, horrible, under-developed characters, spelling mistakes, continuity errors (spelling the name of a town one way, then a different way, a few sentences down). I bought the hardcover, and boy, am I sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly terrible","review":"This is a book for stupid, vapid twenty-something females. There was no character development; there was simply a pile of drivel about how sad the lives of the rich, famous, powerful, beautiful et. al. are. A sad and silly novel. Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. Ms. Bushnell could not even properly spell the name of an infamous Hampton. (this is a detail she should certainly be able to master.) Just awful. Save yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do people like this really exist?","review":"I would have given this a 1/2 star if I could've. I, too, picked up this book because I loved \\"Sex & the City\\", but what a disappointment. These 4 blondes are the most shallow of shallow from the ditzy former model whose claim is to find boyfriends for the summer based on what house they are renting in the Hamptons. The second is the married power wife, who has an affair with a movie star that her husband roomed with in college, not realizing that her husband wants her sister. The 3rd is a real princess who is on a paranoid rant due to drug usage and the 4th, I have no idea, because I didn't finish this book! Save your money!Thanks for reading!**Pandora"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and The City Lite","review":"Candace Bushnell still seems to have a great knack for taking a modern day satirical look at dating and relationships. Some of the critics of Four Blondes seem to be taking the book too seriously. This book is suppose to be fun. I will caution, however, that it is not up to the standards of Sex and The City. While Sex and The City was a fun and witty book, it also had some interesting and enlightening insights into the different ways men and women view sex and relationships. (For those interested in books of that type, I would also highly recommend Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf and Fried Calamari, two very original well written and funny books about modern relationships) But if you're in the mood for a lighthearted witty read, I recommend Four Blondes. If we could only get Ms. Bushnell to team up with Aaron Spelling, they could create a terrific Fox TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precursor to a suicide note","review":"If you're already in a low frame of mind, you'd be doing yourself a favor to avoid this senseless, dull and depressing book before you do harm to yourself.This really is a horrible book. The four stories (well, okay, I'm not a liar. I could only bring myself to read three of them) are so bleak, so pointless and just so...so...NOT good.The character development of each blonde are stereotypical, to say the very least. But the plot lines. Heaven spare me. It's not that the stories are unoriginal (which they are.) It's not that they're uninterestingly written (which they are.) It's just the dogged, relentless plowing through each dull, degrading life that begins to wear on the reader (which I am). There are no plot turns. There are no twists. Each novella is a total flat line.Which brings me back to the title and first line of my review. If you're already feeling pretty down, stay clear of this one. What was Candace's editor thinking? What was Candace thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Sex and the City","review":"While I enjoyed the television series SATC and have all seasons of DVDs, I thought I was looking for a great easy summer read. The back of the book and the reviews inside the front cover looked promising and interesting. This book consists of four stories, each one about a different blonde in NYC. This book really had nothing to do with living in NYC and I was very disappointed in the plot lines. The stories didn't go anywhere. The book seemed to go downhill from the first story about Janey. I am getting ready to start the fourth book, but I am afraid of how horrible it will be if the other three were so bad. Do not recommend reading this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - it's not like Sex and the City","review":"I am addicted to the show Sex and the City so I naturally thought I'd like the book it was based on. Wrong!! This book is awful. While the show has endearing characters that you love despite their flaws the characters in this book are all flaws and you feel nothing for them. If you are going to have meaningless sex stories then it should atleast have good sex scenes but this book didn't even have that. Just annoying self absorbed characters. I couldn't even finish the book all the stories and I NEVER put a book down unfinished.

I'm highly disappointed--I loved some of her other work but this one is truly horrible. Don't bother. I'd have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option.

Someone else said the characters are unlikable, and they are, but they're also hopelessly dull. Bushnell intersperses passages of the most sophomoric dialogue imaginable with sudden descriptions of unconventional sex acts, perhaps in a vain attempt to wake the reader up. At the end of the second story -- Winnie and her husband -- I wanted to throw the thing against the wall in frustration. I settled for throwing it in the trash.I didn't even pay for \\"Four Blondes\\" -- it came bundled with some magazine or other. But I think someone should pay _me_ for the hours I wasted thinking it couldn't stay this bad, that it was going to get better. Pheh. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck. Don't waste your time.","review":"Don't make the same mistake I made and get sucked in by the Bushnell name. If you are looking to get your Sex In the City fix with this book, don't bother. The first character introduced was fun but I struggled to get through her story. As the book went on, I actually felt cheated by the lame-o storylines and going-nowhere plots. Thank God I got it from the library and didn't have to shell out $$ for this one.Just be patient and wait for the new season to start on HBO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this was awful!","review":"Oh, my! This was one of the worst books I have read. It was shallow and smarmy! I finished the book, but really am not aware how that could have happened. There has to be some redeeming factor with the women in the book, but it is difficult to surmise from reading the book. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are there really people like this??","review":"I feel like Bushnell is making fun of people she knows via characters in this book. There are two types of characters- the sex addicts or the people that think sex is horrible. Regardless, all of their lives revolve around sex, either loving it or hating it. I can't imagine a world where these people exist. It is depressing to read about people with such meaningless lives. Yet, it is insightful to see how people hit rock bottom, even if they are rich and beautiful or seem to have it all. A bit of a social commentary but I'm not sure if people in the \\"fast lane\\" do really live like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not From New York","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read and my book club agrees. I'm a huge fan of the show \\"Sex and the City\\" so I don't think you need to be from New York to appreciate New Yorkers, but how anyone could appreciate the characters in this book is beyond me. I didn't make it to the end of the third story or on to the forth because I just couldn't stomach any more of the self-absorbed, money-crazy insanity. If you like to be able to find something about which to empathize in the characters you read about, then I doubt this book is for you. Unless you're one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID and SHALLOW","review":"I wouldn't recoomend this book to anyone.

Boy, was I wrong. The four blondes are self-obsessed, egotistical, and conceited. The four stories had nothing to do with each other (well, I haven't read the last 5 pages it's been so boring).

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think all blondes are like these blondes..","review":"Ok.... So I really really really wanted to enjoy this book. As a blonde myself, I thought it would be a fun book, sort of like a combination of Sex and the City and Legally Blonde. I thought perhaps it would place blondes in an important position where they prove everyone, including themselves, wrong about some sort of stereotype. Perhaps it was because I had these expectations that I was seriously let down by the book. These blondes are not heroines... they don't even come close. I honeslty could have cared less about these four girls, none of them are relatable (is that a word??) at all. Perhaps Candace Bushnell does normally write for newspapers... but has she never read a novel in her life?? Where's the intrigue, the importance, the plot?? Anyhow, if its an interesting heroine you're after, buy Bridget Jones, not 4 Blondes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Being a fan of the TV show Sex and the City, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was sadly disappointed by the characters, which were shallow and cold. You don't establish a connection with them and their troubles seem rather unimportant. You just don't care what happens to them. I found the writing style unreadable in the second story due to the authors constant use of parentheses to add information to the text.

While I didn't expect a happy ending for each woman, I at least thought there would be a positive message. Instead it was wrought with the vanity of 4 women who can't seem to deal with the lives they made for themselves.

Besides the incessant whining, it seems that all rich people in the Hamptons want to do is snort cocaine and think about butt sex. No joke.

In her popular series, Sex and the City, even the little red-headed lawyer had her fan club.

The book is a series of 4 different stories of New York Women. The first story wasn't that bad. But the second story was a total waste of time reading. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. I did not like the style of how that story was written either. It was just weird.

I guess you could call Bushnell a one hit wonder. This book gives you some in depth character depictions of people who aren't really that deep. It rambles, really doesn't have a good writing structure. Every other sentence is in parenthesis. The characters are so shallow and unreal that it's nearly impossible to get through.

The characters in these stories are shallow and stale caricatures of real women. They are selfish and empty, and wander through Bushnell's weak storylines without any real purpose or ultimate goal. The language Bushnell uses is too crude for my taste, and really paints a bleak portrait of life in general. Honestly, I was a little depressed after reading this book and had to wonder how anyone could go through life like these four women and the various men that inhabit their worlds.

It's a style, and Bushnell has got it down pat. Three of the stories are readable in a \\"thank God that's not me\\" kind of way. The fourth, about a married writer, is sort of sad-- it almost seems as if Bushnell is jabbing back at all the \\"serious journalists\\" who think she's some fluffy little slut. In the autobiographical final story, I couldn't help but wonder (as I often did with her NY Observer columns): \\"If you know better-- and you obviously do-- why do you keep hanging out with all these pathetic status-obsessed losers?\\" While it's sometimes a fun read, this book does not give us the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible Book!","review":"I can't believe I wasted my money and time reading this piece of crap called literature.

So, I purchased this book hoping for some feminine insight. Not only was I disappointed in this book, but wasted a good seven bucks I could have spent on an iced mocha latte. The characters are well developed, but the stories themselves lack any content but trash. Drug use, and sex are both represented, but it was of the raunchy type with no real substance. The most disappointing aspect of these stories are the endings, which are abrupt and not well developed. It seems like not much thought went into the endings...they just end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST book I have EVER read.","review":"I am so absolutely disappointed in Candace Bushnell's book. I had purchased it at the last minute before I boarded a plane on a business trip and what a waste of [money]. The characters are self-centered and unrelatable to. There is also never resolution to the situations ( if you can call them that) the characters face. The book outline leads you to believe that they resolve the situation that they are in, but it never happens. Their major concerns in life are still sleeping around for a summer house, and going back to cheating/miserable husbands and taking drugs. The characters never develop, and the women are portrayed kind of like Allie McBeal, needy and doing anything they can to get attention while destroying the people and relationships around them. All in all, I would rather stick with the the television show. I won't even pass it on to any of my friends - this is one for the circular files and a match."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this author get a book contract?","review":"This book is a stupid waste of your time. I'm glad I didn't buy it and took it out from the library instead.The characters are, for the most part, insipid and superficial. The only story I was at all interested was Highlights for Adults, but it stopped abruptly before the plot could further develop.I don't know why she presented four different stories without intertwining them somehow--what's the point?Bushnell is neither a talented nor interesting writer. There is nothing special about her style or her characters. I read somewhere that Bushnell is writing a book about the obnoxious character Janey Wilcox from 4 Blondes. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Pathetic Blondes...","review":"Knowing of Candace Bushnell only through the HBO version of Sex and the City, I had high expectations for this book. To say the very least, my expectations were not met. The four women featured in the book were completely unlikeable and ridiculous. Their shared trait, aside from being blonde, is that they are willing to prostitute themselves in order to improve their image. The stories seemed to be incomplete, yet I was not left wanting more -- I was just glad that I was one story closer to the end. The book was depressing rather than witty and amusing as I had expected. I can only imagine that the publication of this book was the result of having a successful television series with which to associate the author. Don't be fooled as I was -- this is no \\"Sex and the City.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sex and The City","review":"4 Blondes is a tale of - go figure - 4 blonde woman. Each story goes into some sort of detail about their crazed lives. Since four short stories were put together, none of them are really complete. Each character is depicted in a similar manner, which makes you forget which story you are in. The stories weren't funny, witty or ever too compelling. The author really missed on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, quick read","review":"This book is not exactly a brilliant literary work, and I found some parts of it to be rather strange. But if you are looking for a quick, light read then I would recommend it. It took me one plane ride to finish it because of Bushnell's simple writing style. There are many parallel's to her show, \\"Sex and the City,\\" which added further entertainment. Overall, I finished this book feeling like I should dye my hair blonde, begin a modeling career, and sleep with numerous wealthy men."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book that i have ever read","review":"Well, being a big fan of the HBO show, Sex in the City, I was very excited to read Candace Bushnell's new book 4 Blondes. However, after reading her latest creation, I was extremely disappointed. Not only were the characters extradorinarily superficial but also they were shallow and annoying. This kind of book belongs in the recycling bin. Don't waste your money or your time with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"atleast the title wasn't misleading","review":"It is apperant from the very first page that this book is a pitiful excuse to talk about sex. The only reason I continued to read this mindless drivel was to discover the point of the story to justify the authors reputability, but it never came. The story was empty, with absolutley no meaning behind the words that were written, and the writing style was inconsistent with the change of each chapter. This book is definatley not worth the money or the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN - An utter bore","review":"If I could give this book negative stars I would.

I kept thinking it was going to get better as I've read several of Ms Bushnell's book previously. Yuck what a disappointing mess. It appears as if she wrote the book only to meet an editors deadline without a thought or plan. Just words. I wish I'd saved my $9.99. Trust me don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations 4 Blondes....","review":"...You are the FIRST \\"book\\" I never finished. Thank goodness I never paid a dime for this mess, it is essentially awful. The characters in this book are scum of the earth whores, and the men are almost just as horrible. After Highlights I stopped reading, I couldn't put my brain through any more torture.How is it that an author who created the hillarious SATC created such a mind dulling, putrid mess? Was she that desperate for money? If so, she obviously didn't reach her goal with this crap.

I read this book and wanted to put it in the grill during the summer so it would not be inflicted on anyone else. A friend was horrified so I said here, you read it.

It would be totally forgettable if it were not so horrifyingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful","review":"I am a huge fan of Sex and the City, so I started with high expectations. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst books I read in my life. Each story was bland, and there was no real conclusion at the end of each story. When I finished the book I was wishing I spent my time reading something else. These women were neurotic, paranoid, and completely self-absorbed. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy, not even fun summer read.","review":"Trashy is the best descriptive word I can use for this book. The book is about four women in New York City. They do not intermingle, nor do I think they even know each other, and each woman gets her own section (like a short story). The characters are very unlikeable, whether it was because they were narcissistic, paranoid, or hypocritical.I know this is just chick lit, but it is poorly written chick lit. A character should be someone we are interested in, whether we care about them or hate them, we WANT to know what will happen to them. Maybe it's even someone we relate to. Either way, we have a vested interest. I had none of that with this book. There were also times that I became frustrated with Bushnell's writing style. The conversations were often clunky or awkward.I do not recommend this book, not even for a fun summer read at the beach. There are many more novels out there that can give you simple enjoyment, but without being trashy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Bought this book at Goodwill and quickly realized that the $2 I paid for it was too much.

The writing is sophomoric: you know you are reading a bad book when 99% of the book is dialogue, and mindless dialogue at that. The storyline is boring. You'd get a better read from \\"Teen Beat\\" magazine. The characters are pathetic.

I needed a light, easy read this summer, and I found it. No, this isn't a thought-provoking, insightful look into human character. If Bushnell's characters lack depth, it's because the characters themselves won't allow themselves depth. They live in superficiality, and I find them to be believable characters. I enjoyed this book. When life settles down and I'm ready for something heavier, I'll turn to Irving, Anne Tyler and those ilk. Four Blondes is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I am an avid reader and a fan of Sex and the City but this book was a big disappointment.

What a disappointment! These are the worst characters ever written. I've read that Ms. Bushnell writes from her own experiences. If this is true I feel very sorry for her. What a shallow, useless life the women characters lead. These four blondes give women everywhere a bad name. I enjoy a good, fun trashy novel once in a while. If this is what you are looking for look elsewhere.

While these women are glamorous and gorgeous, their stories sounded like things I hear from my friends. The characters' insecurities and disappointments will ring true to anyone who reads this. Perhaps more important is that these ladies are FUNNY -- and that will have you flipping pages well into the night...."},{"rating":"1","title":"For once T.V. is better than a book!","review":"As a faithful watcher of Sex and the City I really thought I was in for a treat to read Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes. But I soon learned I should stick to watching HBO reproduce her idea.The books is actually four short novellas about young, wealthy, beautiful and glamourous women and their sex lives. And little else. The author leaves each of the four stories unfinished with loose ends. There was little substance to each story and then an arubt, but certainly welcome from the boredom of reading it, botchy ending.If you have heard of Candace Bushnell and are thinking of giving her books a go, I would definitely suggest skipping the author and going straight to your television set and watching an episode of Sex and the City."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking ....","review":"This is defnintely not worth the time reading.

Seldom does a book disappoint to the level that this one does. It actually offends!The only surprize is the odd good Amazon review slipped in amongst the overwhelming tide of bad ones. The ones that give it four stars and enthuse about it's fabulousness. Excuse me? Are we even reading the same book???I repeat: Four Blondes is a total stinker.

While \\"Sex and the City\\" jumped from character to character, this book provides four Chapters each centering around a different character, painfully similiar to \\"Valley of the Dolls\\". Each chapter is fun to read, but I was somewhat dissapointed with the last one. It didn't quite seem to \\"fit\\" with the rest of the book. It was very vague and much shorter then the previous 3. I liked this book for its sharp wit and typical New York sarcasm. In short, if you enjoyed \\"sex and the city\\", I reccomend this book for a fun summer read, but don't expect anything too different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Blondes","review":"This has got to be the most utterly boring book I have ever read.

In fact, Janey in the first one was the only character that held my interest.Candace Bushnell failed to get the reader to care for any of the characters in the remaining three stories and I can only say that I am glad I checked the book out of the library and didn't waste my money on this book.

The characters lack any depth whatsoever, and don't even actually do anything interesting except sit around all day complaining, and waiting for something magical to happen.

There are four sections in the book, each dealing with one of the four characters who never actually meet!

Was I wrong. Don't get me wrong. I like mindless entertaining books too, but this is a mindless one without any laughs, any direction, and the stories drag on, for what it seems like forever. To say this book was bearable is being generous.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic Pull","review":"In my busy life a book has to have a magnetic pull to reel me in and keep me hooked. This novel allowed me the luxury of escaping my own life to live vicariously through these 4 women. Although none of the characters seemed to have had any values nor did I identify with any of them beyond my affinity for the finer things in life, they held my interest. Each one of these women in a different time or place could have been a Jane Eyre or an Emma-women who exploited their looks and charm to get what they wanted. I loved every minute of this novel because these characters did things I only wish I had the brazeness to try. For all those naysayers, learn to live a little.

The only thing that interested me about her was why she was as money-hungry as she was and why she wasn't looking for love. The rest of the stories are way below my expectations as compared to Sex in the City. The story of the journalists was uninteresting and not very plausible.

There was absolutely no depth to the writing - and I'm not referring to the morality of the characters (although they're shallow as well). I couldn't lose myself in this book, and trust me, I can read anything. The details that give a story substance and make it come alive were missing. If you're desperate, I suppose you can try it, but don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do such vacuous people really exist?","review":"The other reviewers seem to have covered it: shallow, spoiled characters living in some alternate universe that may or may not exist in elite New York. I had to make a correction: \\"Winnie\\" is said to be a graduate of Smith College (ahem, the women's college) but then a few pages later she knew a male doctor because \\"they went to college together\\". [In Sex and the City, Charlotte is said to have gone to Smith then later meets with her \\"sorority sisters from college\\". There are no sororities at Smith.]. As a Smith grad, I don't mind Bushnell using it to exemplify something stereotypical, but how hard is it to find an editor who knows that Smith is a women's college?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so glad I did not pay for this book.","review":"I was stunningly disappointed by this book. I have been a Candace Bushnell fan for many years and expected better out of her.It has been a long time since I've read about such shallow, self-absorbed characters. It was not at all fun to read about these people and I found myself wishing they'd put themselves out of their misery.Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"As a loyal fan to the fabulous Sex and the City comedy, I was looking forward to an entertaining tale of four women and their interesting lives, instead I got four cynical, overly exagerated stories. Rather than four women dealing with the successes and failures of their lives, I found four women caught up in their materialistic ways, only to be accentuated by sex, drugs, and their inability to contribute to society. The only remotely sane character was in the final story, but at that point I was too annoyed to care. The only reason I finished the book was in hopes of finding some redeaming factor, however, none was found...."},{"rating":"1","title":"God help these women!!","review":"This sort of New-York-Women-on-the-prowl-for-richer-men thing has been done before &, to my mind, a bit better, by Rona Jaffe in her novels from the 50s & 60s. Funny how the more things change, the more they remain the same - particularly when it comes to those who aspire to pointless, trendy, showy wealth. Still, these stories are mostly light fun reads - with characters you love to hate. I particularly enjoyed the marriage between the 2 soulless Yuppies, but felt disturbed by the ongoing theme throughout the book...do women like this really exist in any sort of numbers? Bushnell's got a strong, on-target, witty voice for this sort of character, but I didn't really, in the end, want to spend THIS much time with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I read Sex and the City and Four Blondes back-to-back. I loved the clear voice in Sex and the City, and looked forward to hearing it again in the next book; but that was voice was missing in Four Blondes. I was bored and kept asking myself why I kept reading. The disjointed stories were just Sex and the City \\"Lite.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the walk from the shelves to the register","review":"Like many of my girlfriends, I was really looking forward to reading this. I'm sorry to say that Bushnell's writing could easily be outdone by a fifteen year old high school student. She manages to make mildly intriguing characters downright dull. Don't get me wrong, I knew in advance that the novel would not bring enlightenment or have any point at all, for that matter. However, I think its fun to step into a world of people so different from oneself. I loved The Secret Diary of Bridget Jones, and there was really no point to that either. I thought this book was insulting to female readers and writers alike. That a writer as unskilled as Busnell can be a bestseller, speaks poorly of the standards which many women expect from literary works. Material like this is so easy to come up with, you'd think that an author should at least have to write it well to sell a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read","review":"I have read a lot of bad books in my time but this book takes the cake. Giving it 1 star is giving it more credit then it deserves. I can't believe this book every got published. The writing is horrific and there is no real sense of plot. I thought with all the fame of the TV series spun from her first novel (which I wont even touch after reading this) one would think she has some talent...I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Sex and the City DO NOT read this","review":"I was very disappointed with this book...I was so excited to read it, but as I turned the pages it got worse....The stories had no ending to the sad tales of these women....There was absolutely no humor in the lines and above all it was a far cry from the television show...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not titled \\"Sex and the City\\"","review":"This book does not have the same humor as \\"Sex in the City\\" does. If you're looking for the same funny, lighthearted comedy that takes place on that HBO show, do not buy this book. That said, I personally think this book is hilarious. It's a very, very dark comedy - a great satire of New York \\"privledged\\" life. It's one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lika a car wreck.......","review":"Like a car wreck I couldn't tear my eyes from the horrificness of this book. I thought it would be a great vacation read: light, funny, and easy entertainment for a week of lounging around. But it wasn't. Although it was darker than I expected, that wasn't what bothered me. What did bother me was the fact that I loathed every single character in the book. Now don't get me wrong, you need a villian in a good story. But this book had too many; there wasn't a single character that I had empathy for, or felt connected to. Disclaimer: I did only read the first story. After starting the second, I just couldn't take any more of the priviledged, self-loathing, superficial, and self-righteous a-holes that ran rampant in this book. Now again, don't get me wrong, I love to hate a wicked villian or two. But only when they're a supporting character to the heroine, not when the villian is the main charchter herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"As an avid Sex and The City fan, I figured I would love this book by Candace Bushnell, who wrote SATC and pretty much created the series. How wrong I was.First of all, this is more like a collection of short stories (\\"vignettes\\") than a book. And each short story is more trite and ridiculous than the last. For instance, the first one is about a party girl who sleeps random men to try to snare a summer house in the Hamptons. The barrage of curse words and overly explicit sexual descriptions totally turned me off; they weren't for emphasis, they were for content.These stories weren't the least bit entertaining, and right as soon as you got a tiny bit interested in someone's life, their chapter would end, and you would get a new spoiled socialite (and the total rundown on her outfit). Useless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's True:Terribly Disappointing, Unimaginative, Untalented!","review":"When I received this book as a birthday gift, I was THRILLED, and three hours later, thoroughly disappointed upon its completion. What a horribly dismal follow-up to the spunky, upbeat nature of \\"Sex and the City\\" -- a book and TV series that have spawned more than a slight cult following! The four novellas can't even be regarded as \\"artsy\\" or \\"different\\"-- the style in which they are written, leaving you with four slight glimpses into women's lives do not endear the characters to you, nor do they inspire goodwill. A terribly sad commentary on women and the dating world in general-- better luck next time, Bushnell."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"As much as I love Bushnell's Sex and the City, I found Four Blondes to be extremely superficial and shallow. I don't want to read about people that I cannot ever relate to. I want to encounter experiences by people who show morale fiber. The seperate stories of four woman and their plights, do however, prove that money doesn't necessarily make you happy, but it sure can buy you a lot of sex, drugs, and alcohol. Pass on this one unless you are filthy rich, happy with your life and would like a good laugh at those who can't handle their social status."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"I can only say that I've never experienced a book as bad as the movie \\"A Night at the Roxbury\\" - - but this one did it. When we went to that movie, I wanted to leave in the middle of it but my husband said no, we were here and going to endure the whole thing. That's how this book was. I kept reading thinking that it might get better, but it didn't. Then I read it because I just wanted to finish it. It was truly the worst book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"I am an avid viewer of Sex and The City and I truly enjoy the storylines. I was hoping to enjoy this book as much as I enjoy the show. Unfortunately, this was the most unsatisfying book I have ever read. The characters were completely unlikable and the book left you wondering if there was any purpose of their stories being told. The author stopped writing about each of them in the middle of their story and never went back to explain a thing. This was an absolute waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book is proof that you don't have to be a good writer with a decent story line to be published. This was an incredible waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Bores","review":"Four bores. Four vapid, self-centred, flakey, New York bores. To paraphrase a great line from AbFab \\"Who cares if they are fat or thin? Who cares if they live or die?\\" Reading this book was slightly less interesting than watching paint dry.I normally keep to a 50 page rule. If the book is no good after 50 pages then I bin it. Why, oh why, didn't I stick to that rule? Because this was a gift from a friend who knew I loved Sex And The City. My enjoyment of that book is a measure of my disappointment in this. It has been a long time since I actually wanted to rip a book to pieces but Four Blondes did the trick.I don't care how well observed the characters are. They are bores. Utter, utter bores. Don't buy. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"I expected much more from the writer of Sex and the City.

It leaves you feeling as bored and empty as the characters in the stories (and I use that literary term very loosely here). I loved Sex and the City, Bridget Jones Diary and The Nanny Diaries. 4 Bombs is a shell by comparison. Full of leftover hollow fragments of pitifully uninteresting and empty lives like the ones Ms. Bushnell has unfortunately grown far to comfortable with since her raving success with Sex and the City."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah and depressing","review":"Don't waste your money. It's depressing and badly written. I hope this isn't how NY really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"I was pretty dissappointed with this book. I adore \\"Sex and the City\\". I was hoping that 4 Blondes would be a cross between \\"Sex and the City\\" & \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" as it suggested on the back cover--a little tawdry, and lots of fun. But this book was not fun--it lagged in parts and lacked any sparks overall.I realize that the lead characters were supposed to be shallow and manipulative.Anti-heroes, as opposed to the likeable crop of female protagonists in many books that are currently popular. I know that you weren't supposed to really like these girls. (I applaud Candace Bushnell's efforts to create characters that were so totally the opposite of the Bridget Jones' and even her own character Carrie Bradshaw, for the sake of trying something different.) But the characters were so soul-less that I felt nothing for them, no empathy, no admiration, no dislike, nothing at all.It just felt so empty. The book was conceptually a cool idea, it just didn't pan out."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can judge this book by its cover...","review":"Let's see... Spoiled, disturbed, ungrateful and Cinderella. These could be the summary characterizations of the four women in this book. I'm surprised by how much I disliked it.For what this book is trying to say, Steve Martin's book, \\"Shopgirl,\\" is far better, more entertaining and very much more insightful.I also suspect some of Candace Bushnell's concepts were lifted directly from Natalia Ilyin's \\"Blonde Like Me,\\" another book more readable than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow entertainment","review":"Read this book if you are looking for shallow entertainment, because that is all you will get!

After about 2 chapters, I realized that I should just put it down and find something else. But being an optomist, I pressed on.The characters are shallow and pithy. The storylines are useless and go nowhere.

You're not going to have any earth-shattering revealations after reading this book, and it will never make the Oprah Book Club list, but it is a great read. I only wish it had come out earlier in the summer....I would have called this the ultimate beach book. You will love to hate these characters. Blonde, beautiful, talented, rich and living nutty lives! The 4 short stories are just long enough. They leave you wanting to know \\"just a little more\\".

Having read Sex and the City - and finding it not only difficult to follow, but difficult to relate to, 4 Blondes was a breath of fresh air. In a nut shell, it's four completely different novellas crammed into one book. The first two sections (Nice n' Easy and Highlights-for adults), I felt, were wonderfully entertaining and only wrieked of Bushnell's style. However, the third (Platinum) and fourth (Single Process) sections could have used some work... they lacked her usual flare and wit. Not saying they weren't well written, they simply were not as entertaining as the first half. All in all, I would recommend this book to friends (my copy is currently being lent out) and anyone else willing to take a break from life for a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile, Guilty Pleasure","review":"A friend handed me this book.

Althogough the charachters are shallow at times and often very repulsive, they are interesting, and in my opinion, a book should not be judged on weather it's characters are appealing (as other people on amazon did). Bottom lin- this is a funny book with sad charachter and if they are so ugly to you that it makes you dpresses, just try to laugh at them and maybe then you can enjoy this great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This has to be the worst book ever written.

There are no real stories, just pages and pages about nothing. I hear that \\"Sex and the City\\" is better (and love the series), but I certainly will not pay full price for it as I did for \\"Blondes\\".

The second story featured an extremely unlikeable harridan, Winnie, and Candace has literally lost the plot with the third and fourth stories. I found these two so irritating and unreadable that I would recommend anyone thinking about getting this book to stop reading it after the second story!

Each of the four stories came across as very shallow, without a message, and overall dissapointing. The characters rairly had any positive traits, and were in general disgusting people one would not want to meet. The plots were pathetic, and the writing was not great either.

The book falls most closely into the growing field of books concerned with personal development, with a business audience in mind. It provides a useful review of mental models of power and how they shape our reality and a guide to building power and exercising power through self-empowerment.Though useful, it does not in my opinion replace Hillman: Kinds of Power: Guides to its Intelligent Uses.

You can apply the ideas contained in these pages to improve your home life, work or occupation, social and above all your spiritual growth. Manipulation and control currently breed resentment in those it is being perpetrated upon. Most people don't realize they are doing it. To analyze your own behavior and stop the manipulation will not only improve your own quality of life, but it will also affect those around and close to you.

Not remembering where I got my old device, and not being sure it was still operational, I purchaced the APC Protectnet PTEL-2 to get us current with telephone/DSL protection. It installed easily enough.I do think I'll be researching hardwire versions for the main panel, with some type of LED indicator that it is actually operational. This will work for now and, if I'm reading the documentation correctly, if this device takes a strike it will disconnect the phone line. In other words if the phone dies, the device did its job and I'll have to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"I was afraid that the Protectnet would decrease the speed on my DSL service, since I am over 3 miles from the DSL headend.

You really feel her characters could be real people and she weaves the historical details into her stories so wonderfully. I have read most of her books at least twice and they are like visiting with old friends. She is one person I really would have loved to have been able to meet.

This is a story from the long line of genius/eccentrics mistaken for lunatics, and how the lucky escape brought about a huge positive for the world--a cohesive philosophy, product, and company in the best sense of the environmental movement. The story behind the father-sons relationship is very touching, and effectively humanizes (humorously in some parts, to boot) this film.

Then it started to continually run and you had to turn it off and on as you used it and finally the other day it burst (if you can believe that) which scared me half to death might i add and i sat speechlessly staring at it in disbelief.

If you lived through it, listen carefully; and it will take you back to re-live events and feelings we have lost but not forgotten. Expect it to be a very emotional trip. This is more than music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why buy this re-re-re-release","review":"I'll leave the critical reviews to those who made their opinions known under the prior release of this CD. Suffice to say this is a very good, underrated album in the JA/JS canon. The query here is \\"Why should I buy this CD\\"? Simply put, the remastered 24 bit sound is ASTOUNDING. The interplay between Casady/Kaukonen/Dryden is now revealed with a clarity that finally makes a definitive case for the trio being the premier musicians of the SF rock scene. The muddiness of the prior releases, even the problems with the mid 90's \\"remasters\\", is almost completly removed, with only the slightest tape hiss to distract you during some of the quieter sections. Thankfully, the vocals of Slick/Balin and Kantner are also revealed in all their glory, leaving no doubt as to the quality that needs to be re-discovered about JA. If you have a high-end stereo system this release is a must buy, and not a bad bargain those who don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!! Why did I wait so long.......","review":"I have been fan of JA since the 1960s. As many of you know, one of the problems with their LPs of this period was their incredibly poor fidelity. This remastered version of the music is nothing short of miraculous! The clarity of voice, the richness of Jorma's guitar, Jack's bass, and Spencer's drums enable you to be ....there. The only compromise in quality is some hiss on the Crown of Creation cut.

It would still be a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Airplane album","review":"Jefferson Airplane/ Crown of Creation (Ultradisc Gold): Crown of Creation is a Great album. Great hits, but all the cuts are excellent and they work very well as an album. The Gold disk is very good although the cost of it has risen to such a degree as to make it more expensive than it's worth (as of 2011). There is a new edition of the album which contains several bonus tracks. I have not heard the bonus tracts so I cannot say how good they are, but I would still suggest buying that version over this now overpriced gold disk.

Police work was really different then, and certainly what the cops did to finally get their man would not be allowed today, but this book is earthy and real.

It is excellent, especially for jr. high, high school and college aged kids. It has a great message.

Good acting and good story worth time investment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"THis could have been a good film but I just found it confusing and certainly not one promoting christianity . The christian youth leader picks up the guy when he is car less and drunk and begins to influence him to join the church. After joining, his parents divorce and his girlfriend admits she is pregnant. He persuades her to keep the baby against her wishes and nearly makes another young person kill himself when he offends him in public. This is after he becomes a christian!. No answers are given to any of the question and in the end the obvious happens. Baby goes to other parents. Strange to be made by Christians yet paint such a bewildering story.Its got a lot of positive reviews here from the christian support but elsewhere reviews are very poor. I am not surprised Rotten tomatoes a common reviewing site gives it 19 out of 100 by reviewers in total."},{"rating":"1","title":"language disappointment","review":"We were very disappointed that this product does not appear to have choice of languages.

It is one to teach teens that there is more to life than just high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great movie","review":"My 20yr old daughter and I watched this movie together and enjoyed it. However we were shocked at the bedroom scene. You see them naked as a silhouette. The dancing at the party was really sensual, and the supporting actress was dressed very skimpily throughout the movie. There was also mild cussing. I wish I could have let my other kids watch it, but no way! The bedroom scene was especially disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful movie! Must SEE for TEENAGERS","review":"What a powerful movie for young people to see. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't approve of the cussing, sexual scenes, alcohol, and drug references in the movie. However, having said that I feel like our young people need to see how their choices effect other people. A movie like this is a good depiction of the realities that face our young people today and how they can take a stand against their peers and truly make a difference...and even more importantly SAVE A LIFE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Produced Movie with a Meaning","review":"This is a great movie for teens and tweens - I am a parent with 2 teenage sons - I enjoyed the movie, they did as well :) I wish all teens and parents would watch this movie !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opinion of To Save a Life.","review":"It does show how young people face dilemas that we older people tend to ignore because we have been there before and do not really want to revisit the confusion again. The film challenges us to look at what we bring to our relationships and the courage of our convictions, especially if we think that we are people of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Bought this for my son. Encouraged us both! Medicine to our souls. If you are worried about a loved one, please purchase this movie.

I have loved other movies like \\"Courageous\\" and \\"Fireproof\\", but this one is different. While certain content is not what I would approve for young kids, it is perfect for teens and adults. Both can gain something from it. This movie was one I borrowed from a co-worker and I can't say how glad I am he suggested it. This movie is a wake up call to teens and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool to Connect with Your Teen","review":"Excellent teaching tool for early teens or great way to start a conversation with your older teenager in regards to what is going on in their lives.

We thought this movie was a clean-christian family movie however we saw lots of skin and a watered down gospel message (if any). The name Jesus was hardly mentioned in the movie. Yes, very appealing to young people/youth groups I guess but very disappointed at how the message of Jesus was not relayed. Just because it says it's a christian movie, you really need to read up and know what message the movie is giving out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was everything truly neccessary?","review":"Seriously. Was everything here neccessary? The language, bed room scene (not too explicit- Jake takes off shirt and they lay on the bed and he's shown getting dressed again- but did it have to be there at all?), & drinking? Sure teens face that stuff in life. But did it have to be put in a film that could have honored Christ more than it does? It would have been okay if these issues had been discussed in the film, but did they have to be shown? Plus, the preacher and his son are two of \\"the bad guys\\" here. Why is that?Other than this, the film was fine. Sadly, what I mentioned above pretty much ruined the movie for me. But if none of that bothers you or you don't mind showing that to your youth group, go for it. I just thought I'd throw this review out there in case there's someone like me looking for this angle on the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie will inspire you teens to walk more like Jesus walked. Seeking out the lost, lonely, and the hurting. The language is dicy at times but I think makes the movie more powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for teens and youths...","review":"This is a great teen and youth movie with a great production. It shows the life that a teenager goes through, and the difficulty when one goes astray. It deals with many teenage issues like love, acceptance, sex, teenage pregnancy, drugs, divorce, etc. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and hauntingly real","review":"This is an amazing movie and I applaud the writers and producers for keeping it so real. Many \\"Christian\\" films often get sugar-coated and skip the realities of life. I appreciate the fact that the situations here are very true to life. I also appreciate the fact that the myth that being a follower of Christ exempts you from hardships is debunked; in fact being a follower guarantees hardships.On another note, this movie also speaks to all generations. Whether in high school or not, you can find yourself somewhere in this movie. It's a chilling reminder that our lives do impact others, good or bad, and we are compelled to reach out and make a difference.I would make it a point to view it before showing it to a group of teenagers, if for no other reason than to be prepared for questions that will come up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Movie","review":"It is mainly about Christian and teenagers who commit suicide and how to prevent anyone else from doing it. So it is excellent movie for teenagers and I bought and watch because I wanted to learn and understand the life of Christian people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie! Not only a \\"Christian\\" movie! Everyone can watch it!","review":"I've seen this movie three times and am still not tired of it! This movie is very intriguing and has a great message perhaps everyone needs to think and listen to. Some may say that this is a \\"Christian\\" movie. Yes, I can see where you get that because it does show some \\"Christian\\" references, but it's not limited to it. I'm telling you, this movie will make you think/feel different. It's always that question: \\"What if?..What if I could change something before it happened?\\" It's the inner voice in you that knows what's right. It's just up to you to take that voice into action. I'll never forget the quote: \\"And the best part of the journey, is that the God of the universe, sometimes allows us to play a part in changing the world.\\" - Chris Vaughn. As for the package, it was great. I highly recommend everyone to watch this before they judge it.

We had a diverse age range (from 12 years old up to adult). After the movie was viewed we had an open discussion. Everyone felt the movie was very worthwhile and dealt with issues that many teens are facing or will face in the future. It's a Christian movie but not done in a hokey way that would turn some teens off. It was realistic and appropriate for our diverse age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Read","review":"This book is definitely worthwhile for anyone interested in hunting, conservation, or just American history. Roosevelt was an astute observer of animal habits and habitat. He was concerned with wildlife conservation long before it was popular. You get a real sense of what a hunting trip was like back in the late 1890s.What's more, he's not a half-bad writer. Unlike all of the modern politicians who \\"write\\" books--but actually just give some notes to a ghost writer who then does all of the real writing--Teddy actually wrote this book himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonic Balancer Puller Tool Set","review":"I tried a three jaw puller from my local parts store and it didn't do the job. After some research I found out I needed a specific puller for the harmonic balancer on my Dodge car. I ordered this puller set and it worked great! I choose to purchase this set because it will work for several different applications and makes of cars and trucks making it a tool I can use in the future. This is a good quality tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack","review":"The music on this soundtrack is beautiful music. Nobuo Uematsu, the legendary composer of the Final Fantasy music, has once again succeeded in making another great soundtrack.

Roarke and Eve are HOT!!! Roarke's character just keeps getting better and better. There's this new side of him that's vulnerable and especially in this book, you can see how Roarke needs Eve just as much as she needs him. It's such a special relationship. What did disappoint me, but added something to the book was the relationship between Peabody and McNab. Hopefully, we can see things resolved between the two. I'm already looking for to the next book \\"Seduction in Death\\" to come out.

It never grabbed me. The murder at the beginning was much too graphic. Then getting into the mind of such a sadistic killer was more than I want from a book. I read for relaxation and entertainment, not to be reminded of the depravity in the world. The tension and competition between Eve and Roarke is getting tiresome. I have to admit that I didn't finish this book and maybe it improved. I preferred to toss it and go on to something else. Time is too precious. Take a look at Barbara Parker's series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed-- with spoilers","review":"I really love her books, and the characters in this series are wonderful. So don't get me wrong, I'm usually a big fan of this series. But. . . the ending was a big let down. The bad guy was horrible. Really deserved to get it big time. And then when he was caught so easily in the end, I thought, oh no! Just wait, he'll get away and come back after Eve and Roarke and all hell is going to break loose! But no. He was just caught. The end. And the whole story thread with Roarke being his target was completely dropped. I thought that Roarke would tear him apart when he tried for him. Or Eve would. But Eve and Roarke never even knew that he was a target. And Dr. Mira's grand-child. I thought that Eve would have some sort of thoughts about children in regard to herself. Even if the thoughts were \\"no flippin way!\\" But it was never mentioned again. I was pretty disappointed over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story ruined by Fact Check Big Miss","review":"I was enjoying my first JD Robb when this horrible factual error showed up and kept beingn repeated. This must have driven any British fans bonkers. Fact Cornwall is the Southern most County in England. Fact residents ie. detectives would not speak with a \\"Broad Northern Accent\\" unless they put in for transfer. This obvious error is a horrible distraction and I hope that it isn't true of all JD Robb books or this will be first and last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely moronic","review":"I didn't know she wrote bodice rippers, but it is easy to believe.Really dumb plot: set 50 years in the future for no good reason, zero understanding of technology, simple characters, nothing surprising except when a victim gets away from a killer who is close to an impossible set of characteristics. $2M for a killing in NYC? 4 such killings to distract a CEO so he wouldn't look at his security for a $500M auction?This woman is a NYT Best Selling author? So many great reviews of a mediocre book?These merely show how easy it is to manipulate the systems involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betrayal in Death","review":"Loved it as usual, I wish Roarke had more parts and Eve wasn't such a witch sometimes. And I think think things in their personal life should move along. Like maybe by accident Eve would get with child. it would add some laughs with the drama,"},{"rating":"2","title":"JD ROBB ROCKS","review":"If JD Robb writes it, I buy and read it. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of the In Death series. The characters just keep getting more and more interesting as the series goes along. Can't wait for the next one this fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"finest weiss recording","review":"There could not be a better Weiss recording in existence. The only thing close is Lindberg's later effort. But the instrument and the recording is especially vivid here. I would sure like to hear this instrument in other recordings. The lute world is really waiting for a little recording rivalry between Lindberg and Nigel north in a complete traversal of the magnificent Weiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"hole in product","review":"This shirt arrived with a big hole in one of the side seams. Because I haven't had time to repair it, my daughter hasn't gotten to wear it. I would have sent it back, but that costs more than to just keep it and repair it myself, however I am not happy about spending money on damaged merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"These poems are scathing and beautiful. It is not a long work, but it requires multiple readings to break into its core. A greatly UNDERrated work that should have won the Pulitzer, I think \\"Ariel\\" stands alone much stronger than her Collected Poems, which actually DID win the Pulitzer. The emotions are huge and fiery, and the language is second to none. Plath has an ear for music in language, and shows it wonderfully in \\"Lady Lazarus,\\" \\"Daddy,\\" \\"Fever 103,\\" and \\"Ariel,\\" where she rides her horse into \\"the red eye, the cauldren of morning.\\" Brilliant work by a sometimes misinterpreted and mis-categorized writer. Don't read it to wallow in depression-- read it to hear a unique and truly gifted voice. Brava, Sylvia Plath! Your time came too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mythos of Death","review":"It may seem like an exaggeration, but I think Ariel really is all about death and its various aspects: physical, emotional, spiritual. The poems are written in a broad, mythic sense that is larger than the author, as if she is speaking from a collective conciousness. They are also poems that can evolve with the reader; they can be outlets for angst or bitterness, they can be read for their viewpoints (such as the title poem, where the speaker seems to be a disembodied spirit) or a facinating and somewhat horrifying portrait of a woman on the brink of suicide. They show the beauty in the darkness of things, and, in my opinion, belong on every poet or poetry-lover's bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"an examination of the human condition","review":"I bought this book in 2005, I loved the wonderful ride, examination of the human condition/examination of women's role in society. Plath uses a mind blowing spectrum of images that dance in your head and stay forever and filter your view of the world and all it's nuances and heart ache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly breakable, confusing P.O.S.","review":"We bought this for our 12-year old in December 2005 and just threw it out after taking 0 acceptable photos with it. We already have 2 other digital cameras in the house and have used them extensively for two years so this was not a user problem.1. 2 crucial buttons fell off in one month. We used a paper clip instead.2. All photos we've taken have been orange-cast, dark, and blurry.3. The on-off switch is malfunctioning. It's almost impossible to turn the camera off, which means the batteries run down quickly.4. The user manual has no information on how to correct image problems. We have yet to find any on-line help.5. Buttons on the camera are tiny and hard to use. Button functions are extremely difficult to figure out unless you have the manual on your knee. Not an intuitive design at all.We had high hopes for this camera and bought it because of a few good reviews and the camera's sleek design.Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I would have to say that this is a good investment, especially one for a poor college student. For the price you do get a lot, however the only downside to the camera is that there isn't an automatic focus, you must select your distance on the side of the camera and then take the picture. However, if done correctly excellent point and shoot pictures are taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't buy this. I saved up for it during my freshman year of college because I really wanted a camera and I was so disapointed when I received this. I recently gave it to my 8 year old brother to play with.

Very poor picture quality just makes the size meaningless. Yeah, it's very small and lightweight, but the idea of a camera is to take pictures...and in several different conditions, the pics we took with this camera were grainy. No matter ho wmuch light we had, still grainy. Very disappointing. I used it for a while, then sold it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk Camera","review":"I bought this to take pictures of household construction work, Torture to work the tiny joystick button. Kills your batteries after about 3-4 flashes, pictures are of poor quality on any setting, distance and or set up once you figure out how to work the buttons. I read some reviews on this that stated this was a poor camera, but I figured for what I was going to use it for why not. Wrong choice, DO NOT waste a single penny on this item, if someone try's to give you one for free, they do not like you. How a product this bad actually made it into production is ridiculous. Just to rehash \\"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA\\" it is total garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I recently purchased this camera and it appears to be somewhat worthless.

It probably ranks as his worst film. The basic story (a young Greek fisherman visits the legendary Atlantis shortly before it sinks) has potential, but the movie itself is dismal. The \\"house of fear\\", in which humans are turned into semi-animal slaves, is an obvious rip-off of THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, with the gimmick reversed, and the \\"monsters\\" are merely humans with animal heads. The climactic sinking consists mostly of stock footage from QUO VADIS. For the most part, just barely passable Saturday afternoon fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My Wide Screen","review":"This is a wounderful movie and still holds up after all these years. Why one star? Well it isnt the movie, its fantastic!....Alot of people complain about the Special Effects. ....It dosent need any. The origional movie was filmed in \\"Super Panivision \\"more like: 2:35:1 aspect ratio, and has been reduced to 1:33 VHS. watching this version, will at best give you a headace. Can you imagine driving thru the Red Woods wearing horse blinders, your view would be drastically altered. The special effects are the Splendor, Grandios, and giant set pieces. When I saw this on VHS I got dizzy from all the Pan and scan needed to reduce it to VHS size. Most of the best set pieces are seriouslly cropped, and the destruction seen, is reduced to a mild storm. You are only seeing about 1/4 of the action, and magnificent sets that cover the entire screen. 1 star for the VHS release, but 5 stars for the movie.....

One of the most glaring examples of an erroneous description/classification is it's listing of schizophrenia as a \\"Personality Disorder.\\" What's worse, really bad actors bulge their eyes and display stereotypical (often violent or menacing) behaviors during poorly-produced vignettes. For example, a woman trembles with \\"fear\\" as a rubber spider is pulled across a blanket as she lies in bed. I've seen more realistic scenes (and better actors) in 1950s era 3-D movies! This video/DVD is worse than most of the old 16mm health education films that I suffered through as a high school student in the 1960s.

The scaled back pit is the first thing you notice. The next is that any sense of joy or humor has been stripped out of the show by the removal of certain characters and their songs. The ultimate problem is that in the actual revised production nothing has really been added to compensate for these reductions. The recording suffers even more from the lack of any visuals that occassionally distracted from the production's shortcomings. My recommendation is to purchase the new recently released 2 cd set of the expanded Original Cast Recording instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing journey","review":"I was prepared to hate this one. My friend told me I would: he said, it can't compare with the original. That disheartened me already, since I view the original album as a flawed recording of a very great score. And then my friend made me sit through the new, expanded version of the original and I wanted to sock him: it had more notes, sure, but who cares? - if longer were automatically better, we'd all be sitting around listening to the 1974 Candide recording. So what a nice piece of irony to report that my friend is out of his mind: this new Nine CD, clocking in just under 79 minutes, is the best album I've heard since Ragtime. I'm not sure quite what went right, but minute by minute, the performances are strong, the orchestra sounds rich, and best of all, it feels like a real listening experience. I got the same thrill that I got when I heard the original Sweeney Todd - like the cast and the composer were taking me on an amazing journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Revival Cast!","review":"The cast & orchestrations are incredible for the Tony-winning 2003 revival of \\"Nine\\", surpassing even the original 1982 production.Best tracks include:My Husband Makes MoviesA Call From The Vatican [Jane Krakowski's Tony-winning number]Only With You [Antonio Banderas' version outshines Raul Julia's original]Folies Bergeres [Chita Rivera's big song]The Bells Of St. Sebastian [though the original is somewhat better]Unusual Way [Banderas/Benanti's beautiful duet & best song of the show]SimpleBe On Your Own [Mary Stuart Masterson's gut-wrenching song]I Can't Make This MovieA truly beautiful score! ****+"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not NINE","review":"Nine is a beautiful show... one of the most amazing shows I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I did not see the revival, and this recording does not in anyway make me wish I had. Antonio's performance is extremely flat. It all seems so calculated and rehearsed, which is not at all Guido's character. Guido Contini is charming, smooth, and a con-artist in many ways. Antonio missed that completely. I saw his performance on the Tony Awards show, and it made me want to cry. There was none of the character I loved so much there.The other performances were, for the most part, ok to good. None surpassingly great, except Chita Rivera, who, sadly, does not have enough to do to save the show.Get the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For every Joe McNally fan","review":"If you love the photographic work of Joe McNally, you will appreciate this book.

Loosening the 6 bolts (4 under the bumper and 2 up next to the bracket location) of the offending side and bumping it back out a skoosh did the trick though and I was back on my way.As others have noted - there's no need to drop the spare for proper install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hidden hitch for Sport Trac","review":"The hitch bolted into place just fine and looks great plus you don't have to remove the spare tire to mount it.

The movie had his fingerprints all over it. A great cheesy production with drama, poachers, infidelity, jazz records, fat hicks, dashing leading men, and of course giant leeches. Yvette Vickers stars once again as a sleazy woman who likes to dress scantily in front of her husband's buddies and listen to loud jazz. Of course Yvette and her swamp lover Michael Emmet can't run faster than the obese Bruno VeSota can walk.Ken Clark plays the game warden who answers his door exposing his blond hairy chest.

There might have been one 'titillating scene' and -0- humorous or dramatic ones. The quality of everything was poor; these weren't B films but F,G, or Z films. The production cost of the films, after they picked them up at the Kodak booth at Walgreen's, must have been at least $600, including the camera rental.People forget that the old funny, 'camp' films were intended as such...i.e. comedies.

I was wrong with that assumption, these movies show boobs but there is hardly any killing and when someone does die you don't know what the heck happened. Watching these movies is a waste of time, they aren't scary or interesting at all unless you just want to see girls take their tops off which I know some people do. I should have known that if they are giving your 8 movies for $4 that they are probably terrible movies, but again I went by the reviews so I must say that if you want boobs; buy these.

The nudity was just about right and the rape scenes ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less than two dollars a movie?","review":"Talk about value for your entertainment dollar? There are 8 films in this collection, which is selling for just under ten bucks! And the movies are great, if you are into 1970s camp. There are conflicts that come about in people's lives in every film, the conflicts usually the result of a sexual/romantic situation. Somebody central to the film dies in every one of them. Bellbottoms and other 70s paraphernalia (disco music, tight jeans, feathered hair, etc.) are widely represented. The music is cool in that \\"Convoy\\" kind of way. Really, for exploitation fare the stories are pretty compelling, but still just offbeat enough to give you the campy giggles. I would pay $10 for any one of these movies - getting 8 of them at that price almost makes me feel like I have stolen something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Study of psychotic people","review":"It had too much sasdistic treatment of females. Too many unnesescary murders of girls & women, plus killing of some males. Too much fantasy which added nothing to possible ejoyment of the movie. I could not, in good conscience reocmmend this item to any other sensitive, sensible, reasonably realistic, thinking individual, or couple or group. I had no idea that this was such a repulsively presentation. I regret having been drawn in to naively order anything so reprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saggy boobs and bad acting is all you'll get for your money...","review":"I recently have become fascinated by exploitation films, so I decided this would be a sordid buy. I was surprised at how little the movies actually cost, considering there are eight in the set. But as I trudged through each one (fast-forwarding through the majority) I realized nothing worthwhile is cheap. These movies are campy and unbelievable. The story lines are non-existent and the sex scenes leave a lot to be desired...like sex. Malibu High was a cinematic trainwreck...the gratuitous nudity (which was not exactly pleasing or tasteful) was the only interesting thing about the \\"cult classic\\" The pimp in the movie looks like a weasel and the Lolita prostitute can't seem to find a client under 60. And everyone says this is the best one! I'd have spent more wisely on a Value Meal than this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will blacken your insides","review":"Barbarism triumphs over love in these films. What's disturbing though is the way actions don't connect with motivations. There's cause and effect and meaning derived from a film like Straw Dogs, these are truly nihilistic. Any laughs from campiness are therefore spoiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money saved","review":"As a fan of cheesy B horror movies, I thought that this would be a tremendous deal. Unfortunately, this set completely stinks. All of the titles are mundane and tedious....certainly not worth your time in watching. Do you wonder why the set is so cheap? Because the movies are garbage and the videos are such that no one wants to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, pretty entertaining","review":"If you like old campy films where the story line is built around the elicit sex scene, or the sex crime as in many of these films, I would recommend this disc. As indicated in the title, these are cult films - nothing main stream about these pictures which is refreshing. The movies span from 1970-1980, most in the mid 70's. There are some very different films here, some being fun and entertaining and a few that suck in my opinion. My favorites were Best Friends, The Teacher, and Trip with the Teacher, which is actually pretty violent/scary! Malibu High was disappointing, it sounded better in the description. I found both the stepmother and the sister in law (I think that was the title) to be a drag - very boring. The Pick Up was really freaky. There is a crazy tarot card girl and she will freak you out. I couldn't finish watching that one. For four bucks this is worth the money, and overall I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRIVE IN CULT CLASSICS","review":"Worth every penny.The quality is what you would expect from films of that era,some better than others but I enjoyed watching them.

In all honesty, some of these films were so bad that I watched mostly in fast forward mode (particularly the Pick Up, which seemed to require the use of some mind-altering substance to understand). I suffered through the entirety of half of them, though, and none of those were particularly interesting in either a good or bad way. There is some bad dialog and acting that's laugh inducing here and there (particularly in Cindy & Donna and Malibu High), but for the most part these movies seem to exist for only one purpose: to provide soft-core fodder for men. Thus you get to see topless young women (most of whom aren't pariticularly attractive) in every film and lots of rolling-around kissing scenes. If that sort of thing is your bag, then you might like these movies.

I do not want to burn or download items illegally but this is very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet","review":"I have bought each Dexter season from Amazon because I can pre-order and my account keeps track of each order so I can reference the past. I believe its the best price and even if its not its worth the service and guarantee you get with them. I also LOVED this season the best...showing Dexter as a bit more human and many surprises in between. Fabulous ending leaving me anticipating next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter season 5","review":"I love me some Dexter and was so excited to find the remaining bix set needed for my collection priced so well we received this box set n really good condition quick delivery. Very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched it twice it was so goooood!!!","review":"First of all I enjoyed the credit to my account from the price going lower after my pre-order through Amazon- Thanks! Second...this season was excellent...with lots of twists and turns and chance for one character to reappear in the future, probably when we least expect it! Since we live in South Beach, nice to see some familiar landmarks in the episodes, although we suspect it is really filmed in Los Angeles or West Hollywood... Frank J."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Season of the Series","review":"If you're a Dexter fan, then obviously you will need to see this season. However, don't expect too much. I've noticed that, more often than not, when a series hits a high, its followed by a swift, and devestating low. And unfortunatly, to my great surprise, Dexter is one of these series. After 4 stellar seasons, everything that had so perfectly been built up seemingly disapears... Season 5 does get off to a great start; the season premiere brings a much-welcomed acknowldgement of the lasting effects of season 4. Dexter comes to the realization that he does in fact have feelings, and strong, non-threatening feelings at that. But then comes Lumen, and a storyline that I felt incredibly frustrating, familiar, and yet very-much forced. The murders were predictable, and the villians were so, so boring; especially when compared to Trinity. Oh well, you can't win em' all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"The intensity of the previous season, and the desire to \\"know what happens next\\" motivated me to buy the 5th season of Dexter. I never expected to like this show, but every season it just seems to get better somehow, and it started out good. Season 5 is quite certainly no exception; I have absolutely no regrets about buying this, and will most likely get the next season when it's available as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"love dexter","review":"How do you rate Dexter. When you have a show that has you rooting for a serial killer, the writers and actors are doing something right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 5 is great","review":"Dexter season 5 is great. This season is a transition for Dexter after the blood bath of season 4. The same dark drama, humor, and thoughtfulness of this show continues throughout the season, especially the later half. If you enjoyed Dexter before, you will also find more to like here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray takes 15 minutes to load the disc...","review":"I almost returned my Blu Ray discs to the store because I thought there was some form of error because none of the discs would load. After researching online, I found others had this problem because Showtime forces the discs to go to BD-Live first, instead of just the normal disc screen to watch the episodes.What an extremely annoying and frustrating way to structure a disc. I will never buy another Showtime blu ray until they change this obnoxious policy.I'm beyond frustrated that I had to spend 30 minutes online researching just to find out that the disc would eventually load if I just stared at a blank screen for 15 minutes.Dexter is awesome, but Showtime gets an F for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"I've had no problems watching this season instantly. I do not have to wait hours for the episodes to load or anything, I just turn on my laptop, head to my Amazon video library, hit play, and begin watching with no problems. Its a super convenient thing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a let down","review":"I saw the first season of Dexter and could not wait to buy the rest. Once I watch them I pre-ordered Season 5 and kept checking to see if a date had been releases. This season doesn't even begin to measure up to the first four seasons. I just finished watching the second disk and I just can't believe how weak the story line is. It's very predictable. Hopefully disk 3 and 4 is better. Based off disk 1 and 2 I already know who Dexter's final victim will be. I hope I am wrong but I don't think I am. It's a good thing it's cheap.Update 20 AUG: I finished the series last night and it did end exactly like I thought it would. The whole show was predictable. I could walk away for 5 minutes or so and come back and never feel like I missed something. I never had that urge to back it up because something happened I wasn't expecting. Even if the actress was different I don't think it would have helped. The story line was just very slow and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter LOVE","review":"If you missed the Fifth season you must get this set,,,,dont miss one !!!

Super prompt and the DVD was everything it promised to be.(reasonably priced too!) Being an avid Dexter fan, along with several friends, I purchased Season 5 for a friend for Christmas. It came super fast and was perfect. As soon as I gave it to my friend, she had a Dexter marathon and watched the entire season in a weekend. We both agreed that watching Dexter on DVD is so much better than having to wait a whole week for one little episode. We also agreed that 12 episodes a season just isn't enough...but this seller has nothing to do with that...what he did as a seller was great! You couldn't ask for more. Thanks so much. Added sucess to you in 2012. Lets do business again, any time! Thank U!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to this series!","review":"I love this series, and season 5 was one of my favorite seasons.

SMALL SPOILERS!!!!!!! A lot of people didnt like this season because dexter takes on a sort of partner in julia stiles. While I like dexter going solo as well i thought they played this story line of him having a partner very well. I like the fact that in this season the main bad guy dexter is after is not just one guy but a group of guys. they are Very ordinary and successful men committing violent crimes showing us as a viewer that not everyone is what they seem. This season takes a couple episodes to really get going and to show us what the main plot line will be. When the season picks up it does not slow down. All in all another great season of dexter that does not let up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season again","review":"Another great and intense season of dexterEven though there's another season you really fear for Dexter and his new partner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Great acting, fun story.

He was challenged in his belief structure and really opened himself up.Amazon also delivered exceedingly quickly. We were so impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up from the ashes","review":"My wife and I both were worried about where the show would go after that horrible, cliche of an ending to season 4. Both of us felt that the show had jumped the shark but we figured one bad idea might not ruin the whole series.Thankfully we were right. I loved the story line in this season and how they took their time getting into it rather than cramming it down our throats from the get go. I won't say too much so as to not leave any spoliers, just that the story was intriguing and definitely worthy of a Dexter season.I will ask one thing though. Just how much money does a blood spatter analyst make? The guy has a boat, house, apartment, full time nanny and he's raising kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY SHOWTIME DVD","review":"I saw the REAL series on Showtime. I always get the DVD after the series has ended. I have never been disappointed in the Showtime releases of Dexter until now. They edited the original so badly that the continuity between shows has been lost. This is a SIN!!!! They have sacrificed one of their best shows in favor of mindless advertisement for other less popular programs. If you can acquire Amazon streaming episodes of Season 5 that have not been cut, then that is what you should do. Showtime should re-release an uncut version of this DVD and try to recover their reputation. I am saving my Season 6 on DVR because I do not trust Showtime to do a decent job any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the BEST season yet!!!","review":"I have Showtime, and season 5 ended this past Sunday (Dec 12). This season really was great and each week was even better than the last week. I will try not to provide spoilers. Basically Dexter is moving out of the family home after Rita's death, but stumbles upon blood in a moving van that leads him to discover the \\"barrel girls\\". He then goes on the hunt for the men responsible (along with an accomplice). One of the men is a high powered motivational speaker (Jordan Chase) who is \\"psycho\\". Season 1 was my favorite until this season occured. By far, this is the BEST season yet!! I can't wait to buy it for my personal collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of scratches","review":"Many of the DVDs could not be watched.

I have watched each episode twice already. I have seen every Dexter episode available on DVD. Own them all. I am a big Dexter fan but do not have cable TV. If you are a Dexter fan, even a new one, this is a must purchase for you! Honestly, you need to have them all, from season one to now! You will love it. Other shows I love are NCIS, Bones & Criminal Minds, so if you are a fan of these shows, yes, definitely get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Perfection perfection perfection.

We love Dexter!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it and watched it in 3 days. Good season, somewhat lacking.","review":"Although I rated this season \\"4 Stars\\" due to how much I love the character Dexter Morgan, there were some flaws I feel that need to be pointed out.The main protagonist/s were a bit lacking this season. The thrill factor was just not there, IMO. I guess I was spoiled having the great John Lithgow guest starring last season.I am getting sick of Deb Morgan's potty mouth. Every time she is on screen you can expect her to use the \\"F\\" word at LEAST once. It adds absolutely nothing to the quality of the writing of the show! Her bad-ass-butch-cop image is uber-hokey. Please let her die soon! It would make a great storyline!The season finale has so many holes in it. It seemed very rushed and Twilight Zone impossible. The scene with Dexter, Lumen, and Deb at the end was not well done in the least bit.Otherwise, I love it and look forward to (hopefully a better) season 6.Comments are welcome! Love you all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter FTW!","review":"Forget those debbie-downers who think Dexter doesn't get better with age. He does, and the series only gets richer. Granted, there's only so many ways to kill and make the murderer get what's coming to him, but Dexter always gets his man, and the plot continues to re-invent itself as time goes on. Be prepared for some great plot twists, leading up to the more recent Season 6. Keep em coming, Showtime!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Season 5","review":"We all know that Season 4 was the best season of Dexter to date but Season 5 was not a let down by any means. I have heard lots of people fussing on how Season 5 was not very good but you can't compare it to the last season. You have to take it for what it was. The writers ended the season with so many lose ends that it took most of season 5 to tie them up. But it still had the action and suspense that the other season of Dexter are known for.That is why season 5 was a solid season. Julia Styles played a solid role not emmy worthy but a very interesting part that never got stale. I look forward to starting season 6 as soon as it is available on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting to be too mechanical and predictable","review":"I found the new series a disappointment. It lacked the tight, creative writing with twists and turns that commonly found in the previous season; the plot line seemed to be on autopilot. Also, the story is also becoming even more less believable, which takes away from it (e.g. dexter investigating the blood sample of a fellow co-worker who is suspected of murder, a pickup truck that happens to throw every body all over the road, and other silly incidents)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD Quality; Disappointing Performance","review":"The quality of this product was about the worse thing I've seen on DVD from Amazon. It was distracting. Just awful. The seller replaced it immediately, but I don't think it was the seller's fault. Also, Julia Stiles was just not the right choice. I was so bored with her performance (and panting) - a first while watching my favorite show on TV. Fingers crossed for Season 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un skippable ADs","review":"Series is great, however having a 3 minute ad for Homeland that is not skippable makes this set unwatchable. I am paying for the discs so I don't have to watch ads."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I was a fan of the first four seasons and was excited for this one but it let me down big. Stupid plot, dumb new characters, the same repetitive dexter activities every episode. This season is by far the worst of any produced. It was so bad that i have completely lost faith in the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend Death Note","review":"If you want a good series that involves a seriel killer/psychopath as the main character check out Death Note. It has a very unique storyline that deals with both Japanese mythology, crime drama. Also that show has something this show is really missing and that is a foil 2 the main character. In the Death Note Series it is a character that goes by the nick name of L, an easy going, ecentric, but extremely intellegent detective that tracks the moves of the main character seriel killer Light/Kira. That is what this series needs a very witty and clever detective who will target and eventually catch Dex when it is all said and done with. But anyways this series doesn't offer anything really, and this season was just as pointless as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, Good Season, Unforgivably Poor Quality","review":"Dear CBS,I understand that you're trying desperately to sell BluRay, but the quality of these DVD transfers just keep getting worse every year. The film transfer would be of a higher quality if you sold the bootlegged version. No excuses -- do better or we'll quit buying altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable!","review":"Enough has been said about the plot of the show. If the studio had done it right, I'd give it four stars, but they made a very obvious and sophomoric blunder that is inexcusable. The audio track for all 12 episodes is in mono audio, rather than stereo or surround sound. This would be fine if we were watching Columbo, but Dexter is a modern show with layered sound patterns and stereo music and a mono audio track simply does not work. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic Fail","review":"I downloaded the unbox and purchased Dexter: Season 5 three days ago. I have yet to watch an episode without a lot of stops to load. Each episiode takes anywhere from 2hrs to 24hrs to download. I purchased all the other seasons copies at a department store.

Contacted the seller, he asked for my tracking number, I dont have one since I shipped it USPS from my job. Never heard from the seller again. I have emailed him several times.

Rita's character had grown annoying, although the actress who played her did an excellent job. Enter Julia Stiles. It took a few episodes for her to grow on me, but her expressive face conveyed the trauma she had experienced, and she was a formidable partner for Dexter. I don't know that her departure was very well explained, but I am reasonably sure that Michael C. Hall's actress wife was glad to see her go. Was it my imagination or dod she ooze anger in her role as Dexter's sister--anger that had little to do with the story line?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter liked","review":"My daughter really enjoyed it.

I admit I don't have it. Though series five did leave me with the chills and I found it suspenseful and horrifying, the butchery is too well done and all in all it is truly repugnant. I can't subscribe to the lovable Robin Hood serial killer theme. It is not going to be a classic in my book for sure. And the acting is flat. Dexter lacks a depth and intensity, and that is frightening. A true picture of a sociopath. Thanks for teaching our kids about violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not tear myself away!","review":"Can't wait to get the next season. Dexter lives with a secret - he is a good and lovable, yes lovable, serial killer. He works with his sister for the police dept, often on his own cases - that gets interesting and adds to the suspense. He appeases his \\"dark\\" urges by killing bad serial killers. Part of the code he lives by is to only kill bad serial killers. Dexter is full of suspense and is violent. By using angles along with before and after sceen effects the show avoids showing stuff like knives entering flesh. You will still see lots of blood. A unique show. Cover your eyes for the blood sceens, but give it try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The video was very pixelated.

I honestly feel it's the worst season so far. Maybe developments here and there are great but the thing about Dexter is the main person who is the killer. Nothing can top Lithgow from season 4 and then also his brother in Season 1. But this killer sequence was not good at all. Nothing shocking at all when there were opportunities to really break new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrrgh!

However, I am not sure how tested the recipes are. For instance, the Lamb Shanks, Flageolets and Root Vegetables (the cover). In the directions, it says to remove the shanks from the oven after 1 and 1/2 hours and add the beans. The next direction is to remove 1/2 hour BEFORE it's done to add the root vegetables. Now I'm something of a seasoned cook so I don't have any trouble determining when my beans are nearly done but a novice might get confused so it would be nice to at least estimate the length of time the beans should cook.For me the recipes are lovely and I am able to convert or adapt as needed in cooking for one or two people.

It isn't my perfect deck, but I may never find that, still I will say I can tell I will probably work with this one personally and professionally quite a lot.

Two 4-pin connectors connect in to create one 6-pin connector. The cables were long enough to reach from my power supply to the back of the video card. It was nice not having to purchase a new power supply!As some of the other reviews said, the connection ends are a little cheap-ish. I was actually able to push the 6-pin end into the back of my video card UPSIDE DOWN! The pins were shaped correctly, but I was still able to push them in, likely due to the cheapness of the plastic. Luckily I stopped before I powered up the unit and inserted it the correct way. Just don't do what I did...look closely and make sure the pins are going in the right direction.But once again, I have had no issues running my new video card. Steam games are FULL STEAM AHEAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked perfectly!","review":"I recently ordered one of these so I could power an ATI 6870 video graphics card in a Shuttle SH67H3 XPC box with the 300watt power supply.Worked exactly as I expected, packaging was minimal (I like) and the molex connectors fit better than most I've used around this price point.Simple, easy, and works exactly as advertised! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"This adapter helped power my XFX Radeon 6870 which required two 6 pin PCI-Express headers.

Just be realistic with your system components if running on a smaller power supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but flimsy","review":"The product works as intended but is cheaply made and feels it.

I ended up donating my copy to some very thoroughly English friends, who loved it, precisely because the book was a) funny, b) irreverent, and c) was particularly good at pointing out the biases that many Americans who read it when it first came out would have brought with them to reading the book.A very good book to read second about the revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's view of the Revolution","review":"Although flawed by the omniscient hindsight, this is an excellent review of the American Revolution.

While the Graphics part did install and work, the TV and Video Player was another story completely. I tried several installations, couldn't get it to work right. I went to ATI's website and downloaded a Driver Bundle, just for WinXP. This did not work either. Called their Tech Support, they checked a few things, sent some written instructions, and never did get it to work right. I work in computers, and may not be an expert, but I am no dummy either....I've installed other cards before, but this card, as far as I'm concerned is nothing but A BIG BUST!!

Every time I watch video on the PC, the system suddenly reboots, usually within a few minutes.

Nonetheless, you're captured by the story of Concha, the connection with Drew, and the added value of interesting facts about the history of the Southwest, particularly Tuscon, Arizona. I enjoyed the descriptions of homes and furniture, food and clothes, interior design and exterior landscapes. The book flows well and although it wasn't a book I couldn't put down for an instant, it kept my attention, I read it rapidly, and I was sorry when it came to its very fitting ending.

However, in this performance, there is a lack of some arias of the opera: for example: \\"Si, spietata, il tuo rigore\\" and \\"Belle dee\\" of Ptolomy doesn't appear in this performance. VALERIE MASTERSON is another good reason to buy this DVD. I believe that she represents the best Cleopatra that I have listened and watched in the opera Giulio Cesare. Her aria \\"Da tempeste il legno infranto\\" is a proof of a great talent with the gorgheggi required in this opera. I highly recommend this performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There are lots of interesting tarot decks out there.

If I want to read false claims and news that is spun towards the left, I can read most U.S. newspapers or watch the network news. And don't compare Neil Young to Bob Dylan. Dylan was far less rancorous than Young, but then Young is just expressing his First Amendment rights which I doubt the Islamofascists would tolerate."},{"rating":"1","title":"99% Politics, 1% Music","review":"Sure, I enjoyed Harvest, CSNY and the Crazy Horse stuff. But let's be honest about his most recent effort. The prodution and arrangement is horrible and Neil's voice has never sounded more like Popeye's whiney girlfriend Olive Oil. I don't mind the guy using politics to sell records. Much of his best material was political. But at least in the old days he complemented his opinions with memorable music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Neil...but","review":"We don't need overly jingoistic political rhetoric at a time when what the world needs is globalised, humanised thinking.If you wanted to do something good, go to the front line in Afghanistan or Iraq and work for the Red Cross.

I've been listening to him since I was a teenager 30 years ago. Maybe if I was still a teenager, I'd like this CD. But, it's a bunch of three-chord ranting (ok maybe four or five in a few cases) with little reflection, humor or artistry that Neil is capable of, and I just can't seem to get very worked up listening to it. The lyrics are lame, regurgitating the same ole protests against Bush to the point they have lost their effectivness. Why not a ballad like Powderfinger or Pocohontas, or a rewrite of Cortez titled \\"Bush the Killer\\"? Now that would get my attention. If you're going to protest Neil, make it a genuine effort next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Release","review":"It's clear Neil young has not learned to live with war and wants to pass off this dribble off as a musical protest, but it fails in every aspect.As many have said, I've been a Young fan since the early seventies, I like a good protest song, but this CD is just poor... the music is uninspired and the lyrics could be a Al Gore rant.It's sad that many here have rated this 4-5 stars based on their dislike for the Bush administration and the war, so if you fall in to this category, this might be your cup of tea, but for Neil Young fans who marvel at the tributes to fallen heros as in \\"Sleeps With Angels\\", you will not be pleased.I don't say this often, but I think Neil has perhaps smoke too much weed over the years and has trouble seeing through the fog."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Neil's finest albums","review":"Listening to Living with war reminds of great albums like ZUMA and RAGGED GLORY.this is one of his finest albums since Ragged glory and very unlike his recent country flavoured albums.This is rock music at it's finest from the granddad of the electric guitar.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Another Feedback Filled Noisefest! But I Love It!","review":"I love this album. It's my favorite Neil Young disc since Mirrorball and Broken Arrow. It Rocks and Speaks to me.My favorite songs are The Reluctant Consumer , Living with War and Let's Impeach The President.I know this is a not a real polished album but Neil is in his element here and I think his work plays better without studio second-guessing.I'll also admit to not being a fan of the current administration.I guess that makes a difference.Still, even though Neil wrote lyrics to \\"Let's Impeach The President\\" more than 3 weeks ago his words ring even more true since the story came out that NSA is listening in on more phone calls than first reported.Given that who knows what else they are doing?I already have tickets for CSNY on 12 August. I can't wait to hear these songs live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rate the Music - not the Politics","review":"I heard Neil Young sing about eight of the ten tracks on this CD at a recent concert with Crosy, Stills and Nash. The sound was so-so. I then bought this CD thinking I would hear a better sound. I was wrong.The CD reveals more clearly that Young's voice has lost most of his range. His voice is tucked deep into the sound mix of this CD to try to hide the fact he no longer has much vocal range. The background vocals on the CD are much inferior to what Crosby, Stills and Nash provided on stage (they are not on this CD). His guitar playing is mostly uneventful - even boring. The addition of the large backing choir provides little to the overall sound mix.If you want a political protest CD, buy all means buy this. But if your looking good music, caveat emptor. This CD has been heavily discounted for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"What an atrocious recording, you would hope something making such a bold statement would at least sound better. Wow. I really don't get the chorus singing behind Neil, a gospel chorus on 1 or 2 songs is OK but this is just a regular chorus on pretty much every song and they ain't got no soul if you ask me. And the drum sound? Yikes! This album sounds like something that came out of Studio C at MTSU circa 1997. Rather than waste your money, just look up the lyrics, read em, and spare yourself from listening to this really awful sounding record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard the live version","review":"I saw CSNY in Columbus, Ohio last night and they played most, if not all, of the songs on Living With War. Some of the lyrics can make you uncomfortable, and that's the intent. Living with war should be uncomfortable. Neil Young has grown up, and so have I. The things that were wrong forty years ago are still wrong, but somewhere along the way I lost my passion about it. Hearing these songs last night blew a breath of air across something that's been smoldering in me for a long time. I'll be buying this CD soon so I can fan that fire more often. Maybe you should fan yours, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry,not up to par","review":"I sold this on ebay. I was shocked at how unprofessional this sounds. It's like Neil recorded it in 10 min.

The words are great, the music not so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Living With War is a great cd...[...] As a long time Neil Young fan-I think he should be commended for this. He is speaking the feelings of so many of us. I love this cd. I am looking forward to hearing it live. It is a great testament to Neil Young-to be able to speak his mind.

This is about the deja Vu of lying leaders and dead and maimed young peaple all over again !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and roll Bush out of office","review":"The last Neil Young was probably his best in years. This one came out very fast. This is all out anti-war album. The songs are good. The younger people and musicians, besides Devendra Banhart, have had little to say about the Iraq War. Leave it to Neil Young. \\"After The Garden\\" is a cool song, with a little Beatles vibe. I also like \\"Let's Impeach The President.\\" This is a major album. People will be talking about this album for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"relevant and rocking as my crazy (now deceased) grandmother","review":"somehow my first review of this album was deleted. freedom of speech at work? I certainly reviewed the album and didn't use my review as a soapbox to gripe about the war or respond to other people's comments. double standard, anyone?and now for the review redoux.the music: not up to par. when neil was young, he was one of the best. now he's one of the rest. too bad. the message: the whining of bloggers set to music. not unique or even interesting. give it a pass, and listen to heart of gold instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Message...","review":"... really crappy recording. That's the only reason I'm rating it so low. The content could be framed much better if the production matched the intensity of the lyric. If you're looking for something to relate to on the political front, it's a great album. For repeated listenings, it's a tough album to get behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed with his music.","review":"As much as I have always liked Neil Young, and as much as I support his politics and thinking, I was truly dissappointed with this CD. The music is so lackluster that it is almost painful to listen to the CD all the way through. It just doesn't have the spark of his other stuff that we have all come to love. Hopefully, this is not a diamond faded out, but just a phase he will get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living with Bush Bashing Musicians","review":"I got into Neil Young back in the days of \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\". I'm a huge fan of his classic stuff, and I suppose it always will be. It's part of the soundtrack of my life.I don't agree with Neil's politics on this one, but I do have to admit that this CD rocks. In my opinion, the song \\"Let's Impeach the President\\" got too much attention too soon, no doubt due to the provocative title. That's too bad. I personally don't think it one of the better songs on this album. I found myself enjoying \\"Shock and Awe\\" despite myself.So, if you can't get enough of that signature Neil Young \\"godfather of grunge\\" sound, you'll probably enjoy this CD, and if you don't like our current president, you'll likely love it.Twenty years from now, however, when people look back on Neil Young's career, I doubt that this will be considered his finest hour, or even his finest 40 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SIXTIES ARE LONG GONE NEIL GET OVER IT!!!","review":"I have been a faithful fan of Neil's for thirty some years. This album is pathetic to say the least. Why not just write a book or something to express your feelings instead of trying to put it to music. The spirit of sixties is gone (thank god) and these old hippies need to realize that was a place in time that cannot and will not be recaptured. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure vitriol.","review":"A once great songwriter reduces himself to the level of a political hack.

Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Neil Young","review":"The best Neil Young album since Harvest!As a retired Air Force Medic and a veteran of both Viet Nam and the Gulf War, I feel that I have the credibility to comment on Neil's new album. The lyrics to these songs are powerful and make you stop and think regardless of your beliefs and opinions.It is certainly not anti-American or unpatriotic as some have suggested. Thanks to Neil for saying things many Americans and Veterans feel, but somehow, couldn't say themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Name another musician as true to principles","review":"I've been recalling the 1960/70s for a while. I was a kid, but I remember Kent State. Maybe more, I remember the protest song about it. That song rattled around the radio throughout the entire Vietnam war. I lived through LBJ, Richard Nixon, Spiro Agnew and all that. Four dead in Ohio.I don't know which of the songs on Living with War will rise to that level. There are several great songs here. Check back in ten or fifteen years. I feel certain this effort will be remembered as important, historic protest music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dust Collector","review":"I own over 50 Neil albums and bootlegs and have been a fan since \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\".Neil, please.... let Steve Earle write the NEW protest songs...please! These songs are embarrassing when compared to \\"Ohio\\". I don't agree with Earle or Neil politically, but at least Earle's lyrics are cogent, entertaining, and the arrangements rock. I don't mind opposing views expressed by musical artists, but I sure wish my favorite artist could come up with something better than the inane lyrics for this album and the uninspiring regurgitated guitar from Greendale.This is strictly an album for the Bush-hating and USA-loathing Air America crowd. Absolutely nothing here to cull for any real Neil fan who loves...Ragged Glory, Mirror Ball, Sleeps With Angels, Freedom, Live Rust, Zuma, TNTN, Harvest, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and After The Goldrush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a thought....","review":"Neil Young and his admirers here on Amazon and Democratic Underground, Daily Kos, et al might want to think about this: He lives and works in a country where he can spout off this kind of stuff and all that happens is some people decry his lack of sense, say he should go back to Canada, etc. Now, what would happen to him if he were Iraqi, Iranian, name the Muslim country of your choice (or, at times, some European countries)? Prison, beheading, shredding...DEATH. The people living under that kind of oppression don't deserve the freedom Neil has in America-is that what I'm to understand? They can live in daily fear but at least Neil can \\"stick it to the man\\" as one other reviewer wrote. Doesn't seem like Neil is all that bold and fearless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute","review":"I think it's cute that Neil Young is still writing these political songs. I'm sure all the far left liberals out there will love being spoon-fed this anti-war, anti-Bush propaganda. They might even be led to think that this album is making a difference & changing minds. At least this album lets us know that Neil Young isn't dead yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Neil...","review":"Let me start out by saying that I have been a huge Neil Young fan over the years. But I for one am sick of the anti-war rhetoric...its not enlightening or constructive anymore. Neil should be more concerned with the socialist communist state of his country, than telling us what to do with ours. Lets Impeach the President? I dont even like Bush...but come on. But hey, im sure this album found its niche among America haters, and those who will protest war at any expense.Perhaps I could understand better if it werent musically stale...I dont like the message, I dont like the music. I know Neil can do better without having to pull the old protest gimmick to get sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're into good music, this isn't that good.","review":"There are some pretty good, if somewhat reused, riffs (Neil's still getting mileage from \\"Rockin in the Free World\\"). The lyrics aren't all that. Sorry, but they aren't. This album is better than \\"Re-ac-tor\\" (a total waste of vinyl in the days of vinyl), but its only sales point is protesting the war and pandering to the people who hate Bush.Bottom line - there is one good song, two okay songs and the rest is truly forgettable. Young was smart to start the album with \\"After the Garden\\", but its all downhill from there, and \\"Impeach the President\\" just blows.If you're looking for anything of the quality of \\"Old Man\\" or \\"Horse with no Name\\", look elsewhere.If you want some decent music, get the RHCP's \\"Stadium Arcadium\\"Those of you who say different - well - take a reality pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living With War?","review":"If there is any of the creativity, fire, or outrage (where even Richard Nixon has got soul) that one could expect from Neil Young in this CD, I have not found it.

Neil is a strong voice to be heard and respected, but \\"Living With War\\" only adds to the rhetoric. I voted with my brain and heart so of course George Doobie Bush did not get MY vote! I appreciate Neil speaking out but if he is not a registered voter, that is one vote we lose to the ignorant leaders currently in the White House. It's one thing to get on a bull horn and shout the obvious and quite another to make a real difference. What Bob said in '63 still remains valid for me:\\"And I hope that you dieAnd your death'll come soonI will follow your casketIn the pale afternoonAnd I'll watch while you're loweredDown to your deathbedAnd I'll stand o'er your grave'til I'm sure that you're dead.\\"The public that is voting this album to be the end all be all are the same ones that voted for the idiot president."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for Neil","review":"Thank goodness we have a geopolitical expert like Neil Young telling the sheeple what to think. Can someone tell me where Neil did his doctoral work because I think that he's right on the money with this album.Why should any of us listen to what entertainers, essentially court jesters with a lot of money have to say? I have no idea.In Neil Young's case, oh yeah, we should listen because he DOES play a guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Stuff","review":"This is one of the most boring CD's I've ever bought. Its as if for political reasons the music was cranked out as background to now fairly mainstream anti-war lyrics. It sounds so computer generated. Did they really have a drummer or was a drum machine used on every song? Were the guitar sounds recorded 40 years ago and then mixed into the songs? If you want anti-Iraq war listen to the Dixie Chicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"Never forget that this guy was in CSNY!!! He has done a few good things like Rust Never Sleeps but he also has a history that everybody seems to have forgotten...Indeed, some people seem to forget that actually in the 70's and 80's Neil Young was equated by some of us as THE hippie. And he has managed to deliver one big hippie album.OK so there is some dostortion on the production...ok the album is based on good intentions but the sweet harmonies...really it is too much. OK Greendale was maybe worse but does that really mean anything. I mean I like some of his stuff, I really do but here he is stretching my patience quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric","review":"Just plain BAD it seems as though a 14 year old has written the \\"protest yrics\\" when he was mad with out trying to be somewhat intelligent. It also sounds as if he used the same drum machine through out the disc while just singing stream of consceinceness lyrics to it. As a lifelong Neil fan I guess I will have to just fogive him for this Schlock! as I also did for Greendale and Are you Passionate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preacing, again","review":"Neil is a good singer songwriter, but his preachiness gets in the way of his more well written songs. Maybe Toby Keith will do another \\"Southern man don't need him around, anyhow,\\" type lyric. Why do people in the industry feel the need to speak out instead of letting people figure things out on their own. You might as well be a politician. Next thing you know, he'll be jumping up on Oprah's couch. If you like this sort of drivel, help yourself, but you'd be better off buying some of his better works. Take a pill, Neil."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate To Say This, But...","review":"...all that's going to occur with the release of this CD is an increase in Neil Young's savings or checking account.The music itself is very bland, and, of course, the lyrics are politically incendiary but ultimately go nowhere.We all know what's happening in this country. A rock musician isn't going to change anything. That's trite, I know, but it's true.If there was anything like a percentage of the profits from the sale of this disc going to an organization that was truly making a bid to get this mess over with, then I wouldn't feel so bad about where my 13.99 was going.As it is, I feel I've wasted my money and, because it's a lame and not particularly engaging record, this one won't get much more playing time on my system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Follows The Pack","review":"No intelligent dialogue or commentary here. Just Neil kowtowing to the Bush-haters of the world. Neil can churn out generic drivel like this as much as he wants and apparently there will always be an audience for it. Add some hatred of The President to the mix and he'll sell another couple hundred thousand cd's and go up by 2 or 3 stars in Rolling Stone and here on Amazon. It doesn't change the fact that, despite the knee-jerk rhetoric, it's horrendously bad art. Hatred on a silver disc in a cheap brown wrapper. I agree with the other reviewer that Young should be ashamed of himself. It's funny what some people consider praiseworthy. You and Neil deserve each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Do Not Agree With Neil Young...","review":"...but as someone I thought intellectually honest, I can see where he's coming from.

It is definately electric - Crazy Horse sounding - with some very satisfying notes. It is also complex enough that I am still analyzing the music after several listens and my impression changes a bit each time.If you are a Neil Young fan and not offended by the anti-bush lyrics or the questioning of the status quo, you will probably like it. While not a mind boggling production, it is interesting and good enough to be Neil.I"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I tell you, Neil Young is so darn good! the music, the sentiment, it's all here. He is touring this summer with CSN, be sure to catch them as I am in Camden in July"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Forget the politics, I buy music CDs to hear music. Maybe 2-3 tracks on this CD are actually musically interesting, the others are merely ranting with badly arranged repetetive chords played along to justify calling the track a \\"song\\". Even the normally melodic piece \\"America the beautiful\\" is grating to the ears in this version, due to the screechiness of the vocals. I know you're pissed off, Neil... that's okay, but I was hoping to buy some nice music. This CD certainly is not of the high quality I expect from Neil Young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"I have been a Neil Young fan for decades. Like many others my age, I cut my teeth on his music, followed him into his electric phase, and bought and learned to play just about everything he recorded.This album is tired. Its the same old licks you've heard before and, whether you agree with his politics or not, his lyrics just don't have the sharp edge that they once did. He has written so many compelling songs with strong social or political messages in his time (Ohio, Zuma, Rockin' in the Free World). He stands in a small group of musicians that can claim to be among the most influential of our time.So, given that I think so highly of him, let me say that I wish he hadn't recorded this album and I am sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Neil Album Ever","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy Chrome Dreams 2. This CD has one decent track and the rest were thrown together in a week. Is Neil screwing with his record company, again? I tried to sell mine to play it again records days after it came out and they already had too many. This will make a good collectors item, though. Because I guarantee it will be OOP and never see the light of day, again. I can't believe Dylan's not going to sue him for stealing one of his songs. Flags Of Freedom is an inferior rewrite Chimes Of Freedom. Some of the songs are just ripoffs of his own music I already own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fan but this falls short","review":"I'm a big Neil Young fan and have everything he's recorded so I was looking forward to this cd. I like the sentiment of the offering and lyrically this is right on the money but I think that most of the music is simplistic and mundane. I appreciate the inspiration but the music was written in 2 weeks and it sounds it. I wish he had taken two months. There are a few nice songs and most people will like \\"Looking For a Leader\\" but those moments are few and far between. \\"Let's Impeach The President\\" is especially tiring to listen to with Neil employing only a few chords over and over throughout. When I listen to this song, and several others, I find myself wanting to change notes and chords throughout just to break up the monoteny. And ending the CD with a miserable version of \\"America The Beautiful\\" is like a boring politician ending a speech with a high school band playing \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" in order to get a standing ovation. Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage and Anger","review":"This disk is only for those who hate Bush and do not support the War on Terrorism. It is full of rage and anger but there is not much melody or structure to the music. Young is not very much of a guitar player or singer either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music? Art? Hardly","review":"Preachy and unoriginal, with lyrics that sound like they're written by Bill Maher and Michael Moore and music by a three year old.Pass on it, unless your friends hate Bush so much that owning it will help you look cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"no title","review":"I am a huge Neil young fan, but I really get fed up with artists dealing in politics. This album is a very good example why.Typical of all liberals, he has all kinds of complaints, but no solutions. We are lucky to have as much free speech as we have. Neil, if you don't like the way our government is running our country and protecting our freedom (oh yeah, you had an album about that topic also) you can head right back to your home, Canada. Another example of a hypocrite making money off the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm a huge Neil Young fan which is why I'm so disappointed with this album. The people who love it seem to share one thing in common: a visceral, even irrational, hatred of George Bush, rather than an appreciation of Neil Young. You know, I'm not a Christian but I think Bob Dylan's Slow Train Coming is one of his best albums. The point is that if the music is good, it shouldn't make any difference what the words are, and the music here is simply not up to snuff, not up to Neil's standards. The music here is not that good and the lyrics are, well, childish and naive, rather than childlike. real Neal Young fans, as opposed to George Bush haters will know the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Young - SHUT UP","review":"I absolutely, positively LOVE Neil Young. I have most, if not all, of his albums or cds. I purchased \\"Living with War\\" just to have another Neil Young cd. But, I will probably never listen to it. Neil Young has lived in the USA for more than 20 years, but I believe he is still a Canadian citizen. If he has not become a U.S. citizen then he needs to shut up. If he is then fire away, but his celebrity status does not entitle him to use his status to comment on the vagaries, subtleties, and complexities of U.S. foreign policy and how that policy is made. Why not write a song or two praising the GI's who are serving their country valiantly in a very harsh environment?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Young is a dictator lover of big government","review":"I used to be a fan of Youngs with his passion to speak out against unjust causes but in regard to his misled belief that President Bush is the bad guy and Saddam is the good guy goes beyond belief. As Saddam hoodwinked the UN and the woosey Europeans Bush finally saw through it all and has taken the necessary steps to ensure a Madman and his sons could never take power with nuclear bombs. THis president is fighting two wars on two fronts against people who want to kill Americans and have wanted to since 1979. To take this album seriously is dangerous to America and simply a terrible piece. And I now have an excuse to through out every old Neil Young CD I ever owned. Neil, why not try to protest dictators and Muslim fanaticism and if his fans have a brain of their own they may see the US in a different light."},{"rating":"1","title":"How would you know Neil","review":"excellent guitar player and songwriter, horrible soap box minion.How would you know what it is like to live with war Neil, ever fight in one?

To \\"A Reader\\", you are obviously one of the 30% who refuse to take off your blinders to look at the facts. It is not that hard. How sad to know that as American citizens we are no safer, getting ripped off more than ever by corporate fat cats, and that our boys are dying everyday because of a man with an 80 IQ. What does it take, \\"A Reader\\"? Fortunately there are oldies like Neil Young who want to help educate the real world by shouting it out. Whether \\"Living With War\\" is quality work or not, Neil took the risk for all of us. As he said, \\"I was waiting for the younger generation to step up and when I didn't see that happening, I realized I better take care of it myself.\\" Way to go, Mr. Young. I will gladly be purchasing your album this afternoon just to hear your version of the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I speak for the rest of the world when I say ...","review":"THANKYOU MR YOUNG! This has been a long time coming. I really hope from the bottom of my heart that the message gets through to some Americans about what we have known about Bush and his 'friends' since the beginning. Coming from a peace loving country like New Zealand its very scary to see the kind of world Bush etc have created. its starting to creep down here and we dont like it (the track 'shock and awe' could easily describe how the world felt when we found out Bush had been re-elected - \\"Oh no .. thats the end of the world as we know it\\"). The album is brilliant, Neil Young is a passionate man with passionate views, and its the perfect medium to get them across and who else better to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"freedom fighter","review":"neil young has produced a record with truth. george w. bush has reigned in an era of war long enough, and this album is the cry of the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The problem is America has never been very good at listening too uncomfortable truths and Neil Young has done this with vengeance on this AWESOME album. Having just watched the documentary of C,S,N & Y taking this album on the road and the varied receptions they received in various cities, Held me spellbound and the soundtrack was perfect.Many Americans hide behind the 'we are fighting a war on terror' tag line, Well the UK fought a 30 year \\"war on terror' in Northern Ireland and what was the American response, 1)The main fund raisers for these murderers and 2)Refusing to extradite IRA murderers. But hey the Catholic vote is far more important than a few thousand Brits and Irish being murdered.Many of the participants in the documentary prove that you can love your country but still question your government when you think it's wrong.Just buy this album it's brilliant and as any piece of art is supposed to do it provokes thought and discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better late than never for a review of this album","review":"This album was recorded about seven years ago, during the middle of Bush-43's term in office. I should have picked it up then, because Neil really went after the administration and its politics.I think most of the songs are good and have some bite. The music & melodies are okay, but not as memorable as say Living in the Free World.It demonstrates once again why Neil Young has such longevity -- he can write songs which are honest and well executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time!!","review":"I love Neil Young and I love that he says well what most of us think about the situation in Iraq. He's amazing. The recording quality doesn't seem quite as good as \\"Prairie Wind\\" but the lyrics, heart and intent makes up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Young delivers a powerful masterpiece!","review":"This album just blew me away. Neil Young writes and sings from the heart about the state of our country today.The last 6 years of the Bush administration have been an abomination and now we are getting music which reflects the anger and outrage many of us have been feeling for so long.Living With War is a wake-up call to anyone who wants to bring back compassion and justice to our society.The standout songs for me are: Living With War, Let's Impeach the President, Shock and Awe, and Looking for a Leader.This is a true work of art and Neil Young should be commended for making it."},{"rating":"1","title":"He gets an extra star for bashing Bush. . .","review":". . .still, the music here is pretty bad.

Your not from this great country that is finally doing what past Presidents didn't the balls to do, and thats taking terrorists head on. Clinton sat back and let Bin Ladin get the resourses together to let 9/11 happen in the first place, why not go after him too. Bush isn't pushing for Bin Ladin right now because he is hiding in caves...Zarqawi was an active terrorist, who if You Mr. Young were President, would still be alive killing people today, so lets Impeach the songwriter who doesn't know what he's talking about.

I thought we were gonna roll? You know, fight for freedom? I must have missed a memo. This cd is laughable - Country Joe and The Fish for the 21st century. Once you drive this lemon off the lot it's already depreciated considerably. In a couple months it will be as dated as that half gallon of milk that's been sitting in the back of your fridge. What pathetic about most of you Bush haters is how you will give 5 stars to anything that gives vent to your vile hatred of the president, regardless of the quality. Let's Impeach the President - what a pathetic, artless example of pettiness. Would a Dylan or a Springsteen resort to this pathetic, artless exercise even if they felt the exact same way. That's why Neil's in Triple A compared to those guys. But you can buy this glistening turd and build up Neil's bank account and pretend that your making a difference.

The difference with this one is after listening to the whole thing at least 5 times I just can't get past the feeling Neil was so angry and vitriolic he forgot to make decent music. Just because it's controversial and shocking does not mean it gets a pass on its other attributes. Bad is just bad. \\"Let's Impeach the President\\" sounds more like it was written at a bus stop in five minutes out of anger. Don't make the assumption that I'm a big Bush supporter and that is why I do not like this album.

So much of its value rests upon which side of the line you stand, but that's also what makes it so powerful. The message is loud and clear, tough and on target, and the music is pure Neil. It would have been very disappointing if he had decided to sugarcoat the message or delay its delivery in favor of slick production. Thankfully he did neither, and that's what makes him who he is.

It's only a matter of time that you hold the pot with wet hand and have it slip off.- The omelet pan is not round. Near the handle are 2 dents near the handles.

The colour resolution was awful, everything looked grey, even the brightest red. To cap it all it didn't offer one new technique.

The reverb is to the max. It's a shame that when polls are taken of the great rock guitarists that Dick Dale is usually omitted, as his take on \\"Miserlou\\" makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. A great booklet showcasing the various bands whose tracks are on this CD is included. Crank it up and take a drive down PCH with the top down.

And the point that he repeats incessantly about one housetraining mistake being a catastrophe is ridiculous.

It has informational blurbs about Marc Blitzstein: Composer and Enigma, Orson Welles, Hallie Flanagan, Christopher Marlowe and the questioning of him being a communist, the real Olive Stanton, the death of Vaudeville, Diego Rivera, and so many other things. It also has great pictures from the film, including some candid shots. I used it as a source on my paper on the Federal Theatre Project, it's an excellent source of historical information, but it's also very entertaining to read! The day I got it I spent hours going through it.

Whatever magic they once had is gone.I was praying for them to bounce back from Ultra, (Every band is allowed one poor album but they have slid even further into an abyss of unfresh ideas. This band has lost its steam and has gone from cutting-edge New Wave to a single notce above New Age. I am just waiting for their team-up with John Tesh at Christmas Time.Seriously, this album is nothing more than 3 guys with a drum machine. And what really hurt here, I really wanted to like this album. I tried and tried to get into it. It was to no avail, however.I long for their old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring album ever made.","review":"Is this a joke? Where is Depeche Mode? Nothing about this cd resembles anything like what they've done before. While some people will call this \\"a triumph\\" I call it dreadful. The beats are undermixed to the point of non-existence. The guitar is amateurish and cheesy. The singing is uninspired and monotonous. The instrumentation is so subtle there may as well not be any. Produced by Mark Bell of LFO (on warp) & Bjork fame, I expected an extravaganza of electronica with cool beats, dynamic synthesisers and exciting vocals. This album contains none of those elements. A lazy excuse for an album. I miss Depeche Mode and this cd makes me miss them even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS VIOLATOR","review":"SOME PEOPLE IN DM NATION ARE CONFUSED.

With the exception of the catchy first track,this album is trite,flat and exceedingly boring. I gave this album several repeat listenings over the course of a week to no avail. My disappointment increased with each repeat. Blah. I enjoyed the industrial sonic hum of Songs of Faith and Devotion and was expecting more of the same....not so with this. The 80's are over and out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless your a diehard fan, save your money!!","review":"If your one of those diehard fans who like anything a band puts out, than you'll probably like this disc. If not, save your money. The song that best describes this album is \\"Comatose\\". The first time I listened to this disc I was disappointed and thought it was pretty bad, so the next day I thought I'd listen to it again with an open mind. This time I thought it was worse. Contrary to alot of reviews this album is no were close to Violator. The songs are very dark, slow and boring. Unfortunately this is going to be one of those cd's that you pull out of your collection after 5 or 10 years, and you say \\"wow\\" this cd still looks brand new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album! not the best DM album.","review":"it seems a lot of fans didn't like the change in sound on Exciter. i love it! i think this album is very solid, though not quite as good as Ultra, Violator or Songs of Faith & Devotion (my favorites).there are a variety of songs on here, but the production throughout the album is very consistent. though, i wonder if maybe it's too consistent. the album is almost hypnotizing. as some other reviews have mentioned, the title is sort of misleading because it's not really exciting. however, it is a great album to make love to. so, maybe that's what the title refers to. many of the tracks are rather mellow, and while there are a handful of upbeat tracks, the overall feel is very laid back. it's the perfect album for chilling out on a summer evening or to put your moves on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"Ever since the \\"Violator\\" release, I have been dissappointed in each new Depeche Mode CD. All of their music seems to be a rehash of their more successful tunes. The rhythms and melodies on Exciter I've heard before on other Depeche Mode CDs. Violator was Depeche Modes acme, they seem to be out of fresh Ideas. Its a shame but it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"personal mode","review":"great cd depeche mode never disappoints with there heart felt electro/synth music, shine is a strong balled full of emotion but i love all there music and always will"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DM cd since Violator...","review":"The trademark keyboard-synth sound is no more, but DM comes back with their best work since Violator. Bass-heavy, muted tracks are the backdrop, while David Gahan's vocals are in fine form.That being said, it's not like Violator, Music for the Masses, or even the awful Songs of Faith and Devotion. It's a new sound for DM, and I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it grows on you!","review":"Before you listen to this CD, you have to throw all your expectations out the window. The music on this CD is very different from their previous stuff. A lot of it is slow. Many tracks do not have catchy and accessible melodies. In fact, most people will probably hate this CD at first as I did. But you have to give it a chance and listen to it with an open mind. The fast tracks have rough, powerful energy, while the slow tracks are very relaxing. This CD will certainly divide the listeners. Some will call it a masterpiece; some will hate it. I guess the truth lies somewhere in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a letdown!","review":"Maybe I'm a bit biased here, but I think \\"Exciter\\" is a good album. It is way more consistent than \\"Ultra\\"--not to say that there aren't standout tracks on \\"Ultra\\". My favorites on \\"Exciter\\" have to be \\"Shine\\", \\"I Feel Loved\\", and \\"I Am You\\". Just like they proved they could do it without Vince Clarke, they have proven that they can make good records without the musical chops of Alan Wilder. I'm very pleased with \\"Exciter\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, (maybe) not the worst","review":"I'm sad to say Depeche Mode now sounds like their cover bands. The music has little texture, and most of the songs sound like demos (e.g. 'Dream On'). I think tracks off 'Construction Time Again' and 'Some Great Reward' had much more musical (and surprisingly lyrical) depth. The lyrics also reach an all-time low on this album. Having been a fan since 1988, I must say I'm disappointed, though the album isn't entirely without merit. (Also bear in mind that I really liked 'Ultra.')Hopefully they will play older songs on their tour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never let me down??","review":"The 4th of April was a great day for me because I heard that Depeche Mode were releasing an album called 'Exciter' on the 15th of May. Ultimately the album offered little. The mood created by the songs is a stark contrast to that suggested by the album's name. Now, I've been a DM fan for a long time, and I've loved almost everything they've put out. This time though, I had trouble liking most of the tunes they came up with. Sometimes you'll listen to a song for the first time and not like it. But then, if you hear it a couple of times, it starts to grow on you. No such luck this time. Sorry DM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I will agree to disagree with the majority of negative reviews regarding this album, in that this isn't a horrible album. However, it is extremely lacking in what has become the past power of Depeche Mode.There are few, if many memorable, hooks. While the production is sound, the entire album drones on sleepily for nearly 57 minutes. I am quite disappointed in this effort and regret shelling out the bucks for it.No doubt, if you are a Depeche Mode fan, you have probably bought this album. While still beautifully poetic in its lyrics, it is certainly lacking in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought an advance copy of the album last friday and have listened to it dozens of time by now. The album gets better and better each time you listen to it.I think the main problem that the naysayers have about this album, is that they are living in the past and comparing this album to the others.You can't compare this album to the other ones. I think the entire album is great. It is definitely an improvement over Ultra.Shine, Dream On, FreeLove, I feel loved (soon to be a #1 European dance club hit).This album has variety. The great thing about DM is that they do not rehash their most famous album into new albums (Like most groups do). DM actually tries out different sounds....and it works. Don't listen to the people who are complaining about this album. Go out and buy it....and judge for yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money...","review":"Exciter features some amazing songs some of which are reminiscent of their older work. \\"I Feel Loved,\\" \\"I Am You,\\" \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" stand out here with great lyrics (especially on \\"Breathe\\"). Songs like \\"I Am You\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\" have a good musical edge to them.Other portions of this album, however, need some work. DM insists on adding a couple of filler tracks (\\"Lovetheme\\" and \\"Easy Tiger\\") that only dilute the force of the album. Despite listening to \\"Dream On\\" many, many times, it still doesn't strike me as a finished song. The same can be said for \\"The Sweetest Condition\\" which features some clumsy lyrics. \\"The Dead of Night\\" features some nice lyrics, but the music has contains some elements that seem written purposely for their shows.In the end, \\"Exciter\\" contains some impressive songs that won't be overshadowed by some of the undeveloped songs here. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it more than once","review":"First off, I'd like to say that many of the reviews I've read so far seem too hasty concerning this album. \\"Exciter\\" is DM's deepest album to date and Martin Gore's songwriting is as awesome as it always has been. This album doesn't grab you right from the start, but if you listen to it a while, you will eventually come around. I think quite a few of these people were hoping for another \\"Violator\\", but come on everybody; a band has to progress in order to stay fresh. If you give it a chance, you'll be able to experience some truly beautiful music..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Blew 14 bucks - I DON'T Feel Love","review":"Congratulations, ..., you can pick up your check and backstage passes, your career as a flack is fully intact. Folks, don't believe the hype on this one. I've been a fan of Depeche for years, and if you buy this CD expecting an up tempo, synth pop, i.e. fun album, like Black Celebration, People are People and Violator - Dream On. With the exception of the first two singles - Dream On and I Feel Loved, Exciter is boring, boring, boring. Lyrically it's as weak as anything they've done - I defy anyone to listen to Breathe without laughing. And Dead of Night? I thought that Rage Against the Machine experiment we had with Songs of Faith and Devotion was over. It seems that in their attempts to remain \\"relevant\\" Depeche has completely abandoned the sound that helped build such a loyal following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not done yet","review":"While this CD starts out well, after the first two tracks, it's pretty painful to listen to. Some Interesting ideas, but too many of the songs are just missing so much of what makes Depeche Mode so good. Plus there are a couple of songs, that sound like they just needed to add a few songs.I waited so long for this album, and especially after hearing Dream On, I had high expectations. But now this CD is back in its case, and will probably be there for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for coming back...","review":"What can I say? I don't like techno that much, but DM is always going to be in my record collection. And this album proves that to be a classic act you have to deliver. And they do. Highlights: Dream on, Shine, Freelove, Dead of Night, I Feel Loved, Goodnight Lovers, Sweetest Condition and ALL the LYRICS...they are AMAZING. Lowpoints: The instrumental songs....they don't add much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous, yet still rather hypnotic","review":"Unlike most critics it seems, I really liked Depeche Mode's previous releases \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". Their hyperkinetic melodrama had a theatricality that seemed bold and exciting. With their latest release, \\"Exciter\\", DM has gone back twelve years and revisits their sounds of \\"Violator\\". With the exception of the opening track \\"Dream On\\", the vampirish \\"Dead of Night\\", and the electronic rave \\"I Feel Loved\\", \\"Exciter\\" doesn't excite. David Kahane's voice merely grates and plaintively groans over synthesized noise that is neither melodic nor particularly inspired.This album, however,is not a total lost cause. The tracks mentioned above have an urgency that keeps you coming back to hear more ... and while overall the album has a monotonous feel, there is something hypnotic to it all. I continue to listen even while realizing it isn't very good, yet I cannot seem to pull myself away.I suppose there's something in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD.","review":"Alright - think of this as a slightly biased review - since I am a DM fan. I like this CD. It took me a few runs to get into it, however that is the case with most of DM CDs. \\"I feel loved\\" is absolutely great club song, \\"Freelove\\" and \\"When the body speaks\\" are great ballads. The whole CD is amazing - because Depeche Mode once again took it to another level. David Gahan's vocals are best ever (I also went to their concert in Chicago this June, and I must confirm that Depeche Mode is still going strong). I think that musically this is their best CD yet - and it has become very popular in european and also american club scene. It is not a CD that gets played much on commercial radio stations, so beware - you're not getting a top 20 type of a CD... Then again since you came to this page looking for Depeche Mode, you already know that :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediocre","review":"This time out, Depeche Mode offer up a mellow batch of songs that aren't great, but they aren't bad. \\"The Sweetest Condition\\" appears to be a sequel to \\"The Sweetest Perfection\\" from \\"Violator\\" but \\"Exciter\\" is not as good as that cd is. It seems the band is retreading on songs like \\"Dream On\\" and \\"The Dead Of Night\\" because I found myself reminded songs from \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\". Staunch Depeche Mode fans will probably not be disappointed and new fans may show some interest, but where did the hooks and melodies go? Depeche Mode used to turn out some memorable songs and now with \\"Exciter\\" it seems that spirit is lost. Dave Gahan's voice has never sounded better but where are the memorable songs? Is this the same band that gave us \\"I Just Can't Get Enough\\", \\"People Are People\\", \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Somebody\\" and \\"It's No Good\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD To Come Back With.","review":"Depeche Mode is a great band. I like this CD a lot. I think this CD is the more sophiscated side of DM. Anyways, they have this edgy, radical sound that NO ONE else has!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired with a few gems","review":"Sometimes it's better for bands not to release an album for a while. This is a perfect example of that. Two or three decent tracks, and for the first time in DM history there are filler songs. From what I hear of Playing the Angel, I will be rating that one with 5 stars, but sadly Exciter falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciter ~ Depeche Mode","review":"Exciter being their 2001 release is an album that has the best Depeche Mode lyrics to date. The texts are very autobiographical and deal with Gahans drug abuse and the turmoil that it caused. The vocals are some of the best they have ever recorded and the group seem to have found that harmony that was missing on SOFAD and was not as good on Ultra. I personally think that the departure of Alan Wilder was needded and spurned group to new hights of creativity and not always relying on Wilders ideas and his vision for the band. Goodnight lovers, Dream on, and Freelove are just as good as songs like Enjoy the Silence, Behind the wheel and many other awesome 80's tracks. This is an excellent synth pop album with great lyrics, awesome vocals, and overall I give it 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come On....","review":"When in a band, it becomes more than boring to do the same thing over and over for more than twenty years. Exciter is what a band does when they don't want to move away totally from what they are (sort of like the Faith and Devotion Album...which is too harshly viewed in my opinion) yet still want to add more to what they have been. Tracks like Comatose could have appeared on any other album while tracks like the awesome dance song \\"I feel loved\\" definately belong here. There is beauty and haunting on this album. Don't let those long time \\"hardcore\\" DM fans scare you out of Exciter because they don't want people to evolve. This isn't punk rock - Don't worry about the \\"Selling out\\" Cliche. Buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depeche (in an uncreative) Mode","review":"No one was looking forward to this album more than I was. I have just finished listening to the CD from beginning to end and I can think of only one word--\\"Uninspired!\\" There is not one song on this album that I wish to hear again. In the past, DM has provided solid music with variety. \\"Ultra\\" was such a promising return to the scene from a group that had been silent for years. From the gritty \\"Barrel of a gun\\" to the solemn tone of \\"Home\\", \\"Ultra\\" truly delivered. But the music in this recent offering was colorless, leaving the listener with a flavor reminiscent of trading card gum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"somethin new","review":"This album is a lot more appealin then Ultra, at least to me. A lot better lyrics, much more daring production and synth lines, and a lot more uplifting. Songs like Dead of Night, I Feel Loved and Dream On will keep you moving, while songs like When the Body SPeaks, Free Love, and Goodnight Lovers will croon you. I'd recomend it to new and old DM fans. I really see no reason why so many negative reviews are present...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I once hated this album...","review":"Maybe it was because I expected a more danceable, synthpoppy album. I said, what the hell is this and I didn't care to listen to it any more as I had also the CD singles of Dream On, I Feel Loved and the magnificent Freelove. It was not long ago that I took the time to listen again to this album and really have to say now that this is one of DM's best albums. I just can't stop hearing songs like Breathe or Goodnight Lovers. This is DM's at a very special phase that we may not hear again. Those two songs (Breathe or Goodnight Lovers) actually doesnt't sound very DM as one could say but has such emotion, such soul that now I feel like I have found a treasure and plan to enjoy it forever. Martin Gore is such a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DM Album","review":"I am a huge DM fan. I have all of their albums and love \\"Violator\\", \\"Black Celebration\\" and \\"Some Great Reward\\". However, it's apparent that Alan Wilder was such an important part to the music that DM's last two albums are failures. ULTRA has it's moments, but Exiter has none. \\"I Feel Loved\\" sounds like a B-side to earlier DM singles. The rest of the album is was too personal and dry to listen to more than once. \\"Dream On\\" was the strongest song on the album? Yikes! (I don't want to fall asleep listening to DM, but this album does the trick) The last DM album I consider to be worthwhile is \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\". Exciter is a huge disappointment from a band that seems to be directionless without Wilder. Martin should have publically recognized his contributions and not shut him out. Too bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"c'mon people...","review":"people, this is a boring album, and yes, I love DM. They can do better than that....I don't like it when big time DM fans automatically give every DM release a full mark without distingusihing between the different albums. They are hardly all one one level. Okay, so some are better than others. This page is intended for you (the persons who know best about DM) to review albums to give people who are not so familiar with their work an idea about their albums and their music. I don't have a problem with the fact that you give an album (which in my opinion is weak) five points but please be a bit more precise in the future.

After Ultra, I figured anything would be an improvement. I got Ultra II! Most of the songs here are uninspiring, save for one or two.

In the meantime, it's back to listening to early 80's DM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not There....","review":"Lionell Richie meets Depeche Mode's Violator.That about sums it up.The album needs a drive or a pulse to keep it moving along. The synth work and production work is excellent, however, the depressing and over-the-top lyrics we've all come to expect from Depeche Mode have been wiped. The music doesn't overcome this, and you're stuck with ... less bucks in the bank account for a CD that does not live up to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this cd","review":"I can't stand listening to this cd.

It shows. This album is full of lyrical retreads Sweetest Condition= Sweetest Perfection, Shine= One Caress, and Breathe= Things You've Said. In addition, the lyrics are trite as shown with When the Body Speaks. Musically, Exciter lacks edge. The musical arrangements are flat and bland. There are no dynamics, texture to the songs. In a word, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"a let down","review":"COMPLETELY lacking of the wonderful melodies, lyrics and hooks of most of DM's work. I can only hope their next album is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need to spread the word....","review":"The cd is a great disappointment. ALL the songs are quite slow. And as a warning, when the song \\"Dream On\\" was on the radio, this song won't be the same version that is on the CD. The CD version of this song is horrible and does not have the same fast-paced beat. Because of this album i will never buy another Depeche Mode cd again. Stick with Violator and remember the \\"memories\\" of when Depeche Mode was actually a good band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they serious?","review":"Why did Depeche Mode release this? Were they desperate for cash? Was this a contractural obligation? Were they actually convinced that the songs on here were not crap? This album came out around the same time U2 shocked us all with the fantastic \\"All that you can leave behind,\\" and when Madonna released \\"Music\\". At least they showed us that '80s artists could still swing it with the rest of them. Depeche Mode should have been like them but for some reason, they released this dull drivel. Such a wasted opportunity to embrace new fans. The tour for this album was crap too. Oh well, at least they didn't go hip hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst DM release.","review":"The cd title should be \\"Horrible\\". I am a big fan of Depeche Mode but this release is a big dissapointment. The songs \\"Dream On\\", \\"I Feel Love\\" and \\"I Am You\\" are the only tracks worth hearing in my opinion. I keep hearing all the talk of David Gahan's drug problem being a reason for bad work in the past. Well, with Exciter, I suggest you get back on the drugs if that's what it takes to produce good work!My amazement is that you can find many \\"Exciter\\" Bonus tracks on the internet that I haven't been able to find on the cd. And everyone of those Bonus Tracks is twice as good as what the group choose to put on their album. The guys definitely got the good and bad mixed up when deciding on which tracks to include with this release. Check out the bonus tracks on the net. If your a DM fan like me, you will probally be pleased with what you find. But don't bother with the Exciter release. Sorry Depeche Mode, hope you learned a lesson this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment","review":"Unlike several other reviewers, I very much like the direction the band's been taking recently -- UNTIL THIS. Their prior two albums (\\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" and \\"Ultra\\"), may not contain very much in the way of catchy hooks, but each has exquisite songwriting and an ability to grow on the listener like a sweet addiction. However, this album contains nothing of the sort. It's just plain bad, and excruciatingly boring. Except maybe for the first track, none of the songs go anywhere. And after about 15 minutes of listening to one dull, depressing, uninspired track after another, you honestly begin to wonder whether Martin Gore has picked up heroin where Dave Gahan left off. In a nutshell -- and as someone else said in their review -- if you really feel the need to have this album, wait until it hits the used CD rack. Because the supply there should be plentiful. God, I sure hope they don't play this junk when I see them in concert next month...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"This is the most brutal CD I have ever bought, I hope I can get some money for this at the used record store.

The songs 'Shine' ''Freelove' and 'I feel loved' save this album from being a major dissapointment.'The Dead of the Night' is the worst song ive heard from this group, i skip it (something i never do with DM albums).

I have seen many reviews exalting this album but I am damn sure that each review of that kind comes from a die-hard DM fan. I used to be a great DM fan. Today I have settled down and am more unbiased towards the bands I used to be crazy about. I only buy an album if it's really good. As for Exciter, the album will remain on the shelves.Depeche Mode really feels the lack of Alan Wilder into the mix. The songs are not melody-friendly and there are no intelligent smart tunes like in \\"Policy Of Truth\\", \\"Freestate\\" or \\"I Feel You\\" and many others. It's difficult to digest this album if you come from the days of Music for the Masses and Violator.The only two songs worth in this album are \\"Dream On\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\", the rest just brings that strange cold feeling to your stomach that Depeche Mode is not the same it used to be. It's an album that reflects the lack of direction that the band is struggling with."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciter excites me","review":"i'm not even old enough to have listened to their first stuff, but this cd has me wondering what it would be like, to talk to all your friends about depeche mode and they'd be all 'man, they're the coolest! i'm actually going to their show later this month!'nope, none of my friends are culured enough to realise the neatness of these guys.'dream on' is the first, and coolest song on here...or maybe 'shine' is...i lie...all of them are very, very good.if you're into moby and new-agey stuff, buy this cd along with all their others, (and some moby stuff too!)depeche mode has a new fan.ME"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am being fair...","review":"Only two stars? I set my standards very high when it is DM concerned. They didn't deliver this time...it is, quite frankly, a boring cd. Almost all songs are slowly paced, which is not always bad. But they are, and that is a real shame, uninspired written songs. I Feel Love, Shine On are exceptions to the rule and it's no surprise that these song were chosen as a single. And of course there are some good songs on this cd, hey this is DM! But listening to the whole cd in one time is hard because of the consistency (meaning:dull) throughout which in this case is not a good thing. A real shame, I was never dissappointed by DM. Well there is a first time for everything I guess. Conclusion: singles from this cd are good (not great). Overall impression though is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciter: Not too Exciting","review":"As a DM fan for more than 25 years, I can say that with Exciter the guys missed the mark with this album. It's a decent album but to me it seemed a bit over produced. Perfect example is Freelove. Seven years after this was released I can barely stand to listen to that track when I play the album.However there are some great tracks here: Dream On; I Feel Loved (great dance track); The Dead of Night, a great grungy, industrial track that reminds you of their old stuff and finally Goodnight Lovers, a song that almost sounds like a lullaby.Dave's voice never sounded better but I thought some of the songs could have been stronger. Playing the Angel - the follow-up to this album was a much stronger record.Again, not a bad album but not among DM's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra II","review":"I've been waiting 14 years for dm to release a good album. I'm still waiting! After the drab Ultra, I was eagerly anticipating Exiter. What I got was Ultra II. The songs here, with the exception of one or two, lack the energy of dm's early-mid 80's material... I hate it when bands change just for the sake of changing. Some \\"music experts\\" call it \\"maturing\\". I call it starting to suck! I gave this 2 stars because, while it's beneath dm's standards, it's still better than 99% of the new stuff out the market today. To explain dm's current affliction, look no further than track no. 8 on this cd (Comatose)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best DM Albums ever made!","review":"I just received this album yesterday. Every time I listen to it, it gets better and better! Being a DM fan for over 20 years, I love hearing the magic that is created on each album and the diversity of each. Martin is a superior song writer. Dave's singing on the album has kind of an excellent dreamy quality that I haven't recognized in the past. Exciter pushes the edge of the envelope and I knew after four long years between albums that this one would hold it's own. Very strong! Excellent as always Martin, Dave and Andy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excite-not","review":"I cannot believe this album is averaging more than 3 stars!! This is the absolute worst DM album EVER. It is dull and badly produced. The music and lyrics have no appeal even after repeated listenings in failed hopes of it growing on me. If it did not have the DM name on it, I can guarantee it would not have gotten airplay or noticed even by those of you who gave it a ridiculous 5 stars. PLEASE people: do not rate bad albums with 4 or 5 stars just out of sympathy, or based on previous albums greatness... Rate the album on its own merits!! Other DM albums like Violator, Black Celebration deserve 4 and 5 stars. This one, I am sorry to say, is no comparison and deserves barely 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last","review":"This CD is great.Dream On and I Feel Loved set an amazing tempo for a record that is as genuine and authentic as Violator.

They each have there own unique quality and sound that makes them unique. I had a hard time dealing with Ultra at first, but then it eventually grew on me. I unfortunately can not say the same for Exciter, which came out less then 24 hours ago. I know eveyone will say I'll probably grow into this one too and that I'm jumping the gun, but personallly I don't think I am. I have tickets to the show in New York and look forward to hearing the old favorites any Depeche Mode fan has grown to love and call there own. I guess when Dave or Martin starts to bellow out one of the choir tunes from Exciter, which the exception of \\"Shine\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\", I guess it will be time for me to go to the bathroom... or perhaps even better... get an early jump on that beer line so I can enjoy old school DM during the encores. Bottom line, doen't waste your money on this one, but don't miss the tour this summer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and different","review":"To me, Exciter is a very interesting release.

An otherwise rather extraordinary release is just mediocre, because the &%$@# at Mute Records release music not only a dvd, but with copy-protection.On a happier note, this more down-tempo than not D.M. release displays some exceptional songwriting and singing long after I wrote them off as dead. I didn't give them serious interest since Violator. Wow.Other notes: this is the 2009 European re-issue of the 2007 European collector's edition (cd + dvd) remaster. So, if you're in dvd region one (U.S., Mexico, etc), when playing the dvd on your computer, you'll need to change the dvd-region to two, and you can only change such five times before the drive locks. So, going back and forth may be problematic.

Depeche Mode has evolved into something beautiful over the past 20 years. I hope that they will continue to be successful. Despite lack of radio play and the standard commercialism--they have maintained a solid foundation with their fans. Their critics basically have egg on their faces because DM is still HERE! The band took their time to make this album and it shows. It's all heart & soul and by no means they're not trying to win a popularity contest. Best wishes to Dave, Martin and Andy. Hopefully, someday they will have a reunion tour with Alan Wilder........:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"devoted dm fan","review":"I was excited about a the new cd coming out. I have loved DM for years now. Every cd (or back when, tape) I have bought I have loved. I had to listen to Songs of Faith & Devotion a few times to add it to my love list and Exciter is the same. It is different, but current. DM always evolves with the time. I have listened to the cd a few times now and I can say it will be added to my love list also. New DM has to \\"sink in\\" but they sound great as always.

DM is a band meant for lush sound & deep production and the tiny blips, bleeps & squeeks on here do them absolutely no justice. 2) Let's be honest about the instrumentals, Andy & Martin aren't playing and Dave isn't singing. What we have is a musical piece written by Gore and interpreted by The Producer. They aren't really \\"Depeche tracks\\".Overall though, the songwriting is still strong and I can only \\"Dream On\\" about what this album could have sounded like."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real meaning of their song titles??","review":"I can't believe people actually gave this album four or five stars, as if it were the best thing since FREELOVE or something!! They must be COMATOSE?! DREAM ON if you think this is the innovative Depeche Mode that we know to SHINE on previous albums like Black Celebration or Violator. Ok, Ok, EASY TIGER, dont get me wrong, its not as bad as Ultra or Songs of Faith and Devotion, but WHEN THE BODY SPEAKS, it tells me these guys are getting as boring as THE DEAD OF NIGHT. The musical arrangement on most songs is embarrasing! And way too many songs have a LOVETHEME. What's up with that?! THE SWEETEST CONDITION would be to bring back old Alan Wilder... I'm sure he could BREATHE some life back into the struggling band. I FEEL LOVED that these guys continue making music for us, but after 3 failed attempts, they should really just call it quits and say GOODNIGHT LOVERS. I would not buy this album if I AM YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCITER IS NON-EXCITING","review":"Depeche Modes latest effort \\"Exciter\\" is just awful. The album from beginning to end is absolutely slow dribble.No hooks or standout songs like \\"Strangelove\\", \\"People Are People\\", \\"Master or Servant\\", just dribble.The production is good, but the energy of this album is so low that you feel it is the end of the world for this band.\\"Dream On\\" the first single which right now is a hit on Billboards Club Play chart do to thankfully being remixed to a faster upbeat song is one of the worst songs I have ever heard from Depeche Mode.The rest of the album is just as bad with depressing songs \\"Shine\\", \\"When the Body Speaks\\", \\"Breathe\\" and the ever suicidal \\"I Am You\\".If anything I am now officially over Depeche Mode who I feel peaked in 1989 with \\"Personal Jesus\\".A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"Being really objective here, as I am a big fan and will go to the show when they are in town....One good song, one or two ok, the rest almost unlistenable. Considering this project and Ultra makes me wonder if Depeche has anything left to say. Hard to believe that 3/4 of the band that built Black Celebration was involved in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst DM album after Alan left","review":"You started to see the decline in DM when Alan left after SOFAD. Ultra was ok at best, Exciter on the other hand is simply not worth listening to. There is not one song on this whole cd that is worth sitting down and listening to. If you believed that DM could prevail without Alan Wilder, listen to this CD and it will change your mind. This album lacks direction, and the fans are left thinking \\"Is this the end of DM?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still growing on me...","review":"The first time I listened to this album it struck me as dull and monotonous. However, the more I listen to it, the more I love its nuances and subtle melodies and lyrics. The same phenomenon happened to me when I first bought \\"Ultra\\" also. It took a few months before I really got to appreciate that album because it was not, for the most part, catchy or immediately appealing. DM's greatest asset is their way to grow slowly on you, so that your favorite songs end up being the ones you originally skipped over. Exciter is sizing up to be another DM great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A week of trying ....","review":"I've had the album for well over a week at this point and I've listened to it constantly in an attempt to find that redeeming aspect that all Depeche Mode albums have had for me. Unfortunately, this one doesn't have it. An album where nearly all of the songs sound derivative, albeit with better production, of the more forgettable songs from past albums like the last half of 'Ultra', 'Get Right With me' from SOFAD, and 'Blue Dress' and 'Waiting For The Night to Fall' from 'Violator', 'Exciter' left the excitement somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, Tired.","review":"Save your money. Depeche Mode is just going through the motions here. There's nothing really innovative here, nothing \\"experimental\\" about any of the lyrics, despite the editor's review listed above. As a matter of fact, the tiresome AA/BB rhyme scheme will probably drive you slowly insane. You know: \\"I had a CAR, I went to a BAR, I had a nice DRINK, washed my hands in the SINK\\" so on and so forth. The music is nothing special either: there's a track that is so close to Iggy Pop's \\"Nightclubbing\\", you'll think that you mixed up the discs in your changer. Now, I'm a big fan of these guys, but why keep anyone in Sacred Cow status? When music is bad, it's bad, regardless of who did it. Don't let your devotion to what these guys were (as recently as a couple of years ago) deafen you to what they have become. Save your money, or buy this one REALLY CHEAP on auction."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-Music","review":"Most of these songs belong on a B-side of an LP. Very little new ideas or emotion from DM. Almost as if they just put out an album of their jam sessions. Showed so little of the refined Depeche Mode lyrics or techno sounds that I am disappointed. Do nto get me wrong there are a couple of good songs on this album, but not an outstanding DM album.The 90's (Ultra, Songs of Faith and Devotion) and the new millineum (Exciter)has been unkind to the Fab Four of the Eighties. Maybe the next album will meet our expectations, I am not giving up. I hope the passion for music returns for Playing the Angel. Dave and Martin have been quoted as saying; \\"It is better to be in Depeche Mode now, than in the past 15 years.\\" Now, if they could only get back Alan and his energy, the Fab Four would truly be back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever.","review":"I've been a Huge fan of DM for a long time, but this is the Worst Material I've ever listen from them.

Too slow and too experimental.I thought Ultra was excellent - this album, while aspiring for lofty heights with it's slick production, divebombs and explodes. I consider myself a true DM fan, so I will give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"All I can say about this release is that the songs are boring. Elaborate studio production doesn't compensate for boring material. There aren't any memorable songs. This CD sounds like a bunch of filler material. I wish that Napster was back to its former glory so that I can listen to this stuff before I spend my hard earned $$$ on this (yawn) dust collector. The title Exciter is definitely a misnomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! And it keeps getting better.","review":"Outstanding album! I've listened to it many times during sleepless nights (with my 10 days old daughter) and it simply gets better every time.PREDICTION: Freelove and I Feel Loved will be huge hits.NOTE: Track 13 (Goodnight Lovers) is the only sure thing that I discovered so far (among 100's of CD's) to calm my daughter with.

The latest set of songs from The Best Band In The World right now is there best since Violator, and is close to as good as it!! I would say that the sound they are trying to represent here is all of there 3 studio CD's from the 90's Violator,F&D,and Ultra rolled into one. The result is a wonderfully sounding ride for your ears! I guess that if you are Depeche Mode there are some fans or so called fans who don't want you to change at all!!!!! The songs on this CD's are so different from anything out there and it is by far the best CD that I have purchased this Century!!! Go buy NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I love Depeche Mode. I like their great string arrangements, lyrics, productions, etc. This album however is .... I can't tell you how many ways it .... Totally uninspired. Junk.

Very very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I have been a longtime DM fan and I was really looking forward to his album. I thought Ultra was an important album for them to make considering the amount of personal turmoil surrounding the band at that time. Dave's vocals were strong and althought some of the songs were not that catchy, they were songs.....Freestate, Home, Useless to name a few. Exciter is a 50 minute mix of minimalist electronica bleeps with no emotion or heart. The tempo is incredibly slow and I really have no intention of putting it in my CD player again. I really feel that they have taken two giant steps backwards with this recording and I'm worried about how they are going to pull off these songs live. If the tempo of the set is too slow, I predict many people heading for the Beer Stands. This after paying $.. for a ticket. I really hope they play a lot of old stuff. What a disappointing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get \\"excited\\" about this one!","review":"Like many other reviewers, I just thought this album was one big bore. I fail to see how they could give this album such a name that suggests happy, bouncy tunes ala \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\" Picture \\"Question of Lust\\"- type songs filling an entire album and you will be bored stiff if you're not asleep by the end. Too many downbeat slow songs on one album and you've got a good cure for insomnia. Their recent music has proven they can still produce good tunes (Violator is my all-time favorite, and Songs of Faith and Devotion was pretty good) but this was a real \\"miss.\\" While I hope it's not the death of Depeche it certainly sounds like something reminiscent of a funeral dirge. One star, however, for the nice photo of the band.

Exciter my [butt], this album should be called Borer. The only tracks on this cd worth listening to are \\"Dream On\\", \\"Shine\\" and \\"Freelove\\", the rest is simply boring and uninspired noise. Regardless of this fact, I will still be attending the concert in June 2001.

The album is very minimalistic, moody and dark at times. Then \\"I Feel Loved\\" just booms out of nowhere with a nice beat (future single perhaps?) and would be perfect for the danceclub and MTV (show the viewers who Daft Punk, MOBY and Fatboy Slim got thier sound from....) This track is fantastic and I can picture the crowd hopping up and down during the concert tour this summer...I love the dark, spy-theme-like subtle guitar on \\"Breathe\\" and some of the other tracks (DM should do the next Bond theme).Overall, a great album with some new direction that fits very well within thier discography. Fans who wanted another \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" or \\"Everything Counts\\" may take awhile to get used to it, but the album will not disappoint....."},{"rating":"1","title":"#2 helpful hint","review":"I am ranked very high among Depeche Mode fanatacism...I simply love most of their stuff.

It showed the real meaning of TRUE SISTERHOOD. The three of them worked well together and the story line seemed to mesh.I loved the fact that Wanda taught Ruby how to love herself just the way she was, and that she did not have to change herself in order to love herself.Although I enjoyed this book, GIRLFRIENDS is still my #1 favorite!!!Thanks, Mr. Sanchez, once again.

I would really recommend the book to anyone interested in pioneering in the Midwest.

Your choice of character and how you use each character determins who wins. Your skill determins your speed. In my opinion it is more racing and stratagy than Mario Cart, and it has Sonic The Hedgehog and friends, who can beat that.One glitch I noticed about the game was that in the full screen mode there is no way to exit the game. In window mode you can close the game by clicking on the X in the top right hand corner of the window, but in the full screen mode you have to press Alt F4 to exit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic Riders","review":"This game would be fun, if it actually worked.

The Dolby Digital 7.1 is anything but; you are lucky to get 3.1. The rear surround speakers don't work unless you invoke junky old Pro-Logic. Heck, if I wanted Pro-Logic, I could have spent $50 for some ancient receiver with that 80s technology.On top of that, the remote is incomprehensible, as is the manual. It is the worst Japanese English manual I have seen for years. And the build quality is cheap, with plastic-y knobs. For $400, I expect at least some attention to those details. I mailed this back to my retailer and hooked up my old Outlaw again. It doesn't have the video upconversion, so I have some more cables to deal with, but at least it gives me honest Dolby Digital 5.1.

I'm not sure if it's intended to be a comedy or not, since some of the subject matter (rape, murder, explosions, etc.) is not funny, but the author has one hell of a humorous streak. One of the main characters, Fame - a wannabe comedian - is not my favorite, but please definitely notice him when you read this. :-) See if you don't imagine him as J.B.

The only critique I might have is that you are at the mercy of the shipper as to the variety of the cereals.Would love it if you could pick the cereals and quantity of each, but than I guess the price would have to change if they took the time to do that.

The good news is that customer support prorated a reduction in our price to remove the items we did not request and the damaged item. Maybe the stars should be higher since they got about 80% of the order correct and that is all we ended up paying for.

This book, a nominee in 1991, wasn't very impressive. The story is set in a B&B in a small town in Tennessee. Far too much of the book is about the B&B and small town life. Such mystery as there is only gets rolling in the second half of the book. It seemed to me that the author's real agenda was to write about life in her town and the mystery was an afterthought.Bottom-line: Not sure what this book did to earn a nomination and not surprised the series hasn't gone on to further critical acclaim. There's better southern small town mystery out there (Margaret Maron, Carolyn Hart and others)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem!","review":"If you practice, Iyengar, Ashtanga Vinyasa, Viniyoga or Vinyasa Krama you will want to know more about Krishnamacharya.

Her hits were never her best material but it's nice to see Connie Francis product on the market rather than no product at all. So keep it coming. Universal/Polydor, those who know her best work are still waiting a bit impatiently for good stuff. But hats off to Japan. They always put out quality Connie Francis cds and this fan is greatful and pleased to have it.

It strips every drop of product or oil from your hair, so when you are done shampooing your hair is a matted mess and straw-like.

This book does not explain this very clearly, however. Further, there are many step-by-step instructions that do not apply, exactly, to the most recent version of Outlook 2000; commands are slightly different, and often the Outlook 98 steps are given.

It'll probably catch on with the mainstream \\"country\\" stations and that's exactly the problem. This thing's about the sex appeal of the lead singer - period.

For those reviewers who can't stand the twang, let me remind you that this is a COUNTRY cd and that Jennifer is from Georgia. Southern accents just make the music more real and less processed. Her voice is very strong and makes everything sound upbeat. There are way too many female artists singing \\"sad\\" songs, so Sugarland is a great new alternative to this. Something More, Tennessee, Down In MS, and Baby Girl are my favorites. I rarely have 4 favorites on one CD. Go out and get it if you are a true country fan.

With the hook of how paying your dues may pay off, the song plays as an autobiography of the group. Deservedly, it went to the top of the charts and the video too was a hit.The second single, \\"Something More,\\" shows that Sugarland is not a one hit wonder. It shows off the writing and composing skills of the group along with their musical skills. Jennifer Nettles has a unique voice and backed up by Kristen and Kristian, they make great harmonies.The rest of the album is just as tight and flows well. There are more hits here but it isn't just a collection of singles. The variety of songs and instruments used says a lot about the future of country music. With groups like Sugarland coming, the future is secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feel good music!! Love this!! It's a must have!","review":"I highly recommend this CD.

Other faves of mine are \\"Tennessee\\" and \\"Speed of Life\\".Until I checked out their website, I didn't realize that Kristian Bush is from BILLY PILGRIM, which is a band I followed a number of years ago.

It sounds way better than the original version released on CD in 1990. No matter how many times I hear the title track I never grow tired of it. It rocks!! But I really enjoy \\"Gonna Raise Hell\\" for it's quirky CT approach and Robin really stretches his vocals here. Pure genius!! Not to mention the pop rock perfection of \\"Voices\\".

The live version of \\"I know what I want\\" sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best releases!","review":"I give it 5 because it brings back great memories and because it rocks from start to finish.This release was hard pressed to follow the massive success of the Budokan release. However it held it's own and made Cheap Trick a house hold name for years to come.This remaster has one big advantage over the original release in that the sound as one reveiwer said, jumps out of your speakers. It really brings this classic to life. The entire mix is louder and the bass is firmer and more supportive.The extra's are alright, but nothing fantastic!It's a great listen, pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another brilliant rock album from Cheap Trick","review":"For many Cheap Trick fans this marks the end of the \\"classic era.\\" While the follow-up to this one, All Shook Up, is arguably their best work, it also marked their decline in the pop music industry and fall from the top of the charts for a few years until they returned with a couple of power ballads. Anyway, Dream Police is a must have for tricksters and contains some of their best songs. Like the album before it, Heaven Tonight, Dream Police kicks off with a pop rock masterpiece as the opener and doesn't really contain a bad song all the way through. Some are better than others but there's nothing to skip on this CD.

There are many versions of these 8\\" & 10\\" monitors, so it's easy to order the wrong one and the model numbers are easy to mix up.2. The stand is very flimsy. It's very easy to tip over. You can use a photo tripod to 'mount' the TV or make a stand yourself (highly recomemded).3. The 'hue' control is at it's far range of 'green/yellow'. If your image is 'magenta' (purple) you can't adjust for it.4. It uses a very small and fragile connector for the A/V input. Very easy to break the connector and/or the cables with no way of replaceing the plug.5. Very narrow viewing angle (as usual for a low cost LCD TV).6. Noise and a wavy pattern with darker images.

The main character, Angel, is overweight, and wants to be skinnier. Sounds like \\"Girls Under Pressure\\" and Ellie's dilemma. Her friends are perfect to her... the way Ellie views her friends in the \\"Girls\\" Trilogy (now a quartet, I believe) and the way Lucy views her friends in the \\"Mates, Dates and...\\" series. Her friend Minnie is amazing at designing clothing. I'm drawing a blank to the exact character, but it's one of the girls from either \\"Girls\\" or \\"Mates, Dates, and...\\" I think it might be Lucy from \\"M, D, a...\\" But still it's a boring read, and I suggest you move on to something more worthwhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product.","review":"Recessed (TP-1) In the wall Bathroom Toilet Paper Holder.The only thing I would change in the future to install is to use the rear of the product to trace the size of the hole to cut in the drywall verses using the template provided by the manufacturer.

Also, I used a thin bead of liquid nails around the edge of the hole, which wanted to squeeze out to the exterior of the frame at spots.

While the brothel scenes all have an obligatory smattering of nudity, Fanny only reveals herself nude for the first time in her first love scene with Charles, the man who is the love of her life. The film seems to strengthen the message that while sex can be a lot of fun, true love is ultimately a virtue and a reward beyond the physical pleasures of sex.The supporting cast, especially Alison Steadman, are suitably colourful.

That said it is stupendously made and as ever with the BBC there is a great attention to period detail. I think that may be where the overall problem is, in that the grime and filth that was typical of the period it is set in, has been airbrushed out. Compare it to 'The Libertine' for example, there is muck and detritus everywhere and one gets a real sense of what 'bawdy' means, this is lacking in this production which tries and succeeds to portray a classy courtesan rather than an opportunistic upwardly mobile prostitute.

Blogging had the potential of becoming a bigger deal in our social lives, but it was quickly surpassed by another innovation. Hewitt was at the edge of the innovation in blogging, so far on the edge that he missed the fact that it was open to being challenged by another technology.

I looked forward to reading it since blogging is one of my favorite hobbies. But it was a struggle to finish it. It's written with an arrogant tone. I almost wonder whether Hugh Hewitt actually wrote the book or if some ghost writer did.I don't think I learned very much from reading it. Basically, the message of the book is: You better blog because it's important to your business, your faith, and your political candidate.I didn't bother reading the appendices because the main text was so torturous.I'm grateful for the present because this book is one the things I wanted for Christmas, but personally, you're not missing much if you don't read it.

Learning about Guttenberg and Martin Luther and the history of how text transformed our world was interesting but not particulary helpful in exploring Blogging. What was really disappointing is the \\"right wing political\\" bent to the book. In describing the bloggers ability to bring down Trent Lott, John Kerry and Dan Rather I was disturbed by the lack of recognition that many of the reports given by bloggers were blatantly false (Swift Boat Veterens) but lauded as heroic.

This book was given to me as a present, and it took all my willpower to read it because of the incessant need to talk politics. However. Mentioning that Fox News is Fair and Balanced--three times--and that CNN is dead, (\\"nobody's watching\\" ???) and calling CNN sophomoric names, and dismissing all mainstream media except Fox, really put me off.

Hugh documents the rise of the blogosphere, gives a riveting account of the role blogs played in the 2004 election, and offers both theoretical and empirical arguments for the historical importance of the blogosphere....Buy it!\\"Having now had time to finish the book, I can confirm that anyone who is interested in blogs, the media, politics, or just doesn't want to be left behind by the next wave of the communications revolution should read Blog.

All he is doing is leveraging his radio show with books and blogging. Blog offers nothing of import other that to inspire others to try their hand at self promotion.

There are many more good books on the market that discuss blogging, the Internet, etc. The author of this book seems more to be a mouthpiece for the far right wing Republican Party and big business.

More depressing is how the scientific community, caught up in the moment, did not stop to really look at where the data came from and in Nature magazine's case, actually collaborated to hide the truth about \\"Rosie's\\" true contributions to Watson and Crick's success. They would not have won the race if not for her meticulous scientific research and one hundred hours spent developing the photo that led to Watson's aha! moment. Even if Franklin had been a man, the ethical lapse displayed by a Watson who looked down on being \\"nice\\" is damning to the basic character of the man and not good science. Because science relies on collaboration and the abilty to share ideas without fear of intellectual theft and worse, this kind of libeling of the dead that he performs throughout the book on Franklin. Perhaps his character assasination was the result of a guilty conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"All I can say is, some lunatic at my school thought that a bunch of 9th graders would be able to read, understand, and write about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read only if you love science","review":"You have to like science and like to read about it, then u might possibly enjoy this book.

Describes the whole process very well without getting too deep in the science. The narrative does justice to a dramatic sequence of events.-- Maybe Watson is being modest, but, it seems like he didn't do much in discovering the structure. He was just there discussing things with Crick and others.-- Linus Pauling was subjected to harrasment by Sen. McCarthy. He was denied a passport to travel internationally to attend a meeting.</li></ul>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes indeedy, this is a quick piece of fiction.","review":"As a science teacher it is horrifying to me that anyone is being required to read this self-serving piece of fiction for a science class. (Unless perhaps as a negative example of deplorable ethics.) Watson's account of the discovery of the structure of the DNA helix is so fraught with falsehoods that it could at best only be called historical fiction. His need to vilify and degrade Rosalind Franklin (whose essential (and stolen) work he used) can hardly be something that is admirable. For a factual account of events read Rosalind Franklin & DNA by Anne Sayre instead. No, it will not be an easy read, but you will certainly get a different view and it is backed up with facts and dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don' like it does not correspond to my reaction.

If I would have known that it is only about side stories of the original work I certainly would not have ordered book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Not Be the Target Audience","review":"** The Double Helix was read as the December selection for our book club. **I marginally enjoyed reading The Double Helix simply because I never would have read it had it not been a selection by my book club. I enjoyed the perspective, and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of science can be entertaining","review":"This book is both entertaining and informative. It probably is not a perfectly balanced view of the events however. Watson writes at length about parties, pleasure trips and the like and one gets the impression that 1960s Cambridge was merely a great party place. Obviously Watson and Crick spent hours doing some of the most significant scientific work of the century but the reader doesn't get much feel for how much of the time was spent on science instead of the parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fav Book","review":"This book was required for one of my college courses, which is the only reason that I finished it. Parts of the book were interesting, but it was hard to follow. Also, Watson has the very dry humor of a British scientist, despite the fact that he is an America. All in all, I did not enjoy reading it, but someone who is thrilled by DNA might be interested in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating story","review":"Watson's account of his and Crick's race to determine the structure of DNA is very exciting. Very little technical information makes it accessible for the non-scientist. The Double Helix is very quick reading, and is one of the most captivating books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Should Get the Nobel Prize?","review":"After reading this, I really have to wonder about the value of awarding prizes in science when most (all?) discoveries build on previous discoveries. Does science need competition to advance? Watson did seem fueled by a competitive desire to be first to discover the structure of DNA. However, his ethics seemed questionable and as other reviewers mentioned, he basically stole Rosalind Franklin's data and work. I would like to read a more objective third-person account of the \\"discovery\\" of the DNA structure.Having said that, this book provided a moderately interesting account of the time and the personalities involved, and it gave me some insight into scientific collaboration and in-fighting. I did not understand the science so I skipped quickly through those parts. I never got too involved in the drama and did not get any deep insight from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"gfsdffdg oh dear god it was just terrrible. i hated this book so much. i cant even believe i read the whole thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"The thrill of discovery","review":"This is the story of the search for the structure of DNA, told by the one who (with Francis Crick) discovered it. But it's far more than that. It is also the story of a young man who tries to find his way in the world of science. The book is very well written, in a charming informal style. However, this is a highly personal account, and should not be considered as the objective truth about the subject. Especially the fans of Rosalind Franklin will testify this. Nevertheless, I recommend this book if you want to savour the thrill of scientific discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great memoirs of science","review":"Watson and Crick's discovery has been compared to Darwin's for biological impact and it would be fair to rate Watson's book alongside Darwin's \\"Voyage of the Beagle\\" as a work of scientific literature. The technical details are graspable by the layman, and Watson's skills as a portraitist are hard to overrate. No one else who has tried to tell this story comes close to this protagonist's inside version."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Become Better Informed about Rosalind Franklin:","review":"Several previous reviewers of \\"The Double Helix\\" have, rightly it seems, upbraided Watson for his negative portrait of Rosalind Franklin and his downplaying of her contributions to his and Crick's elucidation of the structure of DNA. The new book by Meyer Friedman and Gerald Friedland, \\"Medicine's Ten Greatest Discoveries,\\" of course contains a chapter on this achievement, interestingly entitled \\"Maurice Wilkins and DNA.\\" It tells the story of Franklin's involvement with the DNA research and the political abuse to which she was treated during her fellowship at Kings College London--a post from which she was ultimately fired. It also shows how Franklin's conflict with Wilkins--and his with her--probably cost the two of them the first prize in the race for the discovery. It was a race which Watson & Crick won by a whisker."},{"rating":"2","title":"take it with a grain of salt","review":"While James Watson is not on the list of authors I'd generally recommend reading, this book is an exception. Those interested in the history of molecular biology should definitely read this book. Given the nature of the topic, it is light and enjoyable reading. Certainly this account is biased to some extent, which makes it necessary to read other books on the topic as well. Further reading on Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, among other personalities mentioned in the Double Helix, are highly recommended, and necessary for fair balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, honest account of a historic discovery","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It worked for me on three levels - (1) as an account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, (2) as a brutally honest description of his moods, emotions and thoughts and (3) as a description of post war England.

It's great for knowing how exciting science can be (and should be) for the people involved. It's great in that it doesn't require too much, if any, technical knowledge to understand. My *only* complaint is inevitible -- it's one participant's view. I read this years ago, so I don't remember how much, if at all, Dr. Watson dealt with this, but how sad that the female scientist who the got much of their information from was not honored and is pretty much forgotten by most people, simply because she died before they were up for the Nobel Prize (the Nobel foundation doesn't award posthumously). And how ironic that she died from cancer brought on (most likely) by the machinerey she used to do her science.Read this book, it's great. Just keep some solemnity for those whose voices aren't quite heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This book is a must for any body interested in how great discoveries actually happen. Watson is one of two who co-discovered the structure of DNA. This is his acount of the time of discovery. Watson fills the readers in on the details of how a discovery happens from both scientific and personal perspectives. Watson writes about how he and his partner Crick work their way towards one of the great dscoveries of the 20th century. Watson also writes about personal dislikes and how men and women of science can be every bit as petty as their lay counterparts. Watson writes about backbiting among the various scientists as well as the heady excitement of the work.

I highly recommend this to people about 17 years old and up. British humor can be a little crude so it isn't appropriate for people still in high school.

In fact, usually the best books are not written by those behind the lines calling the shots, but those who were on the front lines. Indeed, I had previously heard of the many atrocities committed by the Japanese on both civilians and combatants, but to hear first hand about what certain US troops did during and after the heat of battle was sadly educative. This book is recommended reading for anyone interested in what the Greatest Generation accomplished and it certainly made me more appreciative for our current freedom in this great country. God bless the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped explain my father's silence","review":"One difference between Band of Brothers and \\"With the Old Breed\\" is that in Band of Brothers at least there is a \\"Band\\" left at the end. My father was with the First Marines and made it past the first few days on Peleliu. A major regreet for me was that he never said anything substantial to anyone about the canal, the cape or Peleliu. He would never volunteer information and for a long time I didn't know enough to ask. By the time I did, that world and time no long existed to him. Evidently books like Sledge's are the only rare accounts of what happened on the ground. Few people could relate the horror the First marines went through. I was a corpsman in Nam and realize want words can't relate, but Sledge does an admirable job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read before watching HBO's \\"The Pacific\\"","review":"E.B. Sledge's Autobiography of his experiences in WWII is excellent. He takes you from boot camp to war's end and doesn't spare any of the horrid experiences he encountered along the way. There is no Hollywood point of views to be found anywhere in this great read. Just a man expressing the experiences he shared with his brothers and the bond that could not be broken, regardless of how horrible of a situation they found themselves. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys WWII history pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I too had to read this book for a WWII class in college. All I have to say is that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Sledge is simple, honest and sincere in telling his story about the adventures, the horrors, and the triumphs of the war in the Pacific. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in an account of the War through the eyes of an enlisted mortar man in the Pacific. In a word: unforgettable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly haunting","review":"This book should be read by every american who has lived during and after WWII. After reading E.B. Sleges account of combat, I now realize it is a crime that there is no national WWII memorial to thank veterans for their sacrifice.This is the most honest and easy to understand personal account of combat I have ever read.I feel that I will never again read a \\"war\\" book that can move me as much as this one.If you have read this book and another that has moved you like \\"With the old breed,\\" Please, send me the title at mackwb@aol.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"With so many other reviews, I'll just make this short. This is an excellent book by Sledge. It tells the true horrors Marines in the Pacific saw and the fear they felt in plain, blunt terms. This is one of the best memoirs written by anyone about any war and I would recommend it to anyone, not just people who enjoy history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book telling us about the sacrifice of men","review":"What a great book into the life of our grandfathers who served the U.S. on the front lines of WWII. I'm honored to know servicemen today, who carry on the tradition, and fight for our country. This is a great book, and shows the sacrifice our country and individuals have made for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable!","review":"With The Old Breed has to be one of the most remarkable accounts of war ever documented. The pages are not simply an account of the horrors of war, but an invitation to an interpretation of human behavior. This book needs to be used as a means to remind us of the sacrifices made by our ancestors and the depth of choices and reactions that are made under the most astounding circumstances. The work of E. B Sledge is a true study of the capabilities of humankind, both promising and acrid. WIth The Old Breed is as much a text book of American history as it is a lesson in the psychology of human behavior. It is a must read, for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the Old Breed","review":"If you are a person who is a big fan of history, war, blood and gore, you will love this book. With The Old Breed by E.B. Sledge is an autobiography about Sledge's life in the war against the Japanese in World War II. If this book were a movie, it would have 5 stars and would be rated R for blood, gore, and language. Sledge fought with the Marines in some of the biggest battles of World War II, Peleliu and Okinowa. In Peleliu he saw many gruesome wounds and deaths. Peleliu made him tired mentally and physically. In Okinowa it rained a lot and it was really muddy. In Okinowa people lost their lives and many were wounded. E.B. sledge described the action very well. He also talked in depth about the campaigns that they did. Sledge writes in first person because it is about himself, \\"Yeah,\\" I said, \\"and I'm not in any hurry, either.\\" That was a quote from the book.

He thinks, he feels, he tries to understand from a grunt's eye view. No mock heroics or sensationalism, he helps you to see how difficult it was for anyone to endure the camoaign and emerge sane and human. Above all he conveys the binding sense of camaraderie that kept these boys together and won the war. Although not a new book, the pain, the curiosity, the humor and the sadness come through as if yesterday. It should be required reading for our kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful book","review":"Best war book ever written. I had just finished the Manchester trilogy on Churchill--to read this was a stark contrast to the political machinations during WW2. And I say that knowing well that Churchill was no slouch when it came to combat and war-time danger. I am interested to read the lesser known Sledge book about his experiences after the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living it","review":"Mr. Sledge's discription of his experiences at Peleliu & Okinawa was so gripping that I felt the emotions he felt. This book by far is the best I've ever read at putting the reader in battle. I felt his fear....I was dirty, I was thirsty and I smelled the sickening stench of war. Well done Marine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Whow!","review":"This one of the best books of all time that describes war from a real soldiers point of view.

If they would read this book they might understand why an old Marine might feel this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I just finished reading \\"With the Old Breed\\" for the second time. I found the book to in be very well written. Very few books capture my attention to the point that I almost feel like I'm sitting in the fox hole with Sledgehammer. I had two uncles that were riflemen in the Marines. Both fought in Island battles in the Pacific. They never talked about it. I highly recommend this book for your library.Larry Pierce"},{"rating":"2","title":"any Marine would enjoy","review":"This book was extremely well thought out and written. Even though it was written about personal experiences it did not focus on just the author nor did it glorify any one Marine but told a riveting account of Marines in horrific combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Do We Find Such Men?","review":"I'll be brief. \\"With the Old Breed\\" is worth every moment spent reading it. Sledge writes like Hemingway with his short, powerful sentences. If anything, he is understated as he recounts his experiences as a Marine infantryman in the Pacific campaign. Man's brutality to man is given its full measure in \\"The Old Breed\\" and the reader can feel the physical toll extended combat takes and an almost gravitational pull into the abyss of dehumanization.This is a must read for those contemplating a deliberate role for American women in infantry units and those that support the infantry in the thick of combat. Sledge, perhaps better than any other author, shows us that war is hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Penetrating and Haunting","review":"I acquired this book after seeing \\"The Pacific\\" from HBO. The first hand writing and details are more powerful and penetrating than anything I've seen made for television or movies. I won't go into details, as there are many reviews that do so. I will say that it is well worth the read, and that I came away with a deep respect and gratitude for what those Marines endured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine account of a foot soldier","review":"This book will put you on the front line of the fighting.....I've read a lot of war stories but this has to be the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historical read","review":"One of the best historical books on the Pacific I have read. A must read for anyone interested in the history of the 1st Marine division."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ordinary guy telling an extraordinary tale","review":"To say that this story is powerful doesn't do it justice. The author's descriptions of his experiences are void of self promotion or drama. The horror's he depicts as a marine corporal are hard to imagine. Consider that his unit had 256 men at the outset, but after Pelilu and Okinawa only 26 had not been \\"hit.\\" Consider also the title \\"With the old breed....\\" when in fact none of them had turned 21 yet.The contrast of the conviction of these men set against the mainstream of American men today is vivid, particularly as to their personal commitment to the values of their country. It moved me. Pelilu was hot, hardscrabble and dusty while Okinawa was taken in the midst of a monsoon. Both were deadly dangerous as told in this simple tale of war. As John Keegan said, this book will be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 3 WWII books I've read","review":"This is one of the best books I've read about the battles in the South Pacific during WWII. Mr. Sledge writes with all the detail a reader needs to put you smack in the middle of the gory and horrendous combat our boys experienced. Its raw, graphic and dirty, but true. I could hardly put it down once I started reading. This should be a \\"must read\\" for every high school and college student in the US. Then they would know what the \\"greatest generation\\" went through to keep this country and the rest of the world free and safe from tyranny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR YOUR LIBRARY","review":"This is probably one of the most realistic works I have read. It is a absolute must for anyone attempting to understand the Pacific Campaign, what our men went through and what they did for us. I have read this one twice and plan a third reading soon. This is the sort of history they should be teaching in our schools rather than some of the meaningless stuff now presented. This is certainly one work you can get your teeth into. Highly recommend you add it your your collection! Thank you Mr. Sledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional book","review":"I purchased this book after watching \\"The War\\" on PBS. The author Eugene Sledge is one of the people featured in this film. This book is like none other I have ever read on WWII. It is so down to earth and very moving at times. Eugene graphically brings to the reader so much detail of war, some of which I have never heard of before. This book isn't about strategies,politics,or leadership. It is about one young marine who wrote down his personal experiences,feelings,and hopes. It helps you understand what the individual soldier went threw while fighting on islands like Peleliu,Okinawa,Iwo Jima,and the like. I am so glad he turned his memoirs into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic Horror","review":"You only have to read Sledge's account to appreciate the awfulness. Not for the faint-hearted. The death toll on both sides in both battles was horrific and, as in every war, included a great number of civilians. Military historians assure us that the battle for Okinawa was absolutely necessary. Accounts differ as to the necessity of taking Peleliu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy binding which holds up well.","review":"The 1981 Presidio hard cover edition is a very sturdy binding of this book. My copy has held up well to nearly 19 years of being stuffed into suitcases and helmet bags, dropped, dog eared and underlined. Early in its life I lent it to a number of people in my squadron and later to my children, so who knows what abuse it has suffered. It appears to be printed on high quality paper and is barely discolored despite its hard usage. In my opinion it is a very good buy if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and informative","review":"I'm a WWII History buff and have read many documentary type books including \\"Unknown,A story of survival and redemption\\". I found this to be not only exciting and informative, but also sad. It is amazing to me that any of them survived."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mesmerizing account of war from a true hero","review":"How anyone can rate this below 5 stars is beyond me. Sledge's captivating account of his time in the Pacific takes the reader to the front lines of battle. This book is as real as gets without having been in combat, and Sledge's delivery is flawless. The fortitude and tenacity these soldiers showed in the face of the atrocities of war is astonishing. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, first hand account of WW2 I have come across. \\"God Isn't Here,\\" by Richard E. Overton is also an excellent read if you enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is a great read for anyone interest in World War II and our Marines in the Pacific. It told of the gritty everyday fear and the deprevation of such war fighting. It tells of the fear and the hate for the enemy on both sides of the conflict. It is a terrible way to solve a one nations problem with another. It is very well written and is extremely interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like I was there","review":"I've never been in combat and can't even fathom the deprivations and sacrifices that were made by these ordinary men and women As they endured the extraordinary of war.

This is more than a story book of who does what and when and why, heck at times a forget what i am reading and know about the war as i was drawn into the experience of following these guys around day in and day out and feeling thier struggles as they unfolded for them. What makes me likethis book above other wartime stories, is the naration is storytelling hour by hour of what one guy felt as events happened, not just a typical what happened account. Hearing the emotion in a voice helps with storytelling and this book really captures that effect for just ink and paper..."},{"rating":"2","title":"With The Old Breed","review":"Eugene Sledge has written the finest account of Marines fighting in the Pacific that I've ever read. A highly personal, no holds barred story of the horrific fighting they waged against the Japanese on Pelelui and Okinawa. This is a higly readable and epic sweep across the Pacific and to the doorstep of Japan's home islands. The closer they got, the worse the fighting was, and Sledge pulls no punches whatsoever in describing his experiences. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know just what the WWII Pacific campaign was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing First Person Account","review":"I have read a number of books on WWII, both historical and personal, and this is without a doubt my favorite of them all. Professor Sledge conveys what it was like, fighting on the beaches and among the rocks of those terrible tropical islands, fighting against the fanatical resistence of the Japanese garrisons. He really lets you know how horrible war is at first hand. This is definetly one book I will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the Old Breed","review":"Great book if you are into historical war subject matter.

Very pleased with the book and the story it shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the Old Breed","review":"Excellent reading. For those of us who received military training but never served in combat, it provides an insight into what could have happend.More to the point it did in fact happen to Sledge and his mates. They endured deprivation, extreme danger and observed death administered by a fanatical foe who gave no quarter - the principle of kill or be killed was rigidly applied.As a young boy living in Northern Australia in the 1940's I vividly recall American troops passing through this area. I also recall the bombing of parts of Northern Australia. Sledge and his US Marine mates, along with Australian troops, prevented the Japenese from invading Australia. Now I better understand the price these men paid in winning freedom.I salute these men!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"With the Old Breed is an excellent read and gives a better historical insight into the HBO mini series The Pacific and to the life experiences of Eugene Slege. As he writes you can feel his turmoil grow for the horrors of war.An excellent must read companion to the HBO mini series The Pacific ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viseral Reality of War","review":"'With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa' is visceral. It is first-hand experience written at ground-level. And exposes the grotesque realities, terror, and horror of war fighting that foot-soldiers experience. 'The Old Breed' should be required reading for all politicians before funding future wars and by parents and recruits before enlisting. /Geeo (Vietnam War Veteran and patriot)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Breed","review":"Outstanding account of the horrors of war faced by infantrymen. Not a historical sweep with a tactician's view of the consequences of campaigns. This a story written by a PFC in the trenches. Sledge is able to articulate horrible conditions such as battlefield corpses and human waste issues in extreme heat on a rock island with no sanitation, and yet he does so in a manner that is informative without turning off the reader. As in all good books, you keep turning the pages and when its over you wish there was more. You wonder how his return to civilian life went, but he does not go into detail about that. What you are left with is the image of thousands of deeply scarred individuals returning to a society unaware of their damage and of no agency prepared to help them re-integrate. Highly recommend this book to any history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sledgehammer rules!","review":"Just finished reading and am now circulating to my sympathetic CMP Forum buddies.

Apart from anything, it will show them how closely the series followed the truth of this personal history by one of the principle characters, Private Sledge.It is quite shocking and although I have had a lifelong interest in military history, I have never before taken such an interest in the Pacific campaign. It must surely rate as the most brutal, bestial, and shocking conflict in human history.It was absolutely 'medieval' in its brutality, conducted with modern weaponary.The simple and understated report of events experienced by the author make it all the more shocking. Little wonder the number of (Battle Fatigue) PTSD cases on Okinawa was over 20,000!You won't regret buying this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every American should read this book....","review":"This is a extraordinary story of how normal guys become Marines and defeat the well prepared and well trained Japanese. E. B. Sledge's style is outstanding. He weaves seemingly insignificant circumstances with major actions to provide a complete story of what he and the other Marines went through during their island campaigns. What a price these Marines paid for our freedom; therefore every American should read this book and hope we would answer the call as Sledge and his fellow Marines did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I can't add much to what has already been written except to agree that this is an incredible book. I've read it seven or eight times, and each time I'm impressed at how good it is (my wife read it and was equally impressed). If I could only have one book in my library about the personal experience of combat, this one would be it.I first read With the Old Breed in the early 1990s and was so taken with it I knew I had to speak to the author and tell him how much I enjoyed it. I tracked Dr. Sledge to his home in Alabama and gave him a call. We had a great conversation, with him filling me in on many details not in the book. I sent him a copy of the book to autograph, and when I got it back, I found that he had not only written a nice inscription, which I will always treasure, but had also annotated many of the photographs with his comments. I was deeply saddened to read of his death in 2001. He was an incredible man."},{"rating":"2","title":"super book","review":"Just wanted to say that this is the best book I have read about WW2.

And IF you happen to be some nut case peace nick who thinks the use of a nuclear weapon on Japan was wrong, read this book first and call me. Thank God we had men like the Sledgehammer, and thanks to him for telling his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few honest books about war ever written.","review":"In this moving personal account of his experiences as a Marine in WWII E.B. Sledge shows war as the horrifying, bloody, often pointless, mayhem that it really is. Young men and women enamored of glory and bravery should be required to read this book. By describing his experiences clearly, candidly and graphically, he shows the reality of war. I wish I had read this when I was a younger man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, As good as its reputation","review":"I finally got around to reading this wonderful book. Like many others, I was lead to it by Paul Fussell's \\"Wartime.\\"I have gained a new appreciation for the history of the Pacific campaign and will undoubtedly read more.Sledge's account is a little tedious at times as he makes an effort to nail down historical details of troop deployments, which are important but not particularly interesting to the average reader, but it hardly detracts from the impact of the book.If an expanded edition of this book were published with better maps and perhaps an expanded introduction by an historian I would surely buy it. Fussell's introduction explains a little bit about how Sledge actually managed to keep notes in combat, which I found interesting and would like to know more about."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I ordered a set of six WWII books from Easton Press. Among them was this one, \\"With the Old Breed.\\"The other five books were good.

A heroic marine faced with indescribable horrors. I pictured a young, robust he-man type.I turned the last page of this stunning account and there before my eyes was Sledge. A boy who looked as if he just walked out of a high school yearbook.A boy.Really made me think of who really fought this war. Young men...... Boys.I recommend this book to anyone who can read. Riveting from beginning to end.Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The hype is appropriate","review":"I was a little skeptical of the praise this work received, especially since it was written so many years after the author's experiences. But now I will sing the same praises. This book reveals just why such experiences were so vivid in the author's mind when he wrote it. Sledge's accounts are real and engaging; I had great difficulty putting the book down when other priorities called. I also appreciate Sledge's use of notes throughout the book to further explain items without losing the flow of the actual text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first rate memoir of the WW2 Pacific island battles","review":"An honest and very well written memoir from an enlisted marine who fought on the first lines in the WWII Pacific island battles of Peleliu and Okinawa.John Master's memoir, \\"The Road Past Mandalay\\" covers the Burma war against the Japanese from the British side (and is a great book), but Sledge's \\"With The Old Breed\\" is better, since he was at much greater personal risk and describes the psychological effects of this long exposure. It's the best personal military account that I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memoir!","review":"Sledge's account of his time as a young soldier fighting in the Pacific is heartbreaking and harrowing.
